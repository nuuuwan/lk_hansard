( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . . . I will give you time, Hon. Ajith P. Perera. Do not worry.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) Hon. Speaker, we are dealing with a constitutional process in terms of Article 46 (4). The mandatory requirement in terms of that process is to pass a Resolution to the effect that there is a National Government and that position has been rescinded. Even in a statement if it was referred to the fact that there were two years or six months or whatever the period, the pith and substance is the Resolution. So, in terms of the Resolution, both parties have said that their Agreement is in existence and there is no mandatory requirement for any Agreement to be tabled before the Hon. Speaker. So, the Agreement has not been tabled. Both parties who are privy to the Agreement, have expressed their desire to continue as a National Government and that per se is sufficient in terms of Article 46 (4) of the Constitution. Therefore, we cannot go into extra matters which do not constitute under Article 46 (4).

A Resolution was tabled in Parliament saying that the composition of the Cabinet should be increased based on the National Government and Parliament approved it. Consequent to it being approved, neither was any agreement tabled, because there is no mandatory requirement. So, Hon. Speaker, you are dealing with a constitutional process and all other statements made even in the Hansard are irrelevant because the parties to the Agreement have expressly informed the Hon. Speaker the desire to continue in terms of that Agreement and that is what is required in terms of the Article 46 (4).

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake referred to the fact that there was an Agreement which referred to two years. If it was a prerequisite that the Agreement be tabled, it would have been done at the time when this Resolution was brought in. An agreement could be either orally or in writing. His Excellency the President said two years. According what the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake said, the Hon. Prime Minister also said so. But, if parties to the Agreement say that they want to continue the Agreement, then the Agreement is operational. It is only the contracting parties who can come before the Hon. Speaker and say that the Agreement is not in existence. It is not for third parties to interpret the Agreement before this House. Hon. Speaker, no third party can say that this Agreement is operational or not. Here, both contracting parties to the Agreement have come before this House and say that the Agreement is operational. Therefore, third party statements have no consequence and also the fact that this Agreement was not tabled at the time when this Resolution was passed does not make it a mandatory prerequisite that the Agreement be tabled.

In terms of contracting law there are two contracting parties, or maybe three, and if those parties come before the House and say that that Agreement is yet operational, no third party can come before the House and say, This agreement is not in existence. It is all for the General Secretary of the UPFA or the UPFA and the United National Party to come before the House and say that this Agreement is operational. So, that is what they have stated.

HON. SIVASAKTHI ANANTHAN . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Speaker, during the Local Government Elections, the Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan, Member of Parliament, made a statement that the TNA Members of Parliament have accepted a bribe of Rs. 20 million each from the Government in order to support the Budget of 2018. This was highlighted in all Tamil newspapers, electronic media, social media et cetera and all the parties made use of this statement for their election campaign, which resulted in adverse results substantially. So, since this is a Question of Privilege and further tarnishing the image of elected Members of Parliament, I kindly request you to take proper action against him. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) ,

( ) (The Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , what is your point of Order?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, that was a Privilege matter that the Hon.Saravanapavan raised. - [Interruption.] Sir, that was a Privilege matter.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay.

( ) (The Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan) . -

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) We will leave it at that. I cannot give you time. Under Standing Orders, he raised it. So, you cannot reply now.

( ) (The Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan) .

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Please sit down. I asked you to sit down. Otherwise, I will get the mike disconnected.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Will you sit down? I am warning you for the third time. - [Interruption.] This is the third time I am telling you. Will you sit down or will you go out of the Chamber? [Interruption.] I am telling you, please sit down!

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) What is your point of Order?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Member raised a Question of Privilege. In that Question of Privilege, he made a complaint against another Member. Merely because he made a complaint, that Member cannot say that his name has been mentioned and start speaking. I am moving that whatever Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan said in response to the Question of Privilege that was raised be expunged from Hansard.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay, I will look into that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, the Hon. Member should not ascribe motives for the issues that I have raised. That is prohibited by the Standing Orders of Parliament. As I said yesterday, having been in this Parliament for the longest time, from 1970, more than anybody else, he should know not to do that.

This Debate started on the 06th of February. It was adjourned for two more days. Before the Debate started itself, at the Party Leaders Meeting, I clearly stated that if it was to be on the 06th of February, we had no objection - we wanted the Debate to take place early - but, if it was to be on the 06th of February, the TNA Members, none of us, would be able to participate. That was noted.

As the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena correctly said yesterday, it was also noted that if the Report is in English, we will not seek the translations before the Debate. We agreed to that. The only objection I took yesterday was not in terms of the Bond Report. That was in English and we had agreed at the Party Leaders Meeting that we will not ask for translations of that. The only objection I took was that the PRECIFAC Report was not in English. It was only in Sinhala and we had said very clearly that we will not participate on the 06th of February. But, after the 06th of February, if it had been adjourned for some date and after several weeks, still if it was only in Sinhala, I am unable to participate in a Debate that included the PRECIFAC Report.

The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara says I should debate the Bond Report. I want to speak on the Bond Report as well. But I also want to speak on the PRECIFAC Report. You cannot restrict my speech only to the Bond Report. So, that was unfair. I was going by the agreement at the Party Leaders Meeting and I am really surprised that he of all people is still persisting in this objection to my raising this matter of concern and ascribing motives on top of that.

I take strong objection to the Hon. Member ascribing motives for a very valid and legitimate concern that I raised in this House yesterday.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Mohamed Navavi. You have five minutes.

[4.50p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Mr. Presiding Member, I thank you for giving me this opportunity. I must especially thank the Hon. Minster for bringing in this Regulation, which seeks to improve the standard of transport for the benefit of the people.

Fortunately, certain amemdments have been brought in to this Regulation. I would also like to mention the problems that we are facing regarding the transport service today. Last month, I brought to your notice an incident where a bus plying from Colombo to Jaffna via Puttalam met with a major accident due to the negligence of its driver where eight people died and almost 22

601 602

[ . ]

2018 21

people were injured. It was a fatal accident. I visited them at the Puttalam Hospital. I came to know that these buses plying at night start at 10.00 in the night and reach Jaffna around 6.00 or 6.30 in the morning. These buses have only one driver and all of them are young people. I spoke to the Hon. Minister and the Deputy Minister with regard to this matter. I think there have to be at least two drivers for a bus which plies from Colombo to Jaffna, which covers almost 250 miles, so that the drivers could have a rest. This ensures not only their safety, but the safety of the passengers and the other vehicles which are plying on the road. So, I request the Hon. Minister to impose a law that every bus travelling over 200 miles or 300 kilometers, to have two drivers. This practice was followed in the past. While travelling in Tamil Nadu, I noticed that long-distance buses had two drivers. This is for the safety of the passengers as well as the other people.

Once I had the opportunity to travel from Anuradhapura to Jaffna in the Jaffna night mail train. Actually, there are over 150 buses going from Colombo to Jaffna in the night but the train going to Jaffna at this time is not crowded. The reason is, since it is a night train, people think about their security. Actually speaking, travelling by train is comfortable and smooth, but in the night, unfortunately, since there are insufficient security officers in the train, people are reluctant to travel by train. If proper security can be provided, I am sure, not only one train, probably even two trains will not be enough for the people who are travelling to Jaffna at night. At the same time, we can bring down the congestion of these buses plying from Colombo to Jaffna. The Hon. Deputy Minister is also here. He must make a note of this and see that more security officers are provided for the night mail train from Colombo to Jaffna, so that people will have proper security.

In addition, I was just mentioning that all buses going from Colombo to Jaffna and other long distance buses must have at least two drivers, so that the drivers can change and take a rest. Otherwise, it is very difficult for a single driver to drive a bus at a stretch for eight to ten hours. It affects his safety and as well as the passengers' safety.

Also, I would like to refer to the Puttalam railway line. When I was the Transport Minister for North-Western Province, I made repeated requests for a train service on our Puttalam railway line at night, because there are no trains plying from 10.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. on that line. We also have a cement factory, which caters to nearly 46 per cent of the cement requirement. It was constructed to transport cement by train because warehouses are available in Colombo.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Please give me two more minutes.

But, somehow, I can remember, as the cost was so high the CGR refused to transport cement by train. Hon. Deputy Minister, you are also from Wayamba. Please make arrangements so that we could transport all the cement by train, by which you can earn more money. At the same time, the congestion on the road would be less.

I read an article in the newspaper regarding the train to Badulla. Almost all the tourists are going by train but unfortunately, there are no toilet facilities in the train. In addition, people say that cleanliness is also very poor. So, I request the Hon. Deputy Minister, who is present today, to look into these things so that you could make more money and the passengers will have a safe journey.

Thank you. [ 5 ] ( ) ( - ) The Hon. Lasantha Alagiyawanna - Deputy Minister of Finance and Mass Media) , . . , , . , .
