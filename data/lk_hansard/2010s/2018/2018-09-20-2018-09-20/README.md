I wish to bring to the notice of the Government that it is a very serious issue that has arisen for the reason that out of the 59 candidates who were called for the interview, 21 were Tamil-speaking persons. It is because of that, one year after the Exam was concluded, this action is being taken to cancel the Exam.

This happened about three years ago also for the Sri Lanka Accountants' Service exam and that became a big issue. So, I am appealing to the Government not to take this step. If there was any irregularity in the Exam, that should have been known at the time the Exam was held. All the exam centres were in Colombo and it is a very, very serious issue if this Exam is cancelled. It is not merely a suspicion but perception and it will be proved that there is a rank discrimination on the basis of language.

Sir, there has been much debate - and that is what I would like to talk about - in recent months regarding the depreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee. I would like to take this opportunity to shed light on the nuances of Sri Lanka's exchange rate policy.

. .

Over the years there has emerged a fallacy that the value of the currency is a bellwether of the strength of the economy.

719 720

[ ]

2018 20

.

If that were the case, Vietnam where 1 US Dollar buys 23,300 Dong, would be in the doldrums. But, in 2017, Vietnam attracted US Dollars 36 billion of FDI and exports reached US Dollars 215 billion. Indonesia where their Rupiah is still depreciating at a much faster and higher rate than in Sri Lanka, the US Dollar buys 15,000 Rupiah and according to our economic pandits, Indonesia also would be a basket case. But, as we know, in 2017, Indonesia's GDP reached US Dollars 1 trillion and real GDP growth was over 5 per cent.

The value of the Rupee is determined by the foreign exchange market, which functions like any other market, where value is determined by supply and demand. The primary determinants of the demand for currency are exports and imports of goods and services and net capital flows.

In Sri Lanka's case, these basic indicators remain positive and are moving in the correct direction.

indicators . 3.8 3.9 . 0189 US Dollars 88.3 . US Dollars 15.8 . Import growth was seen primarily in small size motor vehicles and fuel which was underpriced in the local market. In the first six months of 2018, imports increased by US Dollars 1,300 million of which 70 per cent was contributed by the increase in imports of fuel and personal vehicles. The Government promptly took measures to address both sources of import growth that were putting pressure on the currency.

. leakages . 1000cc 81 . 1000cc 25,000 . . . 1000cc , .

The Central Bank, yesterday, imposed a 100 per cent cash margin requirement against LCs on non-commercial motor vehicles with immediate effect. - -

Previously, a minimum tax was imposed on motor vehicles up to 1000cc engine capacity. A market determined fuel pricing was introduced, which curbed excess demand for imported fuel. So, it is clear that timely prudential measures were taken by the Government and thus far, these measures have been successful in curbing excess import growth.

Sir, as a country develops and integrates with the global economy, there is greater exposure to global capital markets. Sri Lanka has accordingly seen increased foreign investments in the stock market and greater foreign investment in the government securities market in recent years. However, such investments are volatile in nature and are determined more by global factors than local issues.

The normalization of US monetary policy has been a major factor affecting global financial markets. It is important to understand the recent history of this. After the financial crisis of 2008, US interest rates dropped to record lows and investor capitals left the US and advanced economies in search of higher returns in higher risk emerging and frontier markets. However, as the US economy recovers, the Federal Reserve has been increasing US interest rates, which has caused global investors to uplift capital from emerging markets like Sri Lanka and return capital to the US.

Naturally, this has caused capital movement out of many emerging economies, putting pressure on their balance of payments and causing currency depreciation. Sri Lanka too has experienced foreign investments in government securities moving out and foreign capital leaving the equity markets. Similar trends have been seen amongst all emerging and frontier market economies.

Between January 01st and the 18th of September, 2018, the Sri Lankan Rupee had depreciated by approximately 7.4 per cent. 9. . During the same period, the Indian Rupee depreciated by 13.5 per cent - 83.5; the Pakistani Rupee depreciated by 12.1 per cent - 80.8- and the Indonesian Rupiah depreciated by 9.5 per cent - .5. - Russian Ruble - 8 .0 depreciate . 0 . depreciate . 9. depreciate . depreciate .

Sir, it is clear that Sri Lanka is, by no means, the only country subject to the phenomenon of capital moving out of emerging and frontier market economies. If we are to remain integrated with the global economy and sell our exports, attract FDI and engage in capital markets, we will necessarily be exposed to such volatility. In this context, what is the appropriate policy response? What should our policy be? It is imperative then that we build up the safeguards and resilience to be able to meet up to such volatility and to further consolidate macroeconomic stability to provide confidence to global capital markets.

Towards this end, the Government has taken the appropriate steps to build up our safeguards. Throughout 2017, the Central Bank made a conscious effort to build up foreign exchange reserves purchased from the market instead of the old practice of borrowed reserves.

Accordingly, reserves reached a record. 2018 . . - - - reserves - .6 .

The Government has also regained the confidence of global markets by achieving a primary surplus in the Budget of 2017 and continuing the trend in 2018. Sri Lanka, for the first time, since 1953, achieved a surplus in the primary balance. 1950 . . 3. . With exports and FDI reaching record levels in 2017, markets can take comfort in the forward outlook of the economy and Sri Lankas ability to meet future liabilities.

Mr. Presiding Member, it is clear that Sri Lanka has taken all the appropriate policy measures to provide the macroeconomic stability to ensure support for the capital account of the balance of payments and the prudential measures to control excessive import growth in the current account of the balance of payments.

What is the alternative approach to managing the currency? An approach advocated by some of those in the Opposition is that the Central Bank should defend the currency and prevent currency depreciation by going against market forces. The only way to defend the currency is for the Central Bank to sell its hard-earned US Dollar reserves and buy rupees from the market to artificially prop up the value of the rupees. . This

might have been possible if we did not have to make US Dollars 4.5 billion worth of external debt repayments in 2019 and a similar figure in 2020.

0101 US Dollars .5 . 1 . . , . These are our highest ever debt repayments and selling our reserves this year would surely put us on the path of Argentina and Turkey. .6 .

Artificial currency defence is a myopic and unsustainable strategy. It is possible to defend the currency for brief periods to address undue volatility, which the Central Bank has done, but a prolonged currency defence is bound for failure. . . A country will eventually run out of reserves and will then require a bailout. In fact, those in the Opposition should be quite familiar with such policy errors leading to a currency crisis.

- -0188- depreciate 3.8 - 3 8 - market . 99 0180 market . market . ? The rupee crashed from Rs. 113.90 in the end 2011 to Rs. 132.55 by end April 2012 - a depreciation of 14 per cent. ! .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) 883. 0188 830.55 . .

Furthermore, an artificially appreciated exchange rate creates further macroeconomic imbalances. It makes exports relatively expensive and it makes imports

723 724

[ ]

2018 20

artificially cheap - this further erodes the balance of payments and can trigger a currency crisis. Advocates of currency defence, perhaps inadvertently, are prompting imports over domestic products and exports.

Hon. Presiding Member, like in many other aspects of economic management, the Government is not taking shortcuts and myopic measures to address challenges. We have addressed the fundamental factors affecting the currency within our control whilst remaining committed to prudent macroeconomic policies. We have not taken the easy but irresponsible path of selling down our reserves this year which would leave us vulnerable when meeting debt repayments over the next three years.

At the same time, we are putting in place measures to permanently improve our external inflows. The National Export Strategy was recently launched and will provide the thrust for the export sector. In the 2018 Budget, a number of measures were proposed to support exports including a comprehensive Export Market Access Support Programme. We are also putting in place steps to attract export-oriented FDI and other non-debt creating foreign inflows. The results of this are already manifesting with the record export and FDI numbers witnessed last year.

The Central Bank is committed to a market-determined exchange rate and will intervene to address undue, excess short-term volatility. As I have explained, being integrated with the global economy does expose us to stresses such as the prevailing currency pressure. We must address these stresses in a sustainable manner with a long-term focus and not look for quick fixes which simply postpone a crisis.

Sir, if we do not learn from our own past mistakes, and from the recent experiences of Argentina and Turkey, we will have nobody but ourselves to blame. I am confident that we have the tools and the fortitude to weather this period of global volatility, and come out of it stronger than ever before. Thank you.

Before I spoke, a Member of Parliament from the North, brought up some issues which are related to some of the economic and non-economic issues in the North. I wanted to just point out, because she talked particularly about the opening of toddy taverns in the North. The Hon. Minister of Finance and Mass Media has agreed to extend the business hours of the toddy taverns based on appeals made by toddy collecting co-operative societies - I emphasize, "co-operative societies" - and clusters which have been registered under the Provincial Department of Co-operative Development with a view to avoid economic losses to the toddy tappers due to the chemical reaction of toddy. I want to just point out that this request came particularly from the Northern co-operatives but we have extended this to all the co-operatives in the country and that is because, as the lady MP said, we are certainly sensitive to some of the issues in terms of peoples living conditions. That is why the Hon. Minister has agreed to do so.

There was also an issue raised about those who are still in custody and that cases have not been instituted. Certainly this is being looked into by the Hon. Minister of Justice and Prison Reforms. I am sure even today this will be brought to her notice. But I would also like to take the opportunity to point out that this Government-

, - Parliament counted, and a Quorum not being present, the Division Bells were ordered to be rung.

Later, a Quorum being present- ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I was referring to the Member of Parliament from the North who made those remarks. As a sensitive government, we are certainly looking at them and we will be referring some of those issues to the relevant Ministers.

I also wanted to point out this because she referred to the issue of reconciliation. A considerable amount of work has been done, even though it may not have come completely to the expectations of some. Among those, the issue of land is there. We have looked at that very closely and in terms of actually the private lands that were taken over the period, I must say this as a tribute to the armed forces that nearly 80 per cent of the land taken had been returned by July this year, just in the span of three and a half years after our Government took office. We have also been told that over the next few years that this issue will be completely resolved.

[3.31p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Mr. Presiding Member, at present, both the President and the Hon. Prime Minister have started developing the North and the East. They have set up special committees

773 774

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

in connection with that and the work has already been commenced. We also attended the Presidents meeting. We are very happy that they have selected a few industries such as Paranthan Chemicals Company and the Elephant Pass Saltern - also, they spoke about the cement factory. It is going to be converted into an industrial zone to be developed.

If these start to function, we will definitely have economic development and employment creation. But, it is very sad to say, the North and the East are 30 years behind the other Provinces in terms of development. In addition to that, though the war ended in 2009, none of the politicians or the Government have considered, up to now, the war-torn areas for development. That is the sad story. But anyhow, now the President and the Hon. Prime Minister have started the development work. Therefore, I presume that we will reach the target and our Provinces will also become more or less equal to the other Provinces in development.

The backbone of economic development is the Pradeshiya Sabhas. We have 34 Pradeshiya Sabhas in the North. Unfortunately, the Pradeshiya Sabhas are not fully-fledged and therefore, they are not in a position to function properly because of the lack of equipment. I am, now, going to give the details in Tamil.

Apart from this, I would like to mention that it was in 1974 that the last valuation was done by these Pradeshiya Sabhas. So, you can see how many years we are behind. Even today they are collecting the same amount of money from the public. The answer given by the Centre is that they do not have sufficient officers to do valuations. But in the case of the South, it is not so. There, they have done a valuation three years back. All these Pradeshiya Sabhas are losing three crores per year averagely. Therefore, the Government should find a way to enable

these Pradeshiya Sabhas to collect the income by doing valuations as quickly as possible without giving any reasons. They must send valuation officers and get all these things updated.

You can see, valuations have not been done after the war. It is more than 35 years. Therefore, we request the Government to act very quickly and allow the Pradeshiya Sabhas to function independently with their own money.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Saravanapavan, you have more time left. You have been allotted 15 minutes. If you want to speak more, you can do so. You have a few more minutes left.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) No, Sir, I have finished. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Okay. The next speaker is the Hon. Shehan Semasinghe. You have ten minutes.
