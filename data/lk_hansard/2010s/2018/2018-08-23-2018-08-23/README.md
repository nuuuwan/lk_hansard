( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Sumanthiran. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir. Hon. Minister, while reiterating this issue about the police officers knowledge of Tamil language, might I say that, that proficiency in Tamil must be such that they are able to ascertain what is happening,

not just a book knowledge. Because a group can plan an attack standing next to a policeman, who will have no idea as to what they are talking about. As you know, in language, there are different levels of proficiency that you need to have. That is one.

The other clarification is, we have come across a number of instances because of the pressure that has been created that the police also seem to be arresting youth who are standing at a roadside and such, who have no involvement in that and producing them before court saying that they are taking action. That also needs to be addressed.

Thank you. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. R.M. Ranjith Madduma Bandara) . .

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) .

[12.47p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on this important Bill that has been brought in, which will certainly increase the revenue of our country. This is a proposal that was brought in when we presented our Budget 2015 and Budget 2016 to facilitate a cleaner, quicker and decisive revenue collection and to get revenue from people who really produce this type of

items. So, I am happy that this Bill has been brought in today and that we are able to legislate it and ensure that we are able to take benefit of it. But, this alone maybe insufficient, because the decision-making has to be clear, consistent and coherent. That is the reason why today we see that there is a drop in revenue taking place in our country. Being the former Minister of Finance, I must confess that there is a necessity to increase the fiscal space in this country. Revenue has to be increased, the cost has to be controlled and through that process, increasing of fiscal space is the only way that we could get this country off the ground.

Today, you could see that the world is in turmoil. It is not only little Sri Lanka that is affected like a leaf in the wind. You could see the world is going through this turbulent time simply because there are demands that are insatiable and the supply is limited. So, we have got to take decisions when listing out priorities to make what is good for the country.
