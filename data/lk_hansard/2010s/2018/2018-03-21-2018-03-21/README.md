asked the Minister of Industry and Commerce:

(a) Is he aware that- (i) the people who have made their living on cane craft industry are currently leaving that industry; (ii) there are problems in regard to raw materials and the market; and (iii) this industry could bring a huge amount of foreign exchange to the country?

(b) Will he inform this House- (i) whether cane products are exported; (ii) if so, the income earned from it in the year 2015; (iii) if the aforesaid products are not exported, whether action will be taken to export those products; and (iv) if so, when it will be done?

(c) Will he also inform this House- (i) whether the Government has taken steps to expand the market required for the cane industry in the country; and (ii) if so, the aforesaid steps?

(d) If not, why? ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Sir, the Answer is as follows:

(a) (i) It has been observed that there is no tendency of quitting the cane industry by the industrialists engaged in it. The number of cane craftsmen registered with the National Crafts Council, which comes under the purview of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, was 199 in 2010 and it increased to 467 in the year 2017. Their details are given in Annex 1 and I table* that. (ii) Cane artisans mainly use the types of cane such as "ma wevel" and "kuda wevel". The Forest Department of Sri Lanka provides a limited quantity of "kuda wevel" to the cane craftsmen. However, the variety of "ma wevel" is a restricted raw material since it is preserved by the Forest Department of Sri Lanka. Earlier, the variety of "ma wevel" had been imported from Indonesia, but later, the Indonesian Government has banned the supply of "ma wevel". Therefore, there is a huge scarcity of "ma wevel" in Sri Lanka.

(iii) Yes.

(b) (i) Yes.

(ii) These products are not directly exported by

manufacturers in large volumes. There is no separate HS code for cane related products. Most of these products are sold for tourists and it is not reported as export income. However, the Export Development Board Report indicates US Dollars 18,073 as export earnings from cane related products for 2015. I table* the relevant document as Annexure 2.

(iii) Not applicable.

(iv) Not applicable.

(c) (i) Yes.

(ii) National Crafts Council, National Design

Centre, Industrial Development Board and Export Development Board have taken several measures to implement programmes to expand the market opportunities for cane industrialists. Some of such measures are mentioned below. By considering shortage of raw materials, the National Crafts Council has planned to implement cane cultivation project in collaboration with Forest Department of Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka Timber Corporation. Encouraging cane industrialists to participate in local and foreign trade fairs. Providing market opportunities through

Laksala sales outlets. Implementing programmes to promote

the production of gift items and souvenirs to suit modern market needs. Organizing Buyer - Seller Meetings.

DEMUTUALIZATION OF THE COLOMBO STOCK

EXCHANGE BILL

. . Order for Second Reading read. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, on behalf of the Prime Minister and Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, I move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time." The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva will start the Debate. . . Question proposed.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) ( . , .

[ ] .

, , [ ] .

Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. SELVAM ADAIKKALANATHAN] took the Chair.

[2.20p.m.] () ( ) ( () - ) The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva - State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today we are debating two Items. One is, Regulations under the Foreign Exchange Act and the other one is Demutualization of the Colombo Stock Exchange Bill. As the Hon. Leader of the House explained, we will debate the Demutualization of the Colombo Stock Exchange Bill, but we will not go for the Third Reading or the Committee Stage today.

Let me explain in simple language what we are trying to do here.

The following Regulations and Orders, which are the subjects under discussion today, issued under the Foreign Exchange Act, No. 12 of 2017 were published in the Government Gazette (Extraordinary) No. 2045/56 dated 17th November, 2017 after obtaining approval of the Cabinet of Ministers:

Foreign Exchange (Classes of Capital Transactions in Foreign Exchange Carried on by Authorized Dealers) Regulations No. 1 of 2017.

Foreign Exchange (Opening and Maintenance of Accounts for the purpose of engaging in Capital Transactions) Regulations No. 2 of 2017.

Foreign Exchange (Opening and Maintenance of Foreign Exchange Accounts) Regulations No. 3 of 2017.

Order under Section 8 of the Foreign Exchange Act, No. 12 of 2017.

Order under Section 31 of the Foreign Exchange Act, No. 12 of 2017

681 682

Sir, the main areas liberalized under the new Foreign Exchange Act are the following:

1. Foreign exchange transactions have been further liberalized: Under the new liberalizations, the customers are able to directly go to the respective Authorized Dealers, that is Licensed Commercial Banks and Licensed Specialized Banks and execute their transactions. The Authorized Dealers should satisfy with the bona fides of the transaction and conduct due diligence with respect to those transactions to avoid unauthorized transactions under the liberalized regulatory framework.

2. The current transactions have been redefined in terms of the Article XXX(d) of IMF Articles on Agreement and it includes the following areas without being subject to any limitation:

All payments due relating to foreign trade,

other current business including services and normal short-term banking and credit facilities

Payments due as interest on loans and as net

income from other investments

Payments of moderate amount for amortization of loans or for depreciation of direct investments and

Moderate remittances for family living

expenses.

Under the Exchange Control Act, payments of moderate amount for amortization of loans or for depreciation of direct investments was considered as a Capital Transaction, but under the new Regulations, such payments are freely permitted. Further, the limitations on entrepot trade have been fully liberalized.

3. Determination of a person resident in Sri Lanka: With a view to bring more clarity, a new criterion for determining a persons residential status was introduced based on the specific number of days spent in Sri Lanka - that is 183 days or more in aggregate - rather than focusing on permanent place of abode as considered in previous Exchange Control Act to be in line with the definition of Inland Revenue Act. So, all what we trying to do here is to bring the Foreign Exchange Act in line with the Inland Revenue Act.

4. Foreign currency accounts: In terms of new Regulations, 18 accounts which were in operation under the Exchange Control Act were reclassified into five main categories with a view to removing ambiguities and to bring further clarity. So, the 18 accounts have become five accounts. Those reclassified accounts are,

Personal Foreign Currency Accounts (PFCAs)

Business Foreign Currency Accounts (BFCAs)

Inward Investment Accounts (IIAs)

Capital Transaction Rupee Accounts (CTRAs)

Outward Investment Accounts (OIAs)

Sir, this was done to ensure clarity and convenience in dealing in foreign exchange. Free transferability of funds among similar category of accounts were also allowed.

5. Export and import of foreign currency or Sri Lankan currency and the possession of foreign currency by a person in or resident in Sri Lanka. In terms of the new Regulations, persons departing from or arriving in Sri Lanka were permitted to carry any amount of foreign exchange legitimately acquired by such persons subject to declaration to the Customs Department of Sri Lanka, if the total value exceeds US Dollars 15,000 or its equivalent or value of currency notes exceeds US Dollars 10,000 or its equivalent in other foreign currency notes, following the international standards and norms. This limit earlier stood at US Dollars 5,000 or equivalent in other currencies. Further, any person in or resident in Sri Lanka was permitted to retain in his possession of foreign currency notes up to the value of US Dollars 10,000 or its equivalent in the form of foreign currency notes for any period subject to certain conditions to be in line with the international standards and norms.

Sir, here again, what we are doing is liberalizing and making it easier for such transactions to take place. So, the limit of US Dollars 5,000 has been increased to US Dollars 15,000, but in the case of cash, it remains at US Dollars 10,000.

6. Inward capital transactions were further relaxed. An Inward Investment Account (IIA) was introduced by amalgamating Securities Investment Account (SIA) and Special Foreign Investment Deposit Account (SFIDA) for simplification of transactions and to bring convenience to the investors. If a person can confirm on the inward remittances he made for investments in Sri Lanka, such person can remit out such funds including capital gains without any restrictions. These are timely and are required when we compete with others in order to attract Foreign Direct Investments into the country.

In addition, the ownership restrictions for foreigners in certain strategically important industries and industries with national interest were kept unchanged as per the restrictions imposed by the Government Gazette issued in 2002 under the previous Exchange Control Act until it is revised based on the current international dynamics.

7. Limits of Outward Capital Transactions were enhanced. Threshold limits of outward capital transactions were increased while the categories of outward investments were broadened with a view to facilitate local investors to gain international sophistication by doing business abroad. Sir, those enhanced limits in comparison with the precious limits are as follows:

Suppose if the investor is any company listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange and if the type of investment is shares and sovereign bonds, the earlier limits were US Dollars 500,000 per annum and now it has been revised to US Dollars 2 million per calendar year.

In the case of any investor company not listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange, if the type of investment is shares and sovereign bonds, the earlier limit was US Dollars 100,000 per annum and now this has been increased to US Dollars 500,000 per calendar year.

Then, if the investor is any partnership registered in Sri Lanka and the type of investment is shares and sovereign bonds, the earlier limit was US Dollars 100,000 for life time and this has now been increased to US Dollars 300,000 for life time.

In the case of any individual investing with shares and sovereign bonds, the old limit was US Dollars 100,000 for life time and the new limit is US Dollars 200,000 for life time.

Then, if the investor is any company or a partnership and if the type of investment is setting up of overseas companies, the earlier limit was US Dollars 100,000 per annum and this has been increased to US Dollars 300,000 per calendar year.

Sir, in addition to the investment limits, a general permission was granted to Authorized Dealers to transfer eligible migration allowance on behalf of Sri Lankan emigrants and the limits introduced in 2008 on migrant transfers were increased since the prevailing limits were old more than a decade. So, you would be glad to note the enhanced limits. Their Initial Migration Allowance (IMA) has been increased from US Dollars 150,000 per person to US Dollars 200,000 per person while their Annual Migration Allowance (AMA) has been increased from US Dollars 20,000 per person to US Dollars 30,000 per person.

8. Persons were permitted to open, maintain and operate foreign currency accounts outside Sri Lanka for following categories under a general permission without coming to the Central Bank.

(a) When such persons go abroad temporary for

business, studies or medical purposes

(b) When they earn foreign currency by way of

providing professional services

(c) A permitted entity to invest outside Sri Lanka

(d) An exporter of merchandise goods

(e) Persons who have obtained valid permanent

residency in another country and dual citizens.

(f) Dual Citizens

9. Repatriation of Export Proceeds. This requirement - within 120 days and an additional grace period of 30 days - was kept unchanged for time being until those conditions are revised by the Cabinet with consideration of industry sentiments and to make it on par with international norms.

10. Issuing of corporate guarantees by companies incorporated in Sri Lanka was introduced. In the event where a company incorporated in Sri Lanka - investor- is required to provide a corporate guarantee to enable a company incorporated outside Sri Lanka -investee- in which the said investor is a shareholder to raise facilities from financial institutions in the country where the investee is incorporated, has been permitted to issue a corporate guarantee subject to a maximum limit of US Dollars 1 million.

Now, these revisions and liberalizations have been done in order to make it easier for both local and foreign investors to engage in business activities in Sri Lanka and also for Sri Lankan companies to go overseas and invest in companies they may have established outside.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the next Item is the Demutualization of the Colombo Stock Exchange Bill. The Colombo Stock Exchange was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee in 1985 with the participation of seven members for the purpose of operating a stock exchange and to undertake activities associated with operating a stock exchange.

685 686

The modernization of the Colombo Stock Exchange commenced in 1992 with the United States Agency for International Development funding a number of capital market development initiatives including the procurement of a Central Depository System to automate the clearing and settlement of share transactions carried out through the CSE. Since then, the Government through the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka- SEC- has contributed to market development through funding initiatives in the public interest, including providing financial assistance to the CSE for the procurement of the Automated Trading System and the establishment of the CSEs branch network by utilizing the cess fund.

As a result of these initiatives, the capital market has developed to an extent where the present mutual structure has inhibited growth and development of the Colombo Stock Exchange. Arguably, an efficient stock exchange is essential to the development of a dynamic economy and promoting economic growth. Hence, it is in the national interest to undertake initiatives that will improve the governance and efficiency of the CSE. There is widespread agreement among all stakeholders including members of the CSE that it should be demutualized.

Here, I would like to state that there is an agreement by the members to demutualize but the problem is how the share split is going to be. So, in our view, it is best that there is agreement between the Government and the members of the CSE on the split of the shares and also how much an IPO will be sold in the market place wherein the funds raised through such an exercise would be used for investor education across the country.

One of the big issues is that the Colombo Stock Exchange is still small in comparison to regional players. In many countries in our region, the CSEs market capitalization is bigger than the Gross Domestic Product of that country. But unfortunately, in Sri Lanka even though we have had this Colombo Stock Exchange for a number of years - before 1985, the Brokers Association had been there for another hundred years - we have still not been able to utilize, leverage the CSE in order to raise funds outside the banking system.

, . ? mortgage ? ? ? 71 .

, . , , . , . It is a good instrument to be used to raise funds outside the banking system by issuing shares to the public.

, , demutualization .

In November 2016, the SEC secured technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank - ADB - under the Capital Market Development Programme for the development of the capital market.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. State Minister, you have two more minutes. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, please give me about five more minutes because I have to explain this.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Okay. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) The Bill submitted to Parliament is the result of such technical assistance and includes several policy refinements.

The Bill facilitates the demutualization of the Exchange by converting the CSE to a company limited by shares operating on a for profit basis and restructuring its operations, governance structure and management for the benefit of all stakeholders, taking into account public interest. The conversion has to be carried out by way of an Act of Parliament as a change in the legal status of a company limited by guarantee to that of a company limited by shares is not contemplated in the Companies Act. So, that is the reason, Sir, that we had to come to Parliament to introduce this Bill to make that conversion possible.

What is the rationale for demutualization? This is the process through which the CSE, operating as not for profit member-controlled organization, is converted to a for profit shareholder-owned company. Demutualization will change the legal status of the CSE from a company limited by guarantee to a company limited by shares, in which shareholders will not only be stockbrokers, but also include the public when the CSE is listed on its own exchange. ? . 05 . , .

The Bill provides the procedure to be followed in the conversion of the CSE, a company limited by guarantee to a company limited by shares. The distribution model recommended by the ADB consultants has taken into account the financial contributions made directly by stakeholders to the CSE since its inception. The contribution by the Government and USAID and the contribution by Members through Member Fees has been recognized in the distribution of shares of the demutualized CSE.

So this is where the various compositions have been proposed by various people.

Then, limits on ownership. In order to ensure good governance and to promote a diversified shareholding, ownership of the demutualized CSE has been limited to 5 per cent in respect of any person with a further limitation of 40 per cent being imposed on collective holdings by stockbrokers.

, 4 . control . control . , - equitably - .

Then, the governance structure. The Bill provides for the transition to a new governance structure where the majority of directors will be independent and the Chairman elected from among independent directors to ensure good governance and the interests of all stakeholders are addressed. A statutorily constituted Nomination Panel will be entrusted with the task of nominating directors to be appointed to the demutualized CSE.

Nomination Panel ? ? ? . . , , explain .

Then, listing of the demutualized CSE. The listing of the demutualized CSE on its own exchange is provided for in the Bill. This is expected to take place within a period of three years.

691 692

2018 05

In conclusion, taking into account the positive impact demutualization will have on the capital market development, it is imperative that demutualization be facilitated by way of legislation.

Sir, I will end with this. We will bring legislation to demutualize the Stock Exchange, but we will do it on our own terms, not on the terms of some consultant who is sitting at the SEC and telling the Government how to run our affairs. Thank you very much.
