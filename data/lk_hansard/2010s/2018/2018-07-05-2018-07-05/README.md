( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Devaluation results in extra payments. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I do not agree with that, Hon. Member, because devaluation does two things. One is, when you measure it in rupees, yes you are right that the rupee amount of debt increases. But the devaluation does something else. It makes the exports competitive and the exports increase. I might make one more point about devaluation.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) You are avoiding the question. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) No, I am not avoiding it. I have no reason to avoid it. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) You both have two different views. I think we have to proceed to the next Question.

NATIONAL AUDIT BILL

. . Order for Second Reading read.

[11.28a.m.] ( ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - Prime Minister, Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs} Hon. Speaker, I move,

That the Bill be now read a Second time

Hon. Speaker, a lot of time has been taken, so I will be very brief because there are a large number of Members

1411 1412

who want to express their views on this important piece of legislation. The House has been waiting for this piece of legislation for long and the Government and I have been criticized for the delay.

Firstly, I would like to remind this House that the National Audit Bill and the Right to Information Bill were things proposed by the Government in 2003 of which you and I were Members. Unfortunately, before these Bills could see the light of day, the Government changed. The succeeding governments promised to carry on, but no one ever produced this Bill again. So, while we are going to get criticized that we did not want to bring in this Bill and we have delayed it, I just want to remind everyone that everyone here had a chance of bringing in the Bill. But they did not do that. Then, we decided when we backed the present President Maithripala Sirisena that we will again produce the Right to Information Bill and the National Audit Bill before this House.

There were two Committees appointed. When the Right to Information Bill was produced before this House, it differed slightly from the older draft and therefore it went through the House without too much of discussion outside this House. But, when the National Audit Bill came, it was different from the original one and the whole power structure of the Constitution came into play. Because, you had the Executive power which was wielded by the President, the Prime Minister and the Ministers; then you had the Judicial power and we also had Parliaments Legislative power. It was under the power of Parliament that the Auditor-General operated. This is an important power of Parliament.

The Parliaments powers came around as a result of a conflict with the Executive or the King of England as to who had the right to control finance - the King or Parliament. It was a matter not resolved in the court, it was resolved by a war in which the Parliament won and the King was executed. That is how the Parliaments supremacy on financial matters has been established.

Firstly, it was a question that taxation could not take place without the consent of Parliament and secondly, that the annual spending of the government must be approved by Parliament. Firstly, it was a three-year budget. Then, it came down to a one-year budget. Then, Parliament also set up what was called a Ways and Means Committee to look at ways and means of raising money required to run the government. That was the first part.

Once that was established, then Parliament started looking at controlling the expenditure and they realized that to control expenditure the accounts had to be audited. Therefore, the audit also became a very important part of the Parliament and there came around the office of the Auditor-General. So, our office of the Auditor-General is fairly old. Some of the countries have a Controller General. Then, the importance of an audit and the independence to ensure efficient functioning of government and to ensure that proper data was available before Parliament became an important issue. At the 66th

General Assembly of the United Nations it was decided that a supreme audit body should be strengthened for the promotion and efficiency, responsibility, effectiveness, transparency and accountability of public administration and it indicates that the legality of the audit body should be enshrined in the Constitution of a State or in any other law. So, this is what we accepted.

In 2003, we only envisaged legislation, but we brought in the Audit Service Commission by an Amendment to the Constitution. It was enshrined in the Nineteenth Amendment.

This law seeks to give the details for exercising the powers of the Commission so that it becomes an independent Commission operating under Parliament. We have some bodies which operate with the Judiciary. There are other bodies which operate with the Executive. But, this is a body that operates under the sovereignty of Parliament. So, this is the main purpose of the National Audit Bill.

Now, the issues we have had been about the imposition of surcharges. I thought I will underline it. Who has the power? Because, surcharges were imposed by the Secretary to the Ministry or the Chief Accounting Officer. Can it go to the Audit Service Commission? Can the Audit Service Commission exercise any power which is judicial of nature or is the Secretarys power executive in nature? So, we had actually different number of committees. There is a subcommittee of Ministers, there is a committee of Secretaries, there is a committee of other government officials. Then, there were discussions with the Auditor-General, discussions here, and finally with the Public Service Commission. All of them came and they have made their representations to ensure that their powers are not infringed. Of course, there have been changes.

One of the big areas of concern was the power of audit. The second has been the duties of the Secretary as the Chief Accounting Officer and of the Accounting Officers. They are held responsible. How are the directions to be given? Actually, it was only when the Audit Service Commission Bill came in and these disputes were taking place I realized, having been in government, how detailed the working out of the Government expenditure and the audit was; that it cuts through all the three different branches of the government.

So, these were issues that had been sorted out. Even after we tabled the Bill in April, there were still amendments coming in from some of the public bodies. But all have been accommodated now. I hope this is a satisfactory Bill and when it becomes a law, we must give a chance for this law to be executed and thereafter, Parliament can, from time to time, exercise the oversight powers to ensure what amendments are required.

Auditing of the government itself is a big issue. Firstly, audit must be timely. It is useless us having Audit Reports of four years hence. This Parliament is, at the moment, looking at Audit Reports of the last Parliament

1413 1414

[ ]

2018 15

and Parliament before that. Current Audit Reports must be available. Secondly, on the principles of auditing, some of the Auditor-Generals, some of the Audit Commissions have come under criticism in those countries about the auditing techniques used. But it is not only confined to the State sector, it happens even with the private auditors. Private Auditors are coming under audit firms in South Africa. Recently, the regulator in the UK has pulled up the four leading audit firms for not having audited properly and being responsible for the collapse of some of the largest companies in the United Kingdom. So, auditing itself is now coming under scrutiny and Parliament must now exercise its powers to ensure that proper auditing principles are taken.

Some of the issues would arise. For instance, some public servants would say, No, we cannot take this decision because we will come under audit query. Now we have to sort this out. The Government must also function. Auditing must also take place. So, these are issues that are going to arise and this House will have to go into the matters.

Then, there is also other powers of Parliament. I think this will be completed when we pass the law on the Parliamentary Budget Office. Then, the Parliamentary Budget Office will be the final authority looking at the estimates given by the Executive and the reports given by the National Audit Commission. I think the specialist knowledge that is required will have to be carried in the Parliamentary Budget Office. National Audit Commission will have to be in the auditing side and where specialist knowledge is concerned, we will have to meet up or we have to find some system. So, I think the Parliamentary Budget Office will have to carry specialization, separate from the specialization, a specialist available to the Government.

So, I do not want to take any more of your time on this, but would like to say that we can be happy that since 2015, after the election of Maithripala Sirisena as President, after the election of this Parliament, a total democratic structure has come into place and you can enjoy the freedoms today. You have all the Independent Commissions - the Judicial Service Commission, the Election Commission, the Public Service Commission, the National Police Commission and the Constitutional Council; independence of the Supreme Court and the other courts. Then, we will be having the Audit Service Commission and the Right to Information law as well.

These are all legislations brought in by this Government which has put a democratic structure in place. There will be shortcomings - the Police Commission and all have shortcomings. We can correct those. But the fact is we have put a structure in place where the Executive or the Administration can function and the Judiciary can function without coming under undue political pressure in the work that they have to do. So, we have to look at the National Audit Commission in the background of democracy and how democracy has been established.

Now, for the first time, the Prime Minister comes to Parliament and answers to questions in Parliament. So,

this Parliament is becoming more and more powerful. As we go along and take over the new offices and get the J. R. Jayewardene Centre legislation amended by the end of this year, we will have a Parliament which we can be proud of and would be on par or even have more functions available than the Lok Sabha in India.

Thank you.

The Secretary to the Ministry is the Chief Accounting Officer. He is responsible and his responsibility lies not only on the action taken on the directives but also on the viability of the project - financial input of the project and the sustainability of the project - and he has to make sure that the money spent is properly investigated into. We can see that by bringing in this Bill, the powers of the Auditor-General is made much stronger. The Auditor-General is an officer who is answerable to Parliament. Therefore, by bringing in this Bill, what we are doing is, we are simply strengthening Parliament and that is something that we have to applaud. The fact is that we are bringing in these changes through a Commission. At the end of the day, the Auditor-General is doing a post-audit. So, what is lacking here is that the audit should be done during or before the approval is given and that is why we need an Audit Office in Parliament.

We have to rely on those professional institutes. We will make a small Budget Office without having a huge overhead. Then you can always outsource. Hon. Ajith P. Perera, your point is taken. I am not saying no to it. But whether we can afford to have 50 to 60 people in a Budget Office or should we have a department confined to the purpose of audit which will know our inflation, all the required financial indicators and our yardsticks is what is lacking now.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya. You have 12 minutes.

[3.42p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Hon. Presiding Member, I thank you for allocating me 12 minutes of this House to express my views on the much anticipated National Audit Bill taken up for Debate today.

The National Audit Bill had been withheld since 2003 and deferred 24 times by successive governments, perhaps due to a combination of two reasons - lack of political will, and at least I would like to think, more so to do with the political technicality of a too much unchecked power being given to the Auditor General and his Department. The Yahapalana Government did however made it a point in their election manifesto to introduce the National Audit Bill, and as far as introducing it today, even in this much watered-down version, I must congratulate them. But, a closer examination of the contents of the Bill, which I will touch later on, makes me wonder whether this Bill too is a sham just as much as this Government has been for the last three years. This Bill is just for window dressing, so that the Government can now mumble on what glorious legislation they have brought before us, but in actuality might not serve the intended purpose and actually can hinder the general public administration.

There are also political technicalities that need to be addressed as prerequisites when introducing Bills such as this or for that matter strengthening any other independent commission. Independent commissions stem

1489 1490

2018 15

from defects of democracy, where mainly people involved in the role of Executive takes decisions on self-interest rather than the interest of the nation. So, it is hoped that the independent commissions somewhat put a check and a balance to it. However, we also must be careful as there is a transition of power from the Executive to the commissions that the commissions themselves remain independent. Furthermore, I also feel that the Governments intention should not be to make more and more independent commissions, but independent institutions. It must be noted that governments can get voted out of power, but commissions can create a long-lasting fraternity of like-minded people, including the retired and the working, where the intention can lead to well-being of the sector and about the power they can exercise rather than the mandate given and the general good of the public.

Sir, in order to stress my point, if we take the case of the National Audit Bill, such a Bill can prove to be harmful for general public administration such as ours where the country is riddled with systematic corruption, at all levels. In such countries, it is easy to pick a side and victimize your opponents. Some fear that the public sector will render further inefficient if independent commissions do not function independently and strive fear in the public sector. Therefore, that is why it is important, Hon. Presiding Member, that certain prerequisite legislature be introduced, such as a garden period, which the Government has failed to do. A garden period will essentially prevent the heads and members of independent commissions and not only them, but also high-ranking members of the armed forces and even the police, whereby high-ranking officers cannot engage in political activity or seek public office even after retirement for a given period of time. This will essentially prevent high-ranking officers, who have fiduciary rights from exercising their influence whilst in office for personal gain after retirement.

Furthermore, other legislations, such as set of prearranged dates for independent commissions for announcements and proclamations need to be incorporated so that independent commissions do not go over and beyond the mandate that they are given. Now, take the case of the present Auditor General, who went on air just before a crucial election which had been postponed by two-and-a- half years and decided to give his opinion about bookkeeping during the last Government. My contention is not the validity of the statement, irrespective of the validity what needs to be assessed is whether the Auditor Generals statement has an influence or not on the general public, and if there is an influence then such statement at such times should be forbidden by law.

Sir, we in the Joint Opposition believe in the principles of true good governance which are workable, but not this charade the government is acting out. And, having elections on time is one of the key principles of good governance. The manner in which the Prime Minister answered the question regarding the postponement of Provincial Council elections yesterday, makes us believe that the Prime Minister thinks people of

this country will just watch and wait whilst he acts the goat and clown about whilst taking their franchise away. Let me assure you that the Prime Minister will get a fitting reply worse than the beating he got at the last elections next time around when the provincial elections are held.

Hon. Presiding Member, if we look at international indices such as the Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index, we would see a deterioration in the rankings from 83rd place in 2015 to 91st place in 2017 since the inception of this Government. We also see, Sir, through these rankings that the most developed countries tend to be the least corrupt and the most corrupt countries tend to be the least developed. So, Hon. Presiding Member, the developed countries have strong institutions and they function usually independent of the government. Now, I dare not say that this is the sole reason why some countries have succeeded in developing whereas others have failed. Of course, historical reasons are just as important. But in general, Sir, we see in those countries that an independent supreme audit authority has been a frontrunner in eradicating corruption and bringing those countries towards development.

If we take a closer look at the newly developed countries such as Singapore and South Korea, we could see that they had given the key most emphasis on economic development and acknowledged what works and disregarded what does not. There was no blind pursuit of good governance and with more and more economic development, more and more emphasis was given on good governance. Proper independent institutions and political will was enforced in eradicating corruption.

Hon. Presiding Member, I think the whole role of the Auditor-General and his Department has to be relooked altogether. Although the Auditor-General plays perhaps the most critical role in public sector accountability, its dependency on the two Parliamentary Subcommittees for the release of its findings, I think, should be changed. What good would the findings of these reports do, especially if the Members of the Subcommittees to which these reports are presented themselves deliberate with the accused over the phone as it happened during the infamous Bond case? What good would it be to present a report to a Parliament which has turned a blind eye to the conduct of its Members and continue to solicit them in the COPE even after the Members have been exposed? We have also seen how some Members hurled insults at the Auditor-General in order to suppress evidence and support Mr. Arjun Aloysius. So, if the Members of Parliament in the COPE and COPA are corrupt and contagious, I think this system completely breaks down and it is better off for the Auditor-General to directly publicize the findings.

We also know that there are largely three models of supreme audit institutions namely, the Westminster Model, the Judicial Model and the Collegiate Model. I think, the time has come for the policymakers to have a public debate on whether we have indeed incorporated

1491 1492

the best model or whether we can incorporate different aspects of other models such as the Judicial Model where the Supreme Audit Institution is an integral part of the judicial system operating independently of the Executive and the Legislative branches.

As for the merits of the Bill, there are many contentions. I understand the provision for surcharge which provides for a recovery of an amount overpaid to a Public Servant or recoupment of any loss caused to the Government for which he is held responsible has been diluted under this Bill.

In Clause 19, a lengthy process has been incorporated where the Chief Accounting Officer of the auditee entity imposes a fine with provisions for an appeal against the decision. Now I find that this is a horrendous juxtaposition of checks and balances and a major conflict of interest, as the Chief Accounting Officer of the auditee entity is a colleague of the accused. There can be a possibility of collusion or even an affinity to prolong the process as long as possible as a favour for a colleague. Further complicating the process is the lack of provision for the Chief Accounting Officer to specify any deviations of the surcharge as specified by the Audit Service Commission taking away the transparency and making the whole process meaningless. So, that is why I feel that we need Legislature to change the format so that such a case can be referred to the judicial process directly. If needed, we can even have special courts for this purpose. Sir, if this Government can make special courts to catch politically motivated so-called financial crimes of the previous Government, could we not make fair conclusion by the same logic that more importance has to be given to this Bill which deals with current and future corruptions?

The success of any supreme audit institution depends in a large part on the independence of that institution. It is not just the functional independence of the department which already has the safety of constitutional safeguards, but also the financial independence for the proper operation and administration of the department. We have seen many a time that the Auditor General pleading his case for more manpower, which comes under the Ministry of Public Administration, to no avail. So, in this regard, this Bill falls well short of the actual intention of making the Auditor Generals Department more independent as the Bill has failed to provide financial independence from the General Treasury and independence from the Ministry of Public Administration for manpower requirements.

Sir, I would also like to see Clause 7(1)(b), which provides provision for a person to send a representative to the Auditor General if called upon by the Auditor General be changed. Such provision will no doubt hinder the investigative capacity of the Auditor General as guilty can keep sending representatives to delay the investigation. I would also like to see provisions, which will enable not only Government subsidiaries with 50 per cent shareholding being audited, but also associate companies with at least 20 per cent holdings or for that matter, any

institution with Government holdings where financial abuse seems to take place, be included in this Bill.

There should also be feasibility audits for long-term infrastructure projects, so that we get the best value for rupee spent. Finally, I of course believe that there should be financial independence where a Parliamentary Select Committee oversees and directly debits the Consolidated Fund for the financial requirements of the Audit Commission.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, please.

[3.54p.m.] ( ( ( () - ) The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva - State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) Hon. Presiding Member, I would first like to take a moment to appreciate the good words of Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya that the Government has had finally the political will, the courage to introduce the National Audit Bill. Did he go? Ah, there you are!

Then, I would like to reply to some of the issues you raised, Hon. Member. You asked, "Is this Bill a sham, are we trying to window-dress it and are we trying to hinder the progress?" Actually, it is not; because while both you and I know that it took a while to bring this Bill to Parliament, we have brought it in. As you said, it has been watered-down to some extent; I also agree with you that it has been watered-down to some extent, but it is nevertheless a beginning. Therefore, on behalf of the Government and the Ministry that is introducing this Bill to Parliament, I would like to appeal to you to view this Bill not with a glass half empty attitude, but rather with a glass half full attitude.

Sir, the Hon. Member said the Independent Commissions need checks and balances. - [Interruption.] I will let you speak after me, Hon. Member. You talked about transition of power and the Executive to give that authority to the Independent Commissions. I am sure you are aware that that is certainly happening. I mean, it is not any longer possible for the Executive to direct the various officials or individuals within specified ministries either to do or not to do certain things or to act or not to act on certain issues. Therefore, I think we can see that transition taking place.

For instance, let me give you a classic example. I sit in the COPE. I used to sit in the COPA when I was a Member of the Opposition. Hon. Balasuriya, those days what happened was the COPE and the COPA were chaired by the Executive: the Ministers of the then

1493 1494

[ ]

2018 15

Government. Really I recall very well how I tried desperately to bring up issues in terms of financial mismanagement, but it was always and every time vetoed or thrown into the garbage bin by the Executive who was chairing the Committee on Public Accounts at that time. That is not good governance.

You said earlier that in countries that are well governed the separation of powers has already happened. That has happened here in our good governance Government because when this Government came into office, we said, No, we do not want the Executive to chair the COPE. Let the Members of the Committee decide on who should chair the COPE.

Hon. Sunil Handunnetti is seated in front of me. Our Members elected him as the Chairman of the COPE. He is certainly not a Member of the Executive; he is certainly not a Member of our Government. In fact, he is a vociferous Member of the Opposition.

When the new Parliament Sessions began about two months ago, once again what happened? Unanimously the Members of the Committee reappointed Hon. Handunnetti as the Chairman of the COPE. I think, you must appreciate the transition that is taking place. And I hope some day, Hon. Balasuriya, when the Party that you belong to establishes a Government that you would follow the same principles of good governance and if I am a Member of the Opposition at that time I would put my hand up and say, "I would like to be the Chairman of that Committee."

Thirdly, you mentioned a good point. I did not catch the word that you used. I think you referred to some sort of "cooling off period" where persons of high office leave Government and engage in politics. You said that there must be some sort of cooling off period before such happens and I agree with you. This revolving door policy is not good and that corrupts. It does not necessarily have to be politics. Suppose you are a Member of a regulatory body and as soon as you leave the job as a member of the regulatory body, you become the Chairman or Managing Director of a regulated company. That is completely bad governance but that continues in this country. Perhaps, we can, as a measure of good governance, have some legislation in this House where you say that for three years or for 18 months that you cannot engage either in politics or you cannot move from a regulatory body to a regulated company.

Then, you said that we need strong institutions. Absolutely! Unconditionally I agree with you that we need strong institutions. That is certainly why we are creating the new office of the Auditor-General via the National Audit Bill.

I think, I need to make a correction and this, Hon. Presiding Member, is an important one. I think, I am right in saying this. You said that the Auditor-General's Office must have financial independence and I believe that that is given in this Bill. If I am wrong, perhaps somebody can correct me, but as far as I know the funds will be allocated via the Consolidated Fund to all Independent

Commissions, not only to this Commission but to the Police Commission, the Elections Commission and so on and so forth. Unfortunately it was the then President, your Leader of the current "flower bud group", who got rid of the Independent Commissions and via the Eighteenth Amendment relegated those Commissions and the legislation thereof to the dustbin and took under his control the financial authority of those previous Commissions.

Now I am not going to talk too much about the National Audit Bill because my Colleagues in this House have for the last several hours raised these issues. But I want to certainly raise one issue. You spoke about Transparency International and so on. Transparency International has provided us with a legislative brief on the National Audit Bill and I agree to one of those recommendations. As a matter of fact, I was speaking to the Auditor-General just a while ago and said, I am going to raise this issue. The issue is the right to information. In the Bill, we say the Auditor-General should not be compelled by any person to disclose any information except on a request of Parliament or by an Order of court or subject to paragraph (b) to give effect to the provisions of any written law and paragraph (b) says that you cannot disclose information unless, otherwise, the audit report has been presented to Parliament.

In fairness to the Auditor-General, his view is, "It is still information that is being gathered. So, how is it possible for me to release that information to the public?" But in this day and age where again, the Hon. Balasuriya, we had the guts, we had the courage to bring in the Right to Information Bill to Parliament and create the Right to Information Act which has made a paradigm shift - I stress a paradigm shift - in the way governance is carried out in this country. In the old days, before the Right to Information Act, it was under the Secrecy Ordinance that officials worked. There was no way in which a person either in Kotte or in Jaffna could ask the government or the local authority or the provincial council for information on his tax that he pays or she pays. Today that has changed. Today you send a request to the authority whichever the authority it maybe and by mandate it is compulsory that the information is released to the persons seeking such information by that authority and by any chance if it is not possible to do so, explanations have to be given as to why it is not possible and thereafter, he should get that information in a given period of time.

Now what happens here is, that this Bill in my view, Hon. Presiding Member, goes beyond the Constitutional rights given by the Right to Information Act by restricting the citizen to be able to obtain the information that he or she is entitled to under the Constitution. Therefore, I am not saying that the Auditor-General should willy- nilly give out the information as and when requested by person X or Y. But I think there needs to be some discussion between the Auditor-General and the Legislature to figure out how best we can compromise on this, because something that we fought for, something that we stand for is the right to information. Hon. Balasuriya, you talked about

1495 1496

corruption and I agree with you completely and in my view, the way to fight corruption is the tool of information. Now look at what is happening today. Sometimes information becomes a complicated problem because people create information out of thin air. News becomes fake news and these pieces of fake news are distributed via electronic media, telephones, Facebook and so on and gullible people sometimes believe it. There is no fact-checking. So I think the Auditor-General must also think about these issues whether it is something that is true that is being distributed or whether it is something that is completely untrue that is being distributed.

I do not know how to deal with this question, because it is a question faced not only by us in this country, but a question faced by nations across the world. Therefore, in that sense, we need to take cognizance of that fact. I personally believe that Clause 9(a) of this Bill should undergo some sort amendment either now or at a future point in time.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, you have two more minutes left. ( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Okay, Sir.

So, Hon. Member, I think we must look at what we have started today as a glass half full and we must work together to complete it.

Independence must be given to the Auditor-General and if what I said a little while ago is correct, that the Auditor-Generals finances come directly from the Consolidated Fund - there is no boss over the Auditor-General, in that sense and that is why, I believe, it is called a supreme institution - then, the person has the right, the responsibility to undertake the work. But, I must also caution that when such power is in ones hand, one must use that power with a sense of responsibility and that is essential.

The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya also talked about checks and balances. There have to be checks and balances. An arm of this scale cannot go above another. So, the scale must always be balanced. It might depend on the person. Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya, you asked whether the Auditor-General was right in making a statement on national accounts before the recent Local Government Election. You had your view; I also had my view and I think what the Auditor-General said was accurate. It was just an interpretation issue that had taken place. As a matter of fact, the Auditor-General asked whether all the money that we have spent on loans has been listed as assets.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. State Minister, do you need more time?

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, I am finishing up. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) I can give you a minute or two, if you want. ( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, give me one more minute.

Those monies are not in the Asset Registry; those cannot be in the Asset Registry, Hon. Balasuriya, because a whole lot of the loans that we take are to pay back old loans. We are fully cognizance of that fact. So, I do not know whether the timing of his raising that issue was right, but certainly the issue he raised was correct.

So, once again, I want to reiterate the fact that this effort of ours is not a sham; this is done with all good intention. We have shown to this country, not once, not twice, but over and over again, that we mean what we say. Earlier, I gave two specific examples - one was, the appointment of Chairpersons to the Parliamentary Committees and the second was the Right to Information Act - and here, certainly, is the third.

Sir, thank you very much. . ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Ajith P. Perera, what is your point of Order?
