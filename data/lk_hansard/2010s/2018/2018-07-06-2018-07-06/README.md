REFORMS TO PROVINCIAL COUNCILS ELECTION LAWS

[11.23a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I will move the following Adjournment Motion:

"Whereas the terms of office of three Provincial Councils came to an end in October, 2017.

And whereas no election to the said three councils have been conducted to date owing to the fact that the Provincial Councils Elections Act was amended in order to introduce reforms to the electoral process.

And whereas three more Provincial Councils will end their respective terms of office by October 2018.

No election to any Provincial Council can be held due to the fact that the electoral reforms are not yet complete.

An urgent priority has arisen to complete the electoral reforms so that the franchise of the people of the several provinces are not denied any further.

We urge the Government to complete the electoral reforms to the Provincial Councils Election laws immediately without any further delay.

And if it is not possible to complete the said reforms within the next two months, we urge that the Provincial Councils (Amendment) Act, No. 17 of 2017 be repealed immediately so that elections to the Provincial Councils can be held without any further postponement."

Sir, I think it is important to set out the background to the present situation. After this Government took office in August, 2015, several reform processes were undertaken. There were important reforms to the Constitution that were pledged and in January, 2016, a Resolution was presented to Parliament to appoint a Constitutional Assembly and undertake that task of drafting a Constitution for this country. That was adopted unanimously by this House on the 09th of March, 2016.

There were three important issues that were identified in that particular process: one was to address the national issue, to finally settle the issue that had plagued this country for 70 years by proper devolution of powers to provinces; secondly, to address the issue of the Executive Presidency and to make a decision with regard to the pledges given to this country continuously prior to every Presidential Election that the Executive Presidency would be abolished and thirdly, to reform the electoral laws.

Since 1978 this country has been using the Proportional Representation System and after several

1643 1644

years, various shortcomings of this System were identified. The most important of them being that there is no Member of Parliament who is accountable to a particular constituency. All Members of Parliament represent a district or another and in that context it is difficult to identify Members who are accountable to the people of particular constituencies. So, a promise was given that the electoral system would be reformed.

There was also allegation with regard to preferential voting system in the PR System and therefore, in that Constitutional Assembly process, the Steering Committee started discussing the reforms to electoral process as the first item. One or two Parties insisted that that must be urgently addressed and so that issue was taken up as the first matter. In those discussions, an alternate proposal was put forward that is extant in some countries in the world known as the "Mixed Member Proportion" - MMP - which is meant to be an overall PR System. Within it you accommodate persons who are elected from specific constituencies and in order to maintain that overall proportional representation, a certain percentage of Members are then appointed. So, it was necessary to identify the ratio between those Members who would be directly elected by constituencies and those Members who would be appointed as a compensatory PR so that the overall representation in Parliament would be in accordance with the vote that was cast by the people.

In those discussions several models were examined and at one stage, there was a policy decision taken, that Parties were generally in agreement with the MMP with 60:40 ratio: 60 to come from constituencies directly and the other 40 to be appointed so that the entire 100 per cent would be proportionally representative. Thereafter, there were disputes with regard to various details such as cutoffs, bonus, et cetera. The Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly left it as it was with that position on the principle of MMP - 60:40 - and then we moved on to discuss other issues.

By this time, there were local authorities - several municipal councils, urban councils and pradeshiya sabhas - that had run their terms and election to those local authorities was pending and there was a long delay in holding those elections.

Since there was an overall agreement that the election to Parliament would be on MMP - 60:40, it was decided to introduce the same system to the other two tiers, namely, the provincial councils and the local authorities also. So, the Local Authorities Elections Law was amended introducing the MMP principle and making it 60:40 - 60 from wards and the balance 40 as a compensatory PR. Similarly, the Provincial Councils Elections Act was also amended.

As I have said in the Motion, three councils ended their terms in October last year and the elections were due to those three councils. But in keeping with these overall general agreement of a Mixed Member Proportion system and a 60:40 ratio, the Provincial Councils Elections Act

was sought to be amended. Now, at that stage, some political Parties insisted that 60:40 ratio will not be acceptable to them and that it must be made 50:50. So, that change - 50:50 - was made to Both in the Local Authorities Election Law reform and the Provincial Council Election reform, there was no cut-off that was introduced and in accordance with the Amendment that had been effected to the Local Authorities Elections Act, elections to all the local authorities, except one, were held in the country on the 10th of February this year. The Government said, " Let us have the elections to local authorities under the new system on an experimental basis and see the results, see what we get." This was what the Hon. Prime Minister repeatedly said, on an experimental basis.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, when results came for the local authorities elections that was held on the 10th of February this year, we found that almost half the number of councils did not have a majority for any single party to form an administration. There was a serious issue of stability to form an administration. In the next few months, we found, we saw for ourselves, the difficulties in forming administrations to those councils. So that experiment, the so-called experiment of a 60:40 MMP without a cut-off and without bonus in order to achieve stability was exposed. It was shown to be a failure.

In the meantime, in the Provincial Councils Elections Law reform which this Parliament approved and was certified on the 22nd of September, 2017 - I refer to the Provincial Councils Elections(Amendment) Act, No. 17 of 2017 - it was provided that a Delimitation Committee would be tasked with proposing boundaries to electorates for the provincial councils and thereafter that report would be submitted to Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , 15 . ?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am still moving the Adjournment Motion. So, there cannot be a time limit.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Okay.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Committee should submit the report to the Minister who within two weeks should present it to Parliament. On the 14th of February, this year, the Committee submitted its Report to the Hon. Minister and he, within two weeks, presented it to Parliament. I refer to Section 3A of the Provincial Councils Elections Act, as amended by Act No. 17 of 2017. Subsection (11) of Section 3A of the Act states, I quote:

1645 1646

[ .. ]

2018 06

"The Committee shall submit its report to the Minister, who shall within two weeks of the receipt of such report, table it in Parliament for its approval by not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members of Parliament (including those not present) voting in its favour." And, Subsection (12) of Section 3A states:

"Where Parliament does not approve such report in terms of subsection (11) within one month of the tabling of the report, then the Speaker shall appoint a Review Committee, consisting of five persons representing the major communities and, headed by the Prime Minister."

Now, by the end of March this year, that one month had elapsed. Therefore, in terms of the law, Parliament had not approved the Report that was submitted to Parliament by the Minister in terms of Subsection (11) of the Act and therefore, it was obligatory on the part of the Speaker to appoint a Review Committee. That Review Committee had to make its report within two months. So, by the end of March, Parliament had not approved it. Therefore, by the end of May, the Report of the Review Committee should have come to Parliament but no Review Committee has been appointed and nothing has been done after the Hon. Minister presented the Delimitation Report to Parliament in February 2018. Five months have elapsed since the submission of the Delimitation Report to Parliament by the Minister.

That is why in the Motion, I have said that the reform process has not yet been completed. But, what is the effect of this whole process being deadlocked like this or being in limbo like this? The net effect is, when no elections are being held in the three Provincial Councils that completed their terms last year, and if this continues, the three more Provincial Councils which complete their terms in October this year, no election can be held for those three Provincial Councils also.

Periodical elections are the foundation of a democratic system. I have heard many times that holding periodical elections is not the only feature of democracy. That is true. But, that is the foundation. Without timely periodical elections, there cannot be democracy; it cannot be even called a democratic system. Here, we are faced with a situation where due to an amendment that was approved by this House by two-thirds majority and due to the fact that that is not being worked, elections are not being held and the franchise of the people of those three provinces have denied now for several months.

I think it is important that this House undo those knots that were put in place by ourselves in that Amendment Act, No. 17 of 2017 expeditiously so that elections can be held. Our experience with the Local Government Elections that were held in February, 2018 is that even 60:40 is not acceptable and will not result in stable institutions. How much worse will it be when you have a system of 50:50 ratio? No Provincial Council will be able to form an administration. So, that must be reviewed; that must be changed. An amendment must be brought in to this House to change that ratio. Our position is that it must be 70:30 if stable administrations are to be formed in the provinces. But, that must be discussed.

Here, we are in a situation where even the time prescribed by our own Act, which we approved in September last year has not been followed. We have not even debated the Delimitation Report within one month. That has not been accepted. And if it is not accepted, the law says, there must be a Review Committee which must submit a Report within two months. More than three months have lapsed beyond that and we do not have a Review Committee. So, we have a situation where by inaction of Parliament, elections to Provincial Councils are being delayed and long delayed. If the local authorities elections were held on an experimental basis, as I said before, that exposed the shortcomings of a 60:40 system. So, that must be remedied immediately and an acceptable ratio be found and we must immediately move forward and have the elections.

I have also said that if this process cannot be completed within the next two months, elections must nevertheless be held. Elections cannot be postponed or put off merely because we are unable to complete a reform process to the Election Law. That is totally unacceptable, that violates, that shakes the very foundation of democracy and that is why I move with respect that if within the next two months this reform process cannot be completed by consensus, then Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Act, No. 17 of 2017 must be repealed in order that elections are held on time. Already it is late, but elections must be held on time and then we can take our own cool time to discuss what is acceptable system of elections for the Provincial Councils.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , .

[11.45am.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees.

I am happy to second the Motion that has been moved by the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, Member of Parliament. He has dealt, Sir, primarily with the issue of the elections not being held and discussed various steps that have been taken thus far and also discussed what needs to be done to ensure that democracy is functional in the provinces and that elections are held without undue further delay.

That, no doubt Sir, is a very serious issue which also raises the question of whether Governments in this country are seriously committed to democracy functioning in regard to provincial governance.

1647 1648

There has been a long-standing demand in this country in regard to the sharing of powers of governance. This has been invoked for a long time. In fact, I might mention that the first person in this country who talked in terms of arrangements that would ensure a credible sharing of powers of governance was the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike when he returned to this country in the 1920s. He delivered several speeches and wrote several articles advocating a system of governance that would enable the sharing of power; that would enable regions or provinces to be able to exercise powers of governance. It has been almost a century since that happened. That happened in the 1920s. Almost a century will pass in a few more years since that happened and we have not been able to have in place a credible power-sharing arrangement, an effective power-sharing arrangement where we can also ensure that elections are held at the proper time.

I propose, Sir, to use the little time that is available to me to address the issue of not merely holding the Provincial Council Election which has been dealt with fairly comprehensively by the Mover of the Motion, but I would also like to ensure that Provincial Councils are able to function effectively so as to serve the people in the provinces in terms of the powers vested in the provinces. That too is a very serious issue which needs to be addressed.

Provincial Councils, Sir, came about in this country in 1987, 1988 when there was the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and it will be interesting for us to observe what happened after 1987 and 1988 when there was the Thirteenth Amendment. When the Thirteenth Amendment came about, the late President Jayewardene was the President of this country. He was succeeded by the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa. The late President Ranasinghe Premadasa being fully aware that the Thirteenth Amendment was inadequate to enable provinces to govern their areas effectively and to ensure that the people were really, truly the beneficiaries of provincial governance, appointed a Select Committee chaired by the late Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe, a leading Member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, to submit a report in regard to a new Constitution which would also encompass the issue of provincial governance. There was a Report submitted by the late Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe that took the constitutional arrangements pertaining to provincial governance far beyond the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. That was followed, Sir, in 1994 when ex-President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga became the President.

She came up with Proposals in 1995, 1997 and eventually there were Constitutional Proposals that were tabled in Parliament in 2000 August with the blessings of the present President, Hon. Maithripala Sirisena and the former President, Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, both of whom were Cabinet Ministers in the Cabinet of Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and they had approved the Proposals that came to Parliament in 2000 August.

Then, during President Mahinda Rajapaksas time, there was the All Party Representative Committee - APRC - appointed by him and the Multi Ethnic Experts Committee appointed by him and statements and speeches made by him which talked of maximum possible devolution, which talked of power-sharing arrangements that are available in the other countries which he wanted the experts to study as a basis for their Proposals. He wanted people to determine their destiny in the areas in which they lived and there was the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana's All Party Representative Committee - APRC - which came up with these Proposals. These are all, Sir, matters of record. I am mentioning these matters to show, Sir, that after the enactment of the Thirteenth Amendment, from the time of the enactment of Thirteenth Amendment until now, steps have been taken by every single President and every single Government to enact the new Constitution which contains proposals in regard to provincial governance that went far beyond the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

Hon. Sumanthiran, Sir, in the course of his speech, has referred to the steps that have been taken by the present Government: the Resolution adopted in 2016; the Constitutional Assembly being set up; the Steering Committee and the Subcommittees being set up; the work they have performed; the Reports they have submitted and the Debates that have taken place on those Reports. We have done all this.

Sir, one might ask the question as to why all the steps taken by the former Governments of President Premadasa, President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and President Mahinda Rajapaksa were not successful. It could probably be said that those governments were not in a position to muster a two-thirds majority. But, we are now in a position in this Parliament with an alliance within the two main Parties, though some Members of the SLFP and the UPFA are presently in the Opposition. We know that their thinking on this question has always been progressive. I can see the Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha looking at me; I am aware personally that, for instance, his thinking on this issue has always been progressive. We may be in a position; we are in a position to muster a two-thirds majority which will enable the enactment of a new Constitution within the framework of an undivided and perpetually indivisible country that will put this problem to an end; that will bring this issue to an end. Give this country the freedom to move forward. That is why, Sir, I think it is fundamental that we also address the question of what needs to be done to ensure that the failures of the former governments do not deter us under the new context in which we are.

There has been substantial consensus built around all the earlier proposals during President Premadasas time, during President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas time and during President Mahinda Rajapaksas time. We are able now in the present Parliament as presently constituted to take this process forward.

Sir, our country has no future unless we have a new Constitution which would end the conflict that has arisen

1649 1650

[ ]

2018 06

in this country as a result of the national question. In fact, in the last few days in Parliament, over a speech made by a State Minister, there has been a lot of agitation. Understandably, why is all this happening? All this is happening because there is no final resolution of the conflict and because we have not been able to frame a Constitution, which all of us can accept while every opportunity has existed to frame such a Constitution.

The late Hon. Bandaranaike, as I said Sir, in 1926 when he returned from Oxford, almost a century ago, suggested arrangements that could keep this country as a united, undivided country. That is what he wanted. He remained committed to that position, Sir, and he was the first Sinhalese leader who entered into a pact with a Tamil Leader, my Leader, the late Hon. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam, in order to give this country regional autonomy. The late Hon. Bandaranaike was the first Sinhalese leader who did that. Nobody else was able to do that. Today, I see that the late Hon. Bandaranaike's Party, the Party which he founded, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party is sought to be dispensed with and there is coming into existence a new political party called the Pohottuwa - the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna - which is said to be comprising of - I am not saying, comprising of I am saying, said to be comprising of - even some senior members of the SLFP. I want to raise a question in Parliament and raise it before the whole country as to how it can ever be possible for anyone to dispense with the Party founded by the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in the 50s when he resigned from the then UNP Government and crossed over to the Opposition. It was a Party which he led, a Party through which he governed, a Party through which several of his successors governed in this country; how that Party can be abandoned in favour of the new Party that came into existence just a couple of months ago?

What I think, Sir, is that Provincial Council Elections must be held. They are important, they cannot be delayed and they must be held early. But, before the Provincial Council Elections are held, to make provincial autonomy meaningful, something that will effectively give power to people at the provincial level, the new Constitution that we are proposing must be enacted addressing primarily the main issues referred to by the Mover of the this Adjournment Motion, the national question, provincial governance, provincial or regional autonomy, Executive Presidency and the new electoral reform process.

This proposed Constitution must be brought to Parliament and enacted by Parliament before the Provincial Council Elections are held. I find the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena looking at me and listening to me very carefully. I am sure he is in agreement with me that we must bring a Constitution before the Provincial Council Elections are held without delaying the Provincial Council Elections and the Constitution must be passed giving the provinces real power, substantial power, as the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa said, "maximum possible devolution". People must be able to determine their destiny in the areas in which they live and we must adopt models of devolution that prevail in the other parts of the world. That I think, Sir, must happen even before the Provincial Council Elections are held.

So, my submission would be, Sir, that while I am in total agreement with this Motion, that democracy must be restored in the provinces and there must be early Provincial Council Elections and this tendency to give step-motherly treatment to provinces is unacceptable. I would also urge that the only way in which that can be ensured is by introducing the new Constitution that gives the provinces substantial power and ensures that elections are held in due time and that the people in the provinces as the beneficiaries of such power are able to govern themselves in the areas in which they live. Thank you, Sir.

[1.30 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I must first congratulate you as this is the first time I am addressing this august Assembly while you are in the Chair after having assumed office in this exalted place as its Deputy Speaker. Let me wish you all the very best in carrying out your functions of looking after the affairs of this House.

Having said that, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we are debating today the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Sumanthiran relating to the Provincial Councils Election System that we have introduced recently and we are caught up in a dilemma as to proper implementation of that system since it is in a state of limbo having not presented the Delimitation Committee Report. Though having presented it in March, we are now well passed the time frame within which this particular Report should have been discussed and passed.

Having said that, Mr. Deputy Speaker, in our country ever since the adult franchise was introduced, we have been having different systems of elections at different periods of times. But, subsequently, of late, we have now come to a position where virtually the country has become a veritable laboratory for testing out election systems. None of these tests have become positive for the reason that we cannot address the concerns of different sections of the people, different communities, and there are complaints about the features of whatever system we introduce. But, of late, the system that we introduced, even in the process, I have pointed out that it was introduced very surreptitiously without even the majority of the Members knowing as to what they were going to

1659 1660

do. All of a sudden, in the pretext of introducing some amendments which were originally in the Order Paper relating to women representation, an entire new system of election was stealthily and surreptitiously introduced to the House. I was one of those people, a Party Leader, who had taken strong objections to the process in which that Provincial Council Elections Law was brought to the House and introduced. We made several protests and having got some assurances from the Prime Minister that we agreed to look at all the concerns that the minority communities have, particularly the dispersed communities like the upcountry Tamils and the Muslims who had got very serious issues pertaining to the new system, they agreed even to convert the proportion of First-Past-the-Post Electorates to that of the Proportional Representation Seats; the amended 60:40 proportion was to be amended further to 50:50.

Having observed what happened in the Local Government Elections under the new system on the 10th of February, it became very clear to most of us that the new system - though was meant to get rid of a variety of negative features - it further aggravated the existing situation. For instance, as far as the amount of money spent on territorial constituency, a ward is concerned, we expected, if we got rid of the preferential voting system, the tendency for giving inducements to voters would be reduced. But, what we observed was, the tendency to induce voters became much easier. It was within a limited territorial ward, people started doling out money and various other inducements to buy votes.

This is what we observed. And the Election Commission was quite aware that even religious places of worship such as mosques, Buddhist temples, Hindu temples and churches became places where you could do political activities. There were some specific instances where we even took up objections with the Election Commission and they sent special observers. There were several letters exchanged between the Returning Officers in that area to prevent such abuse taking place. But the electoral abuse was increased in many folds despite the fact that these were to be addressed through the new system.

Now, looking at this Delimitation Committee Report, I must point out that we have only got Volume I of the Delimitation Committee Report that has been tabled. There is a further volume which contains representations made by various different organizations in every district. We are not furnished with that second volume for us to examine whether sufficient attention has been paid by the Delimitation Committee to the observations and memoranda submitted by different organizations at district level. This includes not only political parties but also civil society organizations and individuals. This had to be placed before the House for us to have a complete discussion. But in any event, this is only an exercise in hindsight the relevant period within which this should be debated had passed and now almost five months have lapsed since the presentation of the Delimitation Committee Report. That is one matter.

Then, the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Act, No. 17 of 2017 proposes to consider multi-member electorates in demarcation. The Committee deliberately turned down all the proposals for multi-member electorates made by us in many places such as Akkaraipattu, Pottuvil, Mawanella, Deltota, Hewaheta, Galle and Kuliyapitiya. For these areas, we made very valid presentations to create multi-member electorates to accommodate minority representation in those areas. Those were turned down without giving sufficient reasons.

Then, the criteria defined to demarcate the electorates by the Delimitation Commission were very unrealistic and fundamentally wrong. For instance, population range for an electorate was determined very arbitrarily. Some criteria for majority and the minorities living in geographically scattered areas had been determined without sufficient concern for the need to create smaller electorates or to ensure multi-member constituencies are created. Also, they have rejected some proposals saying that we have no mandate to divide a historical area into two electorates. For instance in Polonnaruwa, we made a very, very strong representation in order to have at least one member from the Muslim community elected from the Lankapura area and from certain adjoining areas dividing certain Grama Niladhari Divisions. That was even turned down. Up to date, we have continuously been having certain members elected.

We have today a document that the Hon. Speaker has circulated to all the Members of Parliament which has been received from the Chairman of the Delimitation Commission which very clearly enunciates what type of injustice will be done to smaller communities. I can refer to the Muslim community here. The Chairman of the Delimitation Commission in his letter very clearly lays out a table in the very first page. At the last Provincial Council Election, the number of members returned to each Provincial Council on behalf of the Muslim community was 43. But in the proposed 50 per cent electorates in the new system, they have been able to demarcate only 13 electorates in the entire country, whereas we have had 43 members in all the Provincial Councils in the previous election. If you add further 50 per cent, it will become 26 members. That is far below the 43 members we have had in the earlier system. This has seriously done injustice when you look at the Muslim communitys interests alone.

Then, if you look at the up-country Tamils too this issue will arise. Of course, they have not divided the up-country Tamils separately. They have not shown it separately, perhaps for the reason that they have put them into the same category as Tamils and have given a table for us to look at to see how the representation will get affected. It has already got affected by this delimitation that has already been done.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, you have only one more minute.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I have two other Members who will be speaking on behalf of my Party somewhere down the line. I will take their time as well.

We suspect that whether the Committee works on a fixed agenda. Demarcation was done prior to public announcement. That is how we see what has happened here. They have had a particular mindset with which they have approached this issue, because only a limited period was available. Such an exercise will have to take several months to complete. But since they were forced to complete it within a particular period of time, they ignored a variety of different, very valid and justifiable representations that have been made on behalf of different communities. Those representations have arbitrarily been turned down by the Commission. It failed to accommodate very reasonable appeals of political parties, civil society organizations and individuals.

The Committee divided and negated the appeals and proposals of renowned scholar and a Muslim representative Prof. Hasbullah who was there as a Member of the Commission. He too was talking to us in a very dejected mindset saying that his appeals fell on deaf ears. Of course, he may not admit it in public but this is something that he shared with us whenever we had discussions with him on this issue.

Therefore, from the Report the Chairman himself has sent to the Hon. Speaker it is very evident and very obvious for all of us to see the way in which they have advised themselves to do this Report and how the impact of this is going to affect different communities. This is quite apparent for all of us to see. To convince the Muslim community to accept this Report is impossible as far as we are concerned.

Therefore, what we are asking is that we totally ignore this new system and get back to the old system. I must also very clearly say here there are a variety of parties which are attempting to continue to tinker with this new system, refine it further in order to appease various different sections and hold elections thereafter. The purpose there I must say very clearly - , , , , . . , . , . .

[2.13p.m.] ( , ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Minister of Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on the Adjournment Motion dealing with Provincial Councils and their Electoral System.

Firstly, I would like to state in this House that the Provincial Councils Elections cannot be delayed at any cost. Since the Hon. Anura Dissanayake is leaving the House, I would like to mention something before he goes.

Political parties should think of the country first before they think of their pound of flesh. I am very thankful to the Hon. Member - I know that the PR System would be more beneficial to the JVP than a Mixed System - for realizing the consequences the country had faced as a result of the Preferential Vote System.

The responsibility of holding the Provincial Councils Elections does not lie only with the Government, but with the entire 225 Members. Normally, being the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government, the finger would be pointed at me. But, as you all know, my function was to table the Delimitation Committee Report and I did it within the time.

Today, we are debating, not the Provincial Councils Electoral System, but the Delimitation Committee Report. I state with responsibility that the Delimitation Committee appointed should take the total responsibility with regard to this mess. I wrote to the Delimitation Committee requesting that before the Report was handed over to me that an All Party Conference be called, that all Parties be consulted and consequent to that, the Report be tabled to be gazetted. Sir, I table* that letter written by me to Mr. K Thavalingam, Chairman of the Delimitation Committee and also the Report of the Delimitation Committee.

, , . . ? . , . . ; . It affects the franchise of the people. As regards to the Local Government Elections, I would like to state this. . 75 , 25 . 25 23 . . , , . , . , . , . .
