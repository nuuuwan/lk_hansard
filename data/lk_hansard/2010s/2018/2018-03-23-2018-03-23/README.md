asked Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade:

(a) Will he inform this House - (i) the actions taken to upgrade the export processing zones as per Proposal No. 200 of the 2016 Budget; (ii) the progress of the export processing zones which are operating in our country at present; (iii) whether the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka has intervened in commencing new export processing zones; (iv) the performance of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka during the period from the year 2000 up to 2016; and (v) the Directors of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka?

(b) If not, why?

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Hon. Speaker, the Answer is as follows:

(a) (i) The 2016 Budget Speech and the subsequent Proposal made in the 2017 Budget proposed to establish private sector managed export processing zones with a view to improving Sri Lankas competitiveness in attracting more FDIs. While managing 14 zones, it is prudent for the BOI to explore new models of highly performing zones with greater efficiency. In the 2017 Budget, Rs. 500 million was allocated to initiate infrastructure for establishment of a new EPZ with Public-Private Partnership. Initial steps have been taken to develop an Industrial Park at Millaniya in the Bandaragama Electorate in the Kalutara District with an experienced overseas zone developer, Rojana Industrial Park Public Company Limited from Thailand, a company engaged in the development of privately operated parks and zones. They operate about six or seven zones in Thailand. The necessary infrastructure such as electricity, water, access roads et cetera, up to the boundary of

the zone, will be provided by the Government. The Ceylon Electricity Board - CEB - the Road Development Authority - RDA- and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board - NWS&DB - have already commenced development of infrastructure facilities and Rs. 336.7 million has been incurred in 2017. The 2018 Budget allocated a further Rs. 2,900 million for that Project.

Further, similar support to be extended to the proposed Industrial Zones in Bingiriya and Charley Mount Estate in Weligama. But the zone development and management models are yet to be finalized and a suitable investor has to be identified. The BOI, with the relevant line agencies and the newly established PPP - Public-Private Partnership - Unit of the Ministry of Finance collaborates in facilitating such ventures.

(ii) After commencing the Katunayake Export

Processing Zone under the purview of Greater Colombo Economic Commission in 1978, 11 Export Processing Zones - EPZs- and 3 Industrial Parks -IPs- have been established. Export Processing Zones are located at Katunayake, Biyagama, Koggala, Horana, Seethawaka, Mawathagama, Polgahawela, Mirigama, Wathupitiwala, Mirijjawila and Wagawatta. Industrial Parks are located at Malwatta, Pallekele and Wagawatta.

As at 31st December 2017, there are 265 commercially operated industries within 14 Export Processing Zones - EPZs- and Industrial Parks - IPs - ruling under the purview of BOI and 137,868 persons are employed within these EPZs/IPs. As compared to the last few years, overall employment in these 14 Zones has progressively improved. The total land extent available in the 14 Zones is 3,641 acres, out of which 2,013 acres, about 55 per cent, have been allocated as industrial lands. Out of the total industrial land extent, 1,600 acres which represents 80 per cent has been utilized for industrial purposes.

The major industries in operation are garments and textile, gloves, footwear, electronic equipment, gems and jewellery, pharmaceutical products, tobacco products, printing industries, textile accessories and food processing. During the year 2016, total export value generated through Export Processing Zones amounted to US Dollars 2,658 million. The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka has spent Rs.344 million for infrastructure development in commercially operated Export Processing Zones in 2017.

(iii) Yes.

(iv) I table * Attachment 1.

If you want the figure for the year 2017 which is not here, it is US Dollars 1.7 billion from the FDIs. - [Interruption.] No, No. Money received. Total FDI received is US Dollars 1.7 billion, and in the non BOI sector, I am told there is another US Dollars 200 million. The Central Bank is finalizing the figures.

[11.41a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Finance and Mass Media) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees. I am presenting for approval of Parliament five Gazette Notifications issued under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, No. 13 of 1989.

925 926

Sir, actually, I would like to start off my speech with some words on the new tax policy of the Government. In fact, the Governments tax policy has focused on some key principles and objectives over the last few years.

First of them is to increase the share of Government revenue which had declined to around 11 per cent of GDP by 2014. This would enable us to better meet our debt repayments without compromising the Government expenditure on health, education and so on.

Second one is to increase the share of direct taxes. We have one of the lowest direct taxes in the world, which is at 18 per cent and our objective is to increase it to 40 per cent to create a more progressive and relevant tax structure. The current 82 per cent share of indirect taxes results in the burden of taxes being disproportionately borne by the poorest sections of society and I think we need to rectify this situation as quickly as possible.

Third one is to broaden the tax base to bring in the informal economy into the formal sector. This would create a level playing field by ensuring that everyone complies and shares the burden of taxes.

Last one is to reduce discretion in tax policy and shift to a simple, transparent and rules-based framework. This is required to minimize potential corruption and reduce tax leakages due to ad hoc exemptions.

In fact, the new Inland Revenue Act, which will come into operation on the 1st of April in a few weeks time, actually ensures that tax holidays and tax exemptions can no longer be given under the whims and fancies of the Minister of Finance. Now, we have created an actual level playing field and a rules-based framework for such decisions.

Since I took over as the Minister of Finance last May, we have adopted these principles in the major tax-related legislation that has been passed in this House and also in the Budget 2018.

The new Inland Revenue Act, which comes into force on the 1st of April, as I said, will go a long way towards increasing the share of direct taxes. This will enable the Government to achieve its revenue targets in an equitable manner by ensuring the higher income earners absorb a larger share of the tax burden.

In the past, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, Sri Lankas taxation policy has been characterized by ad hoc, subjective taxes, as I said, on the whims of politicians and other senior officials. This has resulted in a plethora of exemptions and concessions often without any rational basis. The cost of these exemptions has been estimated at almost 1.6 per cent of GDP in 2015.

One of the key objectives of our tax policy is to rationalize these exemptions, thus broad basing the tax collection.

We are also beginning to see the results of technological interventions in the tax collection process. RAMIS has been in operation since January of last year and the impact on revenue has already been positive. Once key Government institutions are fully integrated with RAMIS in the coming months, the positive impact on revenue will even be greater. The collective impact of these measures will enable the reduction in tax rates once there is an improvement in collection.

That said, it would be imprudent to reduce tax rates prematurely. We have in the last 18 months begun to see an improvement in Government revenue. In 2017, the Government achieved a primary surplus in the Budget for the first time since the 1950s. This fiscal consolidation process has enabled the Government to regain the confidence of markets and stabilize economy. Market interest rates have begun to decline with the Prime Lending Rate falling by 144 basis points since July of last year, which will pave the way for investment-led growth.

A premature interruption of the fiscal consolidation process will destabilize the economy and erase the gains that have been made. Whilst being committed to fiscal consolidation, the Government has always found room to ease taxes on essential items to ensure public welfare. When the drought resulted in an increase in food prices last year, we reduced taxes on a number of food and related items to provide relief to the public as a people friendly-Government.

Once the Inland Revenue Act begins to show results and direct tax collection improves, we will be able to make meaningful downward adjustments to the rate of indirect taxes such as VAT on a permanent basis. But this must be done at the correct time in a responsible manner.

Let us remind ourselves why we are in this position today. Why do we need to raise Government revenue? Why do we need to focus on improving our tax collection? In the years 2019-2022, we will face external debt repayments of approximately US Dollars 15 billion. This is an unprecedented burden that this Government has inherited.

The previous regime spent increasing amounts of money on projects with little or no economic return, including the Mattala Airport and the Hambantota Port. Whilst expenditure increased, the government revenue

collapsed. In 2006, government revenue as a percentage of the GDP was 17.6 per cent and in 2014, eight years after the last administration took over, it had declined to 11.6 per cent of the GDP. The resultant deficit was financed increasingly by commercial foreign debt.

However, whilst external liabilities increased, our foreign earnings were on the decline. In the year 2005, when the last regime took office, exports as a percentage of GDP was 26 per cent. But, in 2014, nine years later, it had declined to just 13 per cent of the GDP; it had declined from 26 to 13 per cent of the GDP. In fact, we inherited an economy in shambles, a flawed economic model that was bound to fail.

Since January 2015, we have begun the process of reversing this flawed model. Our focus has been on shifting the economy to an outward-oriented model in order to create external inflows to meet our external financial obligations.

In 2017, export earnings grew by 10.2 per cent to reach US Dollars 11.4 billion which is a record by itself. FDI reached a record level of US Dollars 1.7 billion. These trends will only increase as we continue the economic programme that this Government has put in place.

Let us also remind ourselves that we have made these gains in macroeconomic stabilization whilst ensuring continued focus on Government expenditure and improving the quality of that expenditure. The Governments expenditure on education, higher education, and skills development has increased from 1.9 per cent in 2014 to 2.4 per cent in 2017. 201 1. , 2. .

Similarly, expenditure on public health has increased from 1.39 per cent in 2014 to 1.74 per cent in 2017. 1.39, 201 1.7 . , , . . . We will continue to invest in our people and invest in our future.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would also like to say very quickly a few words on the vehicle tax reform. This Government came into power in 2015 on a platform of good governance and eradication of corruption. One of the hotbeds of corruption in Sri Lanka has been in the importation of motor vehicles. Without painting all players with the same brush, I believe everyone will accept that there has been rampant corruption in this industry. This has resulted in significant revenue leakage and a highly distorted, uneven playing field.

The previous tax structure left room for under-invoicing and under-valuation to avoid tax payment, and the discretion in the hands of officials compounded this problem of corruption.

It is for this reason that in the 2018 Budget, I proposed a comprehensive reform in vehicle tax policy. A new excise duty policy was introduced where the tax is based only on the engine capacity of the vehicle. This eliminates all room for discretion and treats all vehicles on the same basis. I believe this was a very important revolutionary step forward in order to minimize the leakage.

The duty brackets are based on a transparent, objective formula. This is a shift from the distortions which were characteristic of previous taxation structures.

Naturally, in the process of shifting from an ad-hoc tax structure to one based on a rules-based criteria, there will be large initial price displacements. In some cases, the price of vehicles that were previously given an unfair advantage have increased, and those vehicles which were discriminated against have seen price declines.

On aggregate the tax changes are expected to be revenue positive as the opportunity for price undervaluation declines significantly.

In addition to the primary changes in the tax structure, several other important vehicle import policy changes were proposed:

i) The duty on electric vehicles was revised downwards as an environmentally-friendly policy measure as part of the Blue and Green Budget.

ii) Duty benefits are provided to hybrid vehicles over regular internal combustion engine vehicles.

iii) Whilst the prices of some of the lower-end vehicles have declined with the new tax structure, measures are being taken to ensure that only good quality vehicles are now imported into Sri Lanka. Accordingly, new vehicle safety regulations will be mandatory, and minimum emission standards have been imposed for vehicle imports.

iv) The new tax structure may also result in some of the higher-end vehicles seeing tax reductions, to compensate for which, a luxury tax will be imposed on the Super Luxury vehicles category.

Sir, whilst we have made a conscious effort to minimize the burden of indirect taxes on the public, there are certain sectors where taxes have been imposed in line with government policy. For example, in the 2018 Budget a tax on sugar-added beverages was proposed.

Sri Lanka has high and increasing incidence of diabetes and other non-communicable diseases. Childhood obesity is also emerging as a new health risk. The Ministry of Health, The Minister of Health and the International Research has identified the causative linkages between excessive sugar consumption and certain non-communicable diseases. As excess sugar consumption is a clear negative externality, the argument for a tax is well justified.

Similarly, the negative environmental implications of plastic products have also been well established. Thus we have in the 2018 Budget imposed a tax of Rs.10 per kilogram on the raw material which is plastic resin.

929 930

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, in conclusion I would like to say, it is clear that we have made solid progress in stabilization of the economy in the last three years:

Government finances had its first primary surplus, as I said earlier, in decades; exports and FDI hit record levels in 2017; foreign reserves have reached comfortable levels of US Dollars 7.9 billion and national inflation in February 2018 was down to 3.2 per cent with monthly prices declining in January and February.

The results of this stabilization have not translated into GDP growth levels yet because of the climatic disruptions we have faced. I am confident that the benefits of the policy measures we have put in place will materialize in the near term.

There continues to be significant investor interest in Sri Lanka, with a number of projects ear marked by the BOI for 2018. We will soon be launching the Enterprise Sri Lanka Programme which will give a kick start to entrepreneurs and small business which forms the backbone of the Sri Lankan economy. This will translate into more jobs, higher earnings, and improved quality of life of all Sri Lankans on a sustainable basis.

The government will continue to invest in health, education, public infrastructure, housing and social welfare transfers for the needy.

We will not however engage in wasteful expenditure on vanity projects which end up as white elephants in the guise of development.

We are in the process of creating an economy which empowers Sri Lankan entrepreneurs, Sri Lankan SMEs and Sri Lankan youth to take the future into their own hands. We are creating an economy based on principles of equality, fairness and justice. These are the principles that brought this Government to power, and these are the principles we must strive to take forward in the face of all challenges.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you, Hon. Minister. Next, the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti.

Sri Lanka made public health history in 2016 by achieving significant health milestones and received international accolades for its achievements in improving public health. , 115.

, The countrys achievements are a testament to robust leadership, unwavering political commitment and strong partnerships dedicated to ensuring healthy lives and positive well-being for all.

, There is a sufficient political commitment for NCD prevention and control, -NCD , Non Communicable Diseases- efforts to address these diseases have been hampered by a lack of prioritization, monitoring and evaluation. A key milestone was reached in April, 2016 with the launch of the National Multisectoral Action Plan for Prevention and Control of NCDs (2016-2020).

, In addition, Sri Lanka became the first country in the South-East Region to establish an NCD Alliance - a key recommendation of the Global NCD Action Plan. The Alliance, launched by the Minister of Health, His Excellency (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, during the WHO Regional Committee session in September, 2016, consists of major NCD-affiliated organizations,...

119 , The Government also banned smokeless tobacco products and is now planning to require plain packaging of tobacco, ban the sales of loose cigarettes, and employ a licensing system for tobacco sales. . .

Universal Health Coverage Study Series No. 38 , Overall, Sri Lankas health system is pro-poor, and except for the convenience factor it does not appear to be the case that 'health

services for the poor are poor health services,' a claim sometimes voiced about other countries. A global study using benefit incidence analysis found Sri Lankas government health system to be the second most pro-poor out of 66 countries studied. 66 . , .

, Fortunately, Sri Lanka has taken a proactive approach to tobacco control, most notably through high cigarette taxes, and therefore does not face a tobacco-related disease burden as large as many middle-income countries. . , .

, 2016 , "Looking Forward" . , Steadfast political commitment helped the country achieve major gains in 2016. Sri Lanka withstood pressure from the food and beverage industry and introduced traffic light labelling on sugary food and drinks. Tobacco taxation was increased significantly despite resistance.

There will be many challenges ahead as the country gears towards plain packaging, introducing stricter tobacco and alcohol control legislation and extension of the traffic light labelling system. WHO will continue to support the country in its mission to resist industry interference and address the growing challenge of NCDs.

Sri Lanka is one of six countries for targeted WHO support on NCD prevention and control from al three levels of the organization - WHO headquarters, WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia and WHO Country Office for Sri Lanka. This will provide a major boost to the countrys efforts to reduce the NCD burden. .

He is a fugitive today and we do not know where he is.

The Prime Minister is already a suspect and he is got to face charges in this House about his involvement in the bond scam.

Whereupon THE HON. MUJIBUR RAHUMAN left the Chair and THE HON. LUCKY JAYAWARDANA took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . [5.02p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Mr. Presiding Member, let me at the outset thank you for giving me 12 minutes, I believe, to speak on the subjects under discussion. But before I start, I must say a word about the previous speaker, the Hon. State Minister of Finance, who gave a rather vociferous speech, in which he touched on a range of subjects. I think after he has taken over the Ministry, maybe, through the influence of his senior Minister, he has learnt to sling mud at people, which is very unbecoming of him. If he sticks to the matters at hand, I think we all can have a better Debate. If the Hon. State Minister is so concerned about crime and also corruption, maybe on the 04th of next month, he should put his vote where his words are - vote against corruption to support the No-Confidence Motion.

Sir, I do not want to speak any more regarding the same, but I would like to thank you for allocating 12 minutes time of the House to express my ideas on the Active Liability Management Bill, the Determination under the Constitution to revise the Salaries and Allowances of the Chief Justice and the Judges of the Superior Courts and the five Orders under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act. But, due to time constraints, I will comment mainly on the Active Liability Management Bill.

The Active Liability Management Bill has been contested in the Supreme Court and the Hon. Speaker read out the Supreme Court Determination, which stated that the Bill indeed is in line with the Constitution. Sir, irrespective of the legality of the Bill, without a doubt, we all can agree that this is a very powerful Bill which

1009 1010

allows the Hon. Minister to raise up to 10 per cent of the countrys total outstanding debt through Parliament. However, this can only be used for refinancing and prefinancing of existing loans.

Sir, this Bill also highlights the dire straits our economy is in. If an individual was in this situation, then the simple logic would be to earn more, spend less and try to pay more of his loans. Here again, the Government, without looking at meaningful fiscal consolidation, is adopting a philosophical change in its thinking of borrowing more in order to pay more. Sir, the Editorial of The Island newspaper has made an analogy, comparing this situation to giving a whimsical spendthrift who is neck-deep in debt a high limit credit card with no conditions.

Sir, I do believe that a country such as Sri Lanka, given the dire straits to which this Government has brought its economy, will do well to operate an Active Liability Management Bill. It was only in last November that the Hon. Prime Minister, in this Chamber, went on to read out the Economic Policy Statement of the Government. He pointed out that in 2016, 80 per cent of the Governments total revenue was spent for debt servicing. He further went on to tell this House that US Dollars 2.3 billion worth of Sri Lanka Development Bonds will mature this year and 30 per cent of the Treasury Bonds will mature next year. Further, US Dollars 1.5 billion in international Sovereign Bonds will mature in 2019. All in all, Sir, we have to pay US Dollars 2.3 billion in foreign loans this year, US Dollars 3.7 billion worth of foreign loans in 2019 and US Dollars 3.2 billion in 2020.

It has been talked about rather inaccurately by the Government Members who spoke before me about the naya ugula or the debt trap that was created during the Rajapaksa Regime. Sir, nothing could be more further from the truth. The Mahinda Rajapaksa Government, which inherited a debt-to-GDP ratio of 102 per cent, was able to bring that ratio down to 71 per cent when they handed over power to the Y ahapalana Government in 2015. The previous Government, through proper debt management strategies, ensured that none of the bullet loan payments overlapped one another. It should be noted that the governments unlike individuals could carry on with a deficit over a long period of time. I believe that during the 19th Century, the Untied States had a deficit for almost 100 years.

The United Kingdom has had a budget surplus only eight times during the last six decades. We ourselves have had a budget surplus only twice since Independence. So, it is not actually the budget deficit that matters, but more importantly how we manage it and how much it costs to finance our debt. So, in this regard, the Y ahapalana Rajaya has managed to muck things up to glorious new levels. The issuing of Short-Term Sri Lankan Development Bonds with overlapping maturity periods has resulted in the Y ahapalana Government borrowing over Rs. 3 trillion in the first three years in power.

The ill-advised policies of defending the rupee in 2015 - I think the Hon. Ravi Karunanyake tried to defend it today also - which depleted the Foreign Reserves from US Dollars 3.4 billion to US Dollars 1.7 billion, coupled with stopping of all Chinese constructions due to politically-motivated rationale, the now infamous bond scam, the resultant dip in investor sentiments, the salary increase of the public sector employees and the simultaneous reduction in fuel tariffs are all major factors for the current plight of our economy. So, in any event - I am not going to indulge too much in the blame game - what is more important is how we are going to get out of this impending situation.

In this regard, I do think an active liability management policy is a necessity. The objective of the Active Liability Management Act, as stated, is to manage public debt to ensure the financing needs and payment obligations of the Government are met at the lowest possible cost. This Bill also provides tremendous power to an individual, in this case, the Minister, who is empowered to decide on the quantum of the loan and the mode of raising such a loan. Clause 4 of the Bill somewhat checks this power stating that the Hon. Minister can obtain loans only with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers and according to the Section 114 of the Monetary Law Act. The Monetary Law Act states that the advice of the Monetary Board has to be first obtained upon the monetary implications of the proposed loan or issue. Therefore, I do think, Sir, as the quantum of these loans can be massive, that direct reference should be made in the Act itself on the advice of the Monetary Board. It is best, Sir, if these matters are handled through the Public Debt Department.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Actually, you are mistaken, Hon. Member, because it is governed by the Monetary Law Act. So, we do not have to restate in this Bill what is in the Monetary Law Act.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) I am just stating what was discussed during the Committee Stage of this Bill in the morning. But, I believe, because the quantum of the monies is huge in this case, that it would be better-

1011 1012

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Member, it is specifically stated that - ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) It is specifically stated in Section 114 of the Monetary Law Act.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) That is right. So, the Monetary Law Act specifies how to go about it; it is there.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) The Hon. State Minister will agree with me that when the indemnity issue was spoken about this morning, the indemnity issue was put again in the Bill because two or three areas were not covered. So, it is just my thought that it will be better if this is included directly in the Bill, because the quantum of monies we are talking about is quite high.

Sir, this Bill enables Parliament to raise, through a Resolution, up to 10 per cent of the total outstanding debt. Our total outstanding debt is around Rs. 10 trillion. Up to Rs. 1 trillion can be raised by the Prime Minister using a mechanism to his liking. We all know what happened the last time the Hon. Prime Minister decided to use his expert knowledge on finance and changed the bidding mechanism of the bonds issued from direct placement or auction method to a 100 per cent auction method. So, it is best, through our experience in the recent past, that we put proper checks and balances to this Bill so that no collusion can take place. Sir, even after the horrendous bond scam and its impact on this struggling economy, have we not learnt any lessons?

Hon. Presiding Member, for the purpose of this Bill, Minister is defined as the Minister assigned the subject of Finance and it has also been the tradition all over the world that the Central Bank comes under the Minister of Finance. It was this Government, for the first time in the history of Sri Lanka, which removed the Central Bank and placed it under the Prime Minister. Even after the much-anticipated Cabinet reshuffle early this month, that anomaly was not corrected.

Clause 4 (2) of the Bill states, I quote:

The decision made by the Minister under subsection (1) shall be communicated in writing to the Registrar through the Minister assigned the subject of Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

What are we getting at over here? Sir, without addressing the anomaly that has been made in the first place by putting back the Central Bank under the Ministry of Finance, this Clause has been created in order for the Prime Minister to further interfere in the issuance of bonds.

Do we really want this? Is this not another mechanism where the Prime Minister can find a quick and fast method to enrich his school buddies at the expense of the country?

I have no problem with the Prime Minister except for his track record. He signed a so-called peace accord with the LTTE, recognizing them as a self-governing authority for the North and the East, for a period of 10 years. The Prime Minister neither informed the Cabinet nor did he seek the approval of this House.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Balasuriya, do not talk nonsense. ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) He signed an agreement for ten years. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Do not say that. The Hon. Prime Minister never signed an agreement. No one ever signed an agreement for a self-governing authority for ten years. You would have been sleeping or you would have been on something else.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) In which country are you living in? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I am living in this country. ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Very good. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) You show me the agreement where the Government of Sri Lanka signed for a self-governing authority for ten years. Do not talk nonsense.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) You are taking my time. I will show it to you afterwards.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Do not come to this House and tell untruths. It is not proper. I did not expect that from a person like you.

1013 1014

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Is it not true that the Prime Minister signed an agreement without the approval of this House or the Cabinet? The point is, he signed it without the approval of this House or the Cabinet. You are missing the point. MoU sign . . [ . The Prime Minister neither informed the Cabinet nor did he seek the approval of this House. In any other country it would be treason and he would be hung.

The next time he came to power - alas illegally with only 42 MPs - within less than two months, the Prime Minister colluded with his inner cabinet and his Royal College buddies and committed the biggest financial fraud the world has ever seen perpetuated by a Prime Minister on his own people. Now this House wants to give this person the power to raise 10 per cent of our national debt or roughly Rs. one trillion, in any manner he sees best. Has this Parliament really lost its head or have we become a nation of lotus-eaters immune to corruption where Members just raise their hands predetermined by the political affiliations and not on the merits of the acts concerned. In any event, even if it was not the Prime Minister at the helm of the Central Bank, I am sure we can all agree that more sections need to be included to bring proper checks and balances.

There are also other concerns in this Bill. Section 9 of this Bill provides immunity to the members of the Monetary Board, officers of the Central Bank and employees of the Ministry from any criminal or civil proceedings.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Give me two more minutes, Sir.

This now has been agreed to be changed including immunity for officials of the Ministry. Section 10 also states that the Minister may make regulations on the advice of the Monetary Board. I think this too has to be more definitive because this does not limit the Prime Minister seeking the advice from his old friends like Arjun Mahendran and Arjuna Aloysius. If the Government is not willing to make the necessary amendments, then we must remind the President that he is indeed the President of this country, and in matters such as this it is better to be proactive and prevent another large scale malpractice taking place at the expense of the country rather than reading it in newspapers after the crime had been committed. If the President had insisted on the removal of Arjun Mahendran after the first bond scam, the second bond scam in 2016 could have been prevented. So even at a latter date, the President as the

head of the Cabinet can insist on amendments. Similarly, in conclusion, I urge this House to take all necessary steps that have to be taken in order to prevent further financial malpractices.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , [. . 5.16 ( ) (The Hon. Thushara Indunil Amarasena) , .
