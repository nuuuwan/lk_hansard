. The Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka has made a special publication titled "Sri Lanka Living Wage: Estate Sector (Tea)" after a survey done, which shows that the present wage structure will not bring the working people of the estates out of this present crisis. . . . . . , .

, . I would like to quote the headline of an article which appeared in "The Island" of 01st September, 2018:

"Education matters : addressing inequities and skills development gaps in Sri Lanka"

. The article states, I quote:

"Poor children, in particular, have limited access to skills development programmes."

. . , .

, . I do not want to propose any amendment to this Bill, but I want to tell the Hon. Minister that he should propose these amendments. , . . . ,

. You referred to the National Building Research Organization and the Disaster Management Centre. But here, you have overlooked the Central Environmental Authority, which is also an important institution. , , ,- .

Then, I would like to refer just to the title of an article by Dr. Ranil Senanayake, who, I guess, is one of the most respected professionals in the field of forestry and has even been recognized in the whole of South America today. This article appeared in "The Island" of 04th September, 2018 under the title - "Forests: Beyond The Wood". , ; . the Central Environmental Authority, which has been ignored, should also play a role. . , . .

It should be cleared by the Attorney Generals Department. It is a very important interpretation we need for both Bills which we are debating today. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon.

( ) (The Hon. Chaminda Wijesiri) , . , . , . . . . . . . . . . , , . , . . . [6.42p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) Hon. Presiding Member, I take pride in bringing these Amendments to the Pradeshiya Sabhas (Amendment) Bill. As you know, the workers in the estate sector of this country are underprivileged. I started my politics from a Party representing the plantation sector. So, I realize the difficulties they have.

When we talk about equality, if you look at health, education, sanitation and housing, you would see that we have a lot to do to the plantation sector. Their contribution towards the national economy should be appreciated. Continuously, the governments have tried to improve their lives, but if you look at the condition of the line room, you would see that it is appalling. Basically, we need to give the opportunity to the plantation worker to live with dignity. So, I believe that these Amendments will help them to live with dignity.

As you know, the local government bodies - Pradeshiya Sabhas - have tried to develop the road network and various infrastructure facilities within the plantation sector. In doing so, as common areas do not come under local governments, some chairmen of those institutions have been sent home for violating the law.

So, Sir, I see this as a very progressive step of this Government and I think this will be a paradigm shift with regard to infrastructure development in the plantation

sector. As you know, so far, only public roads have been developed by local governments, but these Amendments would be a milestone in improving the living conditions of the plantation workers. These Amendments give the opportunity for infrastructure development to take place with regard to title, which was vested with the plantation companies. Now, there is a mechanism to vest the said areas developed back with the local government bodies.

I would be thankful to my Cabinet Colleagues who continuously agitated that I should bring this Bill. So, I think we have collectively brought dignity to the plantation sector. The Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena wanted a certain amendment made to expand the scope and I will concede to that amendment because plantation workers do not mean only those who are working in tea, coconut and rubber plantations. So, wherever there are planation workers in this country, we should see that they live with dignity. Therefore, here, we are following a very inclusive approach. I am also proud to say that during my tenure, I brought in amendments with regard to Pradeshiya Sabhas in the upcountry, which had been agitated for a long time. So, I believe this Government has been very progressive. Since I started my politics from a Party which represents the plantation sector - today, I am here because of the start I had from that Party - I was able to bring that amendment during my tenure. I see some Members of Parliament representing the plantation sector from both sides present here. Therefore, I would like to say that this is a very progressive step and a collective approach. So, we would see that these amendments would give dividends to the plantation sector. Thank you. , . . , . , . Question put, and agreed to. Bill accordingly read a Second time. .: '' .'' --[ ] .
