( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Faiszer Musthapha. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, what is envisaged in Article 157 of the Constitution is that if a Treaty or an Agreement is submitted to Parliament and if it obtains a two-thirds majority, no law in contravention can be passed. So, that is distinct from the position taken by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, because the pith and substance of the Article 157 is that if an Agreement obtains the sanction of two-thirds majority, no written law can be passed in contravention of that, except in the interest of national security. I am only stating what the law states. Therefore, the position that every international Agreement has to be tabled in Parliament is distinct from the Article 157 of the Constitution because Article 157 very clearly states that if a Resolution has been passed obtaining two-thirds majority, no written law could be brought in, in contravention of that Treaty or Agreement, except in the interest of national security. That is distinct from the position taken by the Hon. Member that no Treaty or Agreement can be passed without a two-thirds majority.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Hon. Faizer Musthapha, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Deputy Speaker, may I be permitted to read the Article for the clarity of the House, because there were certain statements made. The original position was this Agreement is in contravention of the law. Now the position taken up is that this Agreement is in contravention of national security. May I be permitted to read this Article to the House for the purpose of clarity so that all the Hon. Members would be satisfied. With your permission, once I read this Article of the Constitution, the position will be made clear because what is stated in this Article has been misinterpreted. There is no requirement for it to be placed in the House, but if it is placed in the House and it obtains two-thirds majority, you cannot bring in- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Bandula Gunawardena, let me read this. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, will you read the Article? ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Yes. The Article 157 of the Constitution states, I quote:

Where Parliament by resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members of Parliament (including those not

1511 1512

2018 24

present) voting in its favour, approves as being essential for the development of the national economy, any Treaty or Agreement between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Government of any foreign State for the promotion and protection of the investments in Sri Lanka of such foreign State, its nationals, or of corporations, companies and other associations incorporated or constituted under its laws, such Treaty or Agreement shall have the force of law in Sri Lanka and otherwise than in the interests of national security no written law shall be enacted or made, and no executive or administrative action shall be taken, in contravention of the provisions of such Treaty or Agreement.

So, the position in this case is that if it has obtained the sanction of the two-thirds majority, no law can be enacted in contravention of that, except in the interest of national security. The question that it has to be tabled in Parliament and it has to obtain two-thirds majority is a different issue. With the position taken by the Hon. Member, the provision of this Article states otherwise.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Udaya Prabhath Gammanpila) ,- ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Udaya Prabhath Gammanpila) , " " . , , 15 . . , ,.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , .

Once the Agreement is approved by a two-thirds majority in Parliament, you cannot bring in a law in contravention of that Agreement. . We have only tabled and discussed it. -[Interruption.] There is no requirement for a two-thirds majority. You can table it. But the difference is, if you table it and get a two-thirds majority, you cannot pass a law in contravention of that Agreement. That is all. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Thank you for the clarification, Hon. Kiriella. -[Interruption.] Order, please! , .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Free Trade Agreements are not something that are signed overnight. These discussions go on for years. Officials of the Department of Commerce, Treasury and everybody gets involved in this and it is a long process. So, in that process, suddenly you cannot say that we have done it in a very secretive manner, all of a sudden keeping the Cabinet in the dark or the House in the dark.

Very clearly, this debate has been going on for a long time and the Opposition is trying to mislead the country by saying as if we have done a very secretive deal. It has never happened like that. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I concede that I tabled this Report in Parliament on the 08th of March, 2018. Consequent to that, the Party Leaders discussed to take it up for Business. Of the laws that are passed, some are directory and some are mandatory. The fact that it was not taken up within a month does not take away the statutory flavour that it can be taken up now. There was a discussion with Party Leaders; there were consistent dialogues headed by the Hon. Prime Minister to see whatever changes could be made. However, that does not preclude Parliament from taking this up today; debating and taking it up for vote.

, . . , because it is directory and not mandatory. The fact that an act which should have been done during a specific time in Parliament has taken place later does not take away the statutory flavour of it that it can be done now. , 08 . 5 . , .

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, I have not violated any provision of the Act, the reason being that I tabled it in Parliament. The Business of Parliament is not decided by me. It is decided by the Party Leaders. But, in any event, the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayakes position that it was not taken up in Parliament within a month and that it cannot be taken up now, I say with great respect, is not in terms of the law. The fact that it was not taken up within a month does not take away the statutory flavour that it can be taken up now. And also very clearly, as the Minister, within 14 days from the receipt of the Report, I have to table it and I have done so. The day-to-day Business of the House is beyond my ambit. So, as the Minister of Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports, I tabled it in the House and it was on the Order Paper. Subsequently, it was decided to take it out of the Order Paper and take it up in Parliament on a different date.

some time back. So, it is being taken up for debate and vote today after having been in hibernation for a while. We had some arguments about the legality of such a matter. I must agree with the Hon. Minister in charge of the subject that the provisions of the law is only directory and not mandatory and therefore the decision for us to take it up today is not a matter for any challenge. Having said that, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we observe that this Delimitation Committees Report, leave alone getting the two-thirds majority vote in the Chamber today, may not even harness the simple majority and might be roundly defeated today going by the discussions we have had across the parties for several days now. If that is going to be the fate of this Delimitation Committees Report, we must examine as to why the Report is coming up for such criticism. It is particularly because the members of the Delimitation Committee have set themselves certain internal criteria which, in my opinion, is wrong and discriminates against minorities. That does not reflect the necessary diversity in the selection of members for Provincial Councils from various electoral districts in the country.

Now, I have, for comment, a variety of different observations that have been made. I must agree that the Committee went around the country, sat in different districts and listened to public representations. They perhaps entertained substantial number of such representations and wherever possible gave hearing for many of those people who have come up with important suggestions. But, having considered all that, in bringing out the Report they have not done justice by many races in this country, particularly the affected communities, Muslims as well as the upcountry Tamils, who live scattered among the majority in different parts of the country. Of course the Tamil community living as a minority in other districts like Ampara, as Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah pointed out, had also suffered immensely because of this Delimitation Committees Report. Now, they appear to have decided not to create any multi-member constituencies. They too have not adopted a method to create constituencies with smaller number of voters in order to create sufficient number of constituencies for certain affected communities. Both those issues have been totally set aside and they have only determined as if minimum of 100,000 votes to be available, 100,000 population should be there to create a single-member constituency and if it is to be a multi-member constituency, they presume that it must have at least 200,000 members. That should not be the criteria on which multi-member constituencies are created. Wherever possible, when there is a particular affected community living in substantial numbers within a geographical space where an electorate is created, if it is necessary for the representation of that community, they have to bring in a criteria that would suit the creation of that constituency.

So, such important postulates have been overlooked and they have, on their own, set up certain internal guidelines for themselves and those guidelines, in my opinion, are based on some statistical straitjacket. I would call it a statistical straitjacket which prevents any flexibility to create the necessary number of

1573 1574

constituencies to enable representation of the affected communities who are living all over the country.

If you take the case of the Muslims, we have a problem in many areas. For instance, the Muslims of Udunuwara in Kandy, despite the fact that they are substantially concentrated in a particular area, have been denied the right. Close to Udunuwara is Gampola. So, they could have joined the Muslims from that area too and created a constituency. Then, a Muslim majority would have been there for a constituency. I am sure the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage would agree that some justice could have been done then. But now, only one constituency has been created in the entire Kandy District. The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella, the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage and all of you know that we have had about five Muslim members continuously being elected to the Central Provincial Council from the Kandy District.

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) Now, it is only one.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, now, it is only one. So, how can it be justified? This is a serious discrepancy.

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) So, resign from the Government.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) This is the fault of the Delimitation Committee. So, I cannot, for that sake, do it. -[Interruption.] But, I am used to resigning from the Government all the time. I had done that twice before. I am perhaps the only single Minister in this Government who had resigned twice before and come to the Opposition over a variety of other issues. -[Interruption.] So, that is not an issue for me.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Take a decision now. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, no. I do not think you need to prompt me to take political decisions. We are intelligent people; we are very intelligent. We also know how opportunistic you can be. Be that as it may, let me make my point because I have limited time. Since it is a Friday, I have to go the mosque as well.

So, Sir, there are issues concerning the creation of constituencies in many areas. For instance, the Muslims living in the Anuradhapura District are almost 80,000 in number. They could have created a constituency somewhere around the Horowpothana area. Then, there is also Kuliyapitiya East in the Kurunegala District. Even in Mawanella, where the Hon. Kabir Hashim comes from, they could have created a constituency to enable the Muslims of the Kegalle District to have some representation. Similarly, in the Gampaha District also, there could have been a possibility of creating at least an electorate with a smaller number of voters so that they could enable a Muslim member to be returned or to create a multi-member constituency. Instead of doing all that, they have simply gone on a certain statistical straitjacket in order to decide on the creation of these constituencies. This has very seriously affected the representation of Muslims.

Now, I would like to produce a letter that had been written by the Chairman of the Delimitation Commission, Mr. K. Thavalingam, a very distinguished member of the Public Service in the past. He had written a letter to the Hon. Speaker as the Chairman of the Constitutional Council on the 02nd of July, 2018. This was made available to all the Members of Parliament. In that, he very clearly says, I quote:

1. No. of members in the last Provincial Coucil

Table-1 shows the number of members in the last Provincial Councils Election by province based on ethnic groups. It shows that there were 348 Sinhalese members, 64 Tamil Members and 43 Muslim members, including bonus seats. It revealed that Muslim and Tamil members were elected with the support of a political party as well as their community.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Please wind up, Hon. Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, there is one other Hon. Member, the Hon. Muhammad Ibrahim Muhammad Mansoor, from my Party to speak. I will take his time as well.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) All right. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) According to Table -1 in Mr. Thavalingam's letter, in the last Provincial Councils Election, there were 43 Muslim members. But now, according to Table-2 in his letter, under the proposed electorates, they have created only 13 seats for Muslims. So, we are falling short of 30 Muslim members. Even if you have 50 per cent elected on the Proportional Representation System, we will fall short of a large number of seats. So, this type of discrimination can never be endorsed by this House since it is very clear from the letter that the Chairman of the

1575 1576

[ ]

2018 24

Delimitation Commission had written to the Hon. Speaker. Sir, I would like to table* that letter.

Then, I must point out another issue. The determination of the number of members has to be done after every census and this was a provision that was there in the original Act. Unfortunately, somewhere around the mid-90s, they froze that number of seats in order not to increase the number of members. But, then, the number of voters increased. What was originally envisaged was that for every 40,000 voters, there must be one member being declared. That was to be decided by the Commissioner of Elections soon after every census is declared. So, with the new census that had come into being a few years ago in 2011, it should have been mandatory for the creation of more number of seats. If that had happened, at least, there would have been some compensation for the affected communities.

In that regard, I had already written a letter to His Excellency the President dated 07th November, 2017, pointing out this particular issue to be taken up with the Delimitation Commission and for him to take the necessary steps. The caption of that letter was Publishing Fresh Gazette Notification specifying the number of members for each Provincial Council in terms of Section 2 of the Provincial Councils Act, No. 42 of 1987, in accordance with Section 3 (3) (a) of the Provincial Councils Elections Act, No. 2 of 1988. I have in detail very clearly mentioned all the facts in that and the relevant paragraph reads thus, I quote:

The number of members to be elected to each administrative district as stated in the said public notice of the Committee corresponds to the number of members elected to Provincial Councils determined at the time of establishment of Provincial Councils three decades ago.

Thirty years ago, they determined a certain number. Even today, with so many voters having increased, they maintain the same number of members to be declared elected to the Provincial Councils. My letter further states, I quote:

"Therefore, it is clear that the Committee has not taken into consideration the relevant mandatory provisions in the relevant laws with regard to determination of number of members to each provincial council notwithstanding the increase in population since 1987 and the changing socio-political factors".

So, I have urged His Excellency the President to look into this and provide some relief. Even if there was a necessity to amend the law in order to increase the number of members, that should be attended to in order to give some relief to the affected communities. Sir, I table* that letter from the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress dated 07th November, 2017 as well.

Then, Sir, I also would like to table* another letter by the National Shoora Council addressed to the Chairman, Provincial Council Election Delimitation Committee, which has elaborately dealt with the discrimination that has been meted out, particularly to the Muslim Community as a result of this Delimitation Committee Report.

Having said that, Sir, I would like to read - it is very important - paragraphs 466 and 467 of Chapter 13 of the Delimitation Committee Report. In paragraphs 466 and 467, they simply refer to the fact that smaller electorates can be created. Paragraph 466 states, I quote:

", "

Then, paragraph 467 states, I quote:

" "

For that also, they have put a paragraph and mentioned the ability to create multi-member constituencies, but they have not done so.

( ) (An Hon. Member) Yes, they have not done that.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) They have simply put a paragraph just to show that they are empowered to create multi-member constituencies and smaller constituencies, but they have done neither. They have simply referred to that in Chapter 13 and have done a serious injustice to the minorities. That is why I say that they have simply put on a statistical straitjacket and have decided that they would set an internal criteria for themselves in order to finalize this Report early. Maybe, the time limit given to them was not sufficient. If that was so, they could have always asked for an extension to do so and then, we could have perhaps considered some amendments.

Now, we are in a further dilemma. That is, the timely elections of the provincial councils have already been delayed by almost a year. If you are to continue to fiddle around with this Delimitation Committee Report, if you are to appoint a committee and if that committee decides that multi-member constituencies or smaller constituencies be created in order to accommodate the concerns of the minority communities, then, they have to go back to the drawing board once again in order to do that. That will take further time. In turn, that will invariably result in the elections getting postponed further

1577 1578

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

and further. So, if we set a deadline to have the elections by December or early January - I am sure the Hon. Leader of the House will be possessed of the amendment we have suggested - the Government could at least revert back to the old law for the time being in order to conduct elections early. Now, what is happening is, in the meantime, the Governors are ruling the Provinces, taking over the entire administration and the people are without their political representatives ruling the Provincial Councils. So, this issue has to be taken into mind and I urge this House through you, Sir, that we must reject this Delimitation Committee Report, not only reject it, but also look at some alternatives to this particular system, at least, go back to the old system, have elections in a timely fashion and provide relief to the people.

Thank you very much. [. . 12. 8] ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , 201 . . , . . :

In view of this proposed amendment in respect of certain Provincial Councils the term will be extended beyond 5 years and in respect of some Provincial Councils the term will be curtailed. In both ways it was submitted that the franchise will be affected.

It was held in several determinations that advancing the election date will not violate the Constitution as it will not deprive the voter of his franchise as he will be able to exercise the vote in advance or before the expiry of the term. On the other hand delay in exercising the franchise will affect the fundamental rights of voters.

The majority of this Court is of the view that Clauses 2,3 and 4 of the Bill is inconsistent with Articles 3,4, 12 (1) and 14 (1) of the Constitution and under Article 83 shall become law if number of votes cast in favour thereof amounts to not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members (including those not present), is approved by the People at a Referendum and a certificate is endorsed thereon by the President in accordance with Article 80.

One member of this Court is not in agreement with the above view."

Now, who has signed this Supreme Court Determination? That was signed by by Priyasath Dep, Hon. Chief Justice, Anil Gooneratne, Judge of the Supreme Court and Vijith K. Malalgoda, Judge of the Supreme Court. This Determination is in Columns 2-30 of Hansard dated 19th September, 2017 which all of us can read. The whole country should know this.

The first attempt of the Government was to deprive the country of the Provincial Council Elections which was rejected by the Supreme Court, and a Determination came

and pointed out that there has to be a two-thirds plus a Referendum. Now, what did the Government do? They introduced this Amendment to another Bill that was brought in to accommodate women representation.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe asked a question with regard to the delimitation as to why did we wait so long? You have to understand that unlike the previous Delimitation Committees, this has been done by an independent Committee appointed by the President. This is not a Committee of any Member of Parliament or the Minister. This independent Committee which has forwarded a Report to Parliament had been given four months to hand over its Report and there was total non-interference with regard to handing over of that Report.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) , . Hon. Minister, it is not a matter of a Delimitation Report. You brought in a Bill to postpone elections. That is why this situation has arisen, not because of the Delimitation Report.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Presiding Member, I have to answer.

1661 1662

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) This Bill was not brought in to postpone elections. This was brought in to have a delimitation for the Provincial Councils Elections by which we introduced female representation, a Member answerable to a particular electorate and removed manape kramaya. All that came about by this Act. If you do not know something properly, do not speak about that.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) May I be permitted to read this letter, Hon. Speaker?

"In keeping with the Provincial Councils' Election (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 2017, H.E. the President has already directed you to finalize the delimitation process related to Provincial Councils......"

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Hon. Speaker, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Minister, you go ahead.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) It further states:

"I have been made to understand that you have sought an appointment with me to hand over the above Delimitation Report, having finalized same as per the mandate given for your committee.

Since I am legally bound to table the said Delimitation Report in the Parliament within two weeks of the receipts same as the Minister in charge of the subject, there is a strong possibility of protest and resistance from various groups/political parties unless we secure their consensus prior to submitting it to the Parliament.

In view of the above, it would be much appreciated if you could give me a date and time so that a discussion could be arranged to

1689 1690

review the "Draft Delimitation Report" with the participation of Delimitation Committee Members and Representatives of all the registered political parties prior to handing over the final report to me. I sincerely hope that this will provide a fair opportunity for all the relevant parties to sort out any possible disagreements/differences prior to finalizing the said Delimitation Process."

Hon. Speaker, I table* this letter. I also table* a letter written by the Chairman to the Delimitation Committee for Provincial Councils Elections in response to that saying that he has no mandate to submit a Draft to political parties since Parliament has a process headed by the Hon. Prime Minister to go into that.

So, Hon. Members, today you all are deciding whether an appellate process should adjudicate this Report and if there are shortcomings to correct them.

, , , . , . 25 . , , . . . . , .[ ]

Sir, some say that this Delimitation Report has been submitted by me, and some say that it has been submitted by the Government. It is an independent Report which was submitted for all Members to look into and if there is a disagreement, then go into the appellate process. It is unfortunate that one has forgotten the fact that previously in terms of the Local Authorities Elections Act, there was a Delimitation Report which was done by a Committee appointed by the Minister. But, I see this is a very progressive step taken by Parliament where an independent Committee is adjudicating the appellate process. Therefore, I respectfully urge all to support this. Sir, there are certain parties who are saying that this system is detrimental to the minorities. It is not the system that is detrimental to the minorities, it is this Delimitation Report. I, therefore, respectfully urge every Hon. Member that we should not -

Speaker, this system of a member representing a ward was brought in during the previous regime. I have the Hansard where most Members of Parliament including minority Leaders stated that it is one of the most progressive pieces of legislation. The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena continuously urged that we should move away from the PR system and move away from the "manapa kramaya" and be progressive. Therefore, if any Member or any party attempts to go back to the earlier system, we would be doing injustice to democracy. Thank you, Hon. Speaker.

MR. ANIL PARAKRAMA SAMARASEKERA : APPRECIATION

OF SERVICE

[. . 6.21] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , :

'' 12 , 22 , .''

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . .

[6.23p.m.]

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - Prime Minister, Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) Hon. Speaker, I join the Leader of the House in thanking the Sergeant-at-Arms, Mr. Anil Parakrama Samarasekera, for the services he has rendered to this House. As you know, Hon. Speaker, Parliament depends on the integrity and the functioning of three office holders. The person who is in the Chair, the Speaker; the Clerk to the Speaker who keeps record of the Proceedings and who now today is called the Secretary-General in Sri Lanka and the third person is the officer who keeps order in the House, the Sergeant-at-Arms. Sergeant-at-Arms is an honoured position in the United Kingdom and the Sergeant-at-Arms had to carry out the orders of the House of Commons including arresting people.

I remember when we were in the House somewhere in 1981, one of our Chairmen was arrested and brought before the House by the then Sergeant-at-Arms for having disobeyed an Order. Nevertheless, it is this ancient tradition which goes back to 1914-1915 and today we have Mr. Samarasekera retiring from this House. As you know, Mr. Samarasekera also has a Parliamentary tradition. His father was Mr. Senapala Samarasekera who was a Deputy Chairman of Committees and a Deputy Minister. I knew him well. I used to meet him quite often and I must say that Mr. Senapala Samarasekera was a good example of a Parliamentarian and of a Deputy Chair. He took his work very seriously in Parliament and he was representing Akmeemana for a fairly long time. Mr. Senapala Samarasekeras Parliamentary tradition certainly was inherited by his son who served here without any political bias and who turned out to be a good Sergeant-at-Arms. He had his own training as a Sergeant-at Arms in the Sri Lanka Navy and thereafter he joined us in 1990s. So we have seen during his service he had to go through some difficult times and there have been times when the Sergeant-at-Arms had to carry out the Speakers Orders in respect of Members of the House even.

It is a difficult job but it was a job that was well done by Mr. Samarasekera. We in the House realize the value of the House and the order that is necessary to carry out the Proceedings. The job of the Sergeant-at-Arms is to protect the Mace whenever Members get into the middle of the Chamber which all parties have done. Also this House is not like the old Parliament. It is a much larger building which has to be maintained. So we have to record the services from the time of Mr. Ismail to Mr. Ananda Silva who was a very well known Sergeant- at-Arms, then Mr. Ronnie Abeysinghe, Mr. Wijaya Palliyaguruge and Mr. Anil Parakrama Samarasekera.

1699 1700

2018 24

We are still fortunate enough to get his services. After his retirement, Mr. Speaker, you have been gracious enough to have his advisory service made available to the House. So on behalf of the whole House I would like to thank Mr. Samarasekera for the services he rendered to maintain the decorum of the House which is very difficult and to assist the House and I wish him all the best in his retirement of which part of the time, I presume, will be spent in this institution. Thank you.

[6.40 p.m.] ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Hon. Speaker, I join the other Hon. Members of this House in paying our tribute to Anil Samarasekera, the Serjeant-At-Arms, who is entering retirement with effect from this month. Mr. Anil Samarasekera has carried out his duties very diligently. As officers of Parliament only a few are privileged to serve within this Chamber and among the Secretary-General, the Deputy-Secretary General and the Assistant Secretaries-General, the service of the Serjeant-At-Arms within the Chamber is very invaluable.

We have had many interesting incidents in the Well of the House. Every time when something happens within the Well of the House which disturbs the sanctity of the House, it is up to the Serjeant-At-Arms to assist you, Sir, in maintaining the order in the House. This duty, he has very diligently, very studiously and very carefully and also without compromising the dignity of the House and without affecting the rights of the Hon. Members of the House, carried out.

We have observed him over a period of time and when he assumed office as an Assistant Serjeant-At-Arms in 1996, he had the privilege of working under Mr. Palliyaguruge who was his senior at that time. He had learnt under his tutelage and had attended many training sessions both in the Commonwealth as well as in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. He had also attended many international conferences and enriched himself pertaining to the duties of the Serjeant-At-Arms in this House.

Sir, I do not want to take much time. As an old Royalist myself, let me wish him all the very best. He is somebody who lived up to the motto of our college, Disce Aut Discede, and has always been maintaining the high traditions of Royalists. We are all proud of him and we indeed would wish him very best in his retirement.

Thank you.
