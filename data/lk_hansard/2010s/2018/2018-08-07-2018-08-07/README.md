New Standing Orders were brought in only three months ago. According to the new Standing Orders, you have appointed all the Committees afresh, which means under the new Standing Orders, you have to make a fresh announcement with regard to this. That is the second issue that I am raising today.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay, good. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We do not want the Hon. Speaker to be devalued being dictated by letters sent by incompetent, inefficient and ignorant secretaries of political parties. They have no role to play in Parliament. Parliament is supreme. That is what we are fighting for. That is what you have stated. That is what the Supreme Court has stated. Even if you make an error, that error cannot be corrected by the Supreme Court because Parliament is supreme. So, you cannot be dictated by a letter written by an ignorant official.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Leader of the House, finally I state that we Members of the House have been recognized by you and over the years our membership has risen and today we have reached 70. Now you cannot say that you have not recognized us. You have recognized our Members and we have come up to 70, which is the largest number of Members in the Opposition. We are not Members of this Government which has failed. This Government has failed to maintain even the decorum of Parliament. They have flouted all the procedures and traditions of this Parliament. If you try to say that the Government can dictate who is going to be the Leader or the leading group in the Opposition it is a very sad moment in Parliamentary democracy.

I request you, Hon. Speaker, to make an announcement on this matter without delaying or dilly-dallying and causing Parliament to discredit. [Interruption]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, since mention is being made of Parliamentary tradition and numbers of Members of Parliament on either side of the House, it is important to remember that in this Parliament, there are Members of the UPFA - United Peoples Freedom Alliance - sitting on either side of the House. Anyway, that is their freedom to sit wherever they want to. But the fact is, the post of Leader of the Opposition cannot be held by a person who belongs to a party that has Members in the Cabinet. The Chairman, the General Secretary and over 20 Members of the UPFA are Members of the Cabinet today. So, it would be a mockery to have yet another UPFA Member sitting as the Leader of the Opposition as well.

The precedent cited by the Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma is with regard to the SLFP. The SLFP was the main Opposition party then. There were no Members of the SLFP who were Members of the Cabinet at that point in time. So, he is citing what he calls precedents, which are not precedents at tall. That is with regard to, within the party, who was to act as the Leader of the Opposition at that point in time. But, here is a fundamental issue. As to a "party", there were only six parties that were returned to this Parliament: one is the United National Party and the others are the United Peoples Freedom Alliance, the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, the EPDP and the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. Of these six political parties, two political parties - the United National Party and the United Peoples Freedom Alliance - are joined together in the Cabinet of this country. They are part of the Executive and a Member of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress is also a Deputy Minister now.

So, now, we have only three parties - the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party - which are not part of the Executive, which are really the Opposition and of those, the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi has 16 Members, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna has six Members and the EPDP has one Member. Amongst us, we have decided that the post of Chief Opposition Whip be given to the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. That is up to us; that is up to the 23 Members of the real Opposition, not to those who belong to a party that is part of the Cabinet. - [Interruption.] If they want to be the real Opposition, they must leave the UPFA. - [Interruption.]

805 806

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Let him continue.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If they are the real Opposition, they cannot be Members of the UPFA; they cannot be straddled in this House. There is a clear divide of an aisle in this House. The UPFA cannot be part of the Cabinet and also claim the post of the Leader of the Opposition. It is simple as that.
