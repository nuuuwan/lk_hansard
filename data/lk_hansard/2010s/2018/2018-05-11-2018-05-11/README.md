Sir, I wish to make some submissions in English also with regard to certain issues that are pending in the civil aviation industry. The Hon. Minister has taken adequate steps, no doubt. I commend him for that. But, there are some more steps that need to be taken.

337 338

[ ]

2018 11

One is that the landing and parking charges are considered to be high, compared to what is offered in the other airports in the region. As a result of that, a number of airlines do not want to touch down in Sri Lanka because the cost is going up. Then, the ground handling services at the Airport are also a monopoly and as a result, these charges are bound to be on the high side. So, if the Hon. Minister can address those issues and bring our charges in line with those levied at the other airports in the region, it would be very good and would also encourage more aircraft to come in. That means, there would be more tourists coming to Sri Lanka.

Also, there is a lack of slots for aircraft during peak hours and on certain days. To solve that problem, the expansion of the Airport, as the Hon. Minister mentioned, needs to take place. The sooner you do it, the better it is and then, there will be a higher income to the country.

Then, we should also encourage budget airlines to operate, as in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, as they have highly benefited by such operations because today, all foreigners look for cheap rates in air travel. The budget airlines offer very cheap rates. Therefore, we can encourage more budget airlines to operate. For example, 112.6 million passengers had flown in budget airlines to Malaysia, 3.4 million passengers to Thailand and 11.1 million passengers to Singapore in 2015. All those are people who look out for cheap rates to travel. So, we can encourage them to operate and that is one way we can bring in a lot of tourists to the country and finally bring in more revenue.

At present, AirAsia, Flydubai, Airarabia, IndiGo and Malindo Air operates budget airlines to Sri Lanka. Now, what they ask for is to have a separate terminal for the budget airlines, which is very much needed, so that the facility would be greater and convenient both to the airlines and the passengers.

Then, I would like to propose a reduction in airport tax for charter flights. Now, the world over, the trend is for charter flights. They bring in large numbers of tourists. They come here, park the plane and after one week, that same group gets back in it. But, with regard to those flights, the problem is, the airport tax is a little heavy compared to what is found in other airports in the Asian region. So, my proposal is, consider and try to bring it down.

Then, there is a shortage of airport lounge facilities during peak hours. In 2010, there were only about 450,000 tourists who came to this country. Today, the number is over two million. I think the Hon. Minister has thought of providing some more accommodation facilities; you are trying to have a second terminal. Very unfortunately, there were tender problems. If, at least, the temporary terminal that the Hon. Minister spoke about is constructed swiftly, it would address the issue.

Then, there is also a shortage of check-in counters. If you go to the Airport in the night, you would see the long lines of people waiting to be checked in. Therefore, we have to have more counters within the Airport. I do not

know whether the space would be a problem. However, I would urge the Hon. Minister to try and find a way of increasing the counters. The shortage of immigration officers is another matter.

Unless more Immigration Officers are recruited, the problem of shortage of counters will not be solved. I have been telling the Hon Minister in charge of the Department of Immigration and Emigration to hurry up with the recruitment. There are hundreds of officers being lined up, but so far they have not been brought into the Airport. I think, the Hon. Minister suggested to get temporary people to do the immigration duties.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala De Silva) That was not allowed. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Even that was not allowed. If our country is going to be dependent on the tourism industry to earn foreign exchange, these matters have to be addressed. Otherwise, a tourist who comes to this country once, will not come back. I think the second runway that the Hon. Minister mentioned is most welcome, but there are problems.

Then, lack of space in arrival and departure lobbies is another matter. People are flocking to these places. Now the demand has exceeded the capacity for which the Airport was originally built. This is the crux of the matter. We never envisaged at that time that there would be so much of passengers coming and going. But now it has increased. We are far behind time when it comes to improving the airports. It should have been done some time ago. I think the Rajapaksa Regime should have, without spending on other matters, improved the airports. Unfortunately it was not done. The space between the immigration counters and the wall on the opposite side is not enough and when queues get longer there is congestion as a result. So, these are practical problems which cause a lot of inconveniences.

Then Sir, with regard to development and improvements to domestic airports, I think the Hon. Minister is on the job. He did open the Batticaloa Airport which is a great impetus to the tourism industry for, tourists who come and land at the Bandaranaike International Airport can now take a domestic flight and go direct to their destination. But that is not enough, we need more domestic airports in this country because people do not want to waste time on the roads. I think, we should have one airport in the central part of the country - in the hill country - if possible, and in the Northern part of the country and also in the Southern part of the country. The Ratmalana Airport, which the Hon. Minister mentioned should be expanded and brought under the control of the Civil Aviation Authority. There are many airlines coming from India with about 80 to 90 passengers and they could easily land at Ratmalana Airport without flying to Katunayake and getting it congested. I do not know why the Air Force is clinging

339 340

on to this domestic airport. There are other runways and there is infrastructure in all parts of the country. After all, there is no war in the country now. So, I do not know why the Air Force is not allowing the Hon. Minister to develop this domestic airport. I think His Excellency the President should take serious notice of it and facilitate the Hon. Minister in charge of Civil Aviation to open up domestic airports. We do not need long runways. Most of these domestic airlines can easily land on the runways that are there in other parts of Sri Lanka. So, this is something which is very important.

Sir, as in other airports, there has to be a method to fast track the formalities for Business and the First Class passengers for them to have a quick disposal or get out of the airport. We do not have that facility. That of course is a matter to be addressed by the Department of Immigration and Emigration. The Hon. Minster will certainly attend to that, if there is enough space. So, these are matters that come to our notice, the complaints that we get.

Regarding general training of the staff, courtesy towards the passengers should be improved. This is very important. What is the first impression that a foreigner who comes to this country gets if he is not well treated with a smile? That is what is most required.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala De Silva) The Immigration Officers. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Particularly, the Immigration Officers are very cussed. Sir, you and I do not realize it because we go through the VIP Lounge. But those who come via the normal channel are really upset because sometimes, the Immigration Officers are not in their seats; a number of counters are empty or sometimes the Officer at the Immigration Counter is arrogant. Therefore, some form of courtesy training is necessary both for the Airport personnel as well as for the Immigration personnel.

Then, there is the question of touts as the Hon. Minister mentioned. It is a very important legislation that he has brought in. The problem of touts is there both within the Airport building and outside. Outside it is worst. I mean, there is a lot of pulling.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, you have only two minutes. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, give me more time. There are not many speakers today, so we have enough time. Anyway, I will finish my speech.

Then, we should also make available persons who could speak foreign languages at both Arrival and Departure Lounges. There are tourists who come from different parts of the world. We can deploy men and women who can speak foreign languages, particularly, German, French, Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, Spanish et cetera in order to facilitate the guests who are in need of information. From the tourists point of view this is very important. In other countries, we find officers who can speak a particular language will be there when a flight arrives and if any inquiry is made, they are prepared to answer in that particular language. Many people who come here do not know English, particularly the Chinese; they do not know English at all. Even I have requested the travel agents to see whether they could find such people. We can get them permits and place them closer to the immigration counters in order to facilitate tourists. These are some of the ideas that we have.

The Sri Lankan Government today is very much dependent on tourism. We are looking forward to tourism as the second largest foreign exchange earner to this country. To do that, the first impression of the airport must be improved. I think the Hon. Minister is doing his very best, but he has his own limitations. We have to depend on foreign loans and aid for development and in such a situation, these things come up.

Finally, I would like to thank the President for taking a firm stand in order to clear the Mirissa and the Negombo beach problems, where the beach boys had encroached on the beach preventing the free movement of tourists. We also brought to the notice of the authorities concerned the harassment they had meted out. Coast Conservation authorities, I saw today in the newspapers, had finally decided to go to places like Mirissa, Negombo and Ahungalla in order to clear the obstacles that are there. It is very important. If not, a tourist who comes once will not come again. They are assaulted; they are harassed; their wealth is squandered. This type of things must be stopped. If you want to develop tourism, you must have regulations and proper management of the seafront and all other places of tourist interest.

I wish the Hon. Minister luck in order to implement these proposals. I am sure he will do his very best in the near future in order to facilitate tourism in this country. Thank you.
