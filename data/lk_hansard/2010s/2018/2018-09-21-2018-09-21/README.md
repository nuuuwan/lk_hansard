[12.12p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Speaker, I would like to say a few words on the Condolence Motion pertaining to the Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe. The Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe was a lawyer; he was a politician; he was a diplomat; he was a civil society activist, and apart from that Sir, he was one of the finest of gentlemen.

Sir, I will start with my last description of him that he was one of the finest of gentleman. He was amiable, he was affable, self-effacing to a point of almost being shy, kind, refined, warm, to put it altogether and to put it briefly, he was one of the finest gentlemen you could ever meet.

My first contact with the late Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe Sir, was as a lawyer. We were both lawyers. We opposed each other as lawyers in many matters pertaining to trade union rivalry in the Trincomalee Port. The Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe represented the LSSP, the left trade union. I represented

917 918

[ ]

2018 21

the trade union affiliated to the Federal Party or the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi. They were both powerful trade unions and there was a lot of litigation in court and we represented the different trade unions I mentioned earlier.

We came to know each other fairly closely and the closer that I came to know Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe, my respect for him grew. The Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe was a Member of Parliament. He represented both the Bulathsinhala and the Kalutara Electorates. He entered Parliament through the LSSP and later through the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. He is said to have had a very close association with the people, particularly the people of his constituency and one can easily visualize the warmth and kindness with which he interacted with his constituents. He is said to have been engaged very much in development activity in his area.

The late Mangala Moonesinghe was a progressive and a liberal. He was not one who played the racial card or the communal card to continue to sustain his political career. He believed in all Sri Lankans being equal citizens. A significant role he played as a Member of Parliament was when he chaired the Select Committee on Constitutional Reform during His Excellency President Premadasas term. It was in 1991. After the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord was signed in July, 1987 and the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution had been enacted, the Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe was appointed as the Chairman to a Select Committee appointed by President Premadasa to consider further Constitutional Reform. Despite the Hon. Managala Moonesinghe being a Member of Parliament of the Opposition of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, President Premadasa appointed him as the Chairman of the Select Committee on Constitutional Reform. That was indicative of the immense trust and respect that the Hon. Managala Moonesinghe commanded. Through painstaking negotiations, he was able to achieve a substantial consensus which inter alia referred to: one - devolution on the Indian pattern which meant that while ensuring the territorial integrity of the country there would be genuine power-sharing arrangements.

The second is, substantially transferring subjects in the Concurrent List to the Provincial List or doing away completely with the Concurrent List.

And the third is, an Apex Council of the Northern and Eastern Provincial Councils enabling the Tamil speaking people of the North and the East to be real beneficiaries of power sharing arrangements. In a spirit of goodwill and cooperation amongst all the people who lived in the different provinces, regions in the country, the recommendations reflected a genuine desire to address the longstanding genuine concerns of the Tamil speaking people of the North and the East. The proposals were reflective of the depth of the late Hon. Mangala Moonesinghes vision for Sri Lanka.

These proposals of the Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe provided the gateway and the momentum for the proposals later brought by Her Excellency Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga in the mid-nineties culminating with the August, 2000 constitutional

proposals and the Tissa Vitharana All Party Representative Committee proposals during His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksas time. President Mahinda Rajapaksa had appointed an APRC - All Party Representative Committee- and with the aid of experts reports that Committee was engaged in formulating further proposals. All these proposals are also indicative of progressive thinking particularly on the part of Sri Lanka Freedom Party over a considerable period of time starting with Mr. Mangala Moonesinghe during President Premadasas time, President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas term, Mr. Mahinda Rajapaka's term when he appointed the APRC with Prof. Tissa Vitharana as its Chairman for almost twenty years. This provides the foundation on which we are now attempting to finalize reform on power sharing through constitutional changes. It must be accepted, Sir, that much respected Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe played a crucial role in these healthy developments. He did so in the interest of the country and all the people who lived in the country. As I said before, Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe was a diplomat. He served in India during two terms; he served also as a High Commissioner in the United Kingdom. He was much respected in the countries where he served as High Commissioner. He had contacts with the most important people in those countries. He was able to discharge his obligations by Sri Lanka not merely to the best of his ability but in the best interest of the country.

In his later years, he played the role of civil society activist. He was much involved in the One Text Initiative through which he tried to take the constitutional process forward. Unfortunately, the environment was not conducive to his being successful. In the loss of the late Managala Moonesinghe, we have lost a very dedicated, much respected, able citizen of Sri Lanka. We are all sad that we have lost such a worthwhile personality.

In all his endeavours he was very ably assisted by his wife, Gnana. We happened to know her well. She was a great assistance to Mr. Mangala Moonesinghe in the discharge of his duties. We respect her for the contribution she made.

We convey our very sincere condolences to the widow and the children of Mr. Mangala Moonesinghe and we shall be grateful, Sir, if a copy of today's Proceedings would be sent to the family.

Thank you. [..12.22] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera - Minister of of Buddhasasana) , .

[1.39 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne - State Minister of Finance) Hon. Speaker, I am honoured to say a few words on the life of a distinguished Parliamentarian, the late Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe. My association with the Moonesinghe family goes back to the time I was five years old and entered school where Vinodh, the Hon. Anil Moonesighes son, and I were classmates. So, the Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe to me was more in the category of uncle, in a sense, of respectfully belonging to a generation ahead of us. The Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe was also the first Member of Parliament who was made an Eisenhower Fellow. I am glad that I share proudly the distinction of being somebody who has followed in the same footsteps and was made an Eisenhower Fellow.

He was educated at Royal College and then went on to England where he became a barrister. He practised criminal law in the courts of this country and had a solid practice. As a criminal lawyer, he played his role very effectively as a constituent Member of Parliament in very turbulent times defending young people from the brutality of that time. He was a lawyer, a politician and a diplomat.

In his political career, Hon. Moonesinghe served Parliament from 1965 to 1977 representing the Bulathsinhala Electorate as a Member of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and subsequently, from 1989 to 1994 representing the Kalutara District as a Member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Mr. Moonesinghe, I would not call him a Marxist although he was in the LSSP, but he was, in my own reading and understanding, very much a social democrat. Mr. Moonesinghe was appointed as the Sri Lankas High Commissioner to India and subsequently as the High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. Later in his life, he went on to be the Chairman of the Marga Institute where he continued to contribute to society even after he ceased to be a legislator.

There are a couple of anecdotes about Mr. Moonesinghe when we talk about his life. As a constituent MP, he took a keen interest in socio-economic development in his Electorate. He was instrumental in getting one of the bridges built over the Kalu Ganga in his constituency. When the bridge was completed and it was to be inaugurated, rather than him inaugurating it or getting a fellow politician to inaugurate it, he looked for the worker who had worked the longest in constructing the bridge and got that worker to inaugurate the bridge. That says something about his character and about his life.

Another anecdote is that he was instrumental in the expansion of passion fruit growing in his constituency. One illustration of this was there was a farm established for girls in the 1960s for growing passion fruit. Then, in the 1970s when land reforms came, he was concerned with making land reform of practical benefit to his

constituents. Although he would have preferred if more State-owned plantations were actually transferred to peoples ownership, in some small way though, he was able to reduce by the transfer of lands the landlessness in his Electorate. He believed that small-scale farming could be efficient or even more so as large-scale farming. He was a person with a social conscience.

As we have heard in this Assembly today, he will always be remembered because of his role as the Chairman of the Parliamentary Select Committee appointed to recommend ways and means of achieving peace and political stability in the country in 1991 by President R. Premadasa. The Committee concluded its sittings in September 1993, and submitted a comprehensive Report to Parliament. There was a mandate to go into the ethnic conflict and make its recommendations towards an early solution.

Proposals were made by the UNP, the SLFP and also all the other Parties including the Tamil Parties. If these recommendations were embraced, this country certainly would have been different. In these recommendations, the principles that Mr.Mangala Moonesinghe strongly stood for, was reconciliation. He stood for equality; he stood for justice. When Sri Lanka adopts the new Constitution, the principles and recommendations of the Mangala Moonesinghe Committee will, I am sure, stand to his honour as we have strived in that process.

I would like to say in conclusion that his widow, devoted wife Gnana, whom I used to observe after I became a Member of Parliament as Mr. Moonesinghe was engaged in a lot of civil society initiatives, including the One-Text Initiative, she stood by always supporting him, and not only supporting him but even in her own right in conversation often showing us the way.

May Mr. Moonesighe's widow Gnana and his children be comforted.

Thank you.

. We have to give credit to Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara for taking steps to appoint Thilaka Jinadasa as the coach. Likewise, we have taken progressive steps. We won the World Championship in Carrom. Hon. Deputy Speaker, Hon. Members can make noises but they have to make noise with regard to political issues. Do not insult our cricketers. Facebook . Therefore, I appeal to all Hon. Members in the House, when we deal with sports, please do not bring politics into it. Every government has tried to do something for sports. . . , . , 31 . , . , , . Therefore, to bring national pride and unity, we need sports; to link the North and the South, we need sports.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would not take much time. I know that the Hon. Kanchana Wijesekera is a young MP; I know that the Hon. Shehan Semasinghe is a young MP. Therefore, I would appeal to them, when you move Adjournment Motions with regard to sports, be more cautious because we are a divided nation and through sports, we should not divide ourselves further. We should unite under our National Flag when we play sports apart from whatever divisions we have.

, . . , , . . . . .

Sir, I went to the ICC and informed them that I have to make these changes. They gave me time until February. Hon. Deputy Speaker, I have no intention of holding on to the Cricket Board. Some Members here feel that I want to take the Cricket Board and run it; but I do not. I have already with me the Ministry of Provincial Councils, Local Government and I have a lot of work to do. Handling these two Ministries together, especially with sports, is a difficult task.

. I gave a promise and a pledge to this country when I took over that I will not appoint Interim Committees. The reason I did that is when an Interim Committee is appointed, again there will be factions in sport. There are three or four factions already and I do not want more factions in sports. That is why I appointed a Competent Authority who is my Secretary, so that there will not be a division until an election. And I pledge in this House that I will expeditiously hold elections with regard to the Cricket Board. Not only the Cricket Board, for other sports bodies also I have sent these regulations today to be gazetted. With this gazette, I promise, elections with regard to sports bodies in this country will be more transparent. Sir, there was a request made by our past national cricketers to have major changes. I together with them discussed with the ICC. The ICC informed me as the first step to bring in these changes and I hope that we will be progressive to bring in various changes in the future also, so that cricket including other sports in this country will develop.

Thank you. . . Question put, and agreed to.
