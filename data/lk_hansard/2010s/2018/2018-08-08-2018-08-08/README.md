( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Hon. Speaker, the Question that I bring to the Hon. Prime Ministers notice is regarding the same matter. I was listening to his reply. In fact, at a discussion

convened by the Prime Minister with all the Ministers representing the District and other Members of Parliament, we pointed out the difficulty of some of the affected people not being able to produce evidence since all of their belongings have been burnt. Therefore, we decided to ask the Valuation Department to ignore the normal procedure and go for estimated value. But, that has still not been done. So, I urge that that be considered seriously in order to properly compensate the affected victims.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) What I will do is, I will call another meeting where we can review everything.
