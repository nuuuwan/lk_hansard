( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Hon. Speaker, I would like to add to what the Hon. Rauff Hakeem just stated. Sir, you have very clearly stated that you do not recognize the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister of this country and you have not even recognized any Member as a Cabinet Minister. However, I learnt from the media that a group of MPs meet once a week and take decisions to procure various items. They enter into various agreements not so much with countries, but with international organizations and companies and are trying to bring in various kinds of items to Sri Lanka and various projects are being handed over to them, which is totally illegal. So, I would like to bring this to your kind notice and greatly appreciate if some action is taken to stop this kind of illegal activities.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Mr. Speaker, today is a day in which we have a very awkward situation, where the purported Government in this country has actually decided not to attend Parliament. It is not unusual for the Oppositions in Parliaments across the world to sometimes boycott Parliaments, because they have disagreements with the majority or the Government of the day. But, you never get a situation in which those claiming to be the Government actually boycott Parliament. So, this is really an unusual situation. It shows that this purported Government is an absolute sham because it is unable to prove through a majority that it is actually a Government.

The history of Parliamentary democracy has shown that the job of a Speaker is a very difficult job. If you take the British Parliamentary history, normally, the Speaker was accompanied on the first day by two people to the Speakers Chair as it was a job or a responsibility that somebody took up reluctantly. If you again look at the British Parliamentary history, you would see that from the year 1300, many Speakers had finally lost their lives since they had to stand up to the Executive or the King of the day. That tradition still continues in the British Parliament and it continues in our Parliament too in a different way, where two Hon. Members accompany the Speaker to the Chair. It is a job that most Members of Parliament do not envy, because if you look at the history of the Speakers job, you would see that it entails standing up to the Executive, whichever form of Executive it might be across the world. Parliament is supreme and independent from the Executive and that tradition will always have to be maintained, if there is going to be good governance and democracy in a country.

Sir, you have stood up to the Executive in the recent past. Parliament has been devalued by the appointment of a new Prime Minister and a Government which has been

213 214

unable for one month to prove its majority. But, on the 14th and again on the 16th of November, on a Motion proposed by the JVP in the Parliament of Sri Lanka, the vast majority of Members of Parliament voted that they had no confidence in the Government that had been appointed. The Standing Orders were suspended in taking that Vote. That was not unusual, because Standing Orders are suspended from time to time. They were suspended by a majority Vote in Parliament; a majority Vote in Parliament was taken by suspending the Standing Orders, given the grave situation that had arisen.

The Standing Orders also provides for taking a Vote and the Vote can be taken as a "Voice Vote". Primarily, it is taken as a Voice Vote. Then, if a Division is called for, in those circumstances, it is possible to take the Vote row by row, by name or by using the electronic voting system, as we do now. But, unfortunately, the Government of the day did not permit a proper Vote and at the Vote, they did not even call for a Division. Therefore, a Voice Vote had to be taken under those very difficult circumstances, which was subsequently proven by the signatures of 122 Members of Parliament to say that they had no confidence in the Government that had been sworn in by the President.

Sir, here, the Parliamentary history is repeating itself. Sir, I know that you will be embarrassed, but we have to say that you have stood up - you came from the private sector and you have had a clean record; there has not been a single financial or other allegation against you - and proved your mettle when you ruled that there was no Government after that Parliamentary Vote.

Sir, it was a sad day where we saw the abuse of public property in this Parliament. It was on television; it was on social media. I join all other Hon. Members of Parliament who have expressed their views that action must be taken against those who have abused public property, particularly Members of Parliament, who should set an example for other citizens of this country.

Sir, it is not only that, but the behaviour of the Members of Parliament is also of concern. We heard today that some Members of Parliament have been offered financial incentives for changing their allegiances. That is unacceptable. But, we have also heard, from time to time, wrong stories about Members of Parliament. This crisis has also shown that there are Members of Parliament who stand up for principle. I want to pay tribute particularly to those Members of Parliament and to the small Parties representing interests of ethnic minorities of this country in Parliament, which have stood up for principle and safeguarded Parliamentary democracy and good governance. We salute them for the stand that they have taken. Sir, you will go down in history for the stand that you have taken.

I would call upon the President to uphold the majority view of Parliament. Sri Lanka cannot continue without a Government, because there are serious repercussions for the ordinary citizens of this country. Finally, I would like

to thank the Parliamentary staff too for operating under very difficult circumstances. When they get an Order from the Executive, they wonder how they should act. But, the Parliamentary staff had stood its ground and also upheld the Practices, the Privileges and the Standing Orders of Parliament and I hope that tradition will continue even beyond our generation.

Thank you, Sir, for giving me the time. ( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) Sir, Abraham Lincoln, a very famous leader of the United States, said Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall last forever. I believe the test of democracy is the institutions and the leadership that these institutions have.

In Sri Lanka, we have had many occasions where democracy had been threatened. In the last one month also, we have seen a huge threat to the democratic and value-based system that Sri Lanka has enjoyed for the last 70 years. I have seen on many occasions how individuals have withstood the pressure and also succumbed to that pressure.

Sir, I know, during the last one month, there was a lot of pressure on you personally; you have been told many things; your name has been maligned and certain remarks have been made about you, which are not objective, but entirely subjective. You have acted for the best interests of the majority of the Parliamentarians in this House - the 122 Members of Parliament - that is very clear. I say thank you. Sir, you have withstood a great deal of pressure and have also stood by the principle of acting in our interest; you have acted in a very bold manner, a very decisive manner and you stood with the MPs of the Opposition.

As you know, Parliament is a temple of democracy and in this temple, a lot of dirty things happened. I was shocked to see all that in my Parliamentary career of 18 years, which is not very long. There are Parliamentarians here with longer careers. The Hon. John Amaratunga, for example, I think is going on his fortieth year in Parliament now and the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella is on his 25th year. So, we are very young to Parliamentary democracy - 18 years is not a long time. But, on that particular day, the temple of democracy was invaded by a group of thugs who came up to the Speakers Chair; tried to demolish the Speakers Chair; threw water at the Speakers Chair and also threw "miris kudu" at the police officers. It is indeed a shameful day for democracy in Sri Lanka.

So, what you did that day maybe very unusual. You came with a police escort here and held a Vote. Some people may not agree with that procedure, but certainly the principle of democracy was upheld by you. So, thank you very much for that.

I have seen in my life very bold leaders. For example, my late father, the Hon. Gamini Dissanayake was a very bold leader. He took a lot of risks - sometimes

215 216

[ ]

2018 27

unnecessary risks. The Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali, whom I also worked with, was also a very bold leader. But, that day, what I saw in you was much bolder, much more courageous than many of the leaders that I have worked with. You are a very proud and distinctive product of Ananda College and I am sure your school is also saying, Hon. Speaker, thank you very much for saving democracy in Sri Lanka.

Hon. Speaker, there is another statement which says, "cometh the hour, cometh the man". The particular moment of time was a destruction of democracy in Sri Lanka. I must thank the Judiciary also for acting independently. I must thank you also for acting independently because, for the sake of argument, if the Government had a majority, you would have acted on the best interests of the majority; that is the Government. The fact of the matter is, they have not got a majority. That is why they have not come here. They have abandoned their duties as Parliamentarians, in my opinion, under the guise that you have not followed the proper procedure. But, actually, we know that you did follow the proper procedure. So, it is very important that you as the Speaker communicates well with the people of this country about your actions, because there are a lot of misinterpretations being given about the particular role you had to play. So, I would like to thank you once again for standing with us, as a gentleman of the old school, a man who has stood very firmly on principle, as a man of integrity and honesty - indeed we are very proud to be associated with you.

Also, I would like to say on a personal note, you have lost a great deal in your life. You have lost a daughter two years ago at the age of 40. I am sure wherever she is, she is looking down on you and she is saying, Thank you, Hon. Speaker.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Chaminda Wijesiri) , .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Speaker, I take this opportunity to speak a few words on the unruly and unwanted acts that have been created in this Parliament. For the last one month, the entire country is at a standstill economically and in all fields due to the unconstitutional behaviour by the administrators of this county, and by the President of the country who secretly removed the then Prime Minister and appointed another as the Prime Minister. It is completely undemocratic, illegal, and unconstitutional for them to have done this.

I think it is time that the President of this country takes note of the democratic principles of this country, the democratic principles of this Parliament, and uphold the truth and constitutional aspect that should be adhered to in this society. Unfortunately, from the date of democracy in this country, we have never come across a

235 236

[ ]

2018 27

situation or any act that has created this kind of confusion in our social activities.

If you look at the imports sector of this country; if you look at the banking sector; if you look at the rate of the US Dollar; if you look at all fields, economically and otherwise, the people of this country want back normalcy. The people of this country want democratic principles to be upheld. If you speak to any individual here today, whether he is from the United National Party or from any other Party, everyone is saying that the entire country has to have democracy and the democratic principles have to be upheld. It is high time that the President of this country today come to a conclusion and bring this entire deadlock of society, the entire non-progression of this country during last one month and more to an end, and have proper social activities and uphold the democratic principles.

Therefore, Hon. Speaker, I am requesting you, and also the President of this country to uphold the democratic principles and not to act unconstitutionally or illegally, and to bring back normalcy in this country as it was before the dissolution of Parliament. I earnestly request His Excellency the President to uphold again the democratic principles and bring Sri Lanka to the normalcy, which we are all waiting for.

Thank you.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to speak a few words in English since this message must go to the international community as to what is taking place in Sri Lanka, what is the situation in Sri Lanka, what is the political situation in Sri Lanka and what is the situation that people are facing. Therefore, please permit me to proceed.

The country and the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa - I say "honourable" because he was the former President of this country; but today he has become dishonourable because of what he has been doing - should make serious note that no foreign country or Head of State has so far acknowledged Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. None of them, not a single country, have sent any congratulatory messages. That is the situation today. That merely proves that the Government is illegal. Countries not resorting to customary diplomatic practice on such new appointments send the silent message that the appointment is not accepted. The Ambassadors and High Commissioners come and whisper to us and say, "What is this? We cannot accept this Government" and that their Governments are not going to acknowledge what has been taking place.

As such Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa will stand to be dignified if he resigns from this position of Prime Minister. That is the only advise we can give him as he was the President of this country for two sessions. It is best for him to resign from this premiership and give it away to the rightful people.

During the period of Government from 2015 to 2018 October, daily street protests, worker strikes over irrational issues and flimsiest reasons, satyagrahas and other public peace disruptive actions were orchestrated to cripple the public life to hold back the country from moving forward by the very same elements who are members of the current illegal regime. This is what they did in the last couple of years. They were trying to prevent the development of tourism in this country and the day-to-day life.

Then Sir, what seems to govern today is the rule of man and not the rule of law. That is why all these arguments took place.

Under the present illegal Government, tourism is on a self-destructive mode. It is quite evident from what was stated by the Mover of this Motion. It is quite a timely Motion. I must say that we have to bring to the notice of the public of this country as well as the international

243 244

2018 27

community that under the present illegal Government tourism is on a self-destructive mode, as I mentioned.

Then, we are reminded how and why the Rajapaksa Government was defeated in 2015. It is important to reflect as to why he failed internationally to be branded a "banana regime" at that time. It was our darkest period in the international and local politics since Independence and he with the same team is now back in action. They have come back once again with their antics.

Political turmoil created by callous and undemocratic decisions related to the governance of this country leading to deplorable happenings by sections of unruly Parliamentarians in the hallowed people's Chamber where you are seated, carried to the world by the worldwide media has created a fearful and negative impact on the image of Sri Lanka as a tourism product in the eyes of the whole world. That is the end result of what they have demonstrated in the last couple of days.

I am reminded as to the damaging image of Sri Lanka for tourism under Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa during the time prior to his defeat in 2015 when tourists felt unsafe to visit Sri Lanka. At that time, it was like that. You know it, Sir. One major incident was the gang rape of a British lady and killing of her boy friend headed by the Chairman of the Tangalle Pradeshiya Sabha, a close political ally of Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, when he was the President of this country. That went all over the world.

There were travel advisories issued not to come to Sri Lanka as Sri Lanka was an unsafe destination. This damage cannot be undone easily in the context of the present situation of the country. The current impasse, if not democratically and justly settled, will cause irreparable damage to all sectors of the economy and lead to very adverse effects on tourism and those whose livelihood depend on it in the country in the forthcoming Winter tourist season. Tourist season is the Winter season of the European countries. Most of them make bookings and come here in millions.

Tourism of the country realistically was on track from 2015 to reach its target of 4 million tourists by the year 2022 - those were the estimates and we were moving towards that -but now it has suddenly been derailed by retarding and damaging political events causing a massive setback for tourism way forward in this country. The estimate that we had was that tourism would be the highest income earner in foreign exchange in the immediate future. We had earlier the foreign employment; we had the textile manufacturing industry. Of course, earlier it was the plantations but they went down and then foreign employment took up the first place for the largest amount of foreign exchange earnings. However, we felt that we had so much of attractions in this country and tourism would be the highest foreign exchange earner and we were moving towards that. By 2022, we may have achieved that, if not for this nonsense.

Tourism is the third highest foreign exchange earner of the country at the moment in the ambitious programme to make it the highest foreign exchange earner in the

"Vision 2020". Regretfully, all this will be undone and the country will lose the much-needed foreign exchange in the form of tourism earnings if this situation continues. If this illegal government continues for another couple months, it will be disastrous.

The Government and the Treasury will stand to lose the much-needed revenue to supplement its reserves when the industry takes a dip as we are now trying to expose.

The hotels with their staff and those allied to their services will suffer when the much expected service charges and other benefits are no longer at their disposal. This is a very serious situation. When people see that their service charges are not forthcoming, they will look for employment in some other countries. We will lose the best chefs and the best staff who are now serving. They will go out because the Sri Lankan staff is readily acceptable in any of these foreign hotels. Even the Maldives, the Middle East and Singapore are eagerly waiting to take our people.

Many skilled and semi-skilled employees in this industry, which is already facing a shortage, will be compelled to seek foreign employment which will be a major drawback to the industry. With the greatest difficulty, we were getting them back in the last couple of years by making the industry work more lucrative so that they would be able to draw better salaries. Now they will go back once again. How are we going to move forward?

The major partners in the trade, namely the airlines, will cancel the frequencies. At that moment, they were increasing their frequencies in flight to land in Sri Lanka and even many may consider pulling out of Sri Lanka as had happened in the past. This is one area that we were moving forward to attract more frequencies from the existing airlines that were touching down in Sri Lanka and also to invite new airlines which did not come, to come to Sri Lanka so that there will be more tourists coming here.

The local travel agents will face a similar challenge when arrivals to Sri Lanka begin to drop. They too have invested heavily on transport services, for example, on luxury coaches, buses, vans, cars and so many other items with borrowed financial assistance. They too will face a similar predicament. They will not be able to service their loans. Ultimately, their assets would get sold up by the banks.

Now, Sir, the new development that we embarked on was the "homestay". You know it. When we say homestay it is similar to cottage industry and meant for the poor villagers. The villagers who have borrowed from the bank may perhaps be forced to even commit suicide when they are unable to pay their debts. Now, homestay was a new industry that was developing where the low-income groups would hire out a couple of rooms in their house to the tourists and get an additional income in order to meet their day-to-day expenses. That was developing and we gave all the encouragement to any region which want to develop the homestay.

245 246

The support services including the so-called Tuk Tuk and taxi drivers who make their living by transporting tourists, the vegetable, meat, fish, fruits and all other varied suppliers will be at the receiving end due to this impasse and drop in arrivals. Even the king coconut seller will feel the pinch. All these people derived additional expenditure particularly during this season. So much that they were looking forward in order to cushion their income through this period. Those who are earning from food outlets, restaurants, cafes, bars, casinos, wine stores et cetera will be very unhappy when their income is depleted.

Drop in the national earnings from Sigiriya, Dambulla, Polonaruwa and Anuradhapura, archeological sites, wildlife sanctuaries and a host of others will be a major concern to the Government coffers. Income from all these places were coming into the Government coffers, but now that will be drastically reduced and they will find it very difficult to manage their affairs.

Sir, the UK Travellers Association announced, "The best long haul destination for family travel - 2017, 2018" and National Geography Traveller announced," Sri Lanka on the cool list - 2018. These are some of the brandings that we obtained from the foreign agencies. Virtuoso Luxe Report Australia states that Sri Lanka is among the five most popular destinations for Aussi Traveller.

Now, Sir, I have got some feedback from some of the leading hoteliers. For example, Anantara Hotel in Tangalle - you know it - has said their losses confirmed booking for April/May which is the low season to the value of US Dollars 3 million due to a Hollywood movie production being cancelled.

Mind you, we are not talking only of these two months of this year. This is the effort taken for next years reservations and also there are so many agencies that are helping Sri Lanka. USAID is giving a lot of assistance for training. I do not know whether they will continue under this scenario. There was World Bank aid for infrastructure development. They were giving a large amount of money to develop infrastructure wherever the tourists would visit Sri Lanka. The Australian Government funding for training and development- they were giving a lot of money to train our young boys and girls to be smart in the hotel industry - may also now get suspended on account of this. Then, there was assistance given by the Canadian Government also. These are the repercussions that we will experience due to what has been happening here.

In the Ministry of Tourism Development there are four institutions. One is the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority. Second is the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau. The third is the Sri Lanka Convention Bureau and the fourth is the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management. Today, there are no Chairmen or Managing Directors in any of those institutions. No board meetings are held; nothing is happening. The whole promotional programme of the Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian

Religious Affairs has come to a standstill. What I am saying is, whoever may govern, unless those institutions function and go forward with their progressive measures, the country is going to lose valuable foreign exchange. These four institutions received nearly Rs. 4 billion in 2017. From whom? From the tourists. One source of income is the Embarkation Tax, which brings an income of roughly Rs. 2.7 million to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau and the other two institutions. Then, there is another Rs. 1.2 billion that comes from hotel taxes to the State. So, that way, nearly Rs. 4 billion do come to those four institutions for their tourism development and promotional programmes, not from the Treasury. The Treasury gives hardly any money. On the contrary, the Treasury, from time to time, borrows foreign exchange from those institutions when they are short of money to service their loans. We have been giving almost US Dollars 1 billion every year to the Treasury in order to facilitate their requirements. So, all this is now going to get upset.

Many of the people who have been looking forward for a better future will leave. The number of investors who wanted to come to Sri Lanka, maybe, to invest in hotels, in entertainment or in whatever in order to promote tourism will not come now. The travel advisories that are issued by various countries are creating a very serious situation. The Minister of Foreign Affairs has been very strongly recommending to all the Ambassadors to speak to their Governments to take away the travel advisories, but nothing has happened; no one is moving to. All the agencies - the IMF, the World Bank and the ADB - are watching this situation. Whatever loan facilities and assistance that we have been eyeing for or expecting to get in the future will be freezed; we will not get those. As a result, it is the poorer people, the low-income groups, who will get affected the most.

Today, many hoteliers are worried because they are unable to service their loans. They have been building hotels and refurbishing their hotels borrowing money from the banks, expecting an income to come during the height of the tourism season and when that is not there, many of them feel that they cannot go on and fear that the banks will put up their hotels for sale as they will not be able to pay their loans. So, this is a very serious situation.

I do not know why the leaders or these people who are orchestrating all this do not understand that. The other day, many of these travel agents and hoteliers met the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa and told him about the disaster they are facing as a result of this situation, the amount of cancellations that are taking place and about the number of investors who are now backing off. This is a very sad situation for the country; this is very unfortunate. We were trying to do our very best in developing tourism. In tourism, Sir, there are no imports. We only market the natural assets and reserves we have. The tourists who come here go around and they are sometimes so taken up because Sri Lanka is such a beautiful country.

There is authenticity; there is the biggest animal in the sea; there is the biggest animal on land; all that is visible

247 248

here. Then, the heritage sites declared by the UNESCO are highly respected and popular among the tourists. Unlike the apparel industry where you have to import raw materials, manufacture and then export, in the tourism industry there is nothing like that. All what we market is, all what we have here and whatever we earn is the net income to the country. Whatever we say, this is the most unfortunate situation that we have witnessed. At least now, let these people realize the damage they have done. Without allowing further damages and destroying this country, we will have to do something.

First we must understand, Sir, this country is very unfortunate. We had the JVP uprising in 1971 which destroyed human life, valuable buildings, vehicles et cetera. Again, in 1988, there was another uprising. With that also the tourism industry got affected. Nobody wanted to touch here. See the amount of damage and destruction that took place. Then, came the LTTE. With all this happening, no tourist wanted to come to Sri Lanka. They went to Maldives. They bypassed Sri Lanka. That is how the Maldives developed. They have developed a lot. They have nothing to offer. They have only the sea and sand whereas we have everything. Within a couple of hours, we go to the cool climate; we go to the sea beaches, the wildlife, everything. So, this is very unfortunate. People who are most affected are the poorer people who are much dependent on the livelihood of tourism and today they are all wondering what to do. This is a very sad situation. On one hand, the Government and the country will lose the much required and valued foreign exchange. On the other hand, the lower-end of our society will not be able to meet their ends because tourism was one of the major income earnings for most people on the coastal line and even the central part of the country and on the eastern coast as well. But, today, all that is going to be devastated. The cancellations mentioned by me are now in a region of about 20 per cent and arrivals have gone down by 20 per cent. The important thing is, there will be no bookings for the next year. For the next six months, there will not be any bookings. This industry is going to have a severe beating. All those people who have invested will find it very difficult to service their loans and also to sustain employment.

We have trained about 6,500 young boys and girls every year in the industry. That was one of the programmes for getting employment for the younger generation. Now all that may not take place. Those who got trained will not stay here. They will go abroad. The Middle East is waiting with open arms to take all those trained boys and girls into their hotel industry, so are places like the Maldives, Singapore, Malaysia and so on. So, this is a very serious situation. On the employment side, we are going to lose; on the foreign exchange side, we are going to lose and also the lower income groups will not be able to earn their estimated income. So, this is a very sad situation.

Therefore, at least within the next couple of days, I hope those who are not here today in Parliament would realize that they are not recognized as the Government both by the international community and Sri Lanka and decide to hand over the reign to the Hon. Ranil

Wickremesinghe, who was the lawful Prime Minister appointed by the President of this country.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana. You have seven minutes.

[6.10p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member. As very correctly mentioned by my good Friend, the Hon. Hector Appuhamy, in early October, the popular travel magazine Lonely Planet named Sri Lanka, our resplendent island nation, as the best travel destination in the world for 2019. This was a promising turn for our country, of which tourism is a significant economic contributor amounting to 11 per cent of our GDP.

But then, on October 26th, President Maithripala Sirisenas backdoor move, which now with hindsight can be clearly summarized being meted not in the best interests of the country at heart, but due to petty personal and fundamental differences with the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, the leader of the UNP, has now led us to this crisis. Almost immediately after President Sirisenas unbefitting move, travel advisories were issued by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada with many more expected to follow if this crisis continues.

About a week later, Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau launched in London a new brand and tagline of Sri Lanka tourism titled So Sri Lanka. Hon. Presiding Member, it is frankly disappointing to note to this House

289 290

that the irony of the tagline could not be more distinct taking into account the happenings in the last month.

As is being widely reported in the media and through personal accounts of our citizens, the aftereffects of October 26th are beginning to appear. One very noticeable aftereffect is the obvious drop in the arrival of tourists and the sheer lack of occupancy in hotels around our country. I need not remind this House that December is the peak season for Sri Lanka tourism and the effect that October 26th is having on this industry, which relies on 11 per cent of our GDP, is nothing short of catastrophic.

Sir, there are numerous reports of hotels reporting cancellation up to 30-35 per cent of reservations, and to put this into perspective, the "Times of India" reported recently that one-third of travellers, that is, 2,000 of the 6,000 average tourists from Tamil Nadu, have cancelled their trips to Sri Lanka stating, Panic-stricken tourists are cancelling their trips to Sri Lanka due to the ongoing political crisis, and tour operators are reporting the spurt of cancellations has been the highest since the end of the civil war.

Further, there are additional concerns about future bookings which are extremely slow for the winter season, where tourists from the Northern Hemisphere flock to our equatorial paradise to enjoy their hiatus. So Sri Lanka!, Hon. Presiding Member.

However, this false complacency cannot last longer. The IMF has delayed the release of the 250-million-dollar tranche of a US Dollar 1.5 billion IMF extended loan facility due to pending political clarity.

There is a looming danger of the suspension of GSP Plus trade concessions. The agreement on a US Dollars 460 million grant by the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which was to be signed in December is likely to be delayed. Further, last week, international credit rating agency, Moodys, downgraded Sri Lankas sovereign debt from B1 to B2 stating, The decision is driven by the view that ongoing tightening in external and domestic financing conditions and low reserve adequacy, exacerbated by a political crisis which seems likely to have a lasting impact on policy even if ostensibly resolved quickly. This statement by Moodys is very important, as they say that even if this crisis is resolved over the next few weeks, it will still leave a lasting impact on our economy for a very long time. This is due to the fact that this completely unnecessary crisis has worsened Sri Lankas ability to raise new funds to meet its prevailing debt service obligations.

Further, probably most importantly, due to this crisis, there is little or no possibility for a government to present an Appropriation Bill for 2019, something that this House would have concluded by now had this crisis not erupted. This has far-reaching effects, as in essence without a Budget passed in this Parliament, all Government services will be effectively shutdown from January 1st 2019.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana) Okay. This includes the Consolidated Fund of the Treasury. This is, of course, taking into account that the UPFA shall not continue to act in shameful violation of the Constitution, and continue to appropriate, borrow and tax illegally even in 2019.

Therefore, Hon. Presiding Member, it is the duty of this House to urge and plead His Excellency the President Maithripala Sirisena to have the best interests of the country at heart, and that of its citizens, and put aside all petty and irrelevant issues which should not come in the way of governance, and resolve this conflict at the very earliest for the sake of our Motherland, Sri Lanka.

Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you very much. The next speaker is the Hon. Ranjith Aluwihare. You have six minutes.
