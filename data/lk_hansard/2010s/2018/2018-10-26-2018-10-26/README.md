: : ACTIVE LIABILITY MANAGEMENT ACT: RESOLUTION [11.05 a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Finance and Mass Media) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I move,

That this Parliament resolves that a sum not exceeding Rs. 310 billion may be raised by way of loans, in or outside Sri Lanka for such purposes as specified in the provisions of Section 3 of the Active Liability Management Act, No.8 of 2018. (Cabinet approval signified.)

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, let me take the Floor by assuring that our Government has a clear strategy to address the issue of our local and foreign debts. Of course, the debt issue in our hand was a legacy of pre-2015 mismanagement and therefore let me begin my short remarks by underlining the colossal burden that was left on our shoulders.

This Government took over a very fragile and structurally imbalanced economy. In fact, I would go as far to say that the economy was in shambles when our Government took over in 2015. The economic growth in the post-war years was dominated by foreign debts funded construction boom. The then Government went on a spending spree on infrastructure investments, many of which yielded a little or no returns. The Government at the time expanded its unproductive expenditure in such an irresponsible manner without proper attention to developing revenue sources to meet such expenditure. As a result, there developed a fiscal time bomb, which this Government is in the process of diffusing. Again, as I said earlier, we inherited a fiscal time bomb, and over the last three and a half years, we have been in the process of defusing the bomb successfully. For example, 77 per cent of the share of our foreign debt servicing in 2019 and 2020 will be on pre-January 2015 borrowings.

, 2019 2020 , 77 2015 . . 2,845 . , 63 2015 . 2019 - - 4,285 .

77 . 2020 3,768 . 77 . 2021 3,441 . 83 . 2022 3,840 . 71 . 2023 2,250 . 71 . 2024 2,218 . 69 . 2025 4,275 . 33 . , ; 2015 , , , .

The Sovereign Bonds issued during 2010-2014, amounted to US Dollars 4.5 billion; that is US Dollars 4,500 million, will be maturing in 2019-2022 period. In dollar terms, our annual interest payments on these Sovereign Bonds would exceed US Dollars 300 million.

Sir, much of the increase in borrowing by the previous Government was from expensive external commercial debt, which requires investments in productive assets. Unfortunately, no productive investments were mechanized, instead of draining our resources to utter wastage. Fortunately for this country, in 2015, the direction of that disastrous path took a different direction and now for the first time in history, we have a clear approach to manage our debts.

Therefore, we are fully cognizant of our outstanding debt liabilities denominated in foreign and local currencies. In view of the necessity for institutionalizing a legal framework for managing the countrys public debt profile in a prudent manner that brings debt sustainability and macroeconomic stability, the Parliament enacted the Active Liability Management Act in March, 2018. Similar Acts have been introduced in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines with successful results.

I must say this was the first such legal framework in our country by which we introduced a prudent and pre-emptive debt management strategy. The Act provides the legal framework for the Government to raise loans in or outside Sri Lanka for management of public debt in terms of relevant laws such as the Monetary Law Act, the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance, Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance and the Foreign Loans Act.

The active liability management framework of Sri Lanka is focused on acting in advance to re-finance and pre-finance debt repayable beyond the financial year covered under the annual Budget.

Our liability management strategy is designed to ease the repayment of debt in the future and to ensure that such repayments are done at the lowest possible cost in

1833 1834

2018 26

line with the Governments cash flow, prevailing and expected interest rates and the future maturities of public debt.

The Active Liability Management Framework was duly approved by the Cabinet and once the Resolution is passed by the Parliament to raise Rs. 310 billion by way of loans in or outside Sri Lanka for Active Liability Management, it would provide much needed legal framework to adopt strategies depending on the market conditions.

The Government and the Central Bank have already initiated action within the Active Liability Management Strategy formulated within the legal framework set out under the Act to diversify market based foreign funding sources to jurisdictions, such as the Chinese Panda Market, Japanese Samurai Market and the very liquid Sukuk Market.

We are confident that the Liability Management Strategy being adapted would enable the debt management authorities to proactively address refinancing requirements in coming years and to extend maturity duration of both domestic and foreign debt in a cost-effective manner.

I seek your indulgence to pass the Resolution today with majority endorsement. Thank you. . . Question proposed. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Item No. 2 - the Hon. Kabir Hashim, the Minister of Highways and Road Development. [.. 11.13] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim - Minister of Highways and Road Development) Hon.

Ministry of Highways and Road Development. We are moving this Resolution under the Active Liability Management Act to get approval to raise Rs. 310 billion of new borrowings. This is the first time, such a Resolution has been brought in this Parliament and I will tell you why.

This is Treasury management in general. If we have to pay back a loan of US Dollars 500 million in January of next year and we know that the interest rates are going up by January of next year, we must then try to accommodate it either by paying it off early or else try and re-configure that loan so that we can pay it down the road when the interest rates come down. So active management of that liability is important.

State Minister, I disagree with your point for the mere reason that until 1992, when estates were handed over to private companies, the estate workers' wages were determined by the Wages Board. If that had continued up to today, the wage of an estate worker would have been much more than this Rs. 500. Also, what you claim here to be Rs. 940 is inclusive of the contribution of the estate management to the EPF and the ETF. Actually, you cannot add that to the daily wage. That 15 per cent is also added when they calculate the day's wage at Rs. 940.

Not only that. Sir, the other point is, the plantation companies are claiming that from 1992 onwards, from the day they took over the estates, the estates have been running at a loss. If that is the case, if the estates have been incurring losses, for the past so many years, how have they been running these estates? So, there is a big doubt that has been created. Therefore, we, as trade unionists and Representatives of the plantation community, are not prepared to accept what the companies are claiming.

1875 1876

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Thank you. Sir, I think the Hon. Member is making a valid point.

But, what I am saying is, always there can be negotiations on the salary. That is how collective agreements are negotiated. You have, on the one hand, the employer and on the other, the employee. I am not saying that you should agree to that Rs. 940 or that you should agree to the EPF and the ETF being added to that Rs. 940. All what I am saying is, let us be patient. There is no need to panic, protest, burn things down or do anything like that. I am not saying that you are doing it. But, there has to be some negotiations because there are two sides to the story. As you very well know, under Government management, the plantations were making utter loses. I do not have to say what happened to the JEDB, the Janawasama and all that. There is also a genuine case made by the trade unions and the poor plantation workers; I am not saying no. All what I am saying is, let us agree to negotiate and come to some compromise where it is possible to pay the employees a decent wage and the employees are happy with the wage they get.

Thank you very much, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. Vijitha Herath. You have 30 minutes. [.. 2.22] ( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) , , " . . . , ?" . . " . . ." . . ? . , . " . ." . () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) , . . . . ,-

, 2018.09.21 Hyatt International Mr. Peter Fulton . , ? ? "" ? . , .

Sir, owing to the fact that I do not have enough time at this moment, I would table* this letter to be included in Hansard. This is an official document sent by the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media to Hyatt International. On what basis Mr. Thilan Wijesinghe got the authority to sign this, if the Cabinet of Ministers have not designated as to whom the case should be referred to? You are talking of Hyatt International on one side and Hotel Hilton is in litigation on the other side. How on earth can you go for privatization when there is litigation?

These are the matters that you should look into. When you give wishful thinking that revenue is coming and suddenly when that is not happening those are the multiple problems that we are artificially trying to create. These are the answers that we require. There is no point of talking about Trump. He has got to do what is good for America and we have to do what is good for Sri Lanka. So, on that basis, all I want to do is to ensure that we kick-start or rekindle the economy that was bubbling during May to July in 2017. Let us get back and ensure that we basically bring back that prosperity that has vanquished in the last couple of months. Together we can make that difference. All what we want to do is to ensure that the economy is strong enough to withstand the vicissitudes that we have got to go through.

Certainly, the dollar is now becoming stronger and currencies in Asia are having a tough time. But, "tough time" does not mean that that is the end of the economy. We have to forecast this. These are not unknown things.

When Trump came in, he was trumpeting himself that he was going to make an inroad of dollars back into America. These are known by our Central Bankers. When I was the Finance Minister, they were guiding us. We are now certainly running into these problems owing to the fact that the American Government as well as the American Federal Reserve is talking of more intrusive type of an economy that is there. So, these are planned situations. If those are planned, why are we unprepared for this? These are the things on which we have to take corrective actions. So, all I want to do is to ensure that we get back the confidence that the UNP and President Maithripala Sirisena can do this. However, two or three people are getting into the middle and trying to rack the confidence that is there. But, we need to ensure that this cancer is removed and the same confidence that was there between the President and the Prime Minister is re-echoed, brought back and strengthened giving the feeling that they can do it; not that two or three people have misguided and ruined the economy. If you eradicate those issues, you will be back in the correct sandal and be able to move the country forward.

So, as time is becoming a limited factor, I do not want to speak any longer. But, all I want to say is, it is not that you cannot do it, it is whether you want to do it. Together you can make that difference and let us make that happen.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . [ ] , . [.. 3.09] ( ) (The Hon. Indika Anuruddha Herath) , . . .
