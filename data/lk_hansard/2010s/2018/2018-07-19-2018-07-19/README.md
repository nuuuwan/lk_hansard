Sir, Standing Order 11- [Interruption.] , . , [ ] , . Can I read out the Standing Order? The Standing Order No. 11 states, I quote:

The quorum of Parliament required in terms of Article 73 of the Constitution is twenty Members including the person presiding. If at any time the attention of the Speaker or other Member presiding is directed to the fact that a quorum is not present, the Speaker or other Member presiding shall order the division bells to be rung... "

There are no 20 Members in the House now. So, Sir, there is no Quorum in the House.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, there are only 11 Members in the House now. [Interruption.] Okay, I call for the Quorum.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, according to the Standing Orders, you cannot refer to a conduct of a Member of Parliament without a Resolution. The Hon. Member referred to the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, Member of Parliament. There has to be a separate Resolution on the subject for him to refer to the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa. Perhaps, the Hon. Member does not know that there is a Standing Order regarding that that is in existence in this Parliament. I hope the Deputy Secretary-General will advise in the correct way.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) If there is anything against Standing Orders, that will be expunged.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) It is in the Sanding Order that you cannot refer to a Members conduct without a separate Resolution.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, according to Standing Orders, if you refer to a name of a Member and make an allegation against him, you have to bring a separate Resolution against that Member. Now, this Member has violated that Standing Order. So, Sir, you have to advise the Member to act according to Standing Orders. Either you expunge what is in contravention of Standing Orders or warn the Member not to refer to any Member without a Resolution moved by him. The present Adjournment Motion does not refer to any Member.

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Hon. Member, I am willing to accept any abuses thrown at me. But, Sir, that is a very unfair statement he made on the Floor of the House because I have gone and given evidence before the Presidential Commission that investigated the Bond scam. They asked me to come before the Commission and I went and gave evidence. I was willing to go before the Commission without a lawyer. If they want to charge me, they have the right to charge me. But, Hon. Semasinghe, you cannot charge me here in the House. So, do not do that. That was not fair. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Sir, I ask him to withdraw that statement because that is a wrong statement.

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) Hon. Kabir Hashim, you [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] were one of the initiators of the Bond scam of the Central Bank. You

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] went for a breakfast meeting at the Central Bank and planned this on behalf of the Prime Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Sir, my point of Order is that if the Hon. Member accuses me of being involved in the Bond scam, he has to show what proof he has. Otherwise, you have to remove or expunge it because he has thrown an allegation on me saying that I am a rogue.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] Are you going to keep that in Hansard or are you going to remove that?
