Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, what he says is outside the text. Hon. Member, you can raise your matter of Privilege, but you cannot go outside the text.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) What is the point of Order, Hon. Sumanthiran? .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, the Hon. Member has raised a Question of Privilege. Having raised it, he cannot make a speech. That is the point of Order I am raising.

But, I also wish to state that the issue he has raised is, as he himself says, if a Member functions independently, that Member must have a right to speak in Parliament. If he declares himself to be an independent Member, meaning independent of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi, from which he was elected, then the Hon. Speaker can allocate time for him. That has been the tradition. But, so long as he remains a Member of the ITAK, he must fall by the Whip of the ITAK. If he does not fall by the Whip of the ITAK, he will not be allocated any time. I say this on behalf of all the Members of the ITAK, the other fifteen Members of Parliament. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, I will bring this to the notice of the Hon. Speaker. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) What is the point of Order, Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan has raised a very important issue for the second time in the last few months; this is the second time. The Hon. Member of Parliament has requested repeatedly for an opportunity to express his views as a Member of Parliament representing the people who have elected him. The tradition, to which the Hon M.A. Sumanthiran referred to, is totally different. The Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali was deprived of that opportunity when he got up to speak. It was the same, I remember, for the Hon. Gamini Dissanayake and the Hon. G.M. Premachandra. But, the then Hon. Speaker, the Hon. M.H. Mohamed said, I recognize the Member." The time allocated, of course, could be limited on the request of the Whip, but you cannot deprive a Member from expressing his views, for which he has a right.

1341 1342

Secondly, when the Hon. (Dr.) M.L.A.M. Hizbullah was facing a similar situation under the Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff - we, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane and myself, were seated in the Opposition - the then Hon. Speaker ruled that the Hon. (Dr.) M.L.A.M. Hizbullah could speak, but time was allocated only from the allocation for the Opposition. So, I do not think it is fair to deprive the Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan of his right to express his opinion in the House. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) As I said earlier, I will bring this matter to the notice of the Hon. Speaker. ( ) (The Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan, what is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan) , . . , . . 35 . . . , . . , 225 , . . . , ? 70 ,

( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, even after being ruled by the Chair, the Hon. Member keeps on making a speech. He is only entitled to raise a Question of Privilege, he is not entitled to make a speech like this. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Order, please! As I said earlier, I will bring this to the Hon. Speakers attention. - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) It is a good thing that he is getting the support from the Joint Opposition. - [Interruption.] () ( () ) (The Hon.

The share of the economy of these two sectors is huge. 16. The growth in both these sectors are heavily import-dependent. It turns out that access to imported raw materials was a major factor in the growth of the construction industry. In the three years between 2010-2012, the importation of construction material has quadrupled in quantity and value. So, basically, that, in a sense, drove the economy, but it was import-driven. The growth was import-driven, not production-driven. So, that was one of the problems.

Services in import trade relates to retail and wholesale of a whole lot of imported consumer goods.

2015 . 2014 12 . 11. Since May 2012, exports declined not only as a share of GDP, but also in absolute value. , . 2004 . 2004 08. 2012 05 .

Trade to GDP ratio in 2004 was 88 per cent. But, trade to GDP ratio in 2014 had come down to 48 per cent. So, you can imagine how we have fallen. A country such as ours, as small as ours, has to depend on trade. If you take the Singapore export revenue, Singapore, as a small island country without any natural resources has US Dollars 480 billion. But, Sri Lanka is still at US Dollars 15 billion. We have a long way to go. We have to think about being in national policies; to think on one line to whichever party we belong. Since 2015, we have tried to do an export push, we have tried to increase it. I must say, by 2014, exports as a percentage of GDP was only 11 per cent, at its lowest. Our target was 35 per cent. We want to go back to 35 per cent of GDP. I am happy to say and I must thank the Minister, the Hon. Malik Samarawickrama and his able State Minister, the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, they have pushed, in 2017, exports to grow up to US Dollars 17 billion which is 18 per cent of GDP. So, now we are moving forward slowly, but steadily. But, I think, we have a long way to go. Actually, the Hon. Malik Samarawickrama should be appreciated for the hard work he has done. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees)Hon. Minister, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) I am finishing. He has come up with a national export strategy. That is what we need. We need a strategy first, any government needs that, and this national export strategy looks at a few things. One is, to focus on diversification of products and markets which is very important. , . ..

. , . . .

60 garments, . . 22 . .

Secondly, focus on innovation and quality improvement to break into new markets, because if we do not diversify and if we do not have innovation, then we cannot move forward.

Thirdly, address policy and regulatory bottlenecks to drive exports forward. That is why it is taking time. So, we need policy changes.

Finally, I would like to say that the GSP Plus was a great victory. A lot of people do not understand what the Hon. Prime Minister did. He should be respected for the great job he did because GSP Plus brought duty reductions on 6000 plus tariff lines. It also brought in US Dollars 480 million increase in exports to the EU. For example, apparel duties came down from 9.6 per cent to zero. Sea food duties came down from 28 per cent to zero. Fresh processed fruits and vegetable duties came down from 12.5 per cent to zero. Porcelain and ceramic duties came down from 8.4 per cent to zero. Like this, there was a huge win which most people in the country do not really even appreciate.

The world market for exports is heavily concentrated on a few countries. According to the trade map of the International Trade Centre in 2016, there were 228 trading nations that imported goods to the combined value of US Dollars 16 trillion. Five countries alone accounted for 38 per cent of total world imports in 2016. Just five countries! China is the world's second largest importer and India is moving up as a major importer and as an important market for exporters. In fact, it is the fourteenth largest in the world. Their imports have increased sevenfold between 2001 and 2017. They imported around US Dollars 50 billion but now they are importing up to US Dollars 350 billion. Their world's share has increased.

Our neighbour is one of the largest countries and one of the largest markets in the world. So, when we enter into a Free Trade Agreement with them which is advantageous to us, some people think we are committing suicide. But, this is the way to go. Our main export markets are still USA, the UK and India. we have not been able to tap Japan, China, South Korea or Hong Kong. Sri Lanka has to move into these countries because we need to diversify our products. Only then, will Sri Lanka be strong in its export diversification.

I would like to therefore, at this moment, say that the Hon. Malik Samarawickrama has steered his export drive in the proper direction. But, we need to become more

1387 1388

competitive. It is not only through depreciation or devaluing, which is a natural phenomena, but we have to have production costs coming down and we have to look stronger, we have to diversify, we need to have technology and innovation. Those are the new challenges.

At this moment, I would like to thank the Hon. Minister and his State Minister for the good job they have done. Thank you.

The problem that we have in this country at the moment is the language barrier. The EDB went to the Northern Province and conducted the "2000 Exporters" Programme. But it was difficult for us to identify people who actually want to manufacture and export.

So, why do the Hon. Members from the North and East not get together and give this message to the people who produce coconut-based products? . ( . ) (The Hon. I. Charles Nirmalanathan) , , join . ( ) (The Hon.Sujeewa Senasinghe) "2000 Exporters" programme . improve . North-East products . , ; ;
