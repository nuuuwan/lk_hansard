SITTINGS OF THE PARLIAMENT

I

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I move,

"That notwithstanding the provisions of Standing Order No. 7 of the Parliament, and the motions agreed to by Parliament on 08.03.2016, the Parliament shall sit on Monday, February 19 , 2018 and the hours of sitting of Parliament this day shall be 10.00 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. and 1.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.. At 6.30 p.m. Mr. Speaker shall adjourn the Parliament without question put." . . Question put, and agreed to.

II

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I move, "That this Parliament at its rising this day do adjourn until 10.00 a.m. on Monday, February 19, 2018. " . . Question put, and agreed to. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, it was before the days Business started that I wanted to raise this point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) What is it about? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) As you are quite well aware, Sir, either under Personal Explanations or Questions of Privilege which come under Standing Order No. 19, I gave you a document.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Subsequently, you spoke to me and said that it does not fall within both. I do not understand as to how this Parliament does not provide its Members an opportunity to explain when their privileges are impacted. I have been very clearly, emphatically mentioning that I would be making a statement today and on that basis, it was known what was the reason for. I have given a very detailed statement to you. So, I am lost for an answer. After 24 years in Parliament, I see an absolute case of injustice that is being meted out. On the preliminary basis, I must be told as to why it is not considered and the answer that was given was a flimsy answer. Apparently, that is what your staff has mentioned. So, I am ready to read out my statement on Privileges and I would greatly appreciate if you could give me the opportunity to go forward.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , . , it does not fall within Questions of Privilege or Personal Explanations. It is very clear. . . - [ ] . . Standing Orders - Privilege matter - it does not fall within Questions of Privilege.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, you have to protect our rights. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Of course. Definitely, I am doing that. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, you must listen to what we are saying.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, I am fully listening to you; I respect you. But today is not the opportune time and I cannot allow you to make that statement under Standing Orders.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I very respectfully and humbly ask you, where does it not fall within the purview of Privileges? If you tell me which page and what substance, I will eradicate that.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) It will not fall within the issue of Privileges. That is the reason.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Does it affect me only? ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) You wanted it to come under Privileges.

147 148

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, I did not write it under Privileges. I had it open. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) But your letter clearly states that it is a Privilege issue. "Privilege issue" . . . argue . Standing Orders allow . .

[4.48p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) Hon. Presiding Member, with regard to the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. S. Shritharan, I would like to place on record that this Thousand Rural Bridges Project is done in consultation with the Northern Provincial Council. It is not a programme

203 204

initiated through the Divisional Secretary. But I take the concerns raised by the Hon. Shritharan seriously.

There are 86 rural bridges being constructed in the Northern Province and I feel that we need to engage the Hon. Members of Parliament of those particular Districts in doing this. You have also raised certain issues on certain bridges that have been constructed. The overall project is funded by the United Kingdom and there is a local collaborator who works with them.

. ( . ) (The Hon. S. Shritharan) , . , ; . . . , " ?" . . , . . , !

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Member, this has nothing to do with either the transport sector or the Ministry of Highways. This is the project that was initiated to empower thousand rural bridges. Anyway, I take the concerns you have raised. I have a list of rural bridges to be constructed. In the Northern Province, there are 86 bridges and I will give you all the details rather than mentioning them all at this forum. But, I believe that we can have a better consultative process with regard to the issues which you have raised.

In addition to that, Hon. Member, you were complaining about a British company, which is doing construction in the North without knowledge of the ecology there. I would like to say that this is done by having a meeting once a month with the participation of the Chief Secretary of each Province with my Secretary. So, if you have any issues with regard to rural bridges, I will call for a discussion specifically to deal with the Northern Province. Hereafter, when they decide on what bridges are to be built in the North, I will see that all the Members of Parliament of those particular Districts are informed and there is a far better consultative process.

. ( . ) (The Hon. S. Shritharan) , .

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) I will read it for you. . ( . ) (The Hon. S. Shritharan) , ! , , ? . , , ?

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) It comes under the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government and it is done in consultation with the Northern Provincial Council.

. ( . ) (The Hon. S. Shritharan) ! ! , . , !

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Member, I am surprised to hear that he is not aware of it because once a month he participates in the Consultative Meeting with the Secretary to the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government. Hon. Member, I do not want to go in for a confrontational dialogue with you. So, we will look into the issues which you have raised and move forward.

. ( . ) (The Hon. S. Shritharan) , , ?

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) We have Local Government Elections on the 10th of February. So, we will call for a meeting before the 28th of February. Hon. Member, do you want me to read the list of bridges or shall I table it?

205 206

. ( . ) (The Hon. S. Shritharan) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Then, I will table* the list of bridges together with the background information.
