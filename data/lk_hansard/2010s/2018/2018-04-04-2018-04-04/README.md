asked Minister of Industry and Commerce:

(a) Will he inform this House -

(i) the industrial plants that have been established under the Proposal No. 201 of the Budget 2016 that proposes to set up a large number of environmentally sensitive industries in specifically identified areas such as Puttalam, Hambantota and Kilinochchi;

(ii) the indices used to identify environmentally sensitive industries;

(iii) the environmentally sensitive industries located in Export Processing Zones of Sri Lanka and outside of them; and

(iv) the measures recommended by the Government to prevent adverse effects on environment from the aforesaid industries?

(b) If not, why?

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Hon. Speaker, the Answer is as follows:

(a) (i) Though it was proposed in the Budget 2016 to facilitate establishment of highly-environmentally sensitive industries in designated areas, it could not be pursued since no allocation has been made by the General Treasury for this purpose.

(ii) Identification of industries as to whether

they are environmentally-sensitive or not is a subject that falls under the purview of Central Environmental Authority. Industries are permitted to be established only on production of clearance certificate from the Central Environmental Authority.

(iii) Industries in Export Processing Zones do

not come under the purview of the Ministry

1165 1166

of Industry and Commerce. There are hundreds of industries outside the Export Processing Zones and all are not registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. It is, therefore, not possible to answer this Question.

(iv) Generally, the Government does not allow the establishment of industries that cause damage to the environment. When environmentally sensitive industries are established, the Government takes measures to ensure that counter measures are taken to prevent pollution of the environment.

(b) Does not arise. ( ) (The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane) 205) 205 ?

- Vote of No Confidence on the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister and Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, - Whereas Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Prime Minister, has severed the Central Bank of Sri Lanka from the Ministry of Finance contrary to the norm and brought it under himself with the motive of committing a fraud associated with Treasury Bonds;

And whereas he has proposed a non-citizen of Sri Lanka named Mr. Arjun Mahendran, who is shrouded with an infamous track record and a conflict of interests, to the post of Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka;

And whereas he has been obviously associated with the Bond fraud which occurred at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, which is the most colossal financial fraud in the world in the recent era;

And whereas he has made an attempt to save the fraudsters involved in that fraud by appointing the Pitipana Committee comprising his political cronies to save them;

And whereas he has misled the Parliament by making a special statement on 17th March, 2015 to protect the said fraudsters involved in the Treasury Bond fraud and to conceal the true facts;

And whereas he has made an attempt to exonerate the accused persons through the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), which had been investigating the Treasury Bond fraud by that time, by removing a Member of Parliament of the United National Party from the said Committee and replacing the said Member with another new Member to function as a Member of the said Committee;

And whereas he has influenced upon the Members of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) on how to act regarding the Treasury Bond Fraud while the said Committee was investigating the said fraud;

And whereas he has recommended to the Cabinet of Ministers to make Mr. P. Samarasiri, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, who was revealed by the Presidential Commission as he has been involved in the Treasury Bond Fraud, to an Advisor post at the Ministry of Finance;

And whereas he has made a herculean effort to re-appoint Mr. Arjun Mahendran to the post of Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka while the President was taking measures to appoint some other person in place of Mr. Arjun Mahendran, who had become an accused in the Treasury Bond Fraud;

And whereas he has given a post of Advisor to Mr. Arjun Mahendran at his Ministry even after he had lost the post of Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka because he being an accused person of the Treasury Bond Fraud;

1187 1188

And whereas he has made way for Mr. Arjun Mahendran to go abroad and evade appearance before the Court by refraining, until after Mr. Arjun Mahendran left Sri Lanka, from obtaining a court order to prevent him from leaving the country;

And whereas he has violated the pieces of legislation, namely:-

(i) Finance Act, No. 58 of 1949

(ii) Exchange Control Act, No. 24 of 1953

(iii) Local Treasury Bills Ordinance No. 8 of 1923

(iv) Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance No. 7 of 1937

(v) Financial Reserve Funds Ordinance No. 16 of 1944

(vi) Banking Act, No. 30 of 1988

(vii) Contingency Fund Act, No. 35 of 1979

(viii) Prevention of Money Laundering Act, No. 5 of 2006

(ix) Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006,

which are quite important pieces of legislation for the economy and for the financial control of the country, by taking over the Central Bank of Sri Lanka under his sway and exercising powers under such statutes, knowing that powers under such statutes can only be exercised by the Minister of Finance;

And whereas he has created a huge economic crisis by keeping under him the Ministry of Economic Affairs, taking control of the Ministry of Finance through the Economic Management Committee and keeping the Central Bank of Sri Lanka under him by managing the national economy for the past three years, resulting the retardation of economic growth, collapse of the share market, escalation of rate of inflation uncontrollably, increase of interest rates rapidly and withdrawal of investments by foreign investors, thereby putting people into hardship;

And whereas he has tarnished the image of the country before the international community by failing to take immediate measures to provide protection to Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim people during the unrest that occurred in the Kandy District while holding the portfolio of Minister of Law and Order, resulting in loss of lives and damage to property;

That this Parliament resolves that it has no confidence in Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghes ability to function as Prime Minister and as a Minister of the Cabinet and as well as the Government in which he holds the office of Prime Minister any longer.

There is no confidence in the Prime Minister. Whether the House has confidence in the Prime Minister or not, is a very serious issue.

-2058 0( - " " This article written by Shamindra Ferdinando appears in the "Midweek Review" of todays "The Island" newspaper. Under the caption, "The Great Central Bank robbery", it gives the sequence of the events. I quote:

Jan.8, 2015: Presidential election Jan 9, 2015: Maithripala Sirisena sworn in as President Jan 9, 2015: Ranil Wickremesinghe sworn in as Prime Minister

"Jan.23, 2015: Then Finance Minister Ravi K recommended Arjuna Mahendan as Governor, CBSL

Jan. 26, 2015: President Sirisena appointed Singaporean Mahendran as Governor, CBSL.

Feb. 26, 2015: Mahendran met ministers, Ravi K, Kabir H and UNP Chairman Malik S at CBSL, allegedly to discuss a massive fund requirement of Rs 18 bn.

No one will deny it. All of you have accepted the fact you all went to the CBSL allegedly to discuss the massive fund requirement of Rs. 18 billion.

It further states, I quote:

"Feb 27, 2015: First bond scam perpetrated. Within hours, the top financial sector knew how Primary Dealer Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) had carried out the operation in connivance with Mahendran, father-in-law of Arjun Aloysius, owner of PTL. The PTL is a fully owned subsidiary of Perpetual Capital (Pvt) Limited, owned by Geoffrey Joseph Aloysius and Arjun Joseph Aloysius.

Massive media coverage of the bond scam sent shock waves through the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government."

The biggest fraud that happened in the Central Bank in our country was exposed to the world.

I further quote:

March 10, 2015. Wickremesinghe, following consultations with Sirisena, appointed a three-member committee to probe the issuance of treasury bonds. The committee comprised attorney-at-law Gamini

Pitipana, attorney-at-law Mahesh Kalugampitiya and attorney-at-law Chandimal Mendis.

It was a pro-UNP Committee.

It further goes on to state, quote:

May 21, 2015: The Joint Opposition made representations to Speaker Chamal R demanding a special debate on the bond scam.

May 22, 2015: Special Sub Committee of COPE appointed to probe the Feb 29, 2015 issuance of treasury bonds. The 13-member Sub Committee had its inaugural meeting on the same day under the chairmanship of Dew Gunasekera.........

.................May 26,2015: Probe commenced with Treasury Secretary Dr.R.H.S.Samaratunga and Director General, Department of Treasury M.S.D.Ranasiri being questioned.

June 18,23. 2015: CoPE questioned Mahendran. The Singaporean was the last to appear before the committee.

June 25, 2015: Wickremesinghe alleged CoPE denied him of an opportunity to appear before the watchdog.

June 26,2015: Sirisena dissolved Parliament to thwart CoPE presenting its report on treasury bond scam. General election set for Aug.17,2015."

2054 03 378 Appointment of Mr. Arjuna Mahendran as Governor of Central Bank 23(2

It states, I quote:

"(1) At the time of being appointed the Governor of the Central Bank, was Mr. Arjuna Mahendran a citizen of the Republic of Sri Lanka?

(2) Is he a citizen of Sri Lanka at present?

(3) Is he a citizen of any other country?

(4) Has he taken/made an oath/affirmation to any other country, renouncing loyalty to the Republic of Sri Lanka?

(5) Has he taken/made the oath/affirmation required by the laws of Sri Lanka before embarking upon the duties of the Office of Governor?

(6) Did he have the capacity to take/make the required oath/affirmation in view of any conflicting oath/ affirmation to any other country?

(7) Does the Hon. Prime Minister agree that there are ample grounds for invoking Section 16 (c) of the Monetary Law which declares that the Governor can be removed if he has done any act or thing which, in the opinion of the President, is manifestly opposed to the objects and interests of the Central Bank and the Constitution of Sri Lanka?"

The Prime Minister answered the Question I raised that day, but he never answered these key questions I posed.

Today we are in 2018. After three years of public agitation, professionals' agitation, Parliamentary agitation, reports and commissions, no action has been taken to bring back Arjuna Mahendran to court. The Prime Minister and the Government have failed. The Prime Minster and the Government allowed him to leave the country.

[10.34a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Speaker, we are debating today a Motion of No-Confidence against no less a person than the Prime Minister and the Motion substantially deals with the question of corruption. Corruption has been the worst disease that has afflicted our country. There was a time when there was no complaint of corruption. But, in recent years, corruption has been the worst disease. As I said before, that has afflicted the country and it must be eradicated completely. There can be no question about it. The roots of corruption must be eradicated, and I think there is a general agreement that politicians probably constitute the roots of corruption. I think that needs to be addressed and that needs to be eradicated. Any complaint of corruption must be fully investigated and the severest punishment must be awarded to persons found guilty of corruption. There can be no compromise whatever in regard to that position.

In regard to the Central Bank Bond scam, consequent to investigations, two persons are presently in custody. There has been a warrant issued against another person and investigations are proceeding. No one should be spared. The rule of law should be applicable to everyone whoever he might be: the rule of law can be no respecter of persons.

I will now refer to the Motion before the House, which is the Motion of No-Confidence against the Prime Minister based substantially on corruption. The Motion of No-Confidence seeks to implicate the Prime Minister with the Bond scam. Statements of actions by the Prime Minister of a general nature are sought to be used in an attempt to implicate the Prime Minister with the Bond scam. The wording of the Motion and the timing of the Motion are indicative of the pursuit of a political agenda rather than fixing responsibility in regard to the Bond scam.

The question must be raised as to why the wording is so vague, lacking in any specific charge against the Prime Minister in regard to the fraud pertaining to the Bond scam per se. Why should this Motion be brought now, at this point of time, is another question that I would like to pose to the House. The wording is too loose and too general in nature. It could be that the Prime Minister is facing this situation because of the confidence he placed in someone who has betrayed him. But, where is the evidence or charge against the Prime Minister of involvement in the Bond scam per se? Is the wording of the Motion so loose and so general because of lack of specific material against the Prime Minister in regard to the Bond scam? And, if that is so, in my submission, the Motion lacks credibility.

In regard to the timing of the Motion, Sir, this Bond scam occurred three years ago. It has been the subject of total public focus for a long period of time, from early 2015. Why has this Motion of No-Confidence been brought against the Prime Minister only now? I have a duty Sir, to answer some of the questions I have raised. I want to pose the question whether this Motion against the Prime Minister is the first step in a plan to bring down totally and completely the present Government. The President, His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena, was elected in January, 2015. The Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, was elected in August, 2015. They were elected on a certain mandate. What was that mandate? Firstly, the resolution of the national question which has plagued this country for the past 70 years. We have had a very cruel and wicked war that had raged in this country for a thirty-year period. The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution was enacted in 1988. It is found to be inadequate, insufficient and ineffective. During President Premadasas time, there were steps to bring about new constitutional proposals. There was the Mangala Moonesinghe Select Committee, and there was a Report of that Select Committee with substantial consensus. Unfortunately, President Premadasa did not have a two-thirds majority and he was assassinated.

During President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas time, there were various steps taken from 1994 until the August, 2000 Constitutional Proposals. They were quite advanced and a very substantial improvement on what existed. Unfortunately, she had no two-thirds majority in Parliament and she could not get that through.

Then, during President Mahinda Rajapaksas time, there was the All-Party Representative Committee appointed by

1203 1204

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

President Mahinda Rajapaksa. An excellent speech that he made at the inaugural meeting of the All-Party Representative Committee and the Experts Committee. Much work was done. President Mahinda Rajapaksa made several public commitments in regard to new Constitutional Proposals. He made commitments to the international community, to the Secretary-General of the UN and to world leaders. Eventually, there were the Prof. Tissa Vitharana Proposals, which were also a great advance on what existed earlier.

Sir, the second item I would like to mention as a part of the mandate that was granted to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was to uphold democracy in this country and avoid this country moving towards totalitarianism and dictatorship. The enactment of the Nineteenth Amendment in this Parliament was the first step in that direction.

I think the third item in that mandate of significance was uplifting the economy so as to give our people a better quality of life, and eradication of corruption and waste was one aspect of that matter. These were the main issues during the campaign.

The President and the Prime Minister were elected on the democratic verdict of the people for certain fixed periods of time under the Constitution. The opposite camp was defeated in both the Elections. Everyone knows who were defeated. What was the mandate the people gave? I think, Sir, the mandate the people gave is best reflected in the opening address made by His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena when he addressed Parliament on the 01st of September, 2015 when he outlined and made an official Statement on Government Policy in Parliament.

Sir, I would like to read from that Statement of Policy defining the mandate, which His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena made in Parliament. The English text of the address to Parliament by His Excellency the President states, I quote:

I presume that this new Parliament marks an important turning point in the Sri Lankan political history. Since we gained Independence, we had experiences only about coalition governments formed by one main party with the support of other small parties..

He referred to the fact that in this Parliament the two main Parties have come together. It further states, I quote:

The main objective of the consensual government that is formed based on the concept of national government is to build reconciliation among all the ethnic groups and achieve social and economic development simultaneously and achieve a high human development enabling us to face the new world that will dawn by 2020 and to face the national and international challenges in the similar manner.

He went on to say, I quote:

Hon. Speaker, the identity of a nation or a country is based on its Constitution. That is why a Constitution is considered supreme. During the 60 years after Independence, we have adopted three

Constitutions. Yet, it is unfortunate that we have not been able to adopt a Constitution which enables all of us to agree as a single nation.

His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena clearly stated that we have not been able to agree upon a Constitution which made us a nation.

During the course of his speech he further said, - I will avoid quoting the exact words to save time, Sir. - We, Parliamentarians comprising of communities that are Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Burgher, Malay and Adivasis must live in harmony. There must be a reconciliation. We must coexist and I, as President am dedicated to the achievement of these objectives. He concluded his speech, Sir, on the same lines.

I quote:

"From now on, I make an appeal to all of you, with respect, to pay your attention, as to how the consensus-based co-operation of both the people's representatives and all the parties that represent Parliament founded on the collaboration of the two of major political parties could be utilized in favour of the progress and forward march of the nation in a way the proper political culture which is being developed is further established."

He advocated that both the Parties come together in order to constitute the people of this country - of the Nation - and to give them a new Constitution.

I will not quote extensively from that speech, Sir, for lack of time. I will move on to my next point.

At the Local Authorities Elections held in February, 2018, a new political formation, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, has done better than the Presidents SLFP or the UPFA or the Prime Ministers UNP or the UNF. It is our view that inadequate performance by the Government in the first half of their term was the cause of that result. If they performed better in the remaining two-and-a-half years, public disenchantment can change. Unfortunately, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna does not want that to happen. They want to first defeat the Prime Minister and the next target will be the President. They want the Government brought down. We want the Government to implement the mandate given to it by the country in January and August, 2015. In these circumstances, how can we possibly support this No-Confidence Motion, Sir, when, particularly in relation to the Bond scam, the Motion does not reveal anything specific against the Prime Minister? The true intentions of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna are shrouded in an environment of prejudice based upon the Bond scam. We cannot fall a victim to such machinations and allow ourselves to be used to achieve their political objectives.

We would call upon them to cooperate in the achievement of what is contained in the mandate that was granted to both the President and the Prime Minister. All of you in the Joint Opposition or most of you were Members of the Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga Government; you were Members of the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government and you were members of the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitharanas All-Party Representatives Committee. You played a role in the formulation of all those constitutional proposals. Many of you have participated in that; President Mahinda Rajapaksa has

1205 1206

[ ]

2018 0(

definitely participated both in President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas Proposals and the Proposals during his own time.

We, therefore, have to cooperate, Sir, in regard to the making of a new Constitution. This Parliament has adopted a Resolution converting itself into a Constitutional Assembly unanimously with no one opposing it to frame a new Constitution. We have done much work on that; the Steering Committee, the Subcommittees have come up with their Reports. That process must continue if you want this country to succeed economically. We are a small country, but we are both militarily and economically very strategically located in the Indian Ocean region. We can become the economic hub of the Indian Ocean area. We can have access to wide and large markets if our economy can improve and our economy can improve only if there is genuine peace in this country and if all the people in this country; whether they be Tamils, Muslims, Sinhalese, Burghers, Malays or whomever are able to live as equal citizens. So, I think Sir, your duty must be to cooperate with the Government and join together in keeping with the unanimous resolution we adopted to frame a new Constitution and we should move forward in regard to that matter. That is necessary in the interest of this country and we have to work together.

Sir, there is a view that is sought to be spread very unfortunately that we are trying to support the UNP against the SLFP. I want to put on record certain facts to disprove that. Over a period of time, in 1960 March, the UNP was installed in power. They did not have an absolute majority. We voted with the SLFP to defeat the 1960 March Government of the UNP. In 1960 July, the SLFP came into power. Between 1965 and 1970 we cooperated with the UNP to run a Government. In 1994 when Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was the SLFP candidate for Presidency and Mr. Gamini Dissanayake, for whom I have a lot of personal regard and respect, was the UNP candidate, we supported Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the SLFP candidate. In 1999 when Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was the SLFP candidate against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, we supported Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga against the UNP. The late Mr. S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike was the first political Sinhala leader to sign a pact with the acknowledged Tamil leader, Mr. S. J. V. Chelvanayakam in 1957. He wanted to establish regional councils and he was prepared to create a Tamil-speaking region in the North-East under the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact.

When the UNP Government sought to deprive Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike of her civic rights in the 1977 Parliament we resolutely defended Mrs. Bandaranaike and opposed that Motion. We were under great pressure from UNP leaders not to defend her. I remember I was a new Member of Parliament having come to Parliament for the first time in 1977. I myself very strongly defended her.

Therefore Sir, the view that we are with the UNP and against the SLFP has no foundation whatever. My late

leader Mr. S. J. V. Chelvanayakam always told me, "Sampanthan, we must work with any Sinhala political party, with the confidence and support of the Sinhala people, prepared to resolve our question."

In that respect, probably the SLFP has a greater contact with the Sinhala people than even the UNP. So, we are concerned, Sir, in the interests of this country, in the interests of all the people in this country in working together with the two main political parties, we would like all of us to come together. I will make an appeal to the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena and the Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma, who are senior SLFP members, we must come together and resolve this problem that the country is facing. This country has a different future; this country has a different destination. We must not lose our way. We must bring about permanent peace in this country, permanent amity in this country and permanent unity in this country. Constitute the people of this country the Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims, the Burghers, the Malays into a Sri Lankan nation and move forward towards prosperity. If we do not want to do that and if we want to falter, then nobody can save you and eventually nobody will save you.

So, I would like to appeal, Sir, to all my Friends in this House, not to go against the verdict of the people that was given in 2015 to both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, but to come together in a spirit of cooperation in the best interest of this country to resolve this countrys vital issues.

I thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Okay, Sir.

Money supply was brought under control with credit to the private sector moderating to a stable 14.7 per cent at the end of 2017 from 21.0 per cent a year ago. Market interest rates have declined by over 150 basis points during the last 18 months with the Prime Lending Rate falling from 12.5 per cent in mid-September, 2016 to 10.8 per cent by mid-March 2018. Already robust improvements in foreign investments with FDIs reaching a record level of US Dollars 1.7 billion in 2017, the highest since Independence, continued strong foreign interest in Sri Lankan equity and debt markets as well.

Export earnings also reached a record US Dollars 11.4 billion, growing by 10.2 per cent in 2017 enabled by GSP Plus. Greater improvements can be expected with the completion of trade agreements with India and China in addition to the recently signed FTA with Singapore.

The unemployment rate, as I mentioned earlier, has declined and in the fourth quarter of 2017, listed corporate earnings grew by 17.4 per cent. Even with adjustments for one-off earnings, the corporate profit growth was 8.7 per cent, indicating positive underlying economic activity in the economy. These macroeconomic gains - this is also important - were achieved whilst increasing public investment in social services. , , The Governments expenditure on education, higher education and skills development has increased from 1.9 per cent in 2014 to 2.4 per cent in 2017; 205(

1211 1212

2 ( 2020 4 Similarly, the expenditure on public health has increased from 1.39 per cent in 2014 to 1.74 per cent in 2017.

And finally, Sir, very briefly I would also like to just remind this House how the Prime Minister personally gave - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, you got extra five minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, I do not want to take too much of their time because those Hon. Members also have a lot to say.

The Hon. Prime Minister gave leadership to the Constitutional reform process and the transitional justice process. The Hon. Sampathan quoted a little while ago from the address to Parliament by the President having inaugurated the Constitutional Assembly on 01st September, 2015. The Hon. Prime Minister gave leadership to the process with vigour and dedication. Therefore, I request, as the Hon. Sampanthan did, for the Prime Minister to expedite the process and table the draft Constitution here in this House as early as possible this year. And also the transitional justice process, again to which the Hon. Prime Minister gave leadership, despite certain obstacles, is going forward now. As you know, the Office on Missing Persons has now been established and my Ministry has allocated Rs. 1.3 billion for its operationalization. At the moment, the new Commissioners are in the process of doing so and they will be going to meet the parents of the missing, especially the mothers, and get everything -

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) They must do it faster. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Yes. In fact, we have a very dedicated new Chairman, Mr. Saliya Peiris, and I believe he will do a very good job. But, as you say, Hon. Sampanthan, we must move faster.

Then, the initial drafts of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission are now with the Hon. Prime Minister. We will be looking for it to be brought to the Cabinet and to Parliament, hopefully, during this year and also the reparations unit, I believe, is now being finalized.

[12.30p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for the opportunity given to speak on the No-Confidence Motion on the Prime Minister today. A No-Confidence Motion on a Prime Minister, in any Parliament, is a very serious matter. Nobody moves a No-Confidence Motion on a Prime Minister on trivial issues. So, this Debate has to be conducted in a manner that requires the seriousness. But it is a matter of regret that those very Hon. Members who have signed this Motion have now reduced it to a joke. They themselves presented a Motion and not even half way through the Debate, we find that they have conceded that they cannot pass the Motion and they are reducing the Debate and the Parliament to a joke. When we participate in this Debate, we want to constructively engage with the issues that have been raised. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition who spoke earlier in the day, clarified our position with regard to corruption in this

1235 1236

country. I want to reiterate that fact that none of us want to allow corruption to continue in this country.

This Government, particularly, has received a mandate from the people to fight corruption. In the January, 2015 Presidential Election, that was most pronounced. That was one of the key issues on which the people of this country voted for a common Opposition candidate - to fight corruption. Not only corruption, but there were very serious issues faced by this country that had to be addressed, resolved and the direction that the country was taking had to be changed, and persons from varied political backgrounds joined hands in that exercise. All of us having realized that the direction the country was taking must be changed took that decision and a common Opposition candidate was decided upon and all of us worked together and brought about that change.

Thereafter, at the General Election held in August 2015, a National Government was formed and that was put forward to the people. During the first eight months in 2015, the idea of a National Unity Government was put forward. We had during that time the Leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party as the President of the country and the Leader of the United National Party as the Prime Minister of the country and they went before the people and asked for a mandate. That mandate was given. Unfortunately, some people who were elected from the United Peoples Freedom Alliance - UPFA - decided to go against that mandate and left the Government of National Unity that was formed by the Leaders of the two Parties and chose to sit in the Opposition. That was the first challenge that was posed to the Government of National Unity and the country had to continue in a different direction. Today, that group of MPs who worked against the mandate received by their Party Leader have forwarded a Motion of No-Confidence on the Prime Minister. That is one reason why we take the view that this is a first step in the assault against the Government of National Unity that has a popular peoples mandate. Perhaps, the second would be aimed at the Speakers Chair, and the third at impeaching the President himself. That design goes against the mandate that the people of this country from all parts, not just from one community but from all communities, granted mainly to the two main Parties of this country.

There is, in this Motion that is under debate today, a certain reference to the events that occurred in the Kandy District about which the Hon. Rauff Hakeem spoke in his address. But, Hon. Hakeem has missed a very important part in that reference in the Motion. That part says, by failing to take immediate measures to provide protection to Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim people. It says that the Prime Minister, as the Minister-in-Charge of Law and Order, failed to take immediate measures to provide protection to Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim people. I wonder why Sinhalese and Tamils are mentioned in that section. Today, when the Hon. Hakeem made reference to that, the whole country knows and even those who have signed this Motion concede that that was violence against the Muslim people. This shows the minds of those

who have signed this Motion. They are so reluctant to say that the Muslim people were not protected. So, they have to include the Sinhalese and the Tamils also in it. They are loath to concede that a minority people of this country were the targets of that violence. So, one can see the racist outlook of those who have signed this Motion including the Hon. K. Kader Masthan. I make mention of this because the Hon. Bimal Rathnayake referred to the fact that there is a rumour floating that says that the UNP should not win this Vote of No Confidence with the vote of the Tamil National Alliance, because that will be detrimental to them. It is the same racist thinking that put that thought forward and I heard it a moment ago from the Opposition Bench, the last speaker, mentioning the TNA by name. It is a message to the majority people of this country. It is to arouse communal racist feelings within the majority community that these thoughts are being put forward. I am asking you, what is wrong with the TNA voting in this Motion before the House? Do Tamil people not have a right? Do the Tamil people of this country not have a democratic right to participate in this process? Is that what is being said? I do not know who said it. I do not know whether President said it. Even if the President said it, I am putting the question to the President, if he said it. In fact, the rumour says that a particular Minister asked the President, So, it was good enough for you to win with the votes of the Tamil people, but the UNP should not win with the votes of the Tamil people. I hope the President did not say it. I hope it is only a rumour. But, that thinking is prevalent and that is a matter that I want to raise. That thinking says that they will have currency if that idea is floated. This, I think, is an issue of fundamental importance. So long as people think in those lines, there is no redemption for this country; so long as people think that it is only the Sinhalese or only the Buddhists matter in this country, there is no redemption for this country and that is why we are repeatedly making mention today of the mandate that this Government got to draft and adopt a new Constitution for this country; a new social contract in which all the people of this country, for the first time, can agree upon.

The Hon. Leader of the Opposition read out the speech that the President made here saying that in the previous Constitution, there was no consensus. It is of utmost importance that the fundamental law of this country, the supreme law of this country, the social contract, has the consent of all the people. It certainly must have the consent of the Sinhala people, of the Buddhist people. After all, they are the majority in numbers. But, that is not sufficient. It must have the consent of the Muslim people; it must have the consent of the Tamil people and all other different communities that live in this country. It is only then that this country can be called a united country. It is only then that this country can move forward. The one bane that this country has suffered ever since Independence is that fact - non-acknowledgement of the fact that there are different peoples of this country who inhabit this Island.

The Resolution that was put forward on the 9th of January, 2016 and adopted on the 9th of March, 2016, was the effort that was started. This House adopted that

1237 1238

[ ]

2018 0(

Resolution unanimously. I heard the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa say a moment ago that the Prime Minister has agreed with the Tamil National Alliance that a new Constitution would be adopted in three months time. What is wrong with that? He has not given us any such guarantee, but he should. After all, it is this House that adopted that Resolution unanimously. You were in this House when this House adopted that Resolution unanimously. What were you doing then? You should be happy if it is adopted in three months time without any further delay, because you were party to that Resolution that was adopted by this House unanimously. That is not something that the Tamil National Alliance is doing secretly with the UNP or anybody else. There is a Steering Committee in which every political party is represented in this House. He is a Member. Even the Hon. Douglas Devanandas party, which is a single-Member party, is represented in the Steering Committee. An Interim Report was submitted in September last year to the Constitutional Assembly. Seventy Six meetings were held by the Steering Committee. There were six Subcommittees and another Ad hoc Committee. All of them were reported to the Constitutional Assembly. It is a joint effort. Nothing was being done behind anybodys back. That is one reason why the Tamil National Alliance has consistently maintained that the new Constitution must be put to the people at a referendum. The people of this country must agree and adopt that Constitution and it should not be done behind anybodys back. It is that kind of a transparent procedure. Why is he pointing an accusing finger, if that is to be done?

We urge the Government that those proceedings must be restarted immediately. There has been a long delay, an unnecessary delay. The Constitutional Assembly procedure must be expedited and brought to an end. After all it is the unanimous view of this House that that must happen. We raise this issue with the Government now that that must be done. There are several other issues and I want to itemize them and mention them here today. Whatever happens to this Motion, this is also an opportunity for us as substantially representing the Tamil people from the North and East to openly lay before this House, before the President and the Prime Minister the various concerns that we have with regard to the performance of this Government in the last three years. Our people are most disgruntled and very disappointed. There is no problem with the direction in which the Government is moving; the direction was changed. But it is not moving most of the time or it is so slow that you cannot notice a movement. That has affected and that is seriously affecting the lives of our people.

We have constantly raised the issue of Tamil political prisoners; I used the word advisedly, political prisoners. If it was all right for Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, who took up arms twice against the lawfully constituted Government of this country, to be pardoned, because all they tried to do was to achieve a political objective and that is why they were "political prisoners"; so are those detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act now. They were only attempting to achieve a political objective. Several of them have spent 20 years in prison without their case being concluded. The maximum

penalty under the PTA is 20 years. Case is not concluded. That armed revolt is over; it was over nine years ago; that political objective is no more extant in this country. Thereafter in the last nine years, our people have repeatedly voted for us and they repeatedly say, We stand for a united, undivided and indivisible country. That early political objective no longer exists. Why can you not pardon those who have been convicted under the PTA? Why can you not release the others who have been held in long detention? What the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government did, you are unable to do. They released nearly 12,000 cadres of the LTTE who fought in the final war after a two-year rehabilitation and you are still keeping people who gave a food packet to someone 20 years ago. They are still being detained. Naturally, our people are very concerned and questioning the bona fide of this Government.

Then, on land releases, President Maithripala Sirisena gave a written undertaking. That was the only written undertaking given. I am glad that the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, is here. With regard to private land releases, you will remember that you wrote the promise that was to be given by the candidate Maithripala Sirisena with your own hand and it was sent to him when he was in the East before the Presidential Election. Nobody objects to that; no one in this country objects to that. There is no war in this country. Security concerns are legitimate. For security purposes, if the military requires land, that can be held by the military. We are not opposed to that, but these are large swathes of land. Even today, we acknowledge that a lot has been done; but not enough. This should have been done in 100 days. Now, after three years, we are still struggling.

Sir, Government farms are still being held and cultivated by the military. Why does the military have to do this? Thirteen such farms in the North alone are being run by the military. They are running preschools close to those farms. Those children wear military emblems. Do we need this nine years after the war ended? How do you work for reconciliation? How do you turn the minds of those people if such intense military presence continues?

Then, there is the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The Government promised a Counter Terrorism Act would be enacted in its place. I know that the process is on, but how long is it going to take? The PTA was brought into operation in 1979 as a Temporary Provisions Act for six months. Even today the title to that Act says, Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act" . It was extended until 1981 and then that Clause that said it is "temporary" was removed. But the title still says, "Temporary." For 30 years, it is, Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act and nine years after the armed revolt ended, it is still extant. Why can that not be repealed immediately? Is anybody in this House opposed to that? There are serious complaints from our people in the North and the East.

For administrative structures and Local Government structures, Hon. Rauff Hakeem, there has been a longstanding demand to upgrade the Tamil Divisional

1239 1240

Secretary's area in Kalmunai. A Cabinet decision was taken in 1993, but it is still not implemented. Hon. Minister, we require your intervention and cooperation in this.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you.

There are other issues like appointing Government Agents in the North and the East. To areas that are nearly 100 per cent Tamil - you know, the language of administration there is Tamil - Government Agents who do not know Tamil are sent. So, how do they carry out their work? There was one Government Agent in Vavuniya called, Mr. Pushpakumara. He was conversant in Tamil; he worked in Tamil, but others are not. So, how can they perform? Presently, both Government Agents in Vavuniya and Mannar cannot function in Tamil. It is not that there are no officers available; there are enough Tamil officers available. So, naturally our people are telling us, You support this Government. You say they are working for reconciliation. But see, what is happening here.

With regard to Government jobs, recently six drivers who are residents of Galle turned up in the Jaffna Kachcheri. Why should drivers to Jaffna Kachcheri be appointed from Galle?

() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana) Because the Minister is from Galle. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, and peons and security guards to schools are appointed from Kuliyapitiya. In fact, one of our MPs the other day said that the reason for coconut prices to rise is that there is nobody available to pluck coconuts in Kuliyapitiya. They are all being given peon jobs and sent to Jaffna. - [Interruption.] Now I can see accusations being traded from this side to that. That is the culture - political patronage.

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) So then, why are you voting? - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No. We do not take - [Interruption.] Wait. We do not take political office and no political patronage comes from us. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, please do not disturb. Hon. Sumanthiran, you go ahead. Do not get entangled.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, I know. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Otherwise, there will be unnecessary disturbances. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, we have a right to participate. Again that is being questioned unnecessarily.

Sir, there were factories that were closed in the North and the East due to the war. None of it has still been resuscitated or restarted. We have been asking the Government. That would provide employment to our people. Unemployment is a very serious problem there.

Then there is a very important issue of Mahaweli development.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, you have only four more minutes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay, thank you, Sir.

Mahaweli development scheme has been a serious issue for several decades. To the areas that are being demarcated as Mahaweli areas, the ordinary laws of land alienation, et cetera does not apply. Then, there is post-colonization that happens. This has happened in several schemes of Mahaweli development. This was the reason why through the Banda-Chelva Pact in 1957 and very particularly, through the Dudley-Chelva Pact in 1965, land alienation principles were enunciated. This is one of the root causes of the conflict. It is still being perpetuated.

We want water. So, give us only water. We have people there who need water. Presently, in the Mullaitivu District, there are efforts being taken to only bring people, not water. There are people living there who need water. Send water, we will gladly receive it. Do not send people there. If there is any land to be alienated, do it in a way with preference to the landless people of that District without affecting the demography. This is a very, very sensitive issue and I want to raise it publicly today with the Government.

1241 1242

With regard to migrant fishermen in the North and the East, particularly in the Mullaitivu area, there has been a practice. Migrant fishermen do come from the West on various seasons, but there have been laws and long-standing practices as to how that is done. All that is being violated with permits being given by the Director General of the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources against the law with the active support of the military who is present there. This has gone on for several years and it is still happening. The Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources came, had a discussion at the District Secretariat in Mullaitivu and gave orders to stop that. The very next day, that was violated.

So, these are issues that we want to publicly, transparently and openly raise with the Government today at a time when for other reasons, a Vote of No Confidence has been moved. We will not be party to further those other objectives of others who have moved this Motion as a first step towards destabilizing the National Unity Government and turning the direction of this Government back again to a destructive path. We will not lend our hand to that. We are very clear with regard to the mandate that the people of this country gave to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and there is yet time for them complete their mandate. We are disappointed with the progress. But, nevertheless, we want that done in the remaining two years that this Government has.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Your time is running out, Hon. Member. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Therefore, we will act in this House today with a view to giving the Government that space to complete the performance of that mandate. Thank you.

[1.01p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake - Minister of Plantation Industries) ,

The Hon. M.A. Sumanthirans speech was more of an eulogy on the problems of the Tamil people in the North and the East than on the No-Confidence Motion. Nevertheless, I also feel the pain in his heart, especially when he mentioned that the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime released 12,000 fighters in two years and our Government has not been able to do that. So, certainly, these are problems that we should look at constructively, objectively and most importantly humanely. Especially, if a person has been charged and if there is no evidence to proceed with the case, I just do not see why we are

holding on to those people. So, those kinds of quick political and administrative decisions have to be taken.

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake)

I look at that whole process in repugnance as an aberration of Parliamentary Democracy, because the issue of the UNP leadership, the reforms in the UNP and this particular No-Confidence Motion - I will come to the substance of it in a moment.- should not be conflicted or there should be no relationship between the two. This has been an anticlimax because we certainly took upon ourselves to work hard and save the Government. challenge

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) If you look at the substance of the No-Confidence Motion, there are various allegations which are actually ridiculous. research Report - - 930 :

"Mr. Mahendran and Mr. Samarasiri have deliberately and mala fide...

"Mala fide" " " "Bona fide" '' '' - - "bona fide" "mala fide"

... misled the Hon. Prime Minister and suppressed material facts and misrepresented the factual position when they reported the facts and events relating to the Treasury Bond Auction..."

"The evidence establishes that, Mr. Mahendran had not been instructed or directed by the Hon. Prime Minister to act unilaterally and immediately suspend or stop Direct Placements..."

?

:

Mr. Mahendran has repeatedly assured the Prime Minister that, Mr. Aloysius would not under any circumstances play any role in the business activities of Perpetual Treasuries Limited. The evidence establishes that the Hon. Prime Minister fully expected Mr. Mahendran to comply with the due procedure and conduct a comprehensive study into the matter and for this study to be considered by the Monetary Body.

58 I have participated in about three or four No-Confidence Motions.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker)

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) Sir, give me a minute.

This is one of the most ridiculous wordings of a No-Confidence Motion that I have seen. It is actually an insult to our intelligence. I am sure, when the votes are counted at night today, the victory of this Government would be ensured and also the future course of action that has to be rectified through the Prime Minister as well.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) ( [ 5 09] ( ) (The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane)

Prime Minister directed Arjuna Mahendran to go for public auction. There was no government policy. It was an arbitrary decision taken by the Prime Minister. We were not part and parcel of the Government at that time. -[Interruption.]
