Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I chaired the Cabinet Subcommittee on Cost of Living when we talked about the cost of living. We always tend to think only about how to bring the prices down. But remember this is only one side of it. The other side is how to increase the peoples incomes so that they can afford a better quality of life. The only way to do that in this competitive global economy is to integrate more -

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. (Dr.) Romesh Pathirana, what is your point of Order?

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana) Sir, I want to get a small clarification regarding the statement made by the Hon. Minister just now. Hon. Minister, almost the entirety of our exports to Singapore is duty free. So what is the benefit we get from this new Agreement?

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Yes, I will come to that point.

Sir, naturally, we are mindful of the impacts of the industries present today. But that cannot be our only consideration. Our Government is committed to assisting and improving the local industries. However, assistance does not mean protectionism. Protectionism means inefficiency and higher cost to consumers, to Sri Lankan households. We will assist the local industries to increase efficiency and productivity and help them to be more competitive so that they can compete in the world market. Already we have launched loan schemes and exporter-upgrading grant schemes to help SMEs. We have to look at those industries that are not even there today and yet to emerge with the help of the Free Trade Agreements. For those who are likely to be affected by FTAs, we are providing them with a comprehensive trade adjustment package which will cover new machinery and technology and skills retraining.

Anyone who says, "We should be careful before opening it up, because we might not be able to compete," is doing Sri Lanka a huge injustice. Why should you be scared of competing with the world? Look at some of the exporters we have today; our rubber tyres are used in the worlds top aircraft, our surgical gloves are used by the worlds best surgeons, our electronic sensors are used in the worlds top car brands, our apparels are worn by the worlds top athletes and major brands are produced in Sri Lanka and our IT software is used by the worlds leading stock exchanges. We can compete and our industries are already showing how it has done.

The Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA provides a binding commitment and framework for bilateral trade and investment, which we did not have earlier. This will encourage much-needed investment into our country. It is important that we understand that not every FTA is meant to balance trade between two countries or bridge the bilateral trade deficit.

Sri Lanka has trade surpluses with some countries and deficits with other countries. Sri Lanka would need to sign a range of FTAs aimed at different purposes: some FTAs aimed at boosting exports to gain new and preferential market access as well as give domestic producers access to lower cost inputs, while other FTAs are aimed at leveraging on the trade-investment nexus. Our Agreement with Singapore, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, is mainly aimed at leveraging the trade-investment nexus.

Now, let me turn to some of the frequent allegations made against the Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA and some of the myths that are being propagated both inside and outside this House. The first allegation made, as I said earlier, is that the signing of this FTA has not received Cabinet approval. Sir, for your information, the Cabinet of Ministers was first updated via an Interim Report in August, 2017 on the progress including the areas and extent of liberalization and the status of the consultative process carried out with the stakeholders.

On 21st December, 2017, a Cabinet Paper was submitted by me containing the draft Agreement. Based on that, positive observations were made by His Excellency the President and 14 other Cabinet Ministers on the 9th of January, 2018 including the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake. Taking into account these observations, a revised Agreement was submitted to the Cabinet for approval. This was done on the 12th of January and at the Cabinet Meeting held on the 16th January, the Cabinet approved the Agreement submitted and granted approval for me to sign it during the visit of the Singapore Prime Minister on the 23rd of January. Furthermore, I would like to inform this House that the Agreement came into force on the 1st of May after the Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties Bill and the Safeguard Measures Bill were passed in Parliament.

Recently, at a press conference, the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake has stated that he is against the FTA. However, he is one of the 14 Cabinet Ministers who have sent in writing that they have no objection to the signing and implementation of the Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA. His exact words in the letter signed by him are: " ."

( ) (The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa) ?

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) .. .

Agreeing in Cabinet then but playing narrow political games now is the hypocrisy of the Hon. Members of the Opposition.

Another argument is that, we did this without consultations. I can responsibly state to the Hon. Members of this House that we frequently kept stakeholders informed of the status of the negotiations and possible commitments that were to be undertaken. Over the 18 months, about 20 consultation sessions were held with a wide range of stakeholders including business chambers, trade associations and professional bodies.

Another assertion is that we can never amend this Agreement; that is not true.

Article 17.10 of the Agreement provides for amendments to be made to the Agreement. Furthermore, under Article 17.1, there is a high-level committee established to monitor, review and supervise the implementation of the Agreement as well as to recommend amendments.

The first meeting of this Committee will be held within the first year and thereafter at regular intervals take up the issues related to the Agreement that either party would have.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) A point of Order is being raised by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Minister, you just now stated that you have gone through with all the stakeholders. So, can you please table the list of the stakeholders who attended your meetings? Will you please table it today?

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) I do not know whether I can do it today but I will submit it to Parliament soon.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) When? ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) At the next Session. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Will you be here at the next Session? ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) I will definitely be here, but I do not know whether you will be here. Sir, Article 17.12 of the Agreement provides for termination of the Agreement by either party giving notice and it will be effective for one year from the date of notification.

There has been much debate on the liberalization of services. Let me be very clear, as we have repeated time

69 70

and time again that we are not opening up to any country the independent movement of persons.

Under the Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA, there can be service workers only if they are part of a company here. So, it is always linked to investment in Sri Lanka. Even then, we have restricted it to senior management. Such senior managers will initially be issued a visa for two years and we will get it only for a maximum of five years. So, the option is ours. To be eligible in the first place, that worker should have been employed in the relevant Singaporean company for at least one year and should have five years of industry or professional experience. Above all, our countrys immigration laws will always apply and there is no exemption from that.

So, look at all the conditions we have built in to this Agreement. So, for anyone to say that we have blindly opened it up, it is irresponsible and it is a propagation of lies. Another argument is that non-nationals of Singapore can take undue advantage of this FTA. This is again a baseless claim. This Agreement defines "a national" as a citizen of Singapore or a permanent resident of Singapore. Obtaining PR in Singapore is not that easy, as you know. It is a long and stringent process and more stringent requirements in recent years. It is only this cohort of Singapore nationals who are eligible under the FTA and all other nationalities are excluded from the FTA. There have always been ridiculous allegations that this Agreement allows paddy to be freely imported. That is simply not the case.

( ) (The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa.

( ) (The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa) . .

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) . ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That is not a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) What is your point of Order, Hon. Member? ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Sir, there seem to be a lot of disagreements, a lot of doubts and a lot of dubious issues with regard to this Agreement. It appears to be so as a result of not having a comprehensive discussion about it.

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Hon. Member, we have had discussions with all the trade chambers and professional organizations.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) No, it is the Members of Parliament that matters at the end of the day.

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) I have always invited for a dialogue, but they have not attended. I have been telling your leaders time and time again. You ask Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Hon. Bandula Gunawardane, and the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara. I have always been talking to them. I have invited them for every discussion. I am still willing to discuss with you.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Now, we have so many criticisms over this. There are arguments both plus and minus. So, why do we not have a comprehensive discussion on this?

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) We still can do that. We are open for a discussion. If you can pinpoint and say, This is wrong, we will still try to get it amended.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Sir, I need some more time. I think I will get some time from our side.

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Bandula Gunawardane) . . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) , , . . Under the Rules of Origin Chapter, agricultural produce like paddy, wheat or meat must be wholly obtained from Singapore. In the case of meat, animals must be born and raised in Singapore and in the case of paddy, spices, fruits and vegetables, it must be wholly grown and harvested in Singapore to be eligible for tariff concession. Remember, Singapore does not have a single paddy field. Furthermore, it is mentioned that Pakistan rice and Thailand rice can be imported through Singapore. This is not allowed under the Rules of Origin criteria. In any case, rice is kept in the negative list of this Agreement. On the process of manufactured products too, these products should have 35 per cent value addition or sufficient working or processing undergone in Singapore. Therefore, simple diversion of products to Singapore is not possible. So, any concerns around agriculture are totally unfounded.

Another frequently cited issue is about manpower agencies. Even under the prevailing laws and regulations of our land, a Singaporean recruitment services company could set up a company in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankas commitment in this sector does not include Mode 4 in any capacity. It is completely unbound. Unlike in other Mode 4 commitments, there is no reference even for senior management personnel for such recruitment companies under this services subsector. A Singaporean recruitment company can set up an office in Sri Lanka as is already allowed in the current legal structure, but it cannot recruit personnel from abroad since Mode 4 is unbound and no commitment taken to open. Any such recruitment company that wishes to hire work from overseas has to go through the regular process of immigration, approval of line ministries, current laws and regulations that prevail and the FTA creates no new liberalization in this regard.

It has also been alleged very irresponsibly that the FTA will pave the way for waste products to be dumped in Sri Lanka. , . Again, this is totally false. Then many items called waste products are already under duty free list and have been included in the India-Sri Lanka and Pakistan-Sri Lanka Agreements and there is no evidence to suggest that these products are coming into the country in any harmful manner. Even under the Singapore FTA, these products just cannot come into the country and have to go through the regular import licencing requirements, standards and regulations applicable to protect plant, human and animal life. . . .

Furthermore, Sri Lankas rights under Article XX of GATT/1994 of WTO to take measures to protect human, animal or plant life is ensured by the inclusion of Article 17.7 on General Exceptions under Chapter 17 of this Agreement. Therefore, Sri Lanka is free to introduce environmental measures to protect human, animal or plant life. Furthermore, our rights under International Environmental Conventions and that Sri Lanka is a signatory to Basel Convention are not affected and environmental laws and regulations of the country will continue to be applied.

73 74

Hon. Deputy Chairman, more broadly let me reiterate that this FTA with Singapore has very cleverly been negotiated by us. Unlike in other FTAs signed by Singapore with other countries where the level of liberalization is more than 90 per cent on tariff lines, in the FTA with Sri Lanka, we limited it to 80 per cent. So, 20 per cent of tariff lines or 1887 items were kept protected because of a concern on domestic industries and revenue. Items like footwear, confectionary and many other sensitive items have been kept out of the Agreement. The liberalization programme under this FTA has been carefully designed to have the least impact on domestic industry and revenue collection. We have included all revenue sensitive items in the negative list of items which will not be subject to removal of tariff. Therefore, 97.8 per cent revenue from custom duty is protected. Our tariff liberalization will also take place over a period of 12 to 15 years.

In fact, the revenue owned through tariff on goods imported from Singapore last year was Rs. 35 billion. The revenue loss over the next 15 years due to the FTA is only Rs. 733 million. When annualized, it is just Rs. 51 million a year. This is just 0.14 per cent per year. So, anyone who claims as Singapore FTA causes revenue loss to the Government cannot do basic arithmetic.

, , - . . ; ; . , , . , , . Given the onset of deep, far-reaching technological progress, the nature of cross-border trade and economic relationships is changing at dizzying speed. Physical goods are becoming more virtual; services are becoming more tradable; E-commerce is empowering SMEs to go international. This emerging landscape demands that we adopt a new approach for regional integration or risk falling further behind in this moment of rapid global change.

[3.14 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for the opportunity given to me to say a few words in regard to this Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena. I do not wish to go into the technicalities of the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, Sir. There have been some criticisms made. I think the Government should look at whatever criticisms that had been made.

Sir, I only want to refer to our two countries, Sri Lanka and Singapore, and their history over the past several decades. When Singapore attained independence, its legendary leader, the first Prime Minister of Singapore, the late Lee Kuan Yew, wanted to model Singapores development on Sri Lanka. Singapore was a backward city-state. He looked upon Sri Lanka as a country that was developing and flourishing after Independence with an efficient Public Service, an efficient educational system even at the university level and he wanted to model Singapores development on Sri Lanka. But, over a period of time, it appeared and became clear that while Singapore was advancing in several areas and becoming a prosperous country, Sri Lanka was receding and going backwards.

I have been reading the biography of Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, the first Prime Minister of Singapore and from what he states in his biography, it is clear that he had been visiting Sri Lanka several times; Sri Lankan leaders have been visiting Singapore several times. Mr. Lee Kuan Yew met with Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike; he met with Mr. Dudley Senanayake; he met with Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike; he met with Mr. Ranasinghe Premadasa and before that, he met with Mr. J. R. Jayewardene and all these leaders were asking Singapore to assist Sri Lanka in the matter of development when, unfortunately, such development did not take place. And why did such development not take place? There was no agreement signed between Singapore and the Governments of any one of the leaders I referred to in the past.

What is the key to Singapores success? Where has Singapore gone and where are we? I find, Sir, that in the late 1960s, a few years after Singapore attained independence, its per capita income was US Dollars 500. Today, currently, its per capita income is US Dollars 55,000! It was US Dollars 500 in the late 1960s and 50 years later, it is US Dollars 55,000, which is an increase of more than a hundredfold! The per capita income of Singapore has increased a hundredfold in the last 50 years. Where have we gone? What has happened to us?

I will tell you, Sir, why Singapore has succeeded. In Singapore, good governance operates on five principles. The first is, meritocracy. You are judged on the basis of merit; not on the basis of political influence, not on any

77 78

other consideration, but on meritocracy. The second is, ethnic harmony. In Singapore, you have Chinese, you have Malays and you have Tamils. There are also four official languages in Singapore: English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil. That is, they give recognition to all the people who live in Singapore. There is complete equality; there is no discrimination; there is no denial of anyone's entitlement. The third is, clean government. Bribery is not tolerated; corruption is not tolerated. From top to bottom, everyone has got to be clean, free from bribery and free from corruption. The fourth is, the rule of law. The rule of law is strictly enforced irrespective of who you are. You may be a big man, you may be a small man, but the rule of law is strictly enforced. The final principle is, social equity. Whether it be in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of employment or in the field of development, there is equity, there is equality. So, Sir, those are the basic principles on which Singapore has developed.

It is because we have not observed those principles - we have not observed ethnic harmony; we have not brought about unity amongst our people; we have not observed meritocracy; we have not observed clean government; we have not observed the rule of law and we have not observed social equity - that we have moved backwards. I think, Sir, that is something we must remember. We must improve.

Sir, when I read Mr. Lee Kuan Yew's biography, there was a very interesting comment he had made. Singapore had no port initially. Subsequently, he built a port in Singapore. He was asked the question, Sir, as to whether he praised anyone for the miraculous development in his country. His answer was, I owe very much to the leftist politicians in Sri Lanka. He said that he was prompted to construct a harbour in Singapore to provide bunkering facilities to ships sailing around the world when the Colombo Harbour was constantly crippled due to trade union actions led by Left politicians and that was the beginning of Singapores development. Our Harbour was crippled through strikes organized by Left politicians and Lee Kuan Yew saw in that an opportunity to build a harbour in Singapore and supply facilities to ships from around the world. That, Sir, is the position. If Singapore has succeeded and we have not succeeded, these are the reasons why we have not succeeded. We have not been able to take our country forward because we have not governed our country on the basis of principles that are necessary, compulsory and essential to ensure proper economic development.

When I listened to some of the criticisms made by some of my friends here, I was wondering whether we are looking a gift horse in the mouth. There is a story, Sir, that when somebody presented another person with a horse - the horse was a gift - the other person, instead of thanking the gentleman who gifted the horse, looked in the mouth of the horse to find out whether the teeth were in good condition. So, this is like looking a gift horse in

the mouth to see whether its teeth are in good condition. Singapore does not need a Free Trade Agreement with us. Singapore has gone so far away from us. People in Singapore earn more than hundred times what we earn. So, Singapore does not need a Free Trade Agreement with us; it is we who need a Free Trade Agreement with Singapore.

I would, therefore, urge the Government, if there be any corrections that need to be made to the Agreement, make those corrections, but implement the Agreement for the benefit of our country, use the expertise of Singapore, use the technology that Singapore can provide you, use the services that Singapore can provide you and develop our country's economy because this country needs to be developed. This country needs to go forward. Our people are suffering from a diminishing quality of life. Every day, every week, every month, every year we are moving backwards. We cannot move backwards. This must end. We must start co-operating with countries that can be helpful to us. There is an Agreement we have to sign with India : ETCA - Economic and Technology Co-operation Agreement. That has not been signed. Why? Fear, prejudice, irrational thinking. You cannot go on like this. You cannot turn a blind eye to development taking place the world over, in several countries. You must open out. You must have courage, you must have the confidence that you can engage with the other countries, with development taking place in other countries and benefit ourselves from such engagement, from such co-operation, from such coordination. We must abandon this attitude of fear, apprehension and irrational thinking.

I would therefore urge Sir, that subject to whatever corrections that need to be made in terms of the criticisms levelled against the Agreement, please, implement the Agreement without delay and please, give Sri Lanka an opening towards development.

Thank you.

Singapore's exports will enjoy potential tariff savings of about $10 million each year.

thesis - download - .

Anybody can download his thesis from the internet and we have seen very clearly that you have made certain amendments to the thesis that he has produced. He is a New Zealander and his thesis is the one which had been produced as the National Trade Policy for Sri Lanka. Hon. Minister, that Policy contains only a summary statement and a conclusion. But, a policy statement cannot have only a summary statement and a conclusion. Probably, that is the thesis he produced for his PhD. That is all about it.

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) I just want a clarification on the same thing - what the Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana mentioned. This is the National Trade Policy of Sri Lanka which was published by Dr. Ravi Ratnayake and apparently only the references have been removed from it and you tabled it a month ago. Hon. Minister, you tabled a new National Trade Policy one month ago, but that is his thesis and only the references have been removed.

Secondly, when I was talking, you were not there. So, I just wanted a few more clarifications.

. . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Hon. Member, I think you must be referring to the Bilateral Investment Treaty.

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) IPPA. IPPA has been an Agreement between two countries.

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) There was no Free Trade Agreement. You must be referring to the Bilateral Investment Treaty.

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) This is the IPPA which has been ratified by Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) It was not a - ( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) My argument is that legally - ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) I understand what you are saying. But it is not a Free Trade Agreement; it is a Bilateral Investment Treaty.

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) There is a reference to that in this particular Agreement.

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) When it was referred to the AG, he said that it was not mandatory to present it to Parliament and there was no impediment to sign the Agreement. You were also in the Cabinet at that time.

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) Yes, I was in the Cabinet and I have given my observations also. That is the other point. Of course, I believe that the Attorney-General should have taken into consideration the supremacy of Parliament. Had Parliament ratified something -

. . , . ; it is part of the document. . .

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) But I have tabled the list of names. ( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) So, I would like to request you to give them an opportunity, if you can.

8 1 Bilateral Investment Treaty , IPPA . So, I want to inform you, Sir, that this FTA does not in any way contravene that IPPA signed in 1980 nor does it annul it. It is still valid. That maybe the reason why the Attorney General has said that it is not mandatory to go to Parliament and that maybe the reason why he has given us the approval to sign this Agreement.
