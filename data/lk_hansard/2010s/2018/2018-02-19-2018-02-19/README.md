UPFA quits National Government - UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera sent a letter in this regard to the President.

Last night we had a statement from the Deputy Speaker also on behalf of the UPFA that they have quit the Government. Now there is no National Government. I had raised this matter a couple of times and Hon. Speaker gave a reply. Hon. Leader of the House also said nothing like that has happened. But, now it has happened. So there is no Government. . . .

[11.31a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Speaker.

As we consider the new Standing Orders and the Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament, it seems ironic that we are discussing these two documents which are important for the conduct of Business of Parliament on a day when there seems to be so much uncertainty in the country with regard to the Prime Minister, the Cabinet and the Government et cetera. But, for the orderly conduct of Business in this House, when the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena rose on a point of Order this morning, consequent to a letter given to the Hon. Speaker, the Committee on Parliamentary Business in a very orderly manner took the decision to debate that issue from 4.00 p.m. today for three hours. That is a testimony to the fact that amidst even such a situation, where there is so much uncertainty, the Business of Parliament is being conducted in an orderly manner according to the prevailing Standing Orders and so in some sense this is an opportune moment to debate this document that has been prepared with a lot of care, as the Hon. Ajith P. Perera said, when he introduced the documents.

The Committee on Standing Orders has done a tremendous job. As I joined the previous Parliament - the Seventh Parliament - I was on the Committee on Standing Orders even during that time and under the Chairmanship of the then Speaker, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa, we met many times to review and to redraft anew Standing Orders of Parliament. Unfortunately, that effort was not concluded during that Parliaments tenure, but I am glad that within two-and-a-half years of the Eighth Parliament, it has been possible to present this set of Standing Orders and also the Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament.

It is often when there is uncertainty and weakness in government that good legislative measures are taken. As I

349 350

said when I started, it is ironic that we debate this today, that is yet another irony that it is only when the Government seems weak, that progressive and legislative measures become possible. There are many examples in this country itself. The Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution is one example, but I think the supreme example is the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Then it was a minority government and the number of Hon. Members of that government was so low and yet it was possible to enact the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution with only one Member voting against it. When the government seems weak, that is when it seems that consensus is possible.

That is why I say today may be an opportune day to actually adopt these new Standing Orders that have been presented to the House on a day when the country and even this Parliament seems unsure as to what governance will look like tomorrow in this country. These Standing Orders have been prepared by this Committee as I said across party divides and has brought in a number of progressive measures.

Firstly, it was necessary to have a new set of Standing Orders because the one that we are working with even today is so old that most of those provisions had even become obsolete and unworkable. A Parliament which functions on the British Parliamentary traditions could always rely on tradition and we have been able to go on whenever there was a casus omissus to rely on the practice of the British Parliament and successive Speakers have been able to give rulings that have generally been accepted by the country and elsewhere as correct rulings and the dignity of this House had been maintained up to now. Yet, it has become necessary to review, to reform and renew the Standing Orders by which Parliament must work.

More importantly, a Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament has also been placed before the House. This was a promise given by the National Unity Government. It was an electoral pledge by the new dispensation that was brought in from January, 2015 to August 2015. It may be important today to just look back on that two-and-a-half or three-year period and even pat ourselves on our backs for the number of progressive legislative measures that this Parliament was able to enact.

After the Nineteenth Amendment, the Right to Information Act - Mr. Speaker, you were the force behind it even when you were in the Opposition- was brought into operation. That has revolutionized transparency in governance in this country. That is a fact. Today, as I speak, it may seem that what was achieved or what has been going on for the last two-and-a-half to three years may have come to an end or is a failure. But the fact is that many of the legislative measures that were adopted have gone forward, have been very progressive. The democratic reforms must be acknowledged.

One important democratic reform is strengthening of Parliament and it is to that end that the new Sectoral

Oversight Committees have been brought in. I agree with the Hon. Ajith P. Perera that this whole concept of a Sectoral Oversight Committee system, which seems even today alien to us, is an important measure in strengthening Parliament - Parliaments oversight. Therefore, although many Ministers and other Members seemed dissatisfied with this and the committee system that prevailed before this, which was Consultative Committees, is what they want, I would urge the House to look at this slightly differently. You can have Consultative Committees, I am not opposed to that. But, that is a very different issue to the setting up of Sectoral Oversight Committees. It is through the Oversight Committees that Parliament actually, in effect, exercises even legislative control, where it is possible for Members in Committees to consider legislative measures that are brought in, various other matters that are referred to those Committees and unless there is a committee system through which this oversight is exercised, merely debating it in the House, in public, when Members are grouped in sharply divided compartments of their respective political parties, will not bring about much good. So, as we all know, it is in the Committees that a lot of constructive work is done and therefore, the introduction of Oversight Committees is a very, very important step - a progressive step - that was taken by this Parliament. Even without amending the Standing Orders, by Resolution of this House, those were set up and now, today, it is being brought in into the Standing Orders and that is to be welcomed. I know there is an amendment that may be moved to retain the functioning of the Consultative Committees as well. That can happen and that is a totally different issue altogether. But, I want to impress on the Members not to compare the two, even in this Debate today, because we hear this all the time. Those who want the Consultative Committees revived keep attacking the Sectoral Oversight Committees, particularly the Ministers.

Actually, Sectoral Oversight Committees, as the name itself suggests, is an oversight function and understandably Ministers are not too much in favour of that. But, if we are serious about strengthening the institution of Parliament, then Oversight Committees are an essential feature of that. As the Hon. Ajith Perera also mentioned, a new Committee, the Pubic Finance Committee, which I have the honour of chairing for the present, has been entrusted with Parliaments special function of exercising total control over public finance. That is there in the Constitution, but we saw how ineffective that was in actual practice. But, here is an opportunity now, through the working of that important Committee, that Parliaments important role of being the sole authority, one who exercises the sole control over public finance, to exercise it in a meaningful way.

There are many more measures that need to be taken, particularly the Parliamentary Budget Office which is essential for the functioning of that Committee and also for various other reasons of advising the Members of Parliament with regard to Budgetary procedures and generally with regard to public finance. Unfortunately, the legislation in that regard has also got delayed. But, I hope, very soon, in the next few months, we would be

351 352

[ .. ]

2018 8

able to set that up as an independent office that is not attached to the Ministry of Finance but something that comes within the control of Parliament, something that functions independently to be able to advise this House, not the Government, on very acutely technical matters with regard to finance so that the Members of this House can involve themselves in intelligent debate.

I want to also refer to the other important matter that the Hon. Ajith Perera referred to, and that is the removal of judges. This actually came to a head as he said with the removal or the purported removal of the Chief Justice of that time, Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake. But, it did not begin at that time. The very first impeachment of a judge -which was also of a Chief Justic - was Neville Samarakoon and Parliament did it through a Committee appointed for that purpose. Then itself this issue arose. Unfortunately, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena is not in the House at the moment. The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike and the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena gave a dissent stating that the inquiry procedure by Members of Parliament, particularly over those who exercise judicial function was not desirable. Unfortunately, that was not rectified. It had to be rectified. Even now, I wish to state that brining in the new Standing Order provisions in that regard are not sufficient, because in Article 107 of the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court as well, there are certain segments of that procedure that must be prescribed by law and not by Standing Orders. Standing Orders recognize that. It says that law in that regard must be enacted, and I hope that that is enacted.

Again, the crucial factor to be considered in this is the independence of that inquiry panel much more than anything else. I would say even more than what is invariably referred to as the "supremacy of Parliament", it is the independence of that inquiry panel that needs to be considered. It is a mistaken notion to say that Parliament is supreme. Perhaps under the First Republican Constitution that was true. But under the present Constitution it is the Constitution that is supreme; the Constitution says so. Parliament is supreme in the functions that have been delegated to Parliament - in the legislative functions. Of course, Article 4 (c) of the Constitution states that the judicial power of the people is also exercised by Parliament through courts, except when it is in connection with the powers and privileges of Parliament or Members of Parliament.

The removal of a judge or inquiry into allegations of misconduct or incapacity of a superior court judge is not a matter that comes within the purview of powers and privileges of Parliament or its Members. That is, yes, a judicial power exercised by Parliament, but through courts. That is where a mechanism that is consonant with that principle where the inquiry procedure is a fair procedure and is in accordance with laws of natural justice, laws of procedural fairness et cetera must be strictly complied with. It is for that reason that retired Judges of the Supreme Court have been suggested or prescribed in the Standing Orders, that three of those persons must be appointed by the Speaker in consultation with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, so that there is a bipartisan view as to who constitutes that panel.

But, I would urge that in regard to this matter, the House actually considers employing judges from other countries. When I say this, there will be reaction automatically in the House saying that we are allowing foreign interference and so on. This seems an unnecessary fear that many Hon. Members have. After all, our judges function in many foreign jurisdictions. Even while they are judges here, they have been given leave and they function in courts elsewhere. Our Supreme Court Judges have conducted inquiries into the conduct of other judges in other jurisdictions. In Malaysia, for instance, Justice Mark Fernando and Justice Parinda Ranasinghe have, with distinction and acceptance, played that role. No doubt we are an island and perhaps that island mentality sometimes overcomes us. But, we are a country which is a part of a community of nations - a civilized group of countries. If we are so paranoid all the time to the extent that we cannot accept independent advice and assistance from others around us, then we will not make much progress. So, I urge the House to keep aside this unnecessary paranoia and look to what is good, what is ideal and what is sought to be achieved - which is independence. There is a criticism on what has been formulated here, saying even if you say retired judges, it may be judges who retired recently, so it may be judges who have actually worked with the accused judge and there can be lack of independence et cetera. But, if you actually take it away from the country, you can achieve the objective of an independent inquiry.

That is the most important thing because we are talking about judges of the superior courts: the Chief Justice and other Judges of the Supreme Court, the President and the other Judges of the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court is the apex court and the Court of Appeal exercises the other superior courts functions. If we are to strengthen the independence of the Judiciary, the judges of the superior courts must be able to function without fear of interference into their activity, not only by the Executive, but also by the Legislature, because that is the institution which is at the vanguard, that is the institution which actually protects, that is beyond the political vicissitudes and that is the one that people can repose their confidence in. So, so much more for persons who occupy positions in those courts, that they should know when their matter comes up or there is an allegation against them, that the procedure that is in place to inquire into that is no second to the judicial system that we have for any other citizens.

That is where we failed with regard to the inquiry into the alleged misconduct on Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake - the hasty way in which the Select Committee of Parliament functioned; the manner in which 16 witnesses were examined in one night and the fact that by 8.00 a.m. the next morning a Report was ready and tabled in this House. An almost humanly impossible task had been performed. That mighty rush showed up the flaws in that procedure and that too, in respect of the Chief Justice of the country. So, that is why this was brought into sharp focus. At that time, I remember, as an Opposition Member, the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe introduced a Private Members Bill on the removal of judges. There, he proposed, where it is the Chief Justice,

353 354

to invite sitting judges from other jurisdictions to constitute that panel of inquiry. So, this is something that many countries, particularly in the Commonwealth - we say the Commonwealth because at least within the Commonwealth, judicial systems are comparable - practise and in most instances, we function with the same principles. Therefore, it becomes easier for judges from other jurisdictions to perform that function.

Now, we already have this in our system. Where commercial disputes or even other disputes are concerned, the Arbitration Act, in Section 5, permits that. We participate in international arbitrations. International arbitrations take place in this country, where panels of arbitrators from other countries come and sit and they make awards. Those have to be implemented through the court system in this country even today. You cannot set aside an arbitral award on the basis that there is a foreigner who is an arbitrator. You can set it aside only on three very narrow grounds that go to the root or the jurisdiction of that arbitral panel. So, when it is possible, when it is all right to have commercial disputes settled by persons who are not citizens of this country, foreigners who form arbitral tribunals, why is it anathema to have judges from other jurisdictions to ensure independence? So, this is a matter that I would urge the House to consider as a very important aspect.

The other issues are with regard to the Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament. I want to highlight one or two matters particularly with regard to the duty of disclosure by Hon. Members of Parliament. When that disclosure is done, the country will know when an Hon. Member of Parliament speaks or acts in this House, what conflict he or she suffers from. That disclosure is made well in time. So, Hon. Members interests in contracts, companies and in various other activity must be disclosed beforehand, so that whenever some issue arises in connection with something that the Hon. Member is otherwise connected to, the disclosure is already made. As it is, the duty is cast on us to make that disclosure. It is not that we cannot participate, but we must make the disclosure. But, if there is a conflict, then we must desist from functioning.

It is not only that, it is also with regard to order being maintained in Parliament that the new Code of Conduct together with the Standing Orders now provide for stricter punishment. It is unfortunate that those provisions had to be made in order to enforce discipline. But, as we all know, even in this Parliament, there have been incidents which we all are ashamed of, which ought not to have happened, but still happens and even very recently it happened. So, it has become necessary, I think, in order to enforce a certain measure of discipline without actually violating the freedom that Hon. Members have to express themselves, not only in speeches, but in various other ways. But yet, for the orderly conduct of Business of the House, these measures are important.

Sir, I commend the Report of the Committee on Standing Orders and the Code of Conduct for Members of

Parliament and I hope this House will adopt it today with necessary adjustments and amendments that the Hon. Members propose. It is important that we send a message to the country today, Sir, that amidst this speculation, amidst this uncertainty that this House is still able to function and has, in fact, conducted a business which is very important for democracy, transparency and a strong legislature.

Thank you.

. [2.09 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am pleased to be associated in adding my comments to the two documents that we placed for approval of the House today - one relating to a new set of Standing Orders for the conduct of Business in this House, as well as the Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament. In my opinion, this effort has gone through almost for the last three years. I have had the privilege of serving in that committee under the Chairmanship of the Hon. Speaker.

First of all, I must thank the Hon. Speaker for having taken his precious time to give leadership to this important effort in drafting amendments to the Standing Orders, which had not been attended to since 1980s. Therefore, very important groundbreaking changes have been incorporated and I would say that particularly, the concept of Sectoral Oversight Committees, which goes to empower the backbenchers in this House, to have an oversight role over the executive functions of the government is a very, very salutary feature. But then, we must understand that certain functions of the High Posts Committee as well as the other financial oversight committees such as the Committees on Public Enterprises and Committee on Public Accounts, may also get

overlapped by provisions that we have included in the Sectoral Oversight Committees. Since even the suitability of candidates to institutions that are appointed under each Ministry can once again come under scrutiny by the Sectoral Oversight Committee, and also the accounts and financial matters concerning the enterprises coming under different Ministries could also be examined all over again by the Sectoral Oversight Committees in addition to the Committee on Public Enterprises and the Committee on Public Accounts. So while these overlapping oversight issues can become somewhat confusing I feel that continuous oversight of the executive by the legislative arm is a very welcome feature and we must all agree that these are important changes that have been made.

I would like to venture into another area which had somewhat been ignored and sometimes been purposely ignored by even the Presiding Members of this House. I beg your pardon for saying this. I have, in fact, taken very strong objection to the way in which the Bills are presented to the House. Quite recently we observed that conduct of entertaining Bills for approval in this House has happened in violation of constitutional provisions. Now, I speak in particular - we have had in the recent past two such instances. One particularly -

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order please! Hon. Speaker will now take the Chair. .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am glad that you have come to the Chair at a time when I am raising a very important issue.

We are dealing with the new Standing Orders and we have also made provision for the presentation of Bills. We have made a few changes but some of these changes do not go as far as desirable.

Mr. Speaker, I have in particular taken objection to the way in which certain Bills have been submitted to Parliament in a manner so as to deny the constitutional right of a citizen to petition the Supreme Court against such a Bill. What has happened is, very surreptitiously amendments have been introduced, which are totally different to the content of the Bill that has been presented. The Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill was presented in such a manner and I took very strong objections to that both in the Party Leaders meeting as well as in this House. There was a subterfuge that was used and this type of incident must be avoided. As a matter of fact, this issue is before the Supreme Court today. We are all awaiting a judgment of the Supreme Court on this issue so that there will be a closure and we will not resort to such ways in which we will deny the constitutional right of a citizen. - [Interruption.] Indeed it is! It is a shame.

Now it has come to a situation after the experience we had in the last Local Government elections that the electoral system that we introduced is full of so many lacunas and contradictions that it has finally resulted in total instability. Of course, all of us are responsible for having enacted this piece of legislation. I think, it is very prudent for us to now erase what we did in such a surreptitious manner and revert back to the old system of elections, so that we will be in a position to conduct the Provincial Council elections as soon as possible.

But my point here is in the presentation of Bills we have to be quite responsible. We should not simply rely on the certificate of the Attorney-General to say that the Bill is not inconsistent with the Constitution, but the primary right of every citizen to challenge a Bill should not be denied by very surreptitiously introducing a whole new piece of legislation as amendments. This is what happened. It was such an embarrassing situation. We took strong objection to it. Everything was ignored and it was pushed through. Such things should never be repeated and I hope the Supreme Court should pronounce on the objections that have been made. I know the former Chief Justice went before the Supreme Court and argued this matter since this is a matter of serious concern for legislating in this House.

In addition to that, I believe that our effort to introduce Sectoral Oversight Committees as well as the decision to refer to the Legislative Committees once Bills are presented is commendable. They must come before the Sectoral Oversight Committees as well be referred to the Standing Committees to be examined and then a report be

obtained before they are passed in this House. That is a very welcome feature. Particularly, when it comes to Bills which contradict, which are not in consonant with the Devolution Chapter of the Constitution they are referred to the Provincial Councils. There again, I think some welcome features have been incorporated so that the concerns of the Provincial Councils could be also addressed by the relevant Ministries as well as legislative subcommittees in the House.

These are welcome features. Of course, we have also introduced some new Standing Orders to provide for situations such as an impeachment of the Chief Justice. In keeping with the Latimer House Principles, what happened in the recent past prompted all of us to include some important provisions to ensure that principles of fair play, particularly relating to due process, is afforded to any superior court judge who may face an issue of impeachment in the House. So, that will prevent the Hon. Members of the House sitting in judgment without affording sufficient opportunity for a superior court judge, not being able to have a fair trial. Therefore, the issue of incorporating the Latimer House Principles in keeping with the Commonwealth practice in providing for a three-member panel to examine and report to the House before the House takes a decision whether to impeach or not is a very welcome feature and I believe a lot of time has been taken to introduce such important amendments.

Similarly, we have also introduced other features like the Prime Ministers Question Time as well as the rules relating to broadcasting and telecasting of Parliamentary Proceedings. Of course, the issue relating to abuse of the Parliamentary Privileges by Members sometimes brings out allegations in contravention of the Standing Orders. While we have simultaneous broadcast or telecast, once something is said, it could not be expunged or taken away because whatever damage would have been done before the public. So, these issues need to be addressed properly. A responsible - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, you have only four more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Okay, Hon. Speaker. It was just a matter of concern that I thought should be added.

Coming back to the situation that we are currently faced within the country, a sense of instability has come about because of the disagreements between Parties in deciding on the issue of governance in the country. But I must say that there is a mandate and that mandate is for the National Government to continue and if the National Government cannot continue, I do not think, we should have a Government which is unstable and which is being run by a remote control by somebody else. I know, I have had this kind of an experience once in the past. When I was removed from the Cabinet all of a sudden in 2001, I believe, I crossed over to the Opposition. Then there was

381 382

a brief period in which there was a "Probationary Government" - the Pariwasa Anduwa concept. A Similar Pariwasa Anduwa cannot continue in this country. I believe some steps are being taken; some are being spoken about. But, if all Parties who are supposed to be forming an administration, they must in the first place be prepared to take the Executive Office. If one Party is not taking the Executive Office and if we are going to run by proxy or by having a minority Government, we are violating our own mandate that we got.

So, I must say very categorically to those who have decided to form a Government that as far as the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress is concerned, we would only be part of a stable Government. If we are going to have a Government which is not going to have a substantial majority, it will be a total violation of the mandate that we got to serve the people. So, it is a very important thing. In fact, together with some of our minority Members who met with us, we very clear decided that we would insist on our national leaders to see that they respect the mandate that they have got in forming an administration and that decision should be taken in that spirit without resorting to unnecessary dilatory tactics and they must also see that the confidence that the people have reposed in our national leaders would be respected.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you. The next speaker is the Hon. Douglas Devananda.

Hon. Leader of the Opposition, you may speak now.

[4.36p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

I thought I would say a few words on this debate. The people have delivered a verdict and, in a democracy, the peoples verdict must be respected. The Hon. Member who moved the Motion and the Hon. Member who seconded the Motion have referred to various matters. I think, Sir, I will primarily do a brief analysis of the result of the Local Authorities Election held on 10th of February.

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna polled 44.69 per cent of the votes cast at that election. The United National Party polled 32.61 per cent. The United Peoples Freedom Alliance polled 8.90 per cent. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party polled 4.48 per cent. If one was to add the percentage of the votes polled by the United National Party, the United Peoples Freedom Alliance and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, those three parties put together polled 45.99 per cent, almost 46 per cent. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna polled 44.69 per cent, that is almost 2 per cent less than the other three parties put together.

The Peoples Liberation Front - JVP - polled 6.26 per cent and the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi polled 3.06 per cent. If one was to add the percentage of votes polled by those two parties together with the percentage of votes polled by the United National Party, the United Peoples Freedom Alliance and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the total would be 55.31 per cent. So, in other words, parties opposed to the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna have polled 55.31 per cent and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna has polled only 44.69 per cent. This is indisputable. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Please, do not disturb him. Everybody has the right to speak.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the Presidential Election held in 2015 polled 47.58 per cent. The votes he polled at the Presidential Election in January, 2015 were more than the votes he polled now.

There have been three elections in recent times; the Presidential Election in 2015, the Parliamentary Election in 2015 and the Local Authorities Election held this month. In none of these elections has former President Mahinda Rajapaksa been able to obtain more than 50 per cent.

His vote has always been below 50 per cent at the Presidential Election, at the Parliamentary Election and at the Local Authority Election. So, there is nothing to get excited about: elections are held; parties win; parties lose. The Local Authority Elections have been held and you have won. One does not dispute that fact, but the fact of the matter is that you have polled only 44.69 per cent as opposed to 55.31 per cent cast against you. So, what is there to get excited about? Nothing at all. Parliament is not constituted on the basis of votes cast at the Local Authority Elections. Parliament is constituted, -the President is elected, on the basis of votes cast at the Presidential Election - at a Parliamentary Election held for that purpose in keeping with the Constitution and the laws of this country. The Constitution and the laws of this country cannot be subverted by your claiming benefits under the Local Authority Elections to your advantage in the way you please.

I want to make a few comments, Mr. Speaker, if you permit me in regard to the nature of the propaganda that was carried on at this election. I do not want to do something controversial. But, I must refer to the fact that I was quite alarmed when, quite early in the campaign, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, in the course of an election rally, said that sometimes this election would result in Tamil Eelam blooming after the election is over. The reason he gave was that there was a new Constitution being framed which might result in that happening. Sir, ever since the Thirteenth Amendment was enacted in 1987 - 1988, there had been continued efforts on the part of different Presidents and different Governments to improve the Thirteenth Amendment in such a manner as to bring about a political resolution acceptable to all the citizens in this country. During President Premadasas time, there was the Mangala Moonesinghe Parliamentary Select Committee Proposals which made recommendations which went far beyond the Thirteenth Amendment. During President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas time, there were the 2000 Constitutional Proposals brought to Parliament by no less a person than Prof. G.L. Peiris which went far beyond the Thirteenth Amendment and contained various new features. That proposed Constitution had been brought as a Bill to Parliament.

Thereafter President Mahinda Rajapaksa assumed office. If he will recall his speech that he made at the initial meeting, the inaugural meeting of the All Party Representatives Committee (APRC) and the Experts Committee, he talked of maximum possible devolution. He appointed an Experts Committee that came up with the reports. There was the Prof. Tissa Vitharana Committee which came up with their own report which took the Constitutional proposals much beyond the Thirteenth Amendment and that was the position. After the assumption of office of this Parliament, this

427 428

2018 8

Parliament was evolved into a Constitutional Assembly to frame a new Constitution. As per a Resolution adopted unanimously in this Parliament with all the Joint Opposition Members being supportive of that Resolution, - none of you opposed it - there was a Steering Committee appointed. You participated in the proceedings of the Steering Committee. None of you opposed it. None of you talked of Eelam in this Parliament. None of you talked of Eelam at the Steering Committee. You accepted it; you went along with the process. Suddenly, Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa says, There Eelam is likely to bloom after the Local Authority Elections if the people are not careful.

I have information, Sir, that this message was propagated amongst the innocent Sinhala people in this country. They were told, This is a referendum for an Eelam. If you vote for the Government or if you vote for the UNP, it will result in an Eelam being created. So, do not vote for them. Vote for the Lotus Bud . I am told, Sir, that particularly this propaganda was very virulently carried out in all the temples, in all the villages in the Sinhala South. This, I think, is unfortunate, Sir. I want to put on record that my Party at this Election, in our manifesto, talked of a political solution within the framework of an undivided, indivisible, single country.

There was no campaign carried on, anywhere, in the North and East which talked of division of the country. We only talked of a solution that is acceptable to our people, that is reasonable, with substantial power-sharing within the framework of a united, undivided, indivisible single country. That was the propaganda we carried out in all our areas and when we did that, how dare President Rajapaksa say that Eelam could bloom after the election. This is not merely deception of the people in the South, innocent Sinhala people in the South, but it is the deception of everyone including himself.

I would like to put this on record because I want everybody in this country to know that it was a malicious, vicious, fallacious, false propaganda on the part of President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and if you proceed with this agenda, I want to tell you, Eelam will bloom, not on account of us, but on account of your Lotus Bud. Your Lotus Bud will bloom into an Eelam. That is what will happen. Therefore, please resist your temptation to achieve cheap political gain by carrying on such false propaganda.

Thank you, Sir.
