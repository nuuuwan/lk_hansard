Do not disturb. . Hon. Sumanthiran -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I want to make our Party's position very clear. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . Please, . Hon. Sumanthiran, you may go ahead.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker, I want to make our Party's position very clear with regard to the position of the Leader of the Opposition.

As you said, the party in Opposition that has the largest number of Seats is entitled to the post of the Leader of the Opposition. There is no question on that. But, the question is - there are two questions before this House today. The first question is, is the UPFA a party in Opposition? I say with respect, that the Head of the UPFA is the Head of the Government and the Head of the Executive - the Head of the Cabinet. Not only that, he also holds three portfolios in the Cabinet. In such an instance, our position is that when a Member of the UPFA and that too, the Leader of the UPFA is in the Cabinet, the Head of the Cabinet and holds three portfolios in the Cabinet, another Member of the UPFA cannot be the Leader of the Opposition. That is one.

Secondly, from the issue that has been raised by the Hon. Leader of the House today, Article 99 (13) of the Constitution very clearly stipulates that if a Member of Parliament resigns or ceases to be a Member of the political party through which he was elected to

5 6

Parliament, then he vacates his Seat in Parliament upon the expiration of one month from ceasing to be a Member of that political party.

A question has arisen as to whether those who resigned from the SLFP have also ceased to be Members of the UPFA by that very fact of resigning from the SLFP or by taking membership in another political party, whether they have so lost their membership in the SLFP and consequently lost their membership in the UPFA as well. Now, that is a question of fact which needs to be ascertained. It cannot be something that is covered up and kept, because it concerns the composition of Parliament, as to whether there are "strangers" in the House here today. I take the view that there are "strangers" in the House today and they must be asked to vacate the Chamber.

But, if there is a question of fact to be ascertained, surely Parliament is competent to ascertain that fact and we will be moving for an appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into that question of fact to ascertain as to whether some Members, some who claim to be Members and who have entered this Chamber today, have in fact lost their membership in Parliament; because that is a crucial question as to the composition of this Parliament itself. I will be moving for an appointment of a Select Committee. For those two reasons that I have just enumerated, I appeal to the Hon. Speaker that the position of the Leader of the Opposition ought not to be changed until you take these two matters into consideration.

We also wish to address the Hon. Speaker in writing within a couple of days, placing our position in this respect. This is on a matter of principle, not because anybody wants to hang on to any seat. - [Interruption.] It is on a matter of principle that we were even forced to go to court when, on wrong advice, Parliament was even dissolved purportedly. It had been held by the Supreme Court by a unanimous Judgment by seven Judges that that was a violation of the Constitution by no less a person than the President of this country.

So, we do not want the Constitution violated any further. If some Members have ceased to be Members of Parliament, they must withdraw from this Chamber now. If they refuse to do that, this Parliament is perfectly competent to inquire into that question of fact and a Select Committee of Parliament can go into that. Until such time, I earnestly request the Hon. Speaker that the position of the Leader of the Opposition not be changed.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) In that case, Hon. Member, you have to give me a written submission, because I have to take a decision fairly early. By Friday, I will give my Ruling on this.

The Hon. Ajith P. Perera may speak next and then the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila - we do not want to have a debate on this - and after that, the Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha may speak.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Rauff Hakeem.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Speaker, I would like to refer to a text message that has come on the webpage of "Daily Mirror which says that "the UPFA Parliamentary Group has decided to nominate the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Opposition Leader in Parliament." Now the problem is, Sir, the former President has become a former Member of Parliament. That is the issue now. So this is a very critical question. I have nothing personal against the Hon. Rajapaksa, but the question is whether we are to call him "Hon. Rajapaksa" or "Mr. Rajapaksa". -[Interruption.]

Mr. Speaker, the issue is this. We know our Constitution says that the judicial power of the people shall be exercised by courts through Parliament except in the case of privileges and powers of Parliament.

The judicial power of the people is vested in this House. Now, this is a matter that has to be gone into and decided upon by this House and the House alone. Therefore, it is important for us to set up a Select Committee to go into this in detail to see whether this matter of fact is, in fact, true or not.

I also know that the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila and the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara being Attorneys-at-Law have wrongly advised His Excellency the President and have, unfortunately, put the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa too into serious trouble- always giving wrong advice. - [Interruption.] Therefore, this issue has to be ascertained by this House and we have to await the determination. Once the Select Committee is appointed, let us go into this in detail. We have to examine the constitution of the UPFA, which is lodged with the Commissioner of Elections. - [Interruption.] We have to summon the Commissioner of Elections and ask him to produce that constitution - we have the constitution - to see who the constituent parties of UPFA are and how the membership of the UPFA is decided because the UPFA is the party that contested the last Parliamentary Election.

9 10

Also, Article 99 (13) is very clear, which states that only when a Member is expelled from a party that he can go to court within one month. Otherwise, ipso facto, immediately once that Member obtains membership of another party and his membership ceases, then his Parliamentary Seat also ceases immediately - not in the expiration of one month.

So, these are facts that we have to go into in detail. Standing Order No. 21 talks about strangers in the House and though it can be raised and we can ask the Hon. Members who are "strangers" to withdraw, we are not going to go that far. We will await the determination of the Select Committee once it is appointed.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay. I will look into that. . ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

....if this Court were to deny relief merely on the basis that the Petitioners have failed to establish unequal treatment, we would in fact be inviting the State to equally violate the law. It is blasphemous and would strike at the very heart of Article 4 (d) which mandates every organ of the State to respect, secure and advance the fundamental rights recognized by the Constitution. Rule of Law dictates that every act that is not sanctioned by the law and every act that violates the law be struck down as illegal. It does not require positive discrimination or unequal treatment. An act that is prohibited by the law receives no legitimacy merely because it does not discriminate between people.

[2.31p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to start by reminding ourselves that abolishing the Executive Presidency was a cornerstone of the Yahapalana Governments plan, guided by the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thero and it is now time to recommit to that goal. It is safe to say that it has never been clearer why we need to abolish the system of Executive Presidency.

The events of the last 51 days in our country should leave us in no doubt that the concentration of power in one office is a recipe for disaster. After having seen the ill effects of this, we cannot turn a blind eye - we have to act now. We have seen how this august House, the Parliamentary branch of Government, functioned to uphold democracy and the due process despite the heinous act of the Executive. We have seen how the Hon. Speaker courageously upheld due process amidst an onslaught from the Executive as well as from some Members of this very House. We have seen how the Judiciary upheld the supreme law of the land - our Constitution - amidst an attack on it from the Executive.

Our countrys democratic institutions will only be strong if we have a meaningful distribution of power between the three branches - Presidency, Parliament and the Judiciary. It is about making sure that one person does not wield all the authority and hold the country hostage, as we saw over the last 51 days. The Executive Presidency must go.

The argument that has been put forward for a while is that a strong State requires a strong Executive President. But look at the last 51 days. What kept this State strong was the strong Legislature, its Speaker and the strong and independent Judiciary; not the Presidency. In fact, the actions of the Presidency weakened our State and did not strengthen it. That weakened the State economically and weakened it in the international community.

We need to bust some myths today. The Executive Presidency does not lead to a stronger State. The Executive Presidency does not strengthen the unitary status of our country. The Executive Presidency does not lead to a more stable government. We must bring primacy to this Parliament, the elected Representatives of the people from all corners of our country, all ethnicities and all religions. It is clearly apparent from this crisis that the Executive Presidency is posing a serious threat towards strengthening of Legislature and all of us, as Members of this Legislature, need to double down and commit to abolishing the Executive Presidency.

We commenced on this path through the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution which reined in the absolute powers of the Executive and brought more of it to Parliament. And for the last 51 days you could see how vital this Amendment was.

Now it is time to complete the job to abolish the Executive Presidency. It has never been clearer the dangers of concentrating so much power in the hands of one office rather than distributing more power to the Parliament or people's representatives. We should not let go this renewed opportunity, this renewed rationale.

I call upon all Members of this House to vote for this Motion and campaign in the country when a Referendum is brought in to abolish the Executive Presidency.

Thank you very much.

[3.02p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to say a few words on the Adjournment Motion moved by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. This issue of abolition of Executive Presidency, as all the speakers before me have adverted to, has been there for quite some time. It has not just been there but it has had the endorsement of our people at every Presidential Election. So the mandate of the people to abolish Executive Presidency has been with us for quite some time.

In fact, in 2015, when the Presidential Election was held we thought that the Executive Presidency as a system of government will be abolished very soon. But unfortunately through the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution we were able to do only a part of what needed to be done and if one remembers the day the Nineteenth Amendment was passed, repeatedly this House was assured that through a new Constitution whatever that could not be accomplished in the Nineteenth Amendment would be addressed and accomplished. Executive Presidency - or rather the abolition of the Executive Presidency - is an important element of that. This has dragged for some time. Although in the process that we have to draft a new Constitution for the country, we have in the Interim

Report suggested that the Executive Presidency be abolished. In arriving at the Interim Report, in the committee discussions, there was a point at which all parties actually agreed to the abolition. However, subsequently when political parties made their positions known on various issues some of the political parties namely, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, All Ceylon Makkal Congress and the Tamil Progressive Alliance made certain reservations with regard to the abolition of Executive Presidency.

The very recent incidents that have happened in this country, I am sure, have now caused those Parties also to reconsider their position with regard to Executive Presidency. In fact, they have said so. We should now, without any further delay, abolish the Executive Presidency. But, it is not only the abolition of the Executive Presidency, the new Constitution that has been promised must also be brought. That is a promise to the people and as an integral part of that, the abolition of the Executive Presidency also must happen.

While the process to enact a new Constitution was being delayed, we saw various other events overtaking us and the conduct of the Executive President himself is an important part of that. So, we are here today after almost two months of a constitutional crisis that was triggered off by the Executive President. The Executive President who purported to exercise powers which he did not have - perhaps labouring under misconception, under wrong advice or the habit that had been formed by the Constitution as it obtained prior to the Nineteenth Amendment - made certain moves.

On the 26th of October, first, he purported to remove the Prime Minister in office and appoint another in his place. That power that the President had prior to the Nineteenth Amendment was specifically removed from the Constitution through the Nineteenth Amendment. Article 47 enumerated as (a), (b) (c) -three ways in which a sitting Prime Minister lost that post. Article 47. (a) was, if the President removed the Prime Minister from office. So, the President was empowered to remove the Prime Minister from office. That Article 47. (a) or rather Article 47 now finds place in the Constitution, after the Nineteenth Amendment, as 46. (2) and in Article 46. (2), there are only two situations that are listed instead of the three that were there prior to that, and the one that had been taken out or removed is the power of the President to remove a Prime Minister.

So, in the Nineteenth Amendment, quite clearly, the President's power to remove a Prime Minister at will was repealed, was taken out, and the President no longer has that power. Nevertheless, that act was done. This House, subsequently on the 14th of November, declared that act to be unconstitutional and illegal.

Thereafter, His Excellency prorogued Parliament. He first announced 16th of November as the date on which Parliament was to convene subsequent to prorogation. However, subsequently, he advanced that date to 14th November. But, in the meantime, on the 09th of November, he issued certain Proclamations. By a

41 42

Proclamation, he purported to dissolve Parliament. Again, that was a power that His Excellency the President had prior to the Nineteenth Amendment. After the expiration of one year, if the previous Parliament had not been sooner dissolved, the President could dissolve Parliament. But in the Nineteenth Amendment, that situation changed drastically and the power of the President to dissolve Parliament at will was circumscribed, was limited, was restricted and he could not dissolve Parliament for a period of four-and-a-half years from the first Sitting of a Parliament unless Parliament itself, by a Resolution adopted by two-thirds, requested the President to do so. These are all very clearly spelt out in black and white.

Unfortunately though, disregarding these clear and specific provisions that had been brought in by the Nineteenth Amendment, His Excellency purported to dissolve Parliament and several Members of this House and other citizens challenged such act of the President in the Supreme Court. That, again, was made possible because in the Nineteenth Amendment, the blanket immunity that the President had previously had been relaxed and a citizen could invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court by a Fundamental Rights petition against the official acts of the President. Those were the applications that were heard by the Supreme Court eventually by a Bench of seven Judges and the unanimous conclusion of those seven Judges is that the President had violated the Constitution when he purported to dissolve Parliament before the expiration of a period of four-and-a-half years from the date of first Sitting of this Parliament.

During this process, many people made comments about the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution saying it was hurriedly brought, ill-conceived, badly drafted et cetera. But, if one reads the Judgments of the Supreme Court, one can rest assured that there is no such thing and the Nineteenth Amendment is lucid, clear, unambiguous and had made deep inroads into the powers of the Executive President, as promised to the people before His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena contested the 2015 Presidential Election.

In point of fact, in November, 2014, when the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena addressed a press conference and declared himself to be the Joint Opposition Candidate, the first time he made that deceleration, he made three promises to the country. The first of those promises was that he would abolish the Executive Presidency. The second promise was that he would reform the Parliamentary Election System and the third was that he would appoint the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister. Those were the three promises that candidate Maithripala Sirisena gave the people of this country in November, 2014.

Through the Nineteenth Amendment, although we did make serious strides in the direction of abolishing the Executive Presidency, in my opinion, Sir, what we have today can hardly be called Executive Presidency, if you compare it with what we had prior to the Nineteenth Amendment. But, unfortunately, no one quite appreciated

what had been done through the Nineteenth Amendment. There is very little that the President can do by himself after the Nineteenth Amendment. Even with regard to governance, even with regard to his role in Cabinet, his role with regard to appointment of Ministers, assignment of subjects and functions, there is very little that he can do unilaterally or, as he pleases. The Nineteenth Amendment has brought a situation where the President and the Prime Minister must work together and if they do not, we would have a situation of standoff as we had.

So, the Nineteenth Amendment was only a stopgap, was only an initiative - it could only be something temporary until you did it in full. So, if abolition of the Executive Presidency is a programme, we have done half way or, maybe a little further than half way, but it must be done in full. You cannot continue with the Nineteenth Amendment being part of our Constitution for too long. We will face situations like we faced in the last month or so.

So, this must change. As the Hon. (Dr.) Jayampathy Wickramaratne pointed out, there cannot be two centres of power. Now we have that under the Nineteenth Amendment and that must be rectified. In rectifying that, we must give effect to the mandate that the people of this country had given this Parliament, not only to this Parliament, they have been giving this mandate for quite some time, for two decades. But at least in this Parliament that must be accomplished, that must be honoured, and the abolition of Executive Presidency must necessarily form an important part of the new Constitution that we enact in this Parliament or, through a process of this Parliament and a Referendum. That too is a promise and that must be accomplished.

Many people think that the time has run out, the opportunity has been missed that it is now not possible to enact a new Constitution. I do not think so. I think the lessons that we learnt in the last 50 odd days will be useful in Members of this House and the citizens of this country - the voters of this country - deciding on the enactment of a new Constitution. The experience of this country over the last month or so should not be wasted, should not be in vain. There have been some sideshows also and I am sure the citizenry has watched those sideshows also. The sideshows are that in this whole process anybody who does not belong to the majority community has no place or no role to play in the national life of this country. That is a not so subtle message that keeps getting communicated to the country. So, for instance, if I, Sumanthiran, plays a role with regard to these matters, that is a message that is given. Hidden behind that is the message, How dare he, a Tamil, play a role in the national life of our country. That is the question, most often unarticulated question, but some articulated it also. These sideshows have also been watched by our people. When I say "our people", I particularly mean the majority community of this country. They detest that kind of communalism that is being spewed out venomously by certain politicians.

We have had not just the last two months experience; we have had the experience of three-decade-long bloody

43 44

[ .. ]

2018 18

war in this country. No one wants to return to those days. If that is to be achieved, then one must realize that every citizen of this country, whatever be his ethnicity, his language, where he lives, he has an equal stake in the affairs of this country. There is no second-class citizen of this country. All are equal is a proposition that I think our people have embraced and they know the value of that and that is why I say when in these sideshows these attempts are made to whip up base communal feelings, our people will reject them and reject they must.

When a new Constitution is presented, as amongst other things, a solution to the Tamil national question that has plagued this country for seven long decades, we will have a verdict from our people, not just from people who are numerically the minority in this country, but from the majority community itself, rejecting these tribal, communal notions and endorsing that everyone in this country is equal and they must have due place and the facility to participate as an equal citizen in this country in all its affairs. You cannot be said to be disabled, if you are a Tamil or a Muslim or a Christian or a Hindu, somehow inferior. Numbers do not give you status, numbers do not give anyone any higher status, it is the commitment of a person to that country that gives him status.

Our people have repeatedly, through democratic elections, informed the country that we are willing to live within a united, undivided, maybe even indivisible country and that therefore, the others must acknowledge that readiness, must clasp the hand that has been stretched out by us. But if you do not do that, if anybody tells me that I have no place to play a role in the national affairs of this country, that person cannot tell me that I must remain in this country. If I am not an equal citizen of this country, I cannot be held by force to be a citizen of this country. I would have every right to demand that I go my separate way. So, the choice is of the majority community. We have said very clearly what our position is, and by our acts and deeds even in the last few days, we have shown that we are willing to participate and live as full citizens of this country. The choice is with those who do not want to accept that offer. They are the ones who will be responsible if the country does not progress, if it regresses.

So, on this opportunity when we discuss the very important issue of abolition of the Executive Presidency, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I want to bring to the attention of the House and the country that that must be a necessary part of the new Constitution that we make, because a Constitution is a social contract between the peoples who live in this country. So far, we have not had a social contract to which all the peoples of this country have consented to and we still have that opportunity.

Time may be short, but quite sufficient for us to do that and I appeal to all that we do not squander that opportunity, that we use that opportunity, that we abolish the Executive Presidency and make a new Constitution for the country, where all the people will be equal and share power in an equal way. Thank you.

[.. 3.29] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) .

, ... , , . , 51 , . .

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today we are discussing this Motion that pertains to the question of the abolition of the Executive Presidency. Since 1982, successive presidential candidates have campaigned for a mandate to abolish the Executive Presidency. Every one of them have also succeeded in breaching that mandate, attempting to contest a subsequent Presidential Election. One President quite recently brought about the Eighteenth Amendment to perpetually remain the President of this country. So, the lure, the greed to retain power, particularly Executive power, is such that everyone who promised to abolish the Presidency succeeded in not abolishing it, but doing the reverse by attempting to retain it, contest it once again as well as attempting to be in office perpetually. So, that is the history of the abolition of the Executive Presidency in this country.

More particularly on two occasions, directly the Executive President could not control Parliament and a different party came to power in Parliament, which resulted in serious duality in power. There had been two centres of power. We experienced this between 2001 and

45 46

2004, where Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, who was elected to her second term, had to survive with a hostile Parliament, of which the current Prime Minister had control. I was a central figure in that drama since she lost power in Parliament because she expelled me from Cabinet and I had to cross the Floor of this House and within five months of my going to the Opposition, the Government lost its majority and she had to dissolve Parliament.

In the subsequent election, we joined the United National Party as a constituent party of the then United National Front Coalition, defeated Her Excellency the Presidents Party - the Peoples Alliance - and formed the administration. So, during that period between 2001 to 2004, there was an attempt to survive as a Cohabitation Government. That experience resulted in serious policy differences between the two sections: particularly, the Executive President's Party and those who represented her in Parliament as well as the Party which had the majority in Parliament, that of the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, who had to be sent out of power in the Election in 2004. So, this experiment of cohabitation between two centres of power when they are from different political parties is something that we are experiencing now. Once again, I am, in this whole drama, another central figure by being on the side of the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe whereas we elected His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena on a common platform with a variety of different partners, both directly and indirectly.

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna also joined in the struggle to unseat His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa for the very reason that he wanted to perpetuate his power by bringing in the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution and arrogate to himself all executive power in one single office which became a serious threat to Parliamentary democracy in the country. His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena contested the election on a platform of totally abolishing the Executive Presidency and with a promise not to seek office once again. However, his actions for the past one year or more has convinced all of us that he is seeking to renege the promise he made to the people and whether directly or indirectly he is attempting to seek power again by wishing at least to become a candidate in the next election.

Yesterday we had a massive rally in the Galle Face Green, perhaps one of the largest rallies that this country ever saw. People turned up to celebrate the restoration of democracy in the country, since they saw the attempt by the purported Government that was installed wrongfully and unconstitutionally by His Excellency the President in the October 26th swearing-in ceremony. So we have seen quite interestingly the swearing-in ceremonies of Prime Ministers being done in secret without media being present twice, one to install Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister and the other to swear in Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister.

Be that as it may, today we are grappling with the situation of whether we should continue with this dual

centres of power and that it is totally unsuitable for the countrys democracy, but little forgetting that the electoral system in the country too plays a role in this. That is why we, minority parties, were quite keen that we should address the issue of the electoral system as well together with the abolishing of the Executive Presidency. Yesterday, the Prime Minister was seen to suggest that he wants a two-thirds majority to abolish the Executive Presidency and install a Parliamentary System of Governance after removing the Executive Presidential System whereas his Deputy Leader, Sajith Premadasa very openly said that we must contest and carry on this Government up to next September or October - the full term of His Excellency the President - and conduct the next Presidential Election and then attempt to win that election. So the United National Party itself appears to be having two points of view and this is a question of some confusion for some of us who are in this coalition. So it is important for us to address that issue.

Sir, we need to resolve serious political questions about the electoral system. None of us are in favour of abolishing the current electoral system for the reason that we have experienced the worst in the Local Government Election as well as in the attempt to change the electoral system of the Provincial Councils. In six Provincial Councils, no elections have been held and the Delimitation Committees Report has been rejected by this Parliament even by the Minister who brought the system voting against it. That was the comedy of errors that we saw being staged in Parliament.

Therefore, there is a dilemma here. Of course, the Janatha Vimukuthi Peramuna wants the Executive Presidency abolished for the right reasons. But we cannot divorce it from the entire Constitution and the need to change the other things. What about the devolution aspect? We must also remember that abolishing of the Executive Presidency cannot be done without a Referendum because there are entrenched Articles that needs to be changed and that will certainly attract a Referendum and the Supreme Court will no doubt rule that this question cannot be decided by this Parliament alone by a two-thirds majority. It has to be subjected to a Referendum. So, if a Referendum is to be won, all sections of the country have got to be convinced that we do not want such a system. So, people are not interested in piecemeal tinkering with the Constitution. What we want is an overall Constitutional reform which will replace the Constitution with a new system by addressing every issue of contention.

That is why we appointed a Steering Committee and that Steering Committees Report has been finalized and we have tabled it in Parliament. We were to debate it. We have perhaps come to some understanding with the Tamil National Alliance that by February we will introduce it to Parliament to attempt to see whether we can have an endorsement of that with a two-thirds majority in this House. But there are different points of view. -[Interruption.] No, we need to look at whether we can introduce changes to the Constitution with an agreement by all parties because now the JVP does not want the Executive Presidential System; some of you

47 48

[ ]

2018 18

want to change the electoral system; some have issues pertaining to the devolution aspects of the Constitution and His Excellency the President seems to be having serious reservations about the appointment of judges through the Constitutional Council. Having voted for it ; having approved it, he is now beginning to complain that the senior-most judges do not get appointed since the Constitutional Council is not looking at seniority. This is one of those complaints that he sought to make when we were summoned to meet with him when the Prime Minister was sworn in. Everybody listened to what he said.

Now there is an issue concerning three political leaders in the country. One is Maithripala Sirisena, the other is Ranil Wickremesinghe and the next one is, Mahinda Rajapaksa.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Thank you.

These three political leaders are looking at their political future. So, the abolition of the Executive Presidency or reintroducing the Westminster System cannot be designed for the whims and fancies of these three individuals. The Constitution of the country is not the property of Ranil Wickremesinghe or Maithripala Sirisena or Mahinda Rajapaksa. That is an eternal document. That is the sacred book upon which this entire country's governance is conducted.

Now, what is the problem? The Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa wishes to abolish the Executive Presidency because he cannot contest the next Executive Presidency. It is an issue for him. The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe is a leader who does not believe in emotional, sentimental propaganda or irrational campaign to mislead the masses. He himself has not contested the last two Presidential Elections, but he feels that since he is a political leader who appeals to the intelligentsia of the country, he cannot conduct an emotional, sentimental or irrational campaign. So, he has always opted to let others contest for the Presidential Election. He has an interest in restoring Parliamentary democracy so that he can get himself re-elected to Parliament and then control Executive power through Parliament without an Executive Presidency as a different centre of power. His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena, having promised the country that he is going to abolish the Executive Presidency, now wants perhaps to look at a second bite at the cherry as we call it, to try and contest the Executive Presidency once again having promised the country that he will not seek re-election. So, this question cannot be decided on the whim and fancy of individual political leaders, but we have got to look at how the governance has been impacted by having dual centres of power, whether we are able to have proper

separation of powers in the context of the Executive Presidential System.

Certainly, we saw that during the last 51 days, the experience of this country was such that an irrational, emotional and sentimental President, who is hell-bent on trying to interpret the Constitution to his own convenience, can seriously jeopardize governance in the country. That is what we experienced. Seven Judges of the Supreme Court of this country unanimously held that the constitutional provisions had been violated in dissolving Parliament. The question of installing a Prime Minister went before the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court, in a unanimous verdict, held that the dissolution of Parliament was unconstitutional. With that, at least indirectly, the issue pertaining to the majority of Parliament deciding the fate of Prime Minister was put to rest. So, all these complications arise out of this particular issue.

Now, it is a sour grapes story. You tried to grab power through the back door. Now, at least through the front door, you have come and taken the position of the Leader of the Opposition. Never try it through the back door. You tried to grab power of the Prime Ministerial Office through the back door. Now, you have come through the front door taking the- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Out of your advice, the former President, I hope, will not become a former Member of Parliament. I mentioned this morning, there is a serious issue. Let alone being the Leader of the Opposition, whether he is a Member of Parliament has to be decided by a Select Committee of this House ultimately. I am not being personal here. I have my deepest respect for the former President. I asked him when I met him after this crisis why he was in such a haste. Some of you have pushed him into a serious political debacle. A man who was riding in the high wave of popularity has compromised his popularity unnecessarily trying to grab power through the back door to satisfy a few of you who had misled him. That is his fate. I hope he would see some saner counsel soon and resign to his fate as the Leader of the Opposition in the coming years to come.

Thank you.
