( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) [2.27p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella - Minister of Public Enterprise and Kandy City Development and Leader of the House of Parliament) Hon. Presiding Member, there is a statement by the Hon. State Minister of Foreign Affairs, which I will read out.

The Stafford International School in Doha

The Ambassador to the State of Qatar H.E. A.S.P Liyanage is a non-career diplomat appointed by the Presidential authority with effect from 16th March, 2017.

1. As the conflict between the Ambassador and the management of the Stafford International School in Doha protracted without a solution, the Hon. Vasantha Senanayake, State Minister of Foreign Affairs convened a meeting chaired by His Excellency the President in attendance of both Ambassador Liyanage and the Chairman and Members of the school Board of Trustees on 28th May, 2018. At this meeting, H. E. the President advised all parties that no action should be taken until further directives are issued to resolve the issues affecting the school. However, it appears further directives were not issued through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to date.

2. In this regard, during the Meeting of Cabinet of Ministers held on 07th August, 2018, the Hon. State Minister of Foreign Affairs in his capacity as Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Hon. Harin Fernando, Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment requested H.E. the President for another meeting with the parties to the conflict for settling the issue for good. H.E. the President assured the Ministers of an opportunity of another meeting and accordingly we await such a meeting scheduled to be given by H.E. the President in due course.

Hon. Presiding Member, about one-and-a-half years ago, I had the good fortune of going to Qatar because I was invited for a prize-giving of that school. That is a very good school. So, it is a pity that it has fallen into problems. That school has over 1,000 students and for Sri Lankan families who are working in Qatar, this is a blessing in disguise. Otherwise, over 1,000 families would have been separated. If there was no school, those who are working in Qatar would have to leave behind

1291 1292

[ ]

2018 10

their wives and children in Sri Lanka and they would be alone in Qatar. So, this school has brought nearly 1,000 families together. It is a very good school.

So, I think His Excellency the President should intervene and save this school. Otherwise, 1,000 families will be separated and the great service it is doing to those who are working in Qatar will be greatly prejudiced. I must say, the Qatar Government was so impressed with that school that when I was there, they even donated two acres of land to that school for its expansion. That is the esteem in which this school was held. So, I hope that all parties concerned will put their heads together and find a solution to this problem.

Thank you.
