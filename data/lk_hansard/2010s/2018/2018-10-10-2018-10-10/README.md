: DEFAMATORY MEDIA REPORTS: STATEMENT BY

MINISTER OF DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES AND

INTERNATIONAL TRADE ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama - Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I wish to inform you that there seems to be a targeted attempt by certain sections of the social media and an electronic media channel in particular, to discredit me.

While I was in Germany on official work about 10 days ago, I was made to understand that a Director of Ceylon High Speed Railway Limited, a company who had sent a proposal to the Board of Investment to produce and

export high speed trains, has accused the State Minister and myself of requesting for a commission of US Dollars 25 million to have the project proposal approved. This is totally a false allegation. In fact, I have never met this party, nor have I spoken to them or even seen the colour of them.

I do not wish to delve into the details of the process through which the BOI and the Single Window Investment Approval Committee approves the investment proposals submitted to the BOI, since the BOI Officials have given a detailed description of how the proposals are evaluated and approved. At no stage do the Ministers get involved in the approval process. However, I have requested for and received a report of this proposal from BOI, which I would like to table*.

I would like to highlight some elements of the proposal submitted, so that Hon. Members of this House can see for themselves whether the proposal should be approved or not. Sir, the investor is a company set up in Sri Lanka on 09th April, 2015 with two local directors and the company has 100 shares. The proposal is to setup a high speed train manufacturing plant in Sri Lanka, including seven final assembly plants and 34 factories to produce sub-systems for the final assembly line. They also want to construct a dedicated jetty at Muthurajawela. Project investment for the initial phase is Euro 488 million; the working capital is Euro 2.2 billion and the timeline is 12 years.

What do they require from us? They want outright purchase of Government lands of 2,242 acres in three locations and a private land of 1,823 acres in six locations. So, in total, over 4,000 acres and they want all these areas to be declared as licensed zones under Section 22 of the BOI Law.

Then, they also want to bring in the following capital goods free of customs duties and free of all charges. I will read that out. They want to bring, 220 prime movers, 40 excavators, 30 JCBs, 600 fork lifts, 75 boom trucks, 100 land vehicles, 50 buses, 400 bicycles, 1,200 water pumps, 1,500 air-conditioning units, four helicopters with aviation approval, 22 special vehicles for families of investors, three 36-floor office buildings, two ships and 10,000 mobile phones.

The other requirements they want from the Government are - relaxation of import and export control procedures; 95 per cent special income tax exemptions and all spare parts and fuels on tax free basis; electricity power under special tariff; permission to operate a fully-fledged private bank to facilitate leasing, loans, finance, current accounts, L/Cs, bank guarantees and so on; permission to set up a private university; approval and licence to be given to set up and maintain technological and educational public TV channels and radio channels and three-star level accommodation building in each zone with a licence to operate with international liquor and club licence to cater to the needs of foreign employees.

1187 1188

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

. , .

Again last week, the same media institutions alleged that a sum of Rs. 150 million - that is Rs. 1,500 lakhs- had been received to be credited to my bank account and that the Central Bank had frozen the funds. This is again a totally false allegation. I have checked with the Central Bank and I was informed that no such funds had been received to be credited to any Cabinet Minister's account. However, I have written to the DIG of the CID to investigate into this matter at his earliest convenience and take necessary action against any Cabinet Minister, if such funds had been received. Sir, I am tabling* the letter I have sent to the DIG.

Sir, is this the media freedom that we wanted? This is nothing, but freedom of the wild ass.

I request the Hon. Speaker to kindly take necessary steps to prevent Members of Parliament from being insulted and defamed by the irresponsible media coming out with fake news. If not, no decent person will want to enter Parliament.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) .

OFFICE FOR REPARATONS BILL . . Order for Second Reading read. [2.48 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - Prime Minister, Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs} Hon. Deputy Speaker, I move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time"

Sir, the Office for Reparations Bill is one of those that we have proposed to ensure reconciliation in this country. We have had a long history of fighting - I need not go into it - of armed conflicts, not only in the North, but also in the South and of people who have disappeared. Once we put all this behind us, it is necessary that we find out what has happened to them and also give reparation to the affected parties.

Providing reparations has been a policy of the Government since 1983 when the July riots took place and we established by law the Rehabilitation of Persons, Properties and Industries Authority. This Office for Reparations will replace that Authority. We are repealing the Persons, Properties and Industries Authority Act by this Bill, but all acts done under that law and all the programmes undertaken by that Authority will be carried on by the Office for Reparations. As far as the employees of the Authority are concerned, all will be absorbed to this Office except for those who prefer to take compensation and leave.

The objectives of this Office for Reparations are to formulate and recommend to the Cabinet of Ministers Policies on Reparations, facilitate and implement such policies and monitor and evaluate the progress of delivery of reparations to eligible aggrieved persons. In the Bill, under "Interpretation", the "aggrieved persons" have been defined as "persons who have suffered a violation of human rights or humanitarian law". In the Amendment, we have further defined them in terms of the First, Second, Third and Fourth parts of the Geneva Convention of 1949.

Reparations can be "individual reparations" or "collective reparations" as defined in the Bill. In addition to that, they will also take action on the recommendations made by the Office on Missing Persons. If a person is missing and reparation has to be given, it will be done.

So, Sir, that is the scope of the legislation we have introduced to this House. It is a needed piece of legislation. The Office for Reparations will be run by five Members appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Constitutional Council, one of whom he will appoint as the Chairperson. So, this is a much needed piece of legislation which will look after reparations either for people who have been affected or for their families, maybe, in the North, maybe, in the South, maybe, in the East, maybe, in the West or maybe, in the Central Province.

Sir, I commend the Bill to the House and leave it to my Colleague, the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, to give a longer description of what is planned by this.

. . Question proposed.

[.. 2. 2] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana -Minister of Foreign Affairs) , . . , 1982 "REPPIA" .

. " :" .

Hon. Deputy Speaker, if I may continue in English, you will see that the objectives of this Bill are set out in Clause 2, which states, I quote:

"(a) to formulate and recommend to the Cabinet of Ministers, Policies on Reparations to grant individual and collective reparations to aggrieved persons;"

So, this implies that it is not only those in the North and the East - who have been affected due to the war situation that prevailed - who are included, but also the aggrieved persons as defined in this Bill. It is a much larger category of persons. The interpretation of "aggrieved persons" that is contained in Clause 27 of this Bill would also include all those persons who have suffered in connection with political unrest or civil disturbances, in the course of systematic gross violation of the rights of individuals and also who have suffered in consequence of the conflict that took place in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. Therefore, - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Hon. Minister, are you referring to the Amendments that have been made to Clause 27?

( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) The Amendments are there, but there is no Amendment to this -[Interruptio.]

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) There are Amendments that are placed on our tables. ( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) What I read out was - ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) What is given in the Bill is what had been proposed earlier. But, the Determination of the Supreme Court is on the Amendments. What you were reading out is in the Bill.

( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) Hon. Member, there is no Amendment to - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) There are Amendments to Clause 27, which have been placed on our tables.

( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) Clause 27(a) (ii) has not been amended in that way; it still remains: in connection with political unrest or civil disturbances;. That is what I read out. That still remains; that has not been amended. - [Interruption.] Clause 27 has been amended, but that particular subsection which states in connection with political unrest or civil disturbances" has not been amended; it remains as it is. What gets amended is the whole of subsection (a) of Clause 27. That complete subsection will be left out and then be substituted with the line persons who have suffered damage as a result of ...... That is the substitution.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Will the lines which refer to, Northern and Eastern Provinces" be left out?

( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) Northern and Eastern Provinces... portion will be there. But the earlier line will be left out. If you look at the Amendments that are suggested, only line 14 will be left out. But lines 15 and 16 which refer to Northern and Eastern Provinces will remain.

1191 1192

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) That will remain? ( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) Yes, that will remain. This is only to bring it in line with the observations of the Supreme Court where it was decided to leave out this portion and replace it with the Amendments suggested.

Anyway, Hon. Deputy Speaker, as I was saying, there is much to be achieved by means of this piece of legislation. Our people have suffered due to various riots and civil disturbances earlier. For example, we can remember the riots that took place in Kandy in the recent past, some sort of civil disturbances. Then, we also had a similar incident in Beruwala area some time ago. Then, I recall, in 1997, I think, there was a lot of unrest in Ratnapura with the assassination of the Hon. Member of Parliament, Nalanda Ellawala: many houses were burnt and there were a lot of rioting and many people suffered loss to their properties due to those disturbances. We had an insurrection also in 1971. There were disturbances that took place in the country in 1986. We all are aware of these things. I do not want to remind you and reiterate all these things. In all these instances, though there were severe damages and losses caused to various persons, there was no permanent mechanism to make reparation for those damages. Also, there were ad hoc Cabinet Papers that were presented. But I do not think that those Cabinet Papers served justice to all those persons who had suffered as a result of those disturbances.

So, I think, the establishment of a permanent body in the nature of Office for Reparations is very laudable. It is a much-needed mechanism to address all those things that had happened in the past. I believe that the scope of this legislation would be wide enough to apply to all category of persons. Irrespective of their community and political differences, anyone in Sri Lanka who has suffered as a result of disturbances or any type of an upheaval as set out in Clause 27, will now have an opportunity of being classified as a person who is required to be compensated and reparation will be made available to him.

So, I think this piece of legislation, which was primarily intended to address the issues and reparations arisen as a result of the war for the Northern and the Eastern Province is equally applicable to the South where a lot of our people, from time to time, have suffered due to various communal disturbances and unrests. So, they can also make use of this piece of legislation to get the reparation they deserve.

In conclusion, I wish to say, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that these type of legislations are things that we have undertaken on our own, not done merely because we are required to do it by the international community. Just like human rights, I think, we should take this very seriously for the sake of our own people so that their living

conditions will be made better and they will enjoy the fruits of life. So, as a responsible Government, we should ensure that these things are in place so that our people can get the benefit of these things. Human rights privileges that we are seeking to get for our people, is only a part of it. So, I would commend the House to endorse this piece of legislation without any division so that our people can reap the benefits of this.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Thank you. The next speaker is the Hon. S. Shritharan. Before he commences his speech, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Kanaka Herath to the Chair?

( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) I propose that the Hon. Kanaka Herath do now take the Chair.

If we take reparation, we say "yes" to compensate the aggrieved non-LTTEers and "no" to compensate terrorists or the LTTE. Mr. Presiding Member, the LTTE remains a banned terrorist organization not only in Sri Lanka, but in 32 countries including India, the USA, the UK, Canada, the UAE and Malaysia. The UNSC Resolution 1373 incorporated by the Government of Sri Lanka in April, 2014 has listed 15 foreign-based organizations as LTTE fronts, warranting the countries to investigate from where

those fronts are functioning and hold them to account for material support for a terror movement under their laws as the LTTE is banned in those countries. So, taking that into consideration, when 33 countries have banned the LTTE, we are talking of reparation - [Interruption.] One of the Hon. Members said "". . .

In addition to Resolution 1373, the UNHRC has passed three Resolutions holding only the armed forces accountable for the conflict. , -

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) TNA . proxies . . [ ] . . UNHRC has passed three Resolutions holding the armed forces accountable and responsible for the conflict. . So, this is retributive justice to the national army, which is defending the country and its citizens, while offering restorative justice to LTTE terrorists, who were responsible for three decades of gruesome, premeditated murder. Only Tamils who had no links to the LTTE should receive any compensation. The LTTE terrorists should not be given any compensation. That is my case.

There was a civilian force. Who were that civilian force? civilian , , ? - .- civilian clothes ? "civilians" ? "civilians" ? . , . Is the

1203 1204

Government of Sri Lanka, in giving compensation to terrorists, not doing an injustice to the real civilians that the LTTE killed? So far, even the UN has failed to ask for the death toll of the civilians who were not involved in any acts of terror, civilians who were part of the LTTE armed forces and the civilians who were involved in hostilities either by force or voluntarily.

. , . Clause 27(a)(i) states, I quote:

"in the course of, consequent to, or in connection with the conflict which took place in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces or its aftermath; or"

Hon. Minister, I am seeking your advice. Article 12 of the Constitution clearly states, I quote:

(1) All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law.

(2) No citizen shall be discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion, language, caste, sex, political opinion, place of birth or any one of such grounds :

So, considering Article 12 (1) and (2) of the Constitution - I am proposing an amendment to take out the words "Northern and Eastern Provinces" in Clause 27(a)(i) - you are giving special treatment to them. You cannot give special treatment to them under the Article 12 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka. Therefore, I would ask that to be recorded for action to be taken accordingly.

Then, there are a few other questions that have to be asked. In terms of reparation, compensation must be given only to the civilians who were not involved in any LTTE terror acts at the time of death. How sure can the Office of Missing Persons be of this account? How can the Office of Missing Persons be sure that those people were civilians? How do you describe a "civilian" in a war situation, particularly in relation to those in the LTTE areas? A "civilian" has been described as a person who did not have a weapon with him.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) . , . , . . Sir, I would like to state that no country in the world would compensate or pay compensation to terrorists. Name one country in the world which has paid compensation when terrorists have been named and identified as destructive elements of that country. I state this to go on record that the country must compensate victims of terror, not the perpetrators of terror.

[4.13p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, when we are discussing the Office for Reparations Bill today, I am glad that the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs is here in the House. This is as a result of the Joint Resolution that had been passed in the UN Human Rights Council and also the previous undertakings that we have given under the Universal Periodic Review to address this issue of paying reparations for people who have been made to forcibly disappear and affected by the war or any other civil disturbance.

Sir, I would like to initially discuss the matter pertaining to the repeal of the REPPIA Act by this Act. Now, as a matter of fact, since the Foreign Affairs Minister had been a former Attorney General, he knows the whole history of the REPPIA Act. The REPPIA Act came into being after the 1983 disturbances. At that time, the then administration brought in the REPPIA Act through the Emergency Regulations that were promulgated to cover the entire Island. So, it was part of the Emergency Regulations initially and thereafter in 1987, they formally legislated to make REPPIA as an authority with some legal status. REPPIA was an institution that not only looked at reparations to be paid to individuals and collective bodies of people but also to restore, take over, vest the properties and to pay

1217 1218

2018 10

compensation for the properties. As a matter of fact, after the 1983 disturbances, the then J. R. Jayewardena administration felt that there were various misapprehends and various unlawful elements who were going into occupation of properties of affected people who had fled the city and other areas and they vested the properties in the REPPIA. Now, by repealing REPPIA and by not providing adequate provisions in the new Act, we are doing away with an existing mechanism which provides certain relief at very very difficult and emergency situations. Now, for instance, - [Interruption.] Yes, you have to bring transitional provisions. - [Interruption.] I do not know, but anyway, Hon. Minister, you can reply later.

Take for instance, what happened in Kandy a few months ago? There were several properties affected - a large number of properties in the Kandy District starting from Digana to Akurana and various other areas were affected. The REPPIA is the authority which is looking into the compensation element. Now, as a matter of fact, I want to raise that issue here, so that that will be brought to the notice of the Hon. Minister. I have raised this several times in the Cabinet. There are about 80 files for which more than Rs. 500,000 had to be paid as compensation. Some properties have been damaged and certain people have lost their businesses amounting to several millions of rupees. Now, these assessments have still not been completed and a proper Cabinet assessment has not been done to pay compensation for them. The REPPIA is the institution that is tasked with the responsibility to pay these compensation. So, if we are going to abolish that institution, then there has to be sufficient new provisions that should be included in the new Act which we are bringing in to replace the REPPIA as an institution. That is one issue that I want to raise with you, Hon. Minister. -[Interruption.]

Okay, thank you very much. I think there is a provision for you to formulate some policies on reparation, and recommend to the Government for approval and thereafter for the Cabinet to approve them. At least through that process, include whatever that is missing from the REPPIA Act on to this Office for Reparations Bill and that will be a very necessary thing that you should implement.

I must also say that this focuses on the missing persons also. Actually, the Office on Missing Persons Act is referred to several times in this particular Bill and this is a sequel to that Act. Therefore, the Office on Missing Persons when they identify affected people - people who have been made to disappear, people who had gone missing as a result of the war and as a result of various other agencies of Government or any other individual agencies, victims of war or civil disturbances- reparations could be paid through this Bill. But, the affected properties and affected other entitlements may not be restored through such a Bill. So, there has to be a proper provision to look into that issue and I thought that I should highlight it here.

Now, the Office on Missing Persons had been in existence for the last seven months, Hon. Minister. They have gone all over the country, all over the place, had

various public sittings and have received applications from a variety of affected people. But victims are still continuing to have some distrust in any government mechanism whether that would ultimately bring them any relief. That has been the feeling that people have. Therefore, in the first place, we have to restore that confidence. For instance, the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs as a former Attorney General is aware that in the past - Hon. Sumanthiran is also here - if people go missing the only recourse we had was a habeas corpus application in the Court of Appeal. What does the Court of Appeal do? I have myself filed these habeas corpus applications, nothing comes out of it. You file a habeas corpus application by an aggrieved party, the court entertains it and they refer it to a Magistrate for inquiry. That is the end of it. The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs will endorse this as an Attorney General. He would have had hundreds of thousands of habeas corpus applications in files in the Attorney Generals Department without any finality. So, hopefully through this Office on Missing Persons and the Office for Reparations Bill, for all these victims, some kind of finality for their loss have to be brought about and at least some reparations have to be paid. This is the onerous duty that is cast on the Members who are appointed to these two institutions, the Office for Reparations as well as the Office on Missing Persons.

So I thought I must highlight some of these things. Look at the issue that is happening in Mannar. There is a mass grave that has been found. There are anthropologists, there are archaeologists and there are forensic experts who are going and digging this mass grave. There was a mass grave that had been found in Matale. What has come out of the investigations? God knows. When did this happen? Was it during the JVP insurrection or was it during the LTTE war? There are certain excuses being trotted out to say that there was some serious health hazard that happened in that area and therefore, thousands of people could have been buried in such a fashion. I do not think anybody remembers such an incident happening anywhere in this country. But this has to be gone into. What is happening to the Matale graves? What is happening to the Mannar graves? These two issues, I think, is a matter for anybody with conscience that we have to bring finality to these things. So forensic examinations and inquiries cannot go on forever without any closure. Some closure has to be brought to this.

Therefore, I would rather urge through you, Mr. Presiding Member, that this country as an accountable international citizen should clear its name by bringing in Bills such as this to give redress to the affected people.

Thank you.

[4.24p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. I would like to express a few views, Sir, on this Office for Reparations Bill which has come up somewhat belatedly. But we are all happy that it has come up. In fact, the Office on Missing Persons (Establishment, Administration and Discharge of Functions) Bill also was delayed considerably and passed but eventually not implemented for a long time even after being passed. But, subsequently, after the Office on Missing Persons was appointed, the persons handling that responsibility, I think, are doing their very best to be as effective as they can and we are grateful for that.

I would like to make a few comments in regard to this matter because the ascertainment of truth, the delivery of justice, the issue of accountability, reparations and non-recurrence are all fundamental components of the transitional justice process; process to bring about reconciliation on the basis of truth, justice and accountability in the country which has gone through several decades of armed conflict. This Bill is a very welcome feature, Sir, but it must not be used to sideline truth and justice. Truth and justice must always prevail. Even the issue of missing persons or the issue of reparations must be dealt with on the basis of truth and justice. The Office on Reparations should be able to formulate policies based upon truth and to ensure justice to all victims. That is fundamental.

I find certain provisions in the Bill which will enable the Government to play a role in regard to the implementation of whatever policies are formulated by the Office for Reparations. This must not be a matter that comes under the control of the Government, Sir. The Office for Reparations must have the freedom to act independently in this matter to formulate the required policies and be able to find avenues to offer reparation to persons who have been victimized. Youth have been victimized in a very large manner. What are the reparations that can be given? They must be empowered to acquire skills that will enable them to carry on their life in the future independently and as best as they can. There will be reparation that must be given to youth. People need to be economically empowered. People have been impoverished as a result of the war. There needs to be economic empowerment to the people to enable them to lead their life without deprivation or denial.

Land is a fundamental issue. Yet, land is being held by the military, by the armed forces. I know that after the present Government came into being substantial action has been taken and lands have been released in many places, but land still continues to be in the occupation of the military. People have lost their lands. People have been evicted from their lands. Displaced people, when they came back to their villages, have found that their

1221 1222

2018 10

lands are being occupied by other people or, they are unable to occupy the lands. Those lands must be released to those people. Reparation in regard to land is one of the fundamental issues that the Office for Reparations has got to handle. People affected by the war as a result of the war taking place in some parts of the country, the North and the East, have not been able to receive state lands. There have been no land Kachcheries; there has been no action taken to give lands to landless people. That must be done. The Office for Reparations must formulate policies to ensure that all problems in regard to land that victims of the war have faced, whether it be army occupation, whether it be the issue of land being denied to them, whether they are unable to occupy land to which they want to return because somebody else is occupying it, all these matters must be addressed on the basis of policies that are drawn out and implemented to achieve these matters.

I also want to mention one other matter, Sir. The detainees, persons in custody, some have been convicted; some have not been charged; some have been charged and charges are pending. This matter has gone on for a long time. A number of persons are carrying out demonstrations and fasts in various prisons and various parts of the North and the East demanding the release of these people. Something needs to be done. A large number of people have been convicted purely on the basis of their confessions. In the case of a large number of people, the only evidence available against them is the confession they have made. There is no other evidence available against them. I have not been able to study the Counter Terrorism law that was tabled in Parliament, yesterday.

But I am told that under the Counter Terrorism law, confessions can no longer be admissible at the trial of a person charged with any offence. If confessions are being completely ruled out, and even the new Counter Terrorism law accepts that position, then the Government is obviously accepting the position that there can be no conviction, not even a charge based upon the confession. If that be so, the persons in custody, even persons who have been convicted, must be dealt with on the basis that they have been convicted on the confession which was the only available evidence, there being no other evidence against them, which the Government accepts now as a matter of policy is inadmissible, is invalid, is something that which Government policy would not permit to accept and is not in keeping with international norms. If that be the position Sir, I would appeal to the Government to take steps for the release of all these persons who are in custody based purely on their confession. Whether they have been convicted or charged and not convicted does not matter, but if the only evidence against them is a confession, then I would submit that they must be released and the Office for Reparations can play a role, in my view, should play a role, in ascertaining the truth in regard to this matter and taking steps with the Government to have these persons released.

Sir, we know after the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord in 1987 and during the JVP insurrection in 1971, 1988/1989, a large number of persons were released; some may not

have been released, but a large number of persons were released. So, the same rule should apply in this instance Sir. These persons are in custody for long periods of time. Sometimes they have been in custody for periods of time longer than they would have been in custody if they were tried, convicted and sentenced. I do not think Sir, that should continue and that is also a matter which I think would come within the purview of the Office for Reparations.

The Office for Reparations must comprise of capable people who are able to formulate policies based upon the hardships, the denials, the deprivations that people affected by the war, victims of the war, have gone through and be in a position to address their needs and requirements, their necessities in all these areas in a comprehensive manner.

[5.17 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member, for the opportunity given to me to say a few words on the Office for Reparations Bill that has been taken up for debate today. It is a long overdue piece of legislation and so, we welcome the introduction of this process.

Nevertheless, I wish to place on record certain misgivings that we have, even shortcomings with regard to this Bill. Before doing that, may I say that I would like to echo the sentiments of the Hon. Bimal Rathnayake and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition who spoke before me, both of whom said that a process of ascertaining the truth ought to have preceded this Office for Reparations. Truth being the first pillar in transitional justice, there should be a Truth Commission of sorts that is established to bring out the truth of what happened, particularly during the armed conflict and the various violations that took place during that period. Any armed conflict will have that feature; there is no clean armed conflict in any part of the world. So, it is important that after it is over, that we look back not with a view to vengeance, but with the view to learning lessons and with the aim of ensuring that it does not recur. So, we would have preferred a Truth Commission to precede this Bill. Nevertheless, as I said before, we welcome the introduction of this Bill.

Then, I would like to point to a couple of concerns that we have. The first is with regard to Clause 11. (1) (g), under which the Office is to "formulate and recommend to the Cabinet of Ministers, Policies on Reparations and guidelines with regard to the grant of individual and collective reparations....". In my understanding, the legislation that is approved by Parliament must set out the policy; the policy must be determined by the Legislature.

So, it is the policy of the Government to make reparations for persons who have been affected by various violations and it must categorize who those are and provide for the different kinds of reparations that must be made available to them. If the Office that is being set up through this legislation has to formulate policies and then will have to recommend to the Cabinet of Ministers the kind of reparations and the grant of reparations to individuals and others collectively, we fear that this process might be politicized. We have seen or heard the discussions that have taken place in the Cabinet - those were reported - when this Bill for Office for Reparations was discussed there.

That concerns us because we saw in this House also today a mechanism such as this, which the whole House ought to endorse wholeheartedly, being made the object of divisive politics and that kind of sentiment, unfortunately, had come out even in Cabinet discussions. In that background, we are concerned about the provision that the Office for Reparations must obtain Cabinet approval for policies and guidelines. So, as I said, that policy and guideline or the policies, at least, ought to be in the Bill itself.

Secondly, a concern which has been expressed in certain quarters - that appears in Clause 22(4) - is as to whether the disbursements that are to be made, whether every one of those disbursements, need Parliamentary approval. I do not think so. Reading that Clause, it seems that it is only the policy guidelines with regard to these disbursements that Parliament must approve. But, nevertheless, since some doubt has been aired with regard to this issue, I would very much like the Hon. Minister to clarify that situation because if that fear is justified, then it will become a mockery for Parliament to be approving each and every disbursement and I hope that is not the case.

Thirdly, one looks at this Bill and finds Clause 27 with regard to the interpretation of various words and phrases that have been used in this Bill. Then, you have the Committee Stage Amendments that have been proposed by the Government. I understand those are in keeping with the Determination of the Supreme Court. I have read the Determination of the Supreme Court and I must say, with all due respect to their lordships, that I am unable to understand or agree with that Determination. - [Interruption.] Thank you. That, again, mirrors a certain kind of fear and it is unfortunate that that fear comes through a judicial pronouncement. You find the definition of aggrieved person to be as contained in the First, Second, Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Supreme Court seems to think that that seems to violate the sovereignty of the country. These are all Conventions that Sri Lanka is signatory to and you do not have to pass enabling domestic legislation in order to adopt a definition. There are many laws that we have passed which adopt the definitions in international instruments that we have signed and ratified. So, to say that unless domestic legislation is first passed, a good definition that is found in an international instrument ought not to be adopted defeats any logic. In any case, even if that be so, this is the domestic legislation that is

1239 1240

adopting that definition. So, the fact that we are a dualist country does not take away from the fact that we can look at a good definition and adopt it as the definition that we will follow. But, unfortunately, that is the Determination of the Supreme Court and therefore, I understand that you have to change that.

But I must place here our concern with regard to even the Supreme Court falling into this kind of error and entertaining illogical fears, even with regard to the definition of human rights. Now that is being deleted entirely because, I suppose, that goes on to say, "To give effect to international human rights treaties which have been ratified by Sri Lanka." If Sri Lanka has ratified those treaties, what is wrong in adopting those definitions. That is, I repeat again, an act of passing domestic legislation. So, it is, as I said, unfortunate that we have got this Determination of the Supreme Court and these changes are being made, but I hope that making these changes does not in effect take away the intent of the Government to understand and appreciate who an "aggrieved person" is, and what is meant by "human rights".

With regard to the functioning of this office, it is our fervent hope that it will start functioning soon, and that since reparations are to be made particularly with regard to persons who have disappeared, and also those who have been affected by armed conflict et cetera that the functioning of the Office be speeded up, so that persons who have long suffered after the end of the armed conflict, for almost ten years by the time this Office starts functioning, will at least after a decade be able to find some solace.

Before I sit down might I repeat that a mechanism for the ascertainment of the truth be brought urgently alongside this Bill, so that truth as it is, whether it is palatable or not, is made known to the country so that all of us from all the different backgrounds, from all sides of the divide will learn our lessons in order that the country does not go through such a phase as we have gone through for thirty long years of the armed conflict.

Thank you.
