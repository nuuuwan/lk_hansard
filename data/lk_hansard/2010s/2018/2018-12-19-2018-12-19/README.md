STATEMENT BY HON. RAJAVAROTHIAM

SAMPANTHAN

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I seek your indulgence to make a Statement pertaining to the post of the Leader of the Opposition in the current Parliament.

The Speaker recognized me as the Leader of the Opposition being the Leader of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi, the second largest party in Opposition in the Sri Lankan Parliament in September, 2015 when Parliament was convened after the General Elections in 2015.

After questions were raised in Parliament by some other Opposition Members, the Speaker once again recognized me as the Leader of the Opposition, being the Leader of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi, the second largest party in Parliament in August, 2018. In the course of the Order the Hon. Speaker made, he stated that that was the final decision.

Yesterday, on the 18th of December, 2018, the Hon. Speaker made an Announcement in Parliament that he recognized the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Leader of the Opposition consequent to a request made by the United Peoples Freedom Alliance that he be appointed as

the Leader of the Opposition. The Hon. Speaker made the said Announcement without removing me from the post of the Leader of the Opposition to which position he himself had appointed me twice over and consequently it would seem that there are two persons now holding the position of the Leader of the Opposition in the current Parliament. The question arises as to whether the Hon. Speaker lacked the conviction to remove me from the post of the Leader of the Opposition.

That the United Peoples Freedom Alliance had many more seats in Parliament than the ITAK has never been questioned. I was recognized as the Leader of the Opposition consequent to your accepting me as the Parliamentary Group Leader of the ITAK, the second largest party in Parliament. This was for the reason that a section of the UPFA, including His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena, the Leader of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party were part and parcel of the Government. President Maithripala Sirisena is the Head of State, Head of the Executive and of the Government, a Member of the Cabinet of Ministers holding several portfolios and Head of the Cabinet of Ministers. Several other Members of Parliament elected to Parliament on the ticket of the UPFA held positions in Cabinet. All of them were collectively answerable to Parliament.

In this situation, it would have been incongruous for a member of the UPFA to be the Leader of the Opposition. It is in this context that in keeping with Parliamentary practice and convention, as recognized the world over, the second largest party in Opposition in Parliament has been able to have its parliamentary leader recognized as the Leader of the Opposition and it was for this very reason that the Hon. Speaker recognized me twice over as the Leader of the Opposition.

From the 26th of October, 2018, certain events have occurred in this country pertaining to the Prime Minister, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Government and Parliament. Some finality had been arrived at in regard to these issues in keeping with our Constitution, the rule of law and democratic values through judgments delivered by our judiciary at the highest level. It is in this background that the Hon. Speaker has made the Ruling referred to above pertaining to the office of the Leader of the Opposition.

In keeping with the judicial verdict, a Prime Minister was sworn in on Sunday 16th of December, but the Cabinet of Ministers has not yet been constituted and a Government has not yet been formed. Three Members of Parliament elected on the ticket of the UPFA crossed the Floor and occupied seats on the benches of the Government on the 18th of December. In these circumstances, when a Government has not yet been fully constituted, I submit that there was no need for another person to be recognized as the Leader of the Opposition in haste. Doing so without removing the functioning Leader of the Opposition has further complicated the issue.

It is further alleged that the Member of Parliament whom the Speaker has recognized as the Leader of the Opposition has ceased to be a member of the recognized

63 64

political party, UPFA or SLFP, on whose nomination paper his name appeared at the time of becoming such Member of Parliament and that his seat had consequently become vacant since one month has expired from the date of his ceasing to be a member of such recognized political party. You would observe, Sir, that the person recognized by the Speaker as the Leader of the Opposition does not even hold the position of a Member of Parliament as at the date of such recognition. This would again suggest that the Speakers decision has been taken in haste and that his decision is in violation of our Constitution.

The events that I had outlined earlier tend to raise the question as to whether Sri Lanka is moving towards becoming a failed State which does not recognize the supremacy of its Constitution, the primary law. Sri Lankan citizens who wish to live in an undivided, indivisible Sri Lanka in unity and harmony view this as an act of majoritarianism, which has been the primary cause of the pathetic state to which the country had been brought today. This emphasizes the urgent and utmost importance of framing a new Constitution that would enable all people inclusive of the Tamil and Tamil-speaking people to live with self-respect and dignity.

I urge that early corrective action in the interest of the country as a whole be taken to preserve the sanctity of our Constitution, the primary law, and that such a step is urgently needed.

Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, I will bring your Statement to the attention of the Hon. Speaker.

. . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Sumanthiran?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker.

This is on the same issue. Sir, I want to table* in the House three newspaper reports connected to this matter dated 12th November, 2018 which appeared in The

Island, Ceylon Today and "Divaina", all of which have the report and pictures of the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa taking membership of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna on the 11th of November, 2018, two days after the purported dissolution of Parliament.

Obviously until the President purportedly dissolved Parliament, this was not done because they knew they would lose their Parliamentary seats. So, after the purported dissolution, the very next day, they ceased to be Members of the SLFP and consequently, the UPFA and had taken membership in SLPP. I am tabling those newspaper reports. We will be moving for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire and report on this to Parliament.

Thank you. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha)

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) Hon. Deputy Speaker, it is so unfortunate to hear from a very senior Member of Parliament, the Hon. R. Sampanthan, that there are two Leaders of Opposition in this Parliament and also that this country is becoming a failed State. - [Interruption.] The Government should take the responsibility.

( ) (The Hon. Harshana Rajakaruna) Sir, what is the point of Order in that? ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody is not raising a point of Order. He wants to make a statement.

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) Sir, I am not raising a point of Order. Let me explain my position. I was also a one-time Deputy Speaker. There is a practice and there were precedents in this Parliament. It was stated that since President Maithripala Sirisena is the Leader of the UPFA, another Hon. Member of the UPFA cannot hold the position of the Leader of the Opposition. Hon. Sampanthan, you may very well recollect the fact that from 2001 to 2004, during the Presidency of Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa was the Leader of the Opposition.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. S.M. Marikkar) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Order, please!

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) Do not behave like a jack-in-the-box. - [Interruption.]

Sir, in that Parliament, when the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa was the Leader of the Opposition, the current Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, was the

71 72

Prime Minister. If you may recollect, from 08th of January to 15th of August, 2015, the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena, who was the leader of the UPFA, was the President and the Hon. Nimal Siripala De Silva, a Member of the UPFA, was the Leader of the Opposition. His Excellency the President's holding Ministerial portfolios is another issue that was raised. But, His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena held a few portfolios in that instance as well.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, I cannot give you any more time. Please make it short.

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) I will.

Sir, the other issue is regarding the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa obtaining the membership of the SLPP. He denies it. The General Secretary of the UPFA, as the authority, has informed the Hon. Speaker in writing to appoint the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is the Leader of the Parliamentary Group of the UPFA, as the Leader of the Opposition. What more is expected? Parliament is not there to arbitrate or inquire into the internal issues of the UPFA or any other political party. It is so unfortunate that you are attempting to convert this Parliament, which is funded by the peoples money, into a limited centre for inquiry of SLFP and the UPFA.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Thank you. I will not allow any more time. I cannot allow a debate on this. I will not allow any debate. -[Interruption.] Only the party leaders are allowed to make statements, not anybody else.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Deputy Speaker,

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) I have not been removed.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) You have not been removed. Our position is also the same. Let me say this. The issue is, Hon. Sampanthan, at the beginning of the year, we had Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa as the former President of this country. This month, he became the former Prime Minister once again and now he has become a former Member of Parliament.

( ) (An Hon. Member) Hear! Hear!

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That is what has happened. Trust me. I know the Hon. Susil Premajayantha took a lot of pains to explain Article 99 (13) and all that. It is very clear. Your own party is the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and once you go and obtain membership of another party, your membership ceases. That issue, we will prove. -[Interruption.] We will prove it before a Select Committee. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Order, please! ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) We will prove. Unfortunately -[Interruption.] We have no right. But, the House has a right. Now, you have deprived the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena also of his position in this whole issue. So, it is a very serious matter. -[Interruption.] Do not get so emotional and sentimental. Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella, do not get so emotional. It is not an emotional issue. Why are you getting so upset? I am telling you, only a few Members of Parliament like -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Hon. Rauff Hakeem, please conclude.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Member, the Member sitting next to you is the only sensible Member among you. The Kalutara District Member sitting next to you is the only sensible Member and you did not have the magnanimity to listen to him. That is why you are in this position. -[Interruption.] One of the most popular leaders in this country has been made a political orphan. That is what you have done. It is very unfortunate. -[Interruption.]

That is what the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, in 2005, proposed - the abolition of the Executive Presidency. He went on to state, I quote:

"In the Interim, I propose to present a Constitutional amendment through which the Executive President will be made answerable to the Parliament by virtue of holding such office. To endorse the responsibility that the President has to the Parliament, I will attend Parliament once a month."

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I wish to quote some extracts from the Statement on the Indo-Ceylon Agreement of October 30,1964 made by the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Prime Minister, in the Senate on 10th November, 1964.

It will be relevant to give a brief account of the history of this problem which started with the opening up of estates in the Kandyan areas in the 1830s. Today, we find in the Kandyan Districts an alien population of South Indian workers who follow the social traditions of South India while the Kandyans who occupy the valleys observe their ancient customs. There has been hardly any intermingling between these two sections of the population with their differences in religion, language, social customs and occupations. ....Ceylon has always been most cautious in making concession which would place Indian on par with the indigenous population in sofaras political and citizenship rights were concerned.

? , ? . . , . - "The Problem" - . It states, I quote;

The Indian problem in Ceylon right from the very beginning resolved itself into the question of how many of the Indians resident in this country can be said to have become permanently settled here to the extent that they could be absorbed as citizens and a guarantee of full political and civil rights as are available to the indigenous population granted to them without damaging the interests of the country.
