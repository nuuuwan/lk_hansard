I want to bring to the notice of the House that the PRECIFAC Report is available only in Sinhala even today. -[Interruption.] So, we will not be able to participate in this Debate, Sir.

 2 (   ) (The Hon. Speaker) We have asked for the translations. We were assured of that. We are sorry about that. I will check on that. Just give me a little time.  kc ' (  F ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) They can speak on the Bond scam Report.  7.. k3 3 (  .. F2) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If you speak once during an Adjournment Motion, you cannot speak again. So, do you want us to speak only on the Bond issue? Why are you restricting us to speak only on one report? Why are you worried about the PRECIFAC Report? I want to speak on that as well. - [Interruption.] You are too worried about my making references to the PRECIFAC Report.-[Interruption.] Earlier, you were Minister of National Languages and Social Integration. So, you should be protesting on this issue before the Debate begins. Any report must be available in both National Languages in the House. - [Interruption.] How can you suggest that we start the Debate and go on on one Report?  kc ' (  F ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) You are speaking unnecessarily.  7.. k3 3 (  .. F2) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, I am not speaking unnecessarily, Sir. - [Interruption.] The Hon. Member is suggesting that we go on on one Report. Why should we go on on one Report? Why are you so worried about the PRECIFAC Report?  kc ' (  F ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) What we are saying is, you can speak on the PRECIFAC Report as well as on the Bond Report.  7.. k3 3 (  .. F2) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I cannot speak on the PRECIFAC Report because it is only in Sinhala. - [Interruption.] After I speak once, I cannot speak again. Having been in Parliament since 1970, you do not seem to know even that. - [Interruption.] After I speak on that once, I cannot speak again. How can I speak again?  kc ' (  F ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Do not speak now. Wait until the translations are available.

 7.. k3 3 (  .. F2) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) So, what is the whole point? I cannot even understand if somebody refers to something in the Report. I cannot refer to the Report; I cannot follow it. Is that the way in which you want me to participate in a debate? That is why I took umbrage. Having been the former Minister of National Languages and Social Integration and having gone round the world saying all kinds of things, you are suggesting that I participate in a debate when things are referred to in a language that I do not understand and cannot read, that I should continue to sit here and do that. Shameful! - [Interruption.]  2 (   ) (The Hon. Speaker) Let me explain, Hon. Members, please. - [Interruption.]  kc ' (  F ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) But, Sir, on the Bond scam, they have come ready to speak. - [Interruption.]  2 (   ) (The Hon. Speaker) I must first apologize for not having the Tamil and the English translations ready. There are about 8,000 pages involved. So, we have asked the authorities to get those translated and they are working on that. They have requested the Department of Official Languages to provide the translations. Eight thousand pages is a lot. I think there is a point in what the Hon. Sumanthiran says. It is something that we have taken into consideration.

But, I will leave it to the House to decide. It is nothing but fair that he is also given the opportunity to speak. There is a point in what he says. Hon. Leader of the House, what do you suggest? If you all are to debate this, you must have it in both languages.  '3 CE (  ' )) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Then, we will postpone the Debate.  2 (   ) (The Hon. Speaker) It is up to you all. Then, shall we postpone the Debate? I will leave it to the House to decide. Does the House agree to postpone the Debate? - [Interruption.] K F 0 .  K3 }! (  L ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, there is just one matter to raise before you decide to postpone. There was general agreement that even if it

2018 G 20

is not available in Sinhala or Tamil, if it is available in English, we accept to debate it. That was the original position held. You can take the Minute and read. - [Interruption.] I am not protesting on what you are raising, Hon. Sumanthiran, but the agreement was, if it is available in English and not in Sinhala or Tamil, that still we proceed. That was the decision taken and what is minuted here. - [Interruption.]  2 (   ) (The Hon. Speaker) But, this particular Report is not available even in English.  7.. k3 3 (  .. F2) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) This is only in Sinhala.  1 'E (  >  )) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) It is not available even in the link language.  2 (   ) (The Hon. Speaker) The Report on Treasury Bonds is in English and the other Report is only in Sinhala.  7.. k3 3 (  .. F2) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is why I did not raise an issue on the Bond matter.

 2 (   ) (The Hon. Speaker) I will leave it to the House to decide. There is a valid argument on both Sides.  '3 CE (  ' )) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, legally and technically there should be a Tamil translation. The English translation is also not available. So, we will postpone the Debate.  2 (   ) (The Hon.
