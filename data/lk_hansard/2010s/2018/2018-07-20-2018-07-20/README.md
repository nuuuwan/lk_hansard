PERSONAL EXPLANATION BY HON. M.A.

SUMANTHIRAN

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I have obtained permission to make a Personal Explanation in view of certain statements made in this House yesterday, while I was not here, with regard to the work of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly.

As everyone knows, there were ten experts appointed to advice the Steering Committee and all of those appointments were made unanimously by the Constitutional Assembly. That Panel of Experts was requested by the Steering Committee on the 16th of November, 2017 to submit a document to facilitate the Steering Committee to prepare a Draft Constitution. It is the Steering Committee that is tasked with the preparation of a Draft Constitution according to the Resolution adopted by Parliament unanimously and the Panel of Experts was asked to submit a document to facilitate that process. The Hon. (Dr.) Jayampathy Wickramaratne and I, as the Co-Chairs of the Management Committee, were tasked with coordinating some of the work of the Secretariat.

In January this year, at a meeting of the Panel of Experts, it was decided that different panels that were appointed would make first drafts of certain Chapters and then the whole Panel of Experts would meet together, discuss those and finalize the documents. One expert was asked to consolidate everything together having got all of those reports from these different panels by the end of January. By the end of January, the work had not been done by any of the panels. Therefore, that expert was asked to make a first draft. As you know, if you are preparing a document, ten people cannot sit together, hold all ten hands together and write the document. Generally, one or two make a first draft and then, the others discuss it and agree. This process went on for a long time and around May, six experts had agreed on one document. But, with regard to the information that was required by the Steering Committee, there was another process that was ongoing and that document was not ready. Nevertheless, in May, the Steering Committee gave the Panel of Experts one month's time - they wanted two weeks' time, but the Steering Committee gave them one month's time - to present this document, but even at the end of two months thereafter, it was not ready.

At the Steering Committee Meeting held two days' ago, two documents were presented by the Panel of Experts. One of those documents was by six of the ten experts. The other document was by two of the experts. The other two did not subscribe to either document. I must say immediately that there are no signatures of

617 618

[ ]

2018 20

anyone on any of these documents. The six experts agreed via e-mail with regard to that document that was submitted. The other two also agreed and submitted a document. So, the question of forging anyone's signature does not arise at all. The Steering Committee, having looked at the two documents and found that six experts have submitted one document and two have submitted another document, requested the entire Panel of Experts to see if they can present one single document with the information that was requested of them within two weeks' time.

But, the Steering Committee was also conscious that you cannot force experts to agree on anything. If there are 10 experts, sometimes, there might be 10 documents that might emerge. But, it was our request that they try and bring out one document. So, this is all that happened.

There were statements made saying that some experts nominated by certain Parties had not signed the documents and so on. That is not accurate. One document was submitted by two experts: one is a nominee of the Joint Opposition, Ms. Chamindry Saparamadu, and the other is Prof. (Ms.) Camena Gunaratne, who was suggested by me. So, somebody suggested by me and somebody suggested by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena had agreed on one document. The other document, six had agreed on. I must say that the Hon. (Dr.) Jayampathy Wickramaratne and I coordinated these efforts. In to the document that was prepared by six experts, we had no input at all. That was drafted by one person, seen by all the experts and five others made suggestions, changes and agreed on that document. We had no involvement in that document at all. But, unfortunately, a story is being spread that one of them, Mr. Suren Fernando, the Hon. (Dr.) Jayampathy Wickramaratne and I have drafted that document. That is entirely false. Ironically, it is in the second document submitted by the two other experts that we even sat through the proceedings of preparing that document. So, if an allegation is to be made, the allegation must be that we had some input into the second document by the two experts. But, that also did not happen. I must say, at this stage, in fairness to the Hon. (Dr.) Jayampathy Wickramaratne, President's Counsel, and his expertise that he was appointed to a panel of experts to advice the APRC by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2006. Ten years before that, he was adviser to the then Constitutional Affairs Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris on the drafting of a new Constitution. If there is one expert in the country today with regard to these matters, it is the Hon. (Dr.) Jayampathy Wickramaratne. Nevertheless, neither he nor I did anything to produce those documents.

We are Members of the Steering Committee. As far as I am concerned, after this dispute arose, I went and had a look at those documents. I have brought them. So, it is only after that that I actually read through the document submitted by the six experts. There are many matters in that with which I do not agree. But that, I will take up at the deliberations of the Steering Committee. It is in the Steering Committee that the Members of the Steering Committee will discuss these and it is the Steering Committee that will eventually prepare a draft

Constitution according to the Resolution that was adopted by Parliament. Experts are there to advise. But, it is most unfortunate that accusations were made yesterday without true facts being known or those being known, but deliberately obfuscated to mislead the country that some underhand thing is going on. But, there is no such thing that goes on, I want to assure the House. Whatever the experts submit to the Steering Committee, eventually the Steering Committee will deliberate and decide on what to submit to the Constitutional Assembly. It is not even the Constitutional Assembly that will decide. Thereafter, it has to come to Parliament and then, it has to go before the people. So, these are very first few steps where some experts have been asked to prepare a document to facilitate the drafting. So, it is most unfortunate that this kind of story has been spread and some experts have been put at peril, threats have been made over social media and so on. All that is wholly unwarranted and I regret that some Hon. Members of this House also contributed to this yesterday.

Thank you.

[5.49p.m.] () ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe - (Minister of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs) Hon. Presiding Member, before I make my comments on the scheduled Bill today, the Bribery (Amendment) Bill, I wish to put the House on the correct track, because of some comments made by several Members in this House today, which might lead to some kind of misunderstanding between the two countries, the United Kingdom and Sri Lanka, with regard to diplomatic relations.

I think some Members of Parliament who made their comments based on print media reports today, especially in Sinhala newspapers, were trying to give the impression that one of the Members in the British Parliament, Ian Paisley, had been punished by prohibiting attendance of Parliament for a period of 30 days as a result of taking the side of Sri Lanka during the period of conflict or being quite favourable to Sri Lanka. That is an irresponsible report made by local media organizations. There is no such law in the British Parliament. The MPs have the freedom or the democratic right to justify or to criticize the conduct of another Government or a Party. But the allegation had been that particular Hon. Member, who had visited Sri Lanka several times and who had spoken openly about the true nature of the conflict that prevailed in Sri Lanka for a period over three decades, had been benefitted with the funds provided by the Sri Lankan Government to visit Sri Lanka on a few occasions. There is no allegation against Sri Lanka by the British Parliament and there is no complaint against the Hon. Member, Ian Paisley, with regard to his stance taken up in the whole proceedings; but there is an allegation with regard to his credibility, because some money had been spent by the Sri Lankan side for him to visit Sri Lanka on several occasions.

According to their Code of Conduct and Guide to Rules, it is the duty of that particular MP to inform the relevant authorities that he visited and the funds had been spent not from his personal account but from a third party. The allegation is the violation of that rule. For that, of course, they have a right to take disciplinary action. It does not mean that the British Government or the British Parliament had made any complaint against our country or that they are going to take any action against Sri Lanka.

When the media reports this kind of inaccurate news the entire country is misled, Hon. Members of this Parliament are misled. They relied on those statements and there were some unwarranted criticism and comments made, which might lead to some misunderstanding to create some dent in the relationship between our country and United Kingdom. Therefore, it is our duty to keep the Sri Lankan nation as well as the Hon. Members of this House informed and the true nature of the decision that they have taken had been taken in the correct spirit without having any misunderstanding or distortion.
