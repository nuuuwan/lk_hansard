: STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ACT:

ORDER

[1.48p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama - Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade) Hon. Speaker, I move,

"That the Order made by the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade under Section 3(4) of the Strategic Development Projects Act, No. 14 of 2008 and published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2051/38 of 29th December 2017 amending the order published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1867/5 of 16th June 2014, which was presented on 20.03.2018, be approved."

(Cabinet approval signified.)

Sir, under the Strategic Development Projects Act, No. 14 of 2008, as amended, the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, which was established by the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law, No. 4 of 1978, as amended, has identified a project by Sinolanka Hotels And Spa (Pvt) Limited, that is, Grand Hyatt Colombo, to construct and operate a 475-room hotel and 90 serviced apartments at No. 116, Galle Road, Colombo 3 as a Strategic Development Project in consultation with the relevant line Ministries. After identifying the project as a Strategic Development Project, the Minister in charge of the subject of Investment Promotion, by a Notification in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1771/18 dated 15th August 2012 in terms of subsection (2) of Section 3 of the Strategic Development Projects Act, as amended, published the relevant information relating to the proposed project and exemptions to be granted in respect of the project. In accordance with subsection (3) of the Section 3 of the SDP Act, as amended, the Minister in charge of the subject of Investment Promotion informed the Cabinet of Ministers by a Cabinet Memo dated 09th

397 398

November, 2012 the rationale for considering the project as a Strategic Development Project and the period of exemptions to be granted to the project and obtained the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers. In consideration of the above facts, an Order was published in the Gazette No. 1789/22 dated 19th December, 2012 in accordance with subsection (4) of Section 3 of the Strategic Development Projects Act, as amended, specifying the name of the Strategic Development Project, the date of commencement of the Project and the date on which exemptions from enactments specified in the Schedule to the Strategic Development Projects Act granted in terms Section 2 of the SDP Act will become operative and the date from which the same shall cease to be operative. In terms of the Gazette, Orders made under subsection (2) and (4) of Section 3 of the Act, the date of commencement of the project and the operative date on which the exemptions for the enactments specified in the Schedule to the Act, such as the Inland Revenue Act, Customs Ordinance, was specified as 19th July 2014. By subsequent Order published in the Gazette No. 1974/7 dated 4th July, 2016 in accordance with the SDP Act, the said date was amended to 31st December, 2017. Although the project has commenced construction activities, the Enterprise made appeals to the Board of Investment to vary the date of commencement of commercial operations referred to in the Order of aforesaid Gazette to 31st December, 2018 which is the estimated date of commencement of commercial operations in order to be entitled to continue the state of SDP and enjoy the concessions granted in respect of the exemptions from the applicability of several statutes referred to in the Order of the Gazette pertaining to this project for the period as specified therein.

The reasons for the request by the Enterprise to vary the date of commencement of commercial operations, which were replicated in the Cabinet Memo dated 27th October, 2017 are as follows:

(i) Since the Company has decided to upgrade the project as a Grand Hyatt Colombo Hotel, it was proposed to change the designs of the hotel room combination and serviced apartments, especially the Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing - MEP - and the interior design including the banquet hall up to 1,000 seating capacity with additional swimming pools at level 15 following the international brand. As a result of the above, the Company has to change the contractors and the contractors were selected on a tender basis under the National Procurement Guidelines.

(ii) The Company acquired an adjacent land to maintain a proper traffic plan and accordingly, approval from Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority and the Urban Development Authority has been obtained after carrying out the traffic impact assessment study.

(iii) An extra low-voltage contract was awarded in 2016, but the contractor was terminated due to non-performance, consequently prolongation of other works, that is, interior finishes were delayed. The

design proposals given by some designers were inadequate and not comprehensive. Even contractors refused to accept those installations. As a result, several revisions were made to correct these errors. Changes were made to the designs by Hyatt International from time to time.

Considering the above, approval of the Cabinet of Ministers was granted in terms of section 3(3) of the Strategic Development Projects Act, No. 14 of 2008, as amended, read with Section 18 of the Interpretation Ordinance to vary the date of commencement of commercial operations of Sinolanka Hotels and Spa (Pvt.) Limited to 31st December. 2018. The Gazette was made under subsection 4 of Section 3 of the SDP Act published in the Gazette No. 2049/59 dated 15th December, 2017. In accordance with subsection 5 of Section 3 of the Strategic Development Projects Act, as amended, the said Order has to be placed before Parliament for approval.

The second Item, Hon. Speaker, is similar to that. It is a Mixed Development Project undertaken by Avic International Hotels Lanka Limited with an apartment complex at No. 418, 420 and 422, R.A. De Mel Mawatha, Colombo 03. So, it is a similar issue and the reasons for the request for the Enterprise to vary the date of commencement of commercial operations which were replicated in the Cabinet Memorandum dated 11th October, 2017 are as follows:

The China Development Bank which is the financing source for the project temporarily suspended granting financial facilities for the project until the Gazette Notification was published in terms of the Land (Restrictions on Alienation) (Amendment) Act, No. 38 of 2014 regarding the exemptions from the prohibition of transfer of property to a foreign company. The Gazette Notification was published on 8th of November, 2016 and there was a delay in obtaining relevant approval from the local authorities and relocation of existing CEB transformer from the site. Considering the above, approval of the Cabinet of Ministers was granted on 5th December, 2017, in terms of Section 3 of the SDP Act, No. 14 of 2008, as amended, to vary the date of commencement of commercial operations of Avic International Hotels Lanka Limited within 90 months from the date of principal Agreement entered between the Enterprise and the BOI, dated 25th September, 2012 and the Gazette Order was made under subsection 4 of Section 3 of the SDP Act, as amended, published in the Gazette No. 2051/38 dated 29th December, 2017. In accordance with subsection 5 of Section 3 of the SDP Act, as amended, the said Order has to be placed before Parliament for approval.

Sir, there have been many comments about Foreign Direct Investments and some Members of the Opposition have said there is hardly any investments since they are out of Government. This is totally false.

In 2017, the FDIs recorded US Dollars 1.9 billion, which is the highest ever FDIs received in the history of our country. This year, our target is to achieve Foreign

399 400

[ ]

2018 00

Direct Investments of US Dollars 2.5 billion and we are well on track.

The exports in 2017 were another record of US Dollars 15.5 billion and this year, we are well on target to achieve an export turnover of US Dollars 17.4 billion, growing at about 15 per cent each year.

In 2018, I am very pleased to say, the BOI has approved projects up to a value of US Dollars 1.348 billion during the first four months from January to April. I assure you that in the next one and a half months, that is before 30th June, there will be further US Dollars 1.4 billion worth projects approved by the BOI. Those will include two LNG-based power plants, an LNG terminal, a cement plant and most of the funds are coming from Japanese and Indian investors. So, within the first six months of this year, we will grant approval for projects worth US Dollars 2.75 billion. This clearly shows that we have created a conducive environment for investments and exports.

I am also very glad that the former Defence Secretary, Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, has endorsed our economic policies and what he says that he wants to achieve by 2030 will be achieved by us by 2025 as per the details in our "Vision 2025, A Country Enriched", which I would like to table*, Sir.

Sir, Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa has spent the last three years developing a deep admiration and appreciation for the economic policies and vision of our Government. That itself is a strong argument why our Government should have another five years to implement its 2025 Economic Plan and Vision.

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) . project . . .

The former Defence Secretary has said that China, India and Japan will be economic giants in the coming decade and Asia will be the economic powerhouse. He should be congratulated for realizing this, albeit belatedly. This is exactly why we are negotiating an agreement with China and a comprehensive economic and technology agreement with India. As you know, we have signed an agreement with Singapore and we hope to do so with the Asian economies as well. Focusing attention on Asia, our aim is to make Sri Lanka the hub of Asia and reap the benefits of Asian economic growth.

According to Gotabayas thinking at this late stage, economic development is the panacea for all ills of the country. His is a vote of confidence for our decision to concentrate on our collective efforts on economic development projects and the introduction of economic reforms to ensure the economic resurgence of the majority people. If only the Government he helped lead for nine years had held the same priorities, our country would already be leading the charge.

Furthermore, he emphasizes the need for policy prescriptions to encourage and incentivize Foreign Direct Investment and facilitate the process, as if the Board of Investment has not revolutionized private sector investment promotion over the last three years. By next month there will be a fully online portal one stop shop for investor approvals, while innovations continue, and investors are free to do business in a lawful society devoid of rampant corruption over which he and his Government presided.

Sir, I also want to say a few words about the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. I wish to refer to the recent -

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Parliament has not seen that Agreement. ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) It is on the website. You can read it. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) But, Parliament must get it. ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) It is on the website. Anybody can read that. - [Interruption.] Wait, till I finish. Please do not take my time.

Sir, news items reported that the recently signed FTA with Singapore was entered into without a proper -

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

( ) (An Hon. Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) I will do that.

So, Sir, the news reports stated that we have entered into the Agreement without a proper consultation process and that it will have an adverse impact on Government revenue and would result in an influx of professionals and workers entering the country. That is absolutely false. The Ministry wishes to state that it is the policy of the Government of Sri Lanka to negotiate FTAs with selected countries, as part of our new Trade Policy. The aim of this policy is to achieve diversification of exports and export markets, to create linkages to global production and value chains, integrate Sri Lanka to the global economy, and thereby, by virtue of the nexus between trade and investment, attract Foreign Direct Investments into the country.

The Government has adopted a policy of engaging in dialogue and consultation with all stakeholders in pursuing this goal. My Ministry has been holding regular consultations with Trade Chambers, trade associations and professional bodies. The stakeholders have also been kept informed of the status of the negotiations and possible commitments that were to be undertaken on a regular basis. This Ministry has also had specific consultations with stakeholders in construction-related services, computer-related services, the tourism sector, the maritime sector and the others, and this engagement will continue.

Sir, with regard to the trading services, certain professional associations have expressed their concerns about the influx of professionals and other workers into the country. The movement of natural persons from Singapore has not been opened up except for intra-corporate transferees in senior management and business visitors linked to investments. There is no liberalization whatsoever of independent movement of natural persons, which is not linked to investment. Business visitors will be permitted for a period of not more than 30 days for the purposes such as market scoping, business agreements and so on.

The corporate transferees - transferees from a branch of a company with an investment in Sri Lanka - are also limited to managers, senior managers, executives and specialists who are clearly defined in the relevant schedules of the Agreement. Their period of entry is also limited initially up to two years or over the period of the contract, whichever is less.

No movement of persons, either Singapore citizens or permanent residents, has been opened in professional services. The concern that engineering and architectural services have been opened is also incorrect. The Ministry wishes to state that the only commitment is for cross-border services, that is via the Internet and not relating to movement of people, which is happening even now and

403 404

2018 00

that, too, is limited only to predesigned advisory and consultative services and does not include the practise of architectural or engineering professions. This is only through the use of Internet and other means and not through commercial presence or movement of professionals into the country.

Providing these types of services are already possible through the existing regulatory and legislative framework. Thus, establishing a company for providing these advisory services in the country or movement of natural persons to provide such services has not been permitted under the Agreement. It should be emphasized that Sri Lanka has not undertaken any liberalization exceeding the prevailing investment regime. We have just had some discussions with the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects and the Institution of Engineers and explained this situation. We have told them that if there is any issue which they can point out in the Agreement, we are willing to look at it and if necessary, we will do the amendments. The new Regulations under the Immigrants and Emigrants Act in order to strengthen the regulatory framework have almost been finalized and will be submitted to the Cabinet shortly, perhaps within the next two weeks. When the Regulations come into force, they will address the concerns raised by the professional associations as well as other stakeholders. In the regulations, we stipulate the procedures to be followed when employing foreign nationals, categories of employment, employer and employee obligations, the roles to be played by the professional bodies on recognition of qualifications and so on.

It has also been stated that this Agreement would lead to millions of non-citizens of Singapore arriving to Sri Lanka. This is absolutely not true. The Sri Lanka - Singapore FTA does not permit any permanent resident to work in Sri Lanka. The only permitted entrants are those who qualify as corporate transferees, that is, persons employed by a Singaporean company with investments in Sri Lanka. This is also happening now. Such persons would have to be employed in that company for a period of 12 months and should have five years' experience. They can only work in the company that has made the investment.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, you go ahead. ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) If a person - [Interruption.] I will explain that. If a person has a dominant and effective nationality in a third country, such person would be excluded. Therefore, a Singaporean company cannot hire and send a citizen of another country to work in Sri Lanka. To say so is inaccurate and misleading. Given the above facts, the permanent residents arriving in Sri Lanka is extremely limited and the entry would be tied to a corresponding investment in Sri Lanka, thereby benefiting our country as a whole.

They have also made some references about trading goods. I do not want to go into details. But, the Tariff Liberalization Programme has been in consultation with the Ministry of Finance. They know exactly from what items that the tariff should be removed. Right now, the total imports from Singapore is about US Dollars 1,293 million out of which US Dollars 750 millon is petroluem products and US Dollars 228 million is gold. These tariffs have not been removed. So, there is no effect on the revenue as far as we are concerned and this has been approved by the Ministry of Finance. The Rules of Origin criteria in the Agreement stipulate that products imported from Singapore will not qualify for tariff concessions unless 35 per cent value addition over change of Tariff Headings take place in Singapore. The Rules of Origin in the Agreement will therefore not allow goods of other countries simply to be exported through Singapore since minimum value addition or processing has to necessarily take place in Singapore.

Hon. Speaker, our Ministry will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the Trade Chambers and the professional bodies even in the future, as we negotiate the other agreements.

I have very clearly told not only the Chambers but the professional associations that if they still find anything adverse to please point it out. We have a period of one year after which a review can take place. If there is anything wrong with the Agreement, we can do the amendments.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) Hon. Minster, is there an Exit Clause?

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) There is a Review Clause which provides for a review at the end of one year. If anybody shows some adverse effect, we can review and amend the Agreement.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) But, they should agree to that.

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) It is a matter of negotiation. ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) But, since there is no Exit Clause-

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) There can be. After a while, we can see how it is. As far as the ETCA negotiations are concerned, from time to time, I have kept the Opposition informed, but nobody has come back to us. If there is anything that you want to take up, we are open and free to discuss.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Bandula Gunawardane) Can we have a full-day debate on that? ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) It is not like debating, let us discuss and see what has to be done. All this is for the progress of our country. We have to change. We cannot go on the way we have been going before. We need new markets; we need new products. We are not sacrificing our people, we are only helping them. We have to have a knowledge-based economy. We can get not only the funds, the FDIs, but the know-how as well. Thank you very much.
