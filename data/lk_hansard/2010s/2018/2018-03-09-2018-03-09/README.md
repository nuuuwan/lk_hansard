"...the current Minister of Ports and Shipping as it is totally against the law of this country due to the reasons given below specially it is apparent that the then Minister has been misled by the Director

General of Merchant Shipping which does not contain the required 'Regulations' which are otherwise made into Small Coastal Vessels Regulations in a code named SCV Code unpublished and kept in the drawers of DGMS only to wield...".

, : "1. These Regulations have been made by the Minister only on the advice of the Director General of Merchant Shipping, who has no authority to make Regulations.

2. The said Regulations are disputing the currently valid two Ordinances namely, Boats Ordinance of 65 and Master Attendants Ordinance of 1900, both of which are currently valid.

3. A Regulation gazetted by the Minister cannot supersede the Ordinances passed by Parliament, which are enactments.

4. The small boats below 24 metres operated in the country in Sri Lankan ports by such boat operators are not required to register them under Merchant Shipping Regulations.

5. It is not possible to enforce Merchant Shipping Regulations on boats licensed under Boats Ordinance or Master Attendants Ordinance." , . , . . , . , . . . ; . ( ) (The Hon.

( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana )

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member. I rise on a day that brings to a close what can be argued as one of our countrys darkest weeks in its history. I rise to speak today, not as a Muslim, but as a patriotic and a nationalistic Sri Lankan. Sir, before the discourse and the blame game blurs the clarity of what is absolutely fundamental, I wish to state the obvious. The feelings of the silent majority in our country - patriotic Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burghers and all others who comprise of our rich diverse and proud heritage, all resonate - is simply this : We have been there before and we are headed fast towards the precipice once more." We have seen what the civil conflict which ended in 2009 did to our people and to our country. We are still reeling with its aftermath, which has set us back decades and robbed us of tens of thousands of our country's mothers, fathers and children - who could have been productive individuals today. Those 30 years destroyed our economy, our educational system which we hold so dear and it also distorted our society in such a way preventing us from achieving our truest potential - the real Wonder of Asia. At a time when we are on the mend, the recent attacks in Kandy, Ampara, Gintota, Aluthgama and other areas can be drawn a parallel to a return to the dark days of July, 1983, when some undesirable elements on both sides of the divide created a fear psychosis and a sense of alienation, which spiraled ultimately towards a civil war. Today, we are in a similar predicament, where undesirable elements have spread a campaign of hate and fear against not only the Muslim community, but against our fellow Sri Lankans. Moreover, they are attempting to pose a threat to our strongest weapon - our identity as a united Sri Lanka, citizens of one resplendent, diverse and rich nation. While our identity remains largely intact, it is absolutely imperative that the responsibility thrust upon us by our fellow citizens of preserving our ideals, beliefs and harmonious co-existence lies predominantly with us - the Government. I must state, to give credit to where it is due, that this Government has gone further than others in ensuring that equality and human rights of all Sri Lankans are adhered to, honoured and given due precedence. However, the events of the last few weeks are evident that we still have a long road ahead for us.

It is absolutely evident that some time needs to be spent pondering on the past to ensure that those mistakes are not committed again. This is relevant to the immediate past and to that of 1983 when mobs in Colombo ran amok, looting and murdering while most of the police and armed forces just looked on and did little. Yet today, while the situation in Kandy has reverted to a proverbial calm, largely due to the presence of the police and the military and through the enactment of a State of Emergency - for the first time in seven years - such escalation of conflict could have been avoided in its entirety at the very inception, had the relevant authorities exercised the same due process of jurisprudence that it exercise with regard to all forms of violations. Had that been done, these violent attacks would not have scaled up so drastically and caused pain and fear to all Sri Lankans. Sir, the arrests made yesterday of the ringleaders of the repugnant group could have been made earlier, let alone weeks if not months and years ahead. Why? Because the laws of our country allow us to do so. If only impartial justice prevailed, then Chapter 15, Sections 219A and B of the Penal Code provides the precedent to bring them to justice. Let Kandy, and the unfortunate history be a testament and a precedent that justice should prevail and be exercised in its entirety to indict and punish any group or individual who incites and promotes hate speech in our country, irrespective of his race, religion or creed. Further, it is an increasingly evident aspect that the road to reconciliation and inclusion needs to be better paved, and that the Government is in a severe need to increase its vitality in driving intensive programmes of social inclusion and co-existence, because no matter how much infrastructure is developed, the people who live in an around them need to live in a land of mutual respect, admiration and harmony. Looking ahead, we should brace ourselves to face the unfortunate after-effects of Kandy, its economic setbacks and the divisive agenda that could follow. However, Sir, this is also an opportune time for us to act not just as a Government but as true patriotic Sri Lankans. The world is watching us. Are we to slip back into the folds of divisiveness that has plagued our history or do we to rise from the ashes of Digana, Teldeniya, Pallekele, Thambuttegama, Menikhinna, Akurana and other areas and show them that we are a united and a free Sri Lanka? Moreover, we have to show this to ourselves and we have a responsibility to show the same to the generations that follow to ensure that no matter what obstacles those undesirable elements attempt to throw in our path, we are one Sri Lanka.

Having said that, Sir, when we particularly talk about incidents such as acts of ethnic violence, attacks on mosques and causing damage to properties of people, that have been emerging in various other places of the country, especially in the Ampara and Kandy Districts, it is very obvious that these are not isolated incidents, but are acts that are being carried out in a conspiratorial manner by organized factions and individuals against one particular community with the objective of destabilizing the country and the Government. The latest of this series of incidents are the unfortunate ones that occurred in the Kandy District centering on areas such as Digana and Teldeniya last Monday, 05th of March. What becomes clear when carefully focusing attention on these incidents is that organized groups and individuals have on account of certain incidents arrived at the places where the incidents have occurred and unleashed violence in a severe manner. Although, on the surface, it looks as if violence is unleashed against Muslims, it should be made clear that myriad sinister motives exist in the background. Sir, one Sinhalese youth called Kumarasinghe has lost his life in an unfortunate manner due to a clash that occurred in a fuel filling station in Digana area and the police have arrested four Muslim persons suspected in connection with it. The funeral of the youth was held on March 4th and gangs by pretense of attending the funeral brought the lives, properties, mosques and shops of Muslim people under orchestrated attacks. According to the information reported so far, damages have been inflicted on more than 25 mosques, hundreds of shops, houses and vehicles belonging to the Muslim people. Although the police imposed curfew in the Kandy District and tried to curb the unrest to a certain extent, the situation was not under total control and the lives of the community in the areas has been disrupted to a great extent. Similarly, due to the violent and racially provocative incidents that had occurred in the Ampara Town on the night of 26th February, severe damage had been caused to a Muslim place of worship and three cafes located in the town. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Let me finish these few things and come to the point.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Following this incident, a tense situation was brewing in the Ampara Town and the background was growing towards a clash between the two communities. That unrest and disruption of law and order continued for a number of days and seem to have been brought under control to a certain extent. Under the given circumstances, it is commendable of the President, the Prime Minister and the authorities who acted sincerely in this regard to bring the situation somewhat under control, though incidents continuously took place . Clear and direct evidence disclosed the fact that attacking and damaging of mosques and restaurants and causing a tumultuous situation was carried out by an unlawful assemblage of persons in one continuous act. Many questions have been raised regarding the manner in which action was taken in this regard and how the law was enforced. What the police have reported initially to the court of law was that the above-mentioned incidents were acts of racial violence and an incident which created unrest among communities. The police told the court that the acts, therefore, fall under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and action should be taken accordingly. But the police's latter reports to the court pointed out that there is no reason to file action under the above-mentioned law as the incidents started due to a personal dispute and action should be taken under the ordinary law of the country. At the same time, the above-mentioned incidents had been reported to court as if they were normal acts of violence, concealing the fact that the attacking and damaging a mosque, destroying several shops and creating ethnic unrest were committed by unlawful assemblage of people. That was concealed from the court, which by itself is a biased and unacceptable offence on the part of the police. Sir, the overall incidents referred to above are confirmed to have been a ridiculous tactic orchestrated by organized groups and persons who contributed to trigger off ethnic violence. According to the facts reported, a person who came to an eatery run by a Muslim on the night of 26th February alleged that a tablet had been included into the food that was ordered by the consumer, which triggered the whole series of events. It is reported that the person concerned gave telephone calls to pre-organized mobs, telling them

451 452

that fertility-impairing tablets are mixed into the food sold at the eatery called Cassim Restaurant in Ampara Town and that the Muslims are attempting thereby to reduce the population of Sinhalese. Nevertheless facts are being put forth in medical science circles that infertility cannot be caused by mixing tablets with food. This has been confirmed in the official communique' issued by the Director General of Health Services subsequently. This clearly manifests that a certain group and individuals are using baseless ground to conjure a negative image of the Muslims and attack them and their places of worship, to damage properties and to trigger violence. It is my impression that it is highly probable that unfortunate incidents of this nature may be recurrent in time to come. It is clear that they attempt to destabilize the Government to achieve their narrow political goals. The most serious aspect of this incident is the conduct of the Police Department, which is supposed to be preserving and enforcing law and order, have failed in their duties. Therefore the people of the area complain that the Ampara Police have acted in a biased and unprofessional manner. The people of the area have lost confidence in the Police as they believe that such prejudice prevailed aiming the law enforcement authorities who instead of suppressing the violence and taking action against the perpetrators in order to preserve law and order. It should be pointed out that the manner in which the police have acted during the incident is totally different from their action during the incidents that occurred in Thambuththegama and Gintota. During those two incidents, the police acted immediately and enforced law and order by filing action against the perpetrators. At a time when the Government is acting with responsibility to bring about reconciliation and ethnic unity, on the other hand, the above-mentioned conduct on the part of the law and order, which is another arm of the executive, cannot be approved of. It should be stated that the sinister motives behind the incidents of this nature are to destroy the good impression which the United Nations and the international community already have of our country . Such motive will only lead to destabilize the country and drag it into an abyss and thereby to disrupt the economic activities of the people. As I speak here now the Muslims in this country are about to go for Jummah prayers whilst our security forces have assured for the peaceful conduct of Jummah prayers all over the country. While thanking His Excellency the President, the Hon. Prime Minister and the authorities for their good response that was made promptly to control the situation, I stress that such unfortunate incidents should not happen to any community.

Again I stress that all those representatives who respect the countrys democracy, fundamental rights, exercise of justice, peace and reconciliation among communities especially the clergy, politicians, civil society, professionals and all those who treasure justice, should take immediate action to prevent recurrence of such unfortunate incidents like this in future. Only through taking such action can we ensure the elimination of distrust, suspicion and fear that has emerged among communities and the creation of a nation in which all can live together. Finally, I would like to request that a Presidential Commission of Inquiry be appointed - already it has been asked by our Leader, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem - to investigate and report on the above-mentioned incidents and grant compensation and relief to those affected persons and justice be prevailed. Thank you, Hon. Chair.
