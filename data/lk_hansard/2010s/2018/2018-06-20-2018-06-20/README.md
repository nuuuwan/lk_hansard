asked the Minister of Highways and Road Development:

(i) transportation has been disrupted because 402 - metre long Vattuwakal Bridge, the main bridge situated in Kilinochchi-Mullaitivu A-50 main road that belongs to the Road Development Authority, is very narrow and can accommodate only single-lane traffic and has not undergone any repair; and

(ii) I have submitted a written request dated 31.07.2017 with regard to the repairing of this Vattuwakal Bridge?

(b) Will he inform this House whether steps will be taken to repair and widen the Vattuwakal Bridge to have two lanes of traffic within a specific period of time?

. ( . ) (The Hon. I. Charles Nirmalanathan) ! ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) !

An iRoad Project for the Northern and the Eastern Provinces has already been planned and ready to go. We are ready to call for tenders and bids and to select the contractors. We have done all the negotiations with the ADB. There is a timeline and we are trying to fast-track it. Hopefully, before the end of this year, we would have iRoads set up for the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. But, we are not relying only on that. The Hon. Prime Minister was concerned about the road development in the Northern Province. After discussions with the Government of India, there was a team that came from India last week and we have discussed developing certain priority roads in the Northern Province. There will be a team sent by the Indian Government and they will look at the roads. We will also discuss with the TNA and other political parties of the North to identify the priority roads. In addition, we will have a Cabinet Paper introduced next week to develop the Kokilai Bridge which connects two districts namely, Mullaitivu and Trincomalee. We are also looking at developing a few other rural roads and I will attend to developing the bridge you have mentioned. Next week, hopefully, I will be visiting the Northern Province to open some of the bridges. There are three bridges that have been completed. We will be coming there to open those bridges.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Deputy Minister, can I make a clarification? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. H.M.M. Harees) Okay. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Hon. Deputy Minister is referring to an issue that I raised in Parliament. I would not raise any issue in Parliament without taking responsibility for its facts. Hon. Deputy Minister, as you quite correctly said, I met a group of lecturers, students and the Vice Chancellor of that University. I met all of them.

The fact that there had been some incident of sexual harassment of a girl was not made as a sweeping statement; I did not make a general statement. One girl, together with her parents, had come to the University Grants Commission and handed over an affidavit on the incident. In addition to that, that girl has all the audio recordings as to how she had been threatened by the lecturer, whose name I mentioned here. She had been threatened that he will break her bones unless she agrees to his demands of sexual pleasure. Now, an inquiry into that incident is pending. In addition to that, I have already directed that matter to be referred to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. It has already been referred to that Commission.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Member, that situation has changed now. Before students are enrolled to the Medical Faculty and the Engineering Faculty, the University Grants Commission always ascertain whether they had in fact been studying in a remote district or not. If they had not been there during the minimum period required, they will not be admitted to the university from the Z-score recognized or accepted from that district. It has been regularized now.

[7.08p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene - State Minister of Defence) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would like to say a few words with regard to the Adjournment Motion that has been moved by the Hon. Gnanamuthu Srineshan.

On the issue of the army camp, we have spoken, I think, with the Hon. Member of Parliament as well. I have spoken with the Army Commander and he has assured me of the move-out and requested to give him a one-year time period, because the issue for them has been that they have to find an alternative land. The land that they had already found was not accepted; they were not given the green light to go ahead and acquire that land. But now, they have found another plot of land, for which they have been given the green light to go ahead and acquire. So, they are going ahead with its acquisition at the moment. Anyway, they need to shift the whole camp from where it is at present. . ( . ) (The Hon. I. Charles Nirmalanathan) army camp . . Army Commander . Army Commander . place . . . .
