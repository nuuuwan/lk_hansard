Hon. Presiding Member, I thank the Hon. Janaka Wakkumbura, Member of Parliament, for bringing this Adjournment Motion today.

This Influenza viral fever is seasonal and the outbreak of this viral fever happens twice a year. We have set up 19 centres island-wide from which we get day-to-day data about this disease. The Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine together with an epidemic consultant team is monitoring the outbreak of this viral fever.

Last year, the outbreak of the Influenza viral fever was not in the Southern Province but the other Provinces had been affected by this. However, this year, since April onwards, it has been affecting the Southern Province. With the rains that we are experiencing during the last few days, we expect that there will be more outbreaks of the diseases once the water levels start receding. There have been deaths reported from the Karapitiya Hospital and patients from Matara, Hambantota, Tangalle and various other places have been admitted to this Hospital. I, as the Deputy Minister of Health, want to give an assurance that our Ministry has taken all the necessary steps to tackle these problems.

The issue is, the Ministry of Health alone cannot solve these problems without the support of the public. The public should be aware of how these diseases are caused. This Influenza virus normally starts with cough, followed by fever. We have requested the MOH offices to inform the public that when a person gets cough, fever and a runny nose, to go to a hospital. But there are some patients who do not do that. They go to a close-by private practitioner and take medicine and only when it becomes worse, they run to a hospital. This happens not only for this viral fever but it happens for Dengue fever also. We have been monitoring that also. We have informed the public that they can come to our hospitals for any disease. We have all the facilities. We spend a lot of money to do blood tests. We have provided 3-part haematology analyzers, 5-part haematology analyzers to all hospitals and also sent enough MLTs to most of the hospitals.

But, you all are blaming only the Ministry of Health and that will not help. We want public support to prevent this type of diseases. When the Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Sudarshini Fernandopulle was speaking, she spoke about the importance of washing hands. Do people wash their hands? You should wash your hands if you want to prevent this viral fever. You have to be very careful. These type of diseases rapidly spread in schools, because when children cough, most probably they cough in front of other children.

When you talk about the spread of diseases in Sri Lanka, if we get the support of public, we can control all these diseases. I want to give you an example. A large number of tourists come to Negombo, which is the most-affected area of dengue; but the foreigners do not get affected by the dengue fever. The reason is, when they come to Sri Lanka, they come prepared to face this

problem. They come ready with whatever cream or oil which they apply to prevent mosquito bites.

Some Hon. Members pointed out that as a result of Directors being transferred this has worsened; which is a false story. In fact, yesterday also, I saw on television the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage talking about that issue.

Sir, I want to say that Dr. (Mrs.) Paba Palihawadana has been working as the Chief Epidemiologist of the Epidemiology Unit from 2012 and she was given Cabinet approval in 2017 to go and work for the UNICEF. She was given official leave for two years, but after one year she came back to the Ministry. By the time she came we have already sent the request to the PSC to fill the vacant position of the Epidemiology Unit. They called for an interview and they have selected another person to look after that Unit. Dr. Anil was given that position by the PSC. I think, you know that once the PSC recommends, we cannot change that. It is a rule. After one year, Dr. (Mrs.) Paba Palihawadana came back and she has been appointed to another Unit. It is not a fault of the Ministry or a fault of the Minister. It is the transfer procedure. Every five years, they are transferred. After five years, every doctor has to apply for that transfer programme. So, automatically Dr. Anil came to that position and we had to give it to him. The bond agreement states that it is the Ministry that decides where one has to work.

She had taken leave for two years but she came back after one year. By the time she came, her post had been filled and she had been transferred to another Unit.

( ) (The Hon. Faizal Cassim) Therefore, it is not reasonable for the Opposition to point the finger at the Ministry of Health, because she has been given that position automatically. That is all. We have not transferred her or we have not taken her away from the Ministry. She herself had applied for leave for two years to work in the UNICEF, but, she had come back after one year. That is the story. Therefore, it is not fair to blame the Ministry or the Minister. Still our Epidemiology Unit is very strong. Our team has had two meetings at the PDHS Office in the Southern Province and they have been given instructions as to what they have to do and now, all the medicines are available there. So, the public have to be aware of this and they have to be careful. I think, our Director-General also had a press conference the day before yesterday and he explained the situation.

So, whatever the public may say, according to our records, the number of OPD patients have come down this week compared to last week. So, it is rapidly coming down. Therefore, I hope that this issue will settle in time to come. When public become more aware of this we can work on it.

Then, on the issue that the Hon. ChandimaWeerakkody was talking about, I would like to tell him that we have linked all the Central Government Hospitals through a computerized system. If any hospital, whether it is a Central Government Hospital or a

Provincial Hospital, has a shortage of medicine, through this computerized system, they can immediately get down the medicines required. Last month, I was looking for a medicine for cancer which was not available in our stores and I was able to get it down from the Jaffna Hospital to be given to the Maharagama Cancer Hospital. So, the system is there. It is the duty of the Directors of the hospitals to use that system and we have instructed them to do so. The Minister, the Director-General or the Secretary cannot do everything. We have formed a system where the transfer of medicine can be done. So, it is their duty to use that. The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody blamed the Ministry. He may have been given this information by the public. But these are responsibilities of the high-ranking officers. They have to do their job. What happens in Sri Lanka is, somebody makes a mistake and everybody points the finger at the Minister.

In fact, we have been developing our health sector. I think we have achieved the standard that is recognized by the world. Now we should not try to move further down. We have started a lot of programmes to move forward. The World Bank has granted US Dollars 200 million to develop the primary healthcare system. So, we are going to develop primary healthcare services in all the village hospitals and bring it closer to the level of base hospitals and then base hospitals to the level of Central Government hospitals. So, through this system, we are trying to make access to health facilities easier for the public in Sri Lanka.

Therefore, I thank the Hon. Janaka Wakkumbura for moving this Adjournment Motion today in Parliament and highlighting through Parliament to create public awareness of this influenza virus.

Thank you very much. . . Question put, and agreed to. . . 3.15 2018 25 . . 10.30 .
