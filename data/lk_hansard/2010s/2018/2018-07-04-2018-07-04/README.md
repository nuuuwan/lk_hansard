( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) , . . . . . . . . . , . , 2 . 2 2018 . . , we will have a problem about the criteria. You cannot change the criteria after this has been done. That is the problem that we have.

, . , .

, . , . , .

As it stands now, recruitment is for all-island. We cannot confine it to one district. But the problem that arises in certain districts, including Jaffna, came up when I went there last time. So, I am looking at how we can address it. It is a problem not only for Jaffna; some other districts also have the same issue. It is more acute in

Jaffna because some of them cannot go outside for employment. So, we are looking into that.

Finally, for Jaffna, for the entire North, we have to create employment opportunities; we have to create new jobs. Without development, new income opportunities will not arise in the North. So, we are addressing that issue also.

Mr. Speaker, actually, as we are talking about the Customs Ordinance. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly talk about the reward system in the Sri Lanka Customs. In fact, the problem with the reward system, as it is, Mr. Speaker, is that under the current law, Customs Officers have both the power and the strong incentives to impose large penalties even for trivial customs violations. The fact that appealing a Customs ruling is expensive and time consuming, legitimate traders and other private-sector persons face considerable legal risks and many of them, I am afraid to say, have to pay large irregular payments to avoid penalties and this, from the information I have, is fairly a common situation in the Department. This also affects the material impact on efficiency of the trading process and as a result, we are getting lower customs revenue and higher prices for consumers.

The way to address this problem, which has been there for many, many years, I feel, would be to reduce the officers' incentives to impose large penalties for trivial violations, ensure by law that penalties are proportional to the violations and create an effective appeal system. And also I would say, with the automation of Sri Lanka Customs, with less and less interaction between traders and Custom Officers, this issue can be addressed fairly effectively.

The way things stand now, 50 per cent of the incentives, the rewards, are going to the Customs Officers' Reward Fund, 20 per cent to the Customs Officers Compensation and Management Fund and 30 per cent to the Consolidated Fund. In fact, very, very few countries have any compensation scheme for Customs Officials like we have in Sri Lanka. In fact, the schemes which are operational in our part of the world are uniformly less generous than that of Sri Lanka. For example, in India, 20 per cent, not 50 per cent, of the reward is given to the Customs Officials concerned with a limit of Indian Rupees 2 million - there is a ceiling of Indian Rupees 2 million which is the equivalent of Sri Lankan Rupees 3 million - and Indian Rupees 20 million over an officer's entire career. Over the entire career, no Customs Officer is allowed to earn more than Indian Rupees 20 million as reward. In Pakistan, the reward is 20 per cent, diminishing 5 per cent for amounts above Pakistani Rupees 1 million which is approximately US Dollars 8,000. For smuggling detection, there is a cap at

1263 1264

Pakistani Rupees 1 million and however big the detection is the officer concerned will not get any more than Pakistani Rupees 1 million. In Thailand, it is 10 to 20 per cent with the cap of Baht 5 million which is the equivalent of US Dollars 150, 000.

Mr. Speaker, I have here the rewards list of the Sri Lanka Customs for the period 1st April, 2017 to 31st March of this year.

Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. SELVAM ADAIKKALANATHAN] took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, you may continue. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees.

In fact, I do not want to read the names. The individuals' names are all here with me, but I will not read them because I do not want to embarrass the officials. But, for example, there is one gentleman here who has got as rewards Rs. 95,466,938.00 just for twelve months.

12 rewards 100 . 1,000 . 2, 6, 2 , 37 12 , . . , . ? analyze , rewards, penalties .

In any given year, 20 officers or around one per cent of the Customs workforce receive reward payments above Rs. 10 million. workforce 1 10 . Reward payments to those officers amounted to 20 per cent or more of the total rewards paid out in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and payments to the highest rewarded ten officers amounted to around 15 per cent of the total payments. 10, 12 .

The officers who receive large reward payments in one year usually also received high payments in other years. , . For example, the highest rewarded one per cent of the Customs officers in 2015 not only received around 21 per cent of reward payments in 2015 - , Customs Officers 1 2012 reward payments 21, 00 2012 - but also 12 per cent in 2016 was received Rs. 230 million and 10 per cent in 2017. . Five Customs Officers were among the 20 highest rewarded officers in all three years. All of them received at least Rs. 12 million per year. , rewards 12 Customs Officers 2 .

Taking together all years for which there is data, a large inequality remains. A group of around 130 Officers or six per cent of the Customs' workforce collected more than half of the overall rewards payment from 2015 to 2018. The highest rewarded 10 Officers collected 12 per cent of total rewards, which is Rs. 660 million and the highest rewarded 20 Officers collected 18 per cent of total rewards which is more than Rs. 1 billion. The 10 highest rewarded Officers all received more than Rs. 40 million each from 2015 to 2017, while the average reward was less than Rs. 1 million per year. This suggests that there is a substantial lifetime inequality in rewards.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) , , .

CPJ - Committee to Protect Journalists - , Sri Lankan politicians try to intimidate journalists over New York Times report . Sir, I will conclude my speech with this. Recently, it was reported in The New York Times that the former presidential candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa received about US Dollars 10 million for his election campaign from a Chinese company. It is normal, in elections, for individuals to receive money from citizens and corporations in that country. But, when there is foreign funding, we have to come to the conclusion that those candidates will be under obligation or are already under obligation to deliver on a foreign agenda. That is the problem with receiving foreign funding.

Today, the Committee to Protect Journalists has said that Sri Lankan politicians have tried to intimidate journalists over The New York Times report. Particularly, they have named Dharisha Bastians and Arthur Wamanan, saying that they are being intimidated by politicians in the Opposition and that this is totally unacceptable.

The New York Times has also gone further and issued a news release on that, which states, I quote:

A group of Sri Lankan parliamentarians allied with the former president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, held a news conference to publicly criticize two journalists who contributed logistical assistance to a rigorously reported and accurate New York Times investigation into the Hambantota port, published on June 26.

It is unacceptable for journalists to be intimidated in this way. This action appears intended to silence critics and curb press freedoms, and ultimately deprive Sri Lankans of information in the public interest.

The Times expects the Sri Lankan authorities to ensure the safety of journalists working for our - or any - news organization.

If Mr. Rajapaksa takes issue with Times reporting, we have encouraged him to contact senior editors at The New York Times rather than intimidating Sri Lankan journalists.
