( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Leader of the Opposition. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Sir, as I was telling you, we have been working on the basis of a consensus in regard to the election of Speaker, Deputy Speaker and the Deputy Chairman of Committees. In terms of that consensual arrangement, Sir, as a Member of the United National Party, you are the Speaker and we have as the Deputy Chairman of Committees a Member from the TNA. I would urge that if the SLFP is proposing a name for the position of the Deputy Speaker, we accept that name in keeping with the tradition and work on the basis of consensus. My humble submission is that in keeping with the healthy tradition that has prevailed, if there is a proposal by the SLFP in regard to the position of Deputy Speaker, we bow to that proposal and accept that on the basis of the consensus of the whole House.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Prime Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Speaker, on what the Leader of the Opposition said, the consensus was that we appoint the Speaker from the UNP as the Government Group and we have the Deputy Speaker from the Government Group who is a SLFP Member and the Deputy Chairman of Committees from the Opposition, which was different from earlier times where all three Members were from the Government Group. So, when the vacancy arose, I think the first name that the Government Group suggested was an SLFP Member from the Jaffna District. But some of the Parties were not willing. Therefore, since there were

921 922

2018 05

no other backbenchers in the Government Group -they wanted people with more experience - we have now taken a backbencher from the UNP and recommended him as the Deputy Speaker. So, as long as it is from the Government Group, it does not matter to us. This is the only name that we have from the Members who sit in the Government. We want everyone to go along. But remember that the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker both were from the Government Group in a system where all the Members of the UNF and some Members of the SLFP formed the Government Group and then the position of Deputy Chairman of Committees went to a Member in the Opposition. That was all. I mean, there has never been a situation in which the Government had to take a minority. Always the Government had two Members and the Opposition had one Member. I think the first Member who was suggested from our side with the consensus was not acceptable to some of the Opposition Parties. Therefore, now, we have suggested another backbencher from the Government side, because we are keeping with the consensus that two Members are from the Government and one Member is from the Opposition, which is a new tradition because last time all three Members were from the Government.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Leader of the Opposition.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Sir, I have heard the Hon. Prime Minister - in fact, the Hon. Prime Minister telephoned and spoke to me some days ago in regard to this matter. When he suggested the person he now has in mind, I told him even then that it may be better for us to agree on a nominee of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party for the post of Deputy Speaker. I

923 924

said that to him. I am stating here in Parliament what I said to the Hon. Prime Minister a few days ago.

I would urge, Sir, despite the initial thinking of the Prime Minister, we will reconsider this matter and if the Sri Lanka Freedom party is proposing a name for the post of Deputy Speaker, we accommodate that position and accept that person as the Deputy Speaker.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I have to act on the decision of the political parties. - [Interruption.] Hon. Prime Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, our convention is two Members from the Government, not two Members from the Opposition Benches. I mean, I have always maintained that position and when the Government first suggested a Member, it was you all who opposed it, not us. We did not oppose that Member. When the SLFP Ministers asked me, I said, All right, we have no objection. Speak to the others. So, when you all objected, we came up with another name. That is all. I mean, basically we have to keep it within the Government ranks - two Members from the Government.

So, I urge the Leader of the Opposition that we work in the same way because we have all so far worked together and we have bowed to your wishes in withdrawing the first candidate; the SLFP withdrew that candidate. We ourselves have bowed to your wishes. Not that we went and told the SLFP we do not want that Member. All we said was that it has to be a backbencher. So, it was your decision. As a result, now we have no one from the SLFP backbench in the Government ranks. None of their Deputy Ministers are willing to resign to take it over. Therefore, we have no option but to propose someone from the Government side who is a backbencher. So, I would ask the Leader of the Opposition to support us in upholding it. That is all that we are saying.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, we cannot, because we have five Notifications to debate, which are important. Those affect the country. So, we have to debate those.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) The Hon. Minister of Finance and Mass Media cannot come on Friday. That is the problem.
