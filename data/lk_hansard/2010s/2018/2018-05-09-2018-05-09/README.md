We determine that section 12A (1) of the Bill is inconsistent with the article 154P (3) (a) of the Constitution and an amendment is required to be made to the Constitution to give effect to the section 12 A (1) of the Bill. This requires the Bill to be passed by a two-third majority. However, if the jurisdiction is conferred on the High Court of Provinces under article 154P (3) (c) like in Act No. 10 of 1996 and Act No. 54 of 2006 this amending section will cease to be inconsistent.

[2.00p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to say a few words in respect of the important Amendments that are being brought before this House today, particularly the Amendment that is being sought to be made to the Judicature Act, by which a Permanent High Court of Trial at Bar is to be established to try certain categories of cases which, in the interest of justice and in the present circumstances, require to be expeditiously concluded.

The law's delays have been the bane of our judicial system for so long. Therefore, even in the criminal justice system, the accused in very serious cases have often escaped due punishment making use of the law's delays and over a period of time, sometimes, it also results in them being pronounced "not guilty" due to unavailability of witnesses et cetera. If a trial happens 10 or 15 years after the incident, invariably even eyewitnesses, sometimes, are not among the living and documentary evidence also goes missing. These are our experiences when long delays happen in the process of the criminal justice system.

So, this Amendment that has been brought is timely because there is a clamour, an expectation in the country that certain types of offences, by which the countrys economy has been weakened and certain categories of offences that have been committed with impunity, are not being taken up and pursued. Particularly, if crimes that have been committed by persons in political authority are not taken up in a timely manner, invariably they drag it until there is a change of regime and then, once they are back in the saddle, they ensure that the process is stultified permanently. So, this has been, I think, one of the biggest reasons why corruption at the highest levels in this country has never been effectively addressed. A Parliament term of five years or even six years, as we had previously, is not enough to conclude serious trials involving political bigwigs. Our country also has a history of changing regimes and when there is a change, a change of the guard, they escape permanently.

This Government came with a very specific mandate to address the issue of corruption, to deal with corrupt politicians in particular, bring them before the law and ensure that the due course of justice is followed. Unfortunately, three years after the change happened, there has been only one conviction, which has also been subject to an appeal. In our system, generally, we have two appeals. We can envisage the lapse of another decade or so before finality is reached even with regard to that one conviction.

( ) (The Hon. Arundika Fernando) ?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No. I am not giving way, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Arundika Fernando) I just want to ask a question. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) If it is a point of Order that you are raising, I can allow you. But, otherwise, do not take his time.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I am not giving way. I am sorry. ( ) (The Hon. Arundika Fernando) Just one small question. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I am not giving way. He does not understand - ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) If it is a point of Order, I can allow you. But, otherwise, Hon.Sumanthiran can go ahead.

( ) (The Hon. Arundika Fernando) Hon. Member, what I want to ask you is, do you not think that you all are taking over the power which had been given to the Provincial Councils?

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Aeunsika Fernando, why do you not raise that when participating in the Debate? Go ahead, Hon. Sumanthiran.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) So, Sir, this is the history, as I said, of the criminal justice system, which had become ineffective due to these long delays.

I want to cite one or two examples. There are examples under the ordinary laws. But, even in cases filed under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which is a special law under which prosecutions happen fast or are supposed to happen in a faster pace primarily because of the fact that confessions are used as admissible evidence, we find trials not concluding for 20 years. One good example is

the case of the attempted murder of the former President Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. It took 17 long years for that case to conclude. So, even in respect of the first citizen of this country - when she was the President, an attempt was made on her life - for the State to prosecute the suspects, it took 17 years, to get a judgment even in the original court.

Here, I want to raise another issue. There was a couple, a Hindu priest and his wife, who were accused among the several accused in that case. The man was convicted and received sentences running consecutively for several hundreds of years. But, the wife was acquitted of all charges. After 17 years, she was acquitted and in all those 17 years, she was in remand. She, now, has to get treatment for mental health. This is just one example where even with regard to the so-called "victim", it took 17 long years for justice. But, with regard to the suspects also severe injustice was made. I cite this example because it is a poignant one to be able to point out that from all sides, people have suffered because of these long law's delays. So, it is not in the interest of anyone or in the interest of any orderly society for cases, particularly serious criminal cases, to drag on like this.

Now I must commend some of the petitioners who went before the Supreme Court challenging the provisions of this Bill. I must also disclose the fact that I appeared myself in this matter for certain interventions and supported the provisions of the Bill. Some of the petitioners raised a very important question, that it violated the Thirteenth Amendment. They raised the issue that after the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the original criminal jurisdiction in a particular province lay only with the Provincial High Court and not the High Court of Sri Lanka. That seems to be the case and I think the Supreme Court also has upheld that provision. So, all of those who challenged this Bill, thank you for strengthening devolution. All these years we thought there was no devolution of judicial power, but now you have gone to court and established that judicial power is also devolved under our Constitution. Be that as it may. That change is being made in the Committee Stage Amendments, that it will be before the Provincial High Court, because it is the Provincial High Court that has jurisdiction over original criminal matters. Until now, since 1987, when the Thirteenth Amendment was brought in, I do not think that this has been followed. They followed a system of judicial zones as a matter of administrative practice. But as a matter of constitutional position, this had not been followed. I hope, after this Determination, the Attorney General will now follow the principle that has been enunciated in this Determination and comply with what the Supreme Court has said even in respect of all other matters, not necessarily those that come under the Permanent High Court at Bar.

Then, the objections that were raised with regard to court not granting postponements and so on, have all been dealt with by the Supreme Court. These are not new provisions. These provisions are there or have been there even in respect of certain other matters. Although I am not a criminal practitioner, I know criminal practitioners know that in respect of jury trials, day-to-day trial is the

75 76

2018 09

norm. Once the jury is constituted, you cannot be granting long dates - three months, four months et cetera - between dates. It has to happen day-to-day. In a sense day-to-day trials, particularly in criminal matters - it applies to civil matters also- is essential because even if it is one judge hearing the case or it is the jury that is trying the case or three judges as in the case of trials-at-bar, they should be in a position to remember all of the evidence sequentially being placed before them There is no point in having long intervals between trial dates, in between which they would have heard another hundred or two hundred cases, for it to be humanly possible to remember what a particular witness said on the previous date. A witnesss evidence might actually spans several dates and it is not possible for even a legally trained judge to keep a track of or, remember the demeanor et cetera of a witness. They will have to go by proceedings. So, the whole point of a trial in open court, in public, a public hearing, would be lost if such is the case. But here is a provision that is being brought, not in all cases, but in certain instances, where the Permanent High Court at Bar will hear the cases day-to-day and no one will be the loser as a result because even an accused before that court can actually expect, if there are factors in his favour, for the judges to remember those factors when they write the judgment. It is so with the prosecution as well. No one should be able to rely on imperfect memory of those who hear the case; either judges or jury or whoever it maybe. A perfect memory as much as possible is essential before adjudication is made, I say, particularly in criminal matters. Repeatedly I am saying that, because it is in those matters that a persons personal liberty can be deprived by the sentence that is passed. That is a very serious matter, so care must be taken to ensure that every bit of evidence that is placed before court is seriously addressed, remembered, analyzed, dealt with and pronounced upon.

So, this is the system that is sought to be brought. Not just one judge but three judges - three legally trained minds - would be addressing that issue. According to the new Amendment that will be brought in, they will be appointed by the Chief Justice himself. So, there is complete independence in the manner of choosing who those judges would be in those Permanent High Court at Bar and instead of one judge you have three judges addressing their minds to the matter. So, I would say great care has been taken to ensure that justice is done, that the guilty is punished and also the innocent will not be punished, that all legal and factual matters can be dealt with fully before the court makes an adjudication in respect of these matters.

The other is shortening the time for appeals. There can be one appeal, but that is sufficient because when you have a matter that has been heard by three judges and a decision made, there will be no necessity for two appeals, and therefore, one appeal to the apex court is more than sufficient. Presently, when there has been a trial-at-bar, it is a bench of five Supreme Court judges who have to hear that appeal. So, you would have had three judges at the level of High Court and if there is an appeal, five judges at the highest level who heard the case before a final decision is made.

So, there is nothing to really complain about this institution that is being set up. It cannot be called witch-hunt by any means. It is designed in the best interest of disposing serious issues bringing the crimes before court and the courts to make an adjudication on that, but also all rights that accused before court have hitherto enjoyed will continue to be theirs. There is nothing that is being taken away in this special process. As for myself, I commend the move by the Hon. Minister of Justice for having brought in this important Amendment through which Permanent High Courts at Bar can be set up in every province or in certain provinces where that is required.

I also want to place on record the work that was done in this respect by the previous Minister of Justice who is here, the directions that he gave, and the Sectoral Oversight Committee which worked on this process and all Members in that Committee who gave off their time and had long discussions with the various institutions before this draft Bill was approved by that Committee. It is hoped that the beginning that we envisaged today with the establishment of this Permanent High Court at Bar, we will see a new chapter dawning in disposal of cases in the country dealing with serious crimes, particularly, in the area of corruption, bribery and other financial crimes and the impunity that has hitherto been enjoyed by various personalities of all political hues, will be brought to an end. We can all be proud that this Parliament brought in this mechanism and established this Permanent High Court at Bar which would render justice to all.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

. .

[5.25p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake - Minister of Plantation Industries) Mr. Presiding Member, it is a very privileged occasion for me to speak on the Second Reading Debate of the Judicature (Amendment) Bill. Actually, this is not

131 132

[ ]

2018 09

a new thing or a magic because this is the setting up of a special court to prosecute white-collar crimes. The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara wanted the provisions for murder cases also to be included in this, but actually, only the provisions for white-collar crimes have been included in this. There are white-collar crimes which come under the Penal Code also like cheating offences, criminal breach of trust, cheating by falsification, theft, offences on money laundering and bribery. So these white-collar crimes that have been held up needed to be expedited for justice to take place.

Sir, as you know, one of the important tenets of law is how the legal process works very quickly. That is very important. The legal process has to move very fast; it cannot be held up for two, three years. Once a B Report or an indictment is filed, there has to be a very quick legal process. Therefore, a Special High Court for Commercial Law was established about 15 years ago. I myself as a young lawyer started my practice mostly in the Commercial High Court of Sri Lanka in the Western Province. So, there is nothing new in this. Although the Opposition tries to make it out to be that the cases are going to be political cases, that is not the case, because ultimately the Attorney General will have to present the case to court with the evidence before him and of course, the person who is charged has a very equal right to defend himself.

. . . . . . . . . . .

Now, in this instance also, if the Government or any government wants to prosecute somebody, there has to be a certain body of evidence against that person. For example, if somebody is laundering money, he knows very clearly that he has to set up a system. Under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, certain companies have to be established; dummy companies have to be established; those money has to be cleared through dummy companies and it has to come to certain banks. Then, you can trace it.

I still believe that the Attorney General's Department is a very good department and an independent department. So, it can make these decisions. Our Government is honestly not pressurizing the Attorney General's Department to prosecute people. What we want is that the legal process must move forward expeditiously and very quickly, if evidence is there. We find that the

legal process is not fast enough to move forward in these matters. Actually, the legal process is very slow in Sri Lanka. It is very frustrating even for lawyers like us to work in this legal system, because it takes years for a case to be heard.

Now, some of these cases against politicians, particularly members of the Rajapaksa family, have come before Courts, then, they are delayed for another three months; they are laid by; again they are called and again they are delayed for another four months. So, that is what we are objecting to. It can be A, B, C, D or E. What we want is a very expeditious process where the law is properly adhered to and people are given the choice and the freedom to defend themselves.

Therefore, I welcome this Bill and hope that the Judicature (Amendment) Bill will be a historic Bill so that all these white-collar crimes - embezzlement, fraud, money laundering, cheating, corruption - in Sri Lanka can be looked into and cases can properly be prosecuted very quickly through the establishment of this Special Court.

I hope the Opposition also sees it in this light. It is not an act to make political victimization, because ultimately, at the end of the day, it is a court - in a court, there are two sides. The judge must be independent, the two opposing counsels must be strong and the judgements must be based on the evidence that is there. So, it is that procedure that is still in place. You cannot take that procedure away. So, I think on the long run, this will be a Special Court that will try, hear and determine the trials of the white-collar crimes which are rapidly increasing in our society. I think this is a good move and we, in the Government, welcome it and hope that the Judicature (Amendment) Bill will be passed today.

Thank you, very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . , .
