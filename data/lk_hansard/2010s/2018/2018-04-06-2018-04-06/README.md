[12.23p.m.] 0 ( ( - ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella - Minister of Public Enterprise and Kandy Development and Leader of the House of Parliament) Hon Speaker, I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by the Chief Government Whip and the Hon. Prime Minister. The late Hon. S. Alavi Moulana was a born trade unionist. I had a very close association with him. In the 70s, 80s or even in the early 60s, if there was a demonstration anywhere in Colombo, we would see the presence of the Hon. Alavi Moulana.

Sir, he had a great sense of humour. When we spoke with him, he would always make us laugh. Sir, once I went to see him when he was in a hospital in India as I happened to be in Madras at that time and he came out with a nice rhyming comment. He said, This nurse is a curse; she is trying to drive me into the hearse and the doctor is trying to steal my purse. So, even at a time like that, Sir, though he was ill in a hospital in a foreign country, he never lost his sense of humour. I think those of us who associated him loved him greatly.

He entered Parliament, became a Cabinet Minister and later, a Governor. I think those of us who knew him closely miss his company very much.

Sir, I do not wish to speak at length. I wish to convey my condolences to the members of his family.

Thank you.

[2.19 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana ) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to deliver, probably, the most difficult speech I have ever delivered in this House.

The late Hon. Marhoom Al-Haj As-Seyed Alavi Moulana was, to our nation, one of its greatest sons; to the working class, their champion and most colourful, fearless and successful trade unionist; to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, a devoted tower of strength; to this House and Governments of the past, a notable Cabinet Minister of Labour, Provincial Councils and Local Government and Governor of the Western Province, and personally to me, my dear uncle and closest mentor.

Sir, it is impossible to sum up in a few words the yeoman service he had rendered to our country and also the profound and fearless acts he undertook on behalf of

1583 1584

[ ]

2018

the common man, which brought about change within the overall political fabric of our country, by way of enacting our pivotal reforms and legislation which we now, several years later, take for granted.

Throughout his long and arduous career, he was called many things. Many called him Moulana mahaththaya, Moulana amathithuma, Moulana aandukarathuma and so on. However, what most befitted him was probably his being referred to as the Picketing Governor, a true testament to his lifelong commitment towards taking to the streets, particularly to Lipton Circus, as very rightly mentioned by the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, to fight for what was right even till his last days. His most preferred title, however, was Moulana Sahodaraya or Comrade Moulana, a true display of a man of deep humility. By the members of our family and me, he was always affectionately addressed as Alavi uncle and he was Alavi appa to the younger generations. Alavi uncle was a one-man show, a physically towering force of nature, who boldly and confidently took to the streets on countless occasions at the helm of many protests to fight tirelessly for the common man till his last breath.

The Vote of Condolence being taken up today in his honour in this august House is testament to the life and times of Alavi uncle. While those speaking about him today shall most likely speak of his lifelong, arduous and exhilarating service as a revolutionary trade unionist and a progressive senior statesman of our country, I wish to take a more personal route.

Born on New Years Day in 1932 to Seyed Ahamed Moulana and Sithy Rahma, Alavi uncle, like me, hailed from a noble lineage, the House of Ahl al-Bayt, being the 36th direct descendant of the Holy Prophet Muhammad, sal allahu alaihi wa sallam, may peace be upon him, through his grandson Hussain.

The origins of our ancestry can be traced back to the Southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, in Hadramaut, in present-day Yemen, from where our seafaring ancestors embarked on a journey in search of the famed land of Serendib, present day Sri Lanka. In true testament to this noble ancestry, and in somewhat of an ironic context, Alavi uncle chose to live his life by the actions of his most revered ancestor, the Holy Prophet of Islam, who himself fought tooth and nail for the liberation of the oppressed and the downtrodden, and who was probably one of the earliest notable propagator of labour rights in modern history. In fact, Alavi uncle incessantly repeated the words of the Holy Prophet Muhammad, Sallallahu alaihi wa sallam , may peace be upon him, which were Pay the worker his dues even before his sweat dries.

Thus, Alavi uncle chose to be different, simply because he was different. Choosing to answer a higher calling of what was expected of him and his family, Alavi uncle rose to the occasion at the young age of 15 by attending rallies of Pieter Keuneman, Dr. S.A. Wickramasinghe and Dr. Colvin R. De Silva after school hours while at St. Peters College and Zahira College. He was inspired by the Socialist movements ability to mobilize the downtrodden working classes in the attempt to uplift their lives, and further obtain Independence for our country from the imperialists.

In fact, Alavi uncle was probably among the youngest arrested by the police for protesting against the Motion of No-Confidence against Kumaran Ratnam, the then Mayor of Colombo who was a champion of workers rights at that time. Even at that very young age of 19, the deep rooted conviction instilled in him that there should be equal opportunities for all, always surpassed any obstacle that attempted to prevent him from doing what he thought was right, and this mindset prevailed throughout his six decades of public service. In fact, I recall that fateful day on July 16, 1980, when Alavi uncle, ever at the forefront of the movement for the downtrodden, was targeted by thugs for his leadership, and was assaulted mercilessly. Those harrowing days that followed at the ICU at the General Hospital is a dark period in the memories of our family, as we stood by his bedside and saw him narrowly escaping the jaws of death. But again, after making a full recovery, he went back to doing what he did best, the rest being history.

Moreover, I must state at this juncture that it was not only Alavi uncle, but it was our entire family that paid the ultimate sacrifice on numerous occasions for the sake of doing what was righteous: his youngest brother Saheed lost his life due to political expediency, his brother-in-law and faithful companion, Seyed Mohammed Mashoor Moulana disappeared during the 1990 May Day rally at Campbell Park and was never to be seen again, and further, the healthy business of his two sons, Naqeeb Moulana and Najeeb Moulana were subject to state victimization leading to dire straits.

Hon. Speaker, while I shall allow for my fellow Colleagues in this House to speak more about his contribution towards the trade union movement and that of the exponential growth of Sri Lanka Freedom Party, I wish to speak on more of the character of Alavi uncle, and that of the man himself. Today, throughout the country, the household name Alavi Moulana is synonymous to a one-of-a-kind trade union leader, a great statesman, more recently a poet, whose affable rhymes were always coupled with reason and a serious advocate for unity and integration amongst all communities. This definition is a true testament to a man of principles who did his best towards what he knew was right with no complaint or fanfare.

In carrying out responsibilities entrusted to him, he never came under criticism by anyone who worked with him for having flouted his duties, nor was he ever implicated in any fraudulent or corrupt activity. He held many positions throughout his career and carried out his duties meticulously.

I credit my entry into the political sphere to Alavi uncle who upon my return from my studies in the United States, insisted that I accompany him to meet the then Prime Minister, the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike. At his insistence, she appointed me as the District Organizer for Batticaloa for the SLFP in 1988. From that point onwards, Alavi uncle was always my greatest and closest mentor. I recall countless fond memories of me as a young and sometimes frustrated politician going to him for advice when he would begin by gently addressing me

1585 1586

affectionately as Seyed Ali and thereafter offer me the most relevant and apt counsel, usually peppered with lively poetry.

Despite his seniority, in his true unique style, he never chased the limelight. We both entered Parliament for the first time in 1994. Although we were then on the opposite sides of the divide, him with the SLFP-led Peoples Alliance Government and me in the Opposition with the UNP, there was no greater honour for me than to serve in the Parliament alongside Alavi uncle. In fact, the Hansard will exhibit numerous times how we both engaged in healthy banters of substance from across the aisles and even our Colleagues at the time would egg us on watching amusedly as uncle and nephew were debating on issues of the day in this very House. However, Alavi uncle never ever compromised his principles and moreover, always put the family first ensuring that whenever such debates did happen between us in the Chamber, he would always embrace me in a fatherly fashion in the Lobby thereafter with pride and humility.

As a Governor, he delivered an unprecedented service to the people domiciled in his jurisdiction of the Western Province. I recall when he was offered the position for the very first time, he in fact turned it down, a rare trait in modern politics, preferring to revert to his trade unionist activities at his office at the SLFP Headquarters. He famously quipped in his own flair, I have never governed and do not want either myself or my workers governed. I prefer to negotiate, meditate, mediate and agitate. This is, again, another testament to the honour and loyalty to a lifelong commitment to the dispossessed whom he dedicated his life to. Although he rubbed shoulders with royalty, heads of State and the elite, he was always at home and most comfortable with the working class, whom he fought for all his life.

At this juncture, I must state of the exemplary life Alavi uncle led, particularly of his daily commitment to follow the Sunnah - Sunnah wa'l-Jam'ah- or the daily traditions and practices of the Holy Prophet Muhammed, sal allahu alaihi wa sallam, may peace be upon him.

No matter how immersed he was in public life, his lifestyle, poise and character reflected as to how much he followed the traditions of the Holy Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi wasallam, may peace be upon him, and ensured that this was conveyed and transferred to all those around him to the best of his ability in a manner of peace and contentment.

The light that shone on his face, the permanent smile, and his genuine, jolly, affable character is a true depiction to that of the Holy Prophet's way. I can clearly state at this point, that as a member of his family, and thereby a descendant of that same noble lineage, I am simply humbled to have known and to have been in association with such a man who above all, possessed true love for the Holy Prophet, sal allahu alaihi wa sallam, may peace be upon him, and his continued reverence for Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala.

Alavi uncle, nothing gives me more pride than to speak in this House about your glorious contribution to our country, to the lives of our fellow citizens and to our family. Today, I am joined by your children, Naqeeb Mowlana, Najeeb Mowlana, Husniya and Azzahanim, your grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and members of your extended family, in this very hallowed Chamber which you lit up time and again with your passionate discourse, to memorialize, commemorate and felicitate all that is now and forever, the legend of As-Seyed Alavi Mowlana, the People's Governor.

The members of the Holy Mowlana families are here. They are known as "Ahl ul-Bayt families" because they are brought up in a very holy, deeply religious, conservative, orthodox and a highly refined background. His children have acquired uncle As-Seyed Alavi Mowlana's good qualities. They are extremely good and I personally witness them following our rich Islamic culture and human values towards all communities just as their late father used to practise.

May the Almighty Allah have mercy on his soul, honour his reception, continue to elevate his status further, and grant him the beautiful gardens of Jannatul Firdous.

Ameen!

Having said that dua, let me take the liberty in saying a few words in Tamil.

... ( ( . . . - ) (The Hon. A. H. M. Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation) Hon. Speaker, it is with a deep sense of sorrow that I rise in this House today to speak on the Condolence Motion of my best friend and Colleague, late Hon. Seyed Alavi Moulana who was a trade union and political giant who stood against capitalism and racism nationally and internationally.

Reminiscing on trade union activities and political activities of the past, late Alavi Moulana occupies a significant place in the society for his deep commitment to serve the people of his generation. Hailing from the well popular Moulana family in the country, he had a humble beginning in his early life. He was deeply committed to serve the people of the generation, amidst the multi-ethnic background of our motherland. He devoted most of his time with the less fortunate and the poorer section of the people to whose benefit he dedicated his political career.

Late Moulana entered the trade union movement in early 1940s and continued his struggle for the working force until his last breath. Nearly six decades, he was in the forefront fighting for the rights of the workers and the down-trodden masses. He was the Vice President of the Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya.

He joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in 1956 and continued his trade union activities with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party trade unions. He was the main figure in organizing SLFP May Day rallies for over 30 years. For his commitments and services for decades to the trade unions, he was conferred with national and international awards. He was the Chairman of Asia and the Pacific Region of the International Labour Organization and was also a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

Late Moulana, underwent harassments and great hardships during the regime of late President J.R. Jayewardene in 1980. He was attacked with bicycle chains. He was also taken into custody with other trade union leaders and jailed. During this period, as a revenge, his brother was kidnapped by unknown gangs and he is missing until now. He had all the protest meetings, demonstrations and picketing at the Colombo Lipton Circle which was most popular as Moulana Circle

Late Alavi Moulana entered Colombo Municipal Council as a Member and served for more than 10 years. In 1994, he entered Parliament as a National List Member from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and was appointed the Deputy Minister of Mass Media. Later, he became the Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils. He also held the portfolio of Minister of Labour under President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga Government.

Late Moulana who was an ardent supporter and a family friend of Bandaranaike family was entrusted and took keen interest in organizing Bandaranaike Commemorations over three decades.

From 2002, late Hon. Alavi Moulana was appointed as Governor of the Western Province and he continued to be the Governor till 2015. During this period too as the Governor, he never forgot trade union activities.

He was a very pious person in religious activities. He has a strong faith in Islamic Socialism and stood with socialist countries and he was involved in anti-imperialist activities.

I was very closely associated with my best friend late Moulana in all political and community matters. We both were engaged in organizing the arrangements of Sri Lankan Haj Pilgrims for several years. We both represented Sri Lanka in many international Islamic Conferences. He was the Secretary of the Sri Lanka Muslim Federation for a long time in which I was the President. He was a founder of the Sri Lanka Committee for Solidarity with the Palestinian People and played a main role in championing the rights of the Palestinians.

May I Sir, in conclusion, offer my deepest sympathies to the beloved members of his family. My fervent Dua is that the Late Alavi Moulana be blessed with Allahs mercy and be granted Jennathul Firdouse! Aameen.

Thank you, Sir. [..3. 4]
