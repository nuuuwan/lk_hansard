[11.13a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Speaker for the opportunity given to speak a few words at this time.

I would like to second the proposal made by the Hon. Nalin Bandara Jayamaha just now with regard to the situation that has arisen since the 26th of October. Karuna Amman came in from the cold as it were and started speaking just after the 26th of October. There were many statements that he made and unfortunately, this incident happened at early hours this morning. Four policemen were shot at; two have succumbed to their injuries and we also, from the information that we ourselves have, have serious suspicions over these persons who were rejuvenated after the events of the 26th of October last month.

Similarly, another person also seems emboldened now. The EPDP cadres have suddenly come out of the woodwork in Jaffna. There was an attack last week - not on our Party, but on another Party members of a Paredeshiya Sabha - by the EPDP cadres and somebody who calls himself a minister is now going round saying, I have returned, I have returned. Using a famous screen dialogue from a cinema in Tamil, he goes round saying, I have returned. That is to terrorize the people. So, I would urge the Hon. Speaker to take appropriate action in this regard.

With regard to the Motion before the House, this is an occasion when, I think, perhaps for the very first time, Parliament is actually exercising the total control that it is supposed to have over the public finances of the country. It has always been there and we have spoken about it. But, this is, perhaps, the first time that that is being put into action. We have seen this happening in other countries when a Budget is stalled, governments shut down et cetera; this is somewhat similar.

When the Constitution says that Parliament has total control over public finance, it must be something tangible; it must be something of a power that the Parliament must be able to exercise. Yesterdays and todays Motions before the House are exercising a little of those powers bringing to the notice of those responsible and to the country of what the Parliament can do and if they do not heed what the Parliament is doing as a token of a reminder, then the Parliament can actually shut down government. I want to urge the persons responsible, particularly His Excellency the President and others who still claim illegally to be Prime Minister, Ministers, State Ministers and Deputy Ministers et cetera, that they must stop that, that they must give that up. They are people who have repeatedly, in this House, talked about the supremacy of Parliament. Many of them have ad nauseam talked about this and here is a test. This House has very clearly, not once, not twice, not three times, now almost on a daily basis, demonstrated that there is no Government.

I would also urge you, Mr. Speaker, to take appropriate steps with regard to how the media is treating this. Even after your pronouncement from the Chair on the 15th of November that due to the passage of the Motion the previous day that there is no Prime Minister and that there are no Ministers and the Cabinet, still the newspapers and other media are describing various people as "the Prime Minister", "Ministers" et cetera. I am glad the Hon. Member here raised the issue that the Parliament website still to date identifies the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister. I mean, if the Parliament does not respect what the Parliament has done, then it is impossible to call others to account. So, I urge you, Sir, to take immediate steps with regard to putting the Parliament website right and also instruct those responsible for various private media, even the State media, because this is a breach of the privilege of Parliament. Whether a Vote of No-Confidence is adopted or not is decided in the Parliament and nowhere else.

About 10 or 12 days ago, when we met with His Excellency the President, I said this even to him, that it is the Hon. Speaker who has to be satisfied as to whether a particular Motion was carried in Parliament or not, not the President. A No-Confidence Motion is passed in Parliament, not in the Presidential Secretariat. It is in Parliament. The Constitution has given different powers to different organs of Government and it has appointed certain other organs to be a check and balance of the powers exercised by the other organs. Certainly the Parliament has the power to be a check and balance on the powers exercised by the Executive and to that extent, where it is clearly stated that when a Vote of No-Confidence is passed on the Government the Cabinet stands dissolved. That is what the supreme law of the country says. That happens by operation of law. No one else needs to be satisfied that the Motion has been carried or not and whether it is a voice vote or an electronic vote or a vote by name. That is an act and deed of the Parliament and the moment that happens by operation of law, "the Cabinet stands dissolved" - those are the words that are used and this must be given effect.

We cannot allow various people in this country to willy-nilly violate the Constitution in this way. They are violating the Constitution, the Constitution that they have sworn to uphold and defend. So the Motion that was carried in this House yesterday and the Motion now before the House are the follow-up steps of what the Parliament can do. What the Parliament has done is well within the powers. The powers that have been given to it have been exercised and if it is not being recognized by others, then the Parliament can follow up with these Resolutions.

I also wish to say a few worlds Sir, in Tamil with regard to the TNAs position that was explained to the country yesterday by means of a letter to His Excellency the President.
