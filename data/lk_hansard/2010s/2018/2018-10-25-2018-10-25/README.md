05. , ? ? : 2018.10.25 " " : 2018.10.25 PRIVILEGE: THE ISLAND REPORT OF 25.10.2018 .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Speaker, for permitting me to raise this Question of Privilege.

As this House is aware, on 20th February, 2018, when the adjourned Adjournment Debate on the Reports of the Bond Commission and the PRECIFAC was about to be resumed, I raised a point of Order to the effect that the PRECIFAC Report was available only in the Sinhala language. Previously at a Party Leaders Meeting, when the said Debate was fixed for the 06th of February, I stated the position of the ITAK, that the said Debate should be held early, but if that was held any time before the 10th of February, we would not be in a position to participate in it. There was also a previous agreement amongst the Party Leaders that this Debate could start with only the English version of the PRECIFAC Report and that the Sinhala and the Tamil versions could be provided later. It is in that context, Sir, that I raised the issue that the PRECIFAC Report was only in Sinhala, because the Party Leaders had decided that both Reports could be only in English.

The Island newspaper of today, 25th October, 2018, in a news report titled "Public still waiting for Bond Commission report debate", quotes the Hon. (Dr.) Bandula Gunawardane as having said that I sabotaged the

Debate on the Bond Commission Report by asking for Tamil and Sinhala translations. Sir, I am tabling* that newspaper report.

That newspaper report is not true and not true to the knowledge of the Hon. (Dr.) Bandula Gunawardane, if he, in fact, had said that as reported today.

Although I have a right to demand that the two Reports be made available in Tamil, I did not, in fact, do so, as will be revealed from the Hansard of 20th February, 2018. I only referred to the fact that the Party Leaders had agreed to debate the Reports so long as those were in English, but that the PRECIFAC Report was available only in Sinhala. It has also been brought to my notice that in several broadcasts over the last several months, the MTV channels - MTV, Sirasa and Shakthi - have consistently carried out the same untrue propaganda against me.

I consider all of that as breaches of my Privilege as a Member of Parliament and I respectfully urge the Hon. Speaker to take action accordingly against, one, the Hon. (Dr.) Bandula Gunawardane, two, "The Island' newspaper and three, the MTV Television Network. The newspaper report I tabled today quotes the Hon. (Dr.) Bandula Gunawardane as having said, I quote:

Gunawardena said that in early Feb this year an adjournment debate on the treasury bond scam report was sabotaged by Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Jaffna District MP and party spokesman M.A. Sumanthiran. The TNA took up the position that it would be unfair to go ahead with the debate in absence of the Sinhala and Tamil translations of the report.

I never asked for Tamil or Sinhala translations. As I said earlier, I only asked that in accordance with the Party Leaders decision, that the PRECIFAC Report, not even the Bond Commission Report, must be available in English.

Therefore, I urge the Hon. Speaker to take appropriate action. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Bandula Gunawardane) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. (Dr.) Bandula Gunawardane, your name has been mentioned. So, you have the Floor.

The Hon. (Dr.) Bandula Gunawardane is again misrepresenting what I said. He says that I request to give the translations in Tamil and Sinhala. No, I did not request for translations in Tamil and Sinhala. That is the point I am making. I said we were prepared to debate it while it was in English. That was the Party Leaders decision. Even on that day, I did not ask - although it is my right to ask - for it in Tamil and Sinhala. I asked for the PRECIFAC Report, not for the Bond Commission Report, to be in English. I asked for the PRECIFAC Report to be in English because that was the Party Leaders decision. Now, again when the Hon. (Dr.) Bandula Gunawardane speaks, he says, The Hon. Sumanthiran says that it has to be in Sinhala and Tamil. I did not ask for it in Sinhala and Tamil. That is untruth. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay, we will discuss that. ( ) (The Hon.

What I raised was a Question of Privilege that false allegations are being made about what I said in the House and I want you to take action on that. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay, let me work according to the Standing Orders. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, it is the same privilege that I am looking for. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, I know. Your name was mentioned and that is why I allowed you. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) When the non-actors' characters are being

assassinated, I want to know as to why no action has been taken to stop that.

And also, Sir, I want to mention that there is a serious infringement on my security. Today morning, at 9.30a.m., D.M.M. Lahiru who is apparently working for Swarnavahini and ITN, without any permission, has used a drone which has gone over my house and recorded. For our luck, my private security personnel, which is more effective - I do not keep any MSD personnel at all - have captured that man. He has said that it is for ITN or something and has given false excuses. So, I would like to know whether there has been permission given in this high security area for a person to record. The recordings are in my hand. They are basically saying that this is an attempt of the ITN. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I will check on that.

Interestingly, the Finance Ministry Statement states, I quote:

Meanwhile Lazard and MTI through their global offices have already begun to reach out to international real estate investors covering many countries

I would like to know what the terms of references are. How could they have been already engaged in doing so even before the actual mandate was given to them? The advertisement appears on a particular day and the next day, I send a letter and then the Minister makes a statement to say that the agents are already looking out for investors.

RELEASE OF PERSONS DETAINED UNDER PREVENTION OF TERRORISM ACT [3.54p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Presiding Member, I move the following Adjournment Motion which concerns a very serious issue, that of several detainees under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which the Government has now moved to repeal and replace with another law titled Counter-Terrorism Act.

"The Prevention of Terrorism Act - PTA - was enacted in 1979 as a temporary piece of legislation valid for only six months. Thereafter, it was extended from time to time and eventually became permanent. Presently the Government, as I said, has taken steps to repeal the PTA and replace it with Counter-Terrorism Act. Several obnoxious provisions of the PTA have been left out of the new Bill.

Several persons were arrested under the PTA over the last several decades, tried and have been convicted. In most cases, the suspect's own confession made to a police officer was the only or main evidence against him/her. Under the proposed new law, confessions are not admissible as evidence.

Over 100 persons are still languishing in prisons under the PTA. Their cases have taken a long time and in most cases, the remand period is longer than the prescribed sentence for the offence they are charged with. These prisoners are accused of waging a war against the Government. However, the political objective of creating a separate State has come to an end in May, 2009 and is no longer extant. Therefore, it is meaningless to continue to incarcerate them even after they have already spent a decade or longer in prisons.

I, therefore, move that the Government should take a political decision to release all prisoners who have been held in prison for long periods under the PTA without any further legal action taken against them."

Sir, this law titled the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act has been the subject of many criticism by many persons and organizations for a long time since it was brought in, in 1979. Some of its features are draconian. There is preventive detention for periods of 18 months at a time merely on suspicion and on a detention order signed by the Secretary, Ministry of Defence. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs) Thusitha Wijemanna to the Chair? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I propose that the Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Thusitha Wijemanna do now take the Chair. , . . Question put, and agreed to.

1757 1758

, () . , , ( )() . Whereupon THE HON. HESHA WITHANAGE left the Chair, and THE HON. (DR.) (MRS.) THUSITHA WIJEMANNA took the Chair. .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) The other features are, as I said before, the provision that a confession made by the suspect, made to a police officer above the rank of an Assistant Superintendent of Police, is admissible as evidence in a court of law and if the voluntariness of that confession is challenged, then the burden of proving that such a confession was not voluntarily given is on the accused himself. This particular provision has led to very serious violations over the years and our countrys Law Reports are also replete with cases where the Supreme Court inquiring into Fundamental Rights petitions, on several occasions, has held that persons were tortured in order to obtain confessions to be used under the Prevention of Terrorism Act at their trials. At many a voir dire inquiry in the High Court itself where the voluntariness of the confession has been challenged, invariably the accused has been able to demonstrate through medical evidence that he was tortured for the purpose of extracting a confession. But, this is not always a case since the trial of the alleged offence comes up years after the arrest and invariably evidence of torture is not present when the persons voir dire inquiry comes up in court. With the result that a law that was brought in to contain terrorist activity, in fact, resulted in no proper investigation being conducted into the offence. Police Officers being armed with the power to extract confessions and produce them as evidence admissible in court did not bother to actually investigate and obtain evidence to present in court to prove the offence. That naturally led to situations where persons unconnected with the actual act, on mere suspicion or on some false information given, being apprehended and tried and convicted whilst the actual offender still roamed free. So, the objective of the Act was never realized because the actual offender was always a free person whilst someone who was picked up on suspicion and had signed a confession because he was tortured, or in some cases even just threatened, was convicted of that offence.

These are all documented and well known and that is why on the 14th of September, 2015 when the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Managala Samaraweera spoke at the High-Level Segment of the United Nations Human Rights Council gave an undertaking that the obnoxious Prevention of Terrorism Act would be repealed and that it would be replaced by another law that met with international standards.

High on those obnoxious provisions is the provision that admits confessions. Therefore, it is not necessary to state that the majority of those who have been convicted and sentenced under the PTA are persons against whom only their own supposed confession was the evidence. After the conclusion of the war in 2009, we appealed to

the Government that these persons who have been incarcerated for long years be released. Under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, there is no bail that is granted; bail is prohibited in the law. So, after the long preventive detention, when the case is filed in court, thereafter that person is not allowed bail. We have had situations where trials in these cases have gone on for 15 years or longer. Recently, we had a case that concluded after 19 years. Even the case on the attempted assassination of former President Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga took 17 long years for the trial to finish, at the end of which a husband and a wife - a couple - who had been arrested and charged with the offence of - ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please!

, . .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Madam Chair. I was also getting disturbed. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member)Hon. Member, you carry on with your speech. .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you.

A couple who had been arrested on suspicion - a Hindu priest and his wife- was held for 17 years in prison. They had four children. All those 17 long years, those children were brought up by neighbours and at the end of that trial, the lady was acquitted. But, she had been in prison for 17 years with her husband. I am told that she is mentally deranged now, after that long incarceration. This is just one example of what the Prevention of Terrorism Act has done. I can recite a story after a story of how this draconian law has caused injustice and hardships. Now that law is on its way out. Thanks to the Government's undertaking given by the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, last week or week before, the Government tabled in Parliament the Counter Terrorism Bill- ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) And also, the TRC Bill was also passed at the Cabinet.

1759 1760

2018 25

.. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you.

The Counter Terrorism Bill repeals the PTA. There is no provision for confessions to be admitted in evidence in the new draft law which means the Government accepts the obvious that that was an obnoxious provision that had to be removed from the Statute Books.

While all of this is happening, there are yet over hundred persons incarcerated under the Prevention of Terrorism Act; over 50 in number are convicted and sentenced. I have the list of those persons here. Some have been in prison for 25 years; some for 26 years; some for 22 years and so on. Long years of incarceration, longer than if they had been convicted and sentenced for a particular offence; longer than the prescribed sentence for the offence. That is because of the length that it takes for the trial to take place. These persons must be released.

This happened during a time when there was an armed rebellion in the country with the objective of creating a separate State. Whether these persons were actually guilty or not, there were people who waged the war against the Government with the intension of creating a separate State. That objective is now no more. In fact, at the end of the war, the Rajapaksa Government released 12,000 prisoners taken into custody. Twelve thousand young people, who had actually taken up arms and fought in the final war, were released after a two-year rehabilitation without any charges being preferred against them.

So, we were hopeful that the new Government would be more humanitarian than the Rajapaksa Regime. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be so. -[Interruption.] We will have your word, Hon. Minister, but we will also see what you do. Unfortunately, during the last three years, we have not seen that. Of course, I must acknowledge that at the time that the new Government took over, there were 217 persons in custody under the PTA and now there are 107 which means about 110 have been released; either their sentences finished or through a process of them pleading guilty and being sent to rehabilitation. We are thankful for that. But at the end of three years, if we still have 100 people or more detained under the provisions of a draconian law that you have taken steps to repeal, why is it not possible for you to release these persons also? We are asking the Government to take into consideration, the long years of incarceration. At the present moment we are not asking that you let them go scot-free. Because of those people whom we call "political prisoners" - we use that term advisedly and correctly because they were people who prosecuted a particular political objective - I know that the Ministers of Justice have continuously said, There are no political prisoners in Sri Lanka. That is what the White South African Government said when Nelson Mandela was imprisoned. Technically, he was convicted under a particular law and sentenced according to that law. But that did not mean that the world accepted that Nelson Mandela was not a political prisoner. He was a

political prisoner because he pursued a political objective. Similarly, these are people who pursued a political objective. Technically, they are convicted under a particular law. That does not make them any the less political prisoners.

And, of this lot, who are still languishing in prison, the least a person has been in prison is nine years. People were arrested in 2009, soon after the end of the war, for offenses they are said to have committed before the end of the war. Nine long years! If you release them by sending them to rehabilitation - that is what they have requested, not because all of them are guilty, but they say We have spent so long in prison. Therefore, we are willing to plead guilty and be sent to rehabilitation because if we wait for the end of the trial, we will spend another 10 years in prison.

Therefore, our appeal to you is that you take a humanitarian approach with regard to this matter, consider the long years of incarceration, consider the fact that you yourself are now repealing that Act, under which they were arrested and are being tried - some have even been convicted and sentenced - and release them, so that at least after 10 years, they can be free. Of course, they would have served a period of 10 years' incarceration, perhaps, for offences they did not commit. Nevertheless, to bring this matter to an end, we appeal to you to make that recommendation and take steps to do this. This has been done before in this country.

The Tamil political prisoners ask the question justifiably as to whether they are not being released only because they are Tamils. Twice before in rebellions in this country, after those rebellions were put down in the South, persons were released; after a period, they were released. Why is it that only these persons are not released? Also those who have been convicted and sentenced, it is only His Excellency the President who can exercise his powers to pardon them under the Constitution. We have spoken to His Excellency the President who has assured us that he will convene a meeting with the Hon. Prime Minister, the Hon. Minister of Justice, the Attorney-General and others and pursue that. It is on that undertaking that these prisoners who were fasting temporarily gave up their fast. So, we appeal to the Hon. Minister of Justice that you would also recommend to His Excellency the President to exercise his powers of pardon under the Constitution with regard to those who have already been convicted and are serving a sentence.

Thank you. [.. 4.16] . ( . ) (The Hon. S. Shritharan) , M.A. , .

[4.51p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardene - State Minister of Defence) Hon. Presiding Member, I think this subject has been spoken about for the last few years and it is an issue that has often been raised by the Hon. Members of Parliament of the TNA as well as the people of Jaffna. We, of course, do not consider them as political prisoners. I think this matter will have to be looked into by the Ministry of Justice and Prison Reforms as well as by the Ministry of

Public Administration and Management and Law and Order and see what we can do to expedite the cases.

From what we know, you all have spoken with the President as well as the Prime Minister about this and what they say is that they would take up case-by-case and see how they could expedite them. Out of all the people who are detained, there might be those who had committed grave crimes during that time. So, first, we need to look into the cases. All these cases are with the Attorney-General at the moment. So, we will have to take those up case-by-case and try to expedite these matters as soon as possible. I agree that some of them have been languishing in prison for a long time; we accept that. But, right now, those are going through the judicial process. As both the President and the Prime Minister said, we can take these up case-by-case and whoever who could be released would be released at that time.
