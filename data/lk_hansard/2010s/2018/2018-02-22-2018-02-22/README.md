asked the Minister of Industry and Commerce:

(a) Will he admit that -

(i) the Sevanagala Sugar Factory is very important in fulfilling the sugar requirement of Sri Lanka;

(ii) it has generated a large number of direct and indirect employment opportunities; and

(iii) farmers have taken to other cultivations without cultivating sugarcane in lands allocated to them in the area around the factory?

(b) Will he inform this House-

(i) the number of hectares allocated to farmers for the cultivation of sugarcane in the area around the Sevanagala Sugar Factory;

(ii) the number of hectares currently being used for sugarcane cultivation;

(iii) whether he admits that the expected output cannot be procured as farmers resort to other cultivations day by day; and

(iv) if so, the measures taken to procure greater output from this factory?

(c) If not, why?

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen)

(a) (i) Yes. Details are given in Annex I. Sir, I table* Annex I. * : : Annexes tabled:

Annex I

Sevanagala Sugar Factory plays a vital role in the supply of sugar requirement in Sri Lanka. Sevenagala institution has made significant contribution to the national economy by saving Rs. 4,698 million in the last five years. Details are given in the chart below.

6. The production contribution of Sevanagala Factory to total indigenous sugar production as a percentage.

26% 26% 27% 25% 27% 27%

(ii) Yes. Large numbers of direct and indirect job opportunities have been generated through the Sevenagala Sugar Factory and it is supported by the following facts:

The Sevenagala Sugar Factory is making a great contribution to the economy by providing livelihood to more than 3,900 farmers families and approximately 16,000 of their dependants. Direct job opportunities have been provided to more than 1,900 sugarcane harvesters and more than 200 transporters.

(iii) It cannot be accepted that the farmers cultivate other crops instead of sugarcane in the lands surrounding the factory.

The extent of lands allocated to the Sevanagala Sugar Factory for sugarcane cultivation is 4,100 hectares and the farmers are legally bound to plant sugarcane only in those lands. Although in the year 2011, about 2,000 hectares were in existence without being cultivated with sugarcane - 1,700 hectares for other types of crops and about 300 hectares as bare lands - the area for other crops and bare lands have been reduced to about 500 hectares by now. The total area of sugarcane-cultivated lands as at the end of 2017 is about 3,700 hectares.

According to the cycle of sugarcane cultivation, since land preparation is done in every five years, about 650 hectares of land are reprepared for replanting annually.

Also, some farmers adapted to follow crop rotation with the purpose of raising the qualitative harvest of sugarcane and the quality of the soil by rehabilitating it through removing the infertility of the soil. This is limited for a short period of time and farmers turn to cultivation of sugarcane soon. This takes place as a cycle.

b) (i) 4,100 hectares.

(ii) The number of hectares being used for sugarcane cultivation is 3,354 as at 31.07.2017.

(iii) Not agreed.

Our main production is sugar and it is confirmed through the volume of production for the past four years.

(iv) There are many measures that have been taken to procure greater output from this Factory. The details are given in Annex II. Sir, I table* Annex II.

Annex II

The measures that have been taken to procure greater output from this factory.

The grinding of sugarcane was started under the Government in 2012.

The following amounts were spent to purchase new parts to the machinery and for maintenance.

The amount paid to a sugarcane harvester for one ton of sugarcane is Rs. 1,500.

The price of a ton of sugarcane has been increased up to Rs. 5,000.

Incentives and financial benefits are provided every year based on the sugarcane supply by the farmers.

The transport expenses of sugarcane are borne by the company and not by employees.

A large sum of money is spent annually to repair rural roads and field roads.

Facilities provided to farmers for cultivation

Irrigation systems running to the fields have been repaired completely with the assistance of the Mahaweli Authority.

From clearance of land to preparation of plant beds are done by tractors and heavy machines of the institution at concessionary rates and charges are recovered in three years.

Preliminary fertilizers, first surface fertilizers, second surface fertilizers and herbicides and good quality nursery plants are also supplied on credit basis and recovered from the final payment.

Since sugarcane cultivation gives income once a year, an allowance of Rs. 3,500 is paid monthly to farmers who applied for it.

Irrigation methods have been successfully implemented in 400 hectares out of 2,200 hectares in highland which depend on rainwater and it is planned to implement the irrigation method in the remaining land.

Welfare for farmers

Rs. 24,000.00 is given to the children of sugarcane farmers who enter university for education and Rs. 2,250.00 is paid annually for the children who have passed the Grade Five Scholarship Exam up to Advanced Level.

Transport facilities have been provided to the children of sugarcane farmers to go to school.

An amount of Rs. 42,715,481.00 is in the welfare fund of the sugarcane farmers and 82 per cent out of this fund has been contributed by the institution.

Teams of good farmers are selected and given local and foreign training, sent to workshops and visits.

[12.44p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Speaker, sometimes intellectuals entering politics is very hazardous, but their contribution in assemblies and this is something that all of us appreciate.

695 696

Although they belong to some party or the other, their observations most of the time are bereft of politics; they speak of ideal political utopian systems.

The late Hon. Prof. W.A. Wiswa Warnapala was a towering intellectual who entered this House way back in 1994. I had the privilege of entering politics or entering this Parliament in the same year and we all benefited from such personalities who were professors. We had Prof. A.V. Suraweera along with Wiswa and also Prof. G.L. Peiris. Their contribution in the House in every Debate, if you can go back to the Hansard and look at what they have said, you will find that they are very worthy of reading. This is what my learned Friend, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane, said a while ago. Let me also give him my advanced wishes for getting his doctorate in a month's time. We are adding to the long list of intellectuals in the House another learned Colleague, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane, who himself has a string of students in the country, whom he has coached and taught Economics. So, we are benefited by the contributions of all these people.

The late Hon. Prof. Wiswa Warnapala was a multifaceted individual. He simply did not stick to his own political ideology. He studied the way in which Left politics impacted in the social reformation of our country and its national politics. We know, during the imperialist times, it was the labour movement that was virtually turned into political parties. Then, after Independence, we had the birth of Mahajana Eksath Paramuna originally and thereafter the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Everybody knew Prof. Wiswa Warnapala as a dedicated party man. Having entered the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in the mid 1960s, he had been a faithful of the party, who had gone through all the ups and downs of the partys fortunes in the national politics. But, he had the good fortune of entering Parliament in 1994, when President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga recognized his contribution both to the intellectual domain of this country as well as to the party itself and appointed him through the National List.

We have several of them who have written many books, manuals and articles, but when you look at Wiswas contribution, I do not think anybody else could claim that they are much better than he is, because he has written in such different, multifaceted areas.

Particularly, I observed his contribution in the Committee on Public Accounts of Parliament. As a Member and Chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts, he was somebody who had studied very deeply the oversight functions of Parliament and the need to improve the Parliamentary oversight of public finance. I believe, he, in fact, he even wrote a book on the role of Public Accounts Committee of Parliament and how things should be introduced to improve its oversight functions.

He also looked at the civil service in the country and wrote books on the improvement of civil service and its contribution to the administration of the country. He

contrasted our civil administration with that of the civil service during the imperialist times. He looked at it from a regional perspective and contrasted it with civil service in the rest of the regions. So, we had almost a birds-eye view of every subject when we read his writings, his books and his researches.

So, we have, in fact, in losing the Hon. (Prof.) Wiswa Warnapala, a big void in this House. His knowledge was such that he dealt with even personalities. I remember he once wrote about Dr. N.M. Perera, a towering left politician this country had produced, and his personality was studied in depth. He also looked at certain other revolutionary leaders as well. His contribution in looking at Udakendawela Siri Saranakara Himi was an assessment of his role in anti-imperialist struggle in Sri Lanka. He was looking at the imperialist struggle and the contribution of the Buddhist clergy in the country in order to raise the nationalist awareness. So, being part of the Left of Centre Politics, he looked at every different angle in which this country came to be impacted at different times: during the colonial times and during the post-Independence period and thereafter the way in which our different administrations embraced different ideologies.

We talked about capitalism, socialism and neoliberalism. Now, we are talking about the social market economy. This Government is now talking about social market economy. These are all variations of different ideologies, but to fit the times and the needs of the countrys economic policies. So, people of the Hon. (Prof.) Wiswa Warnapalas calibre were able to critically look at both good and the bad in the different systems and talk about the reality and the way in which the application of such ideologies impact on the social fabric and politics of the country.

I believe his loss is indeed a big void that have been created. In keeping with the faith that he adhered to and according to the Buddhist principles, I wish him Nivan Suwa! Also, I would convey my condolence to his family members.

Thank you.
