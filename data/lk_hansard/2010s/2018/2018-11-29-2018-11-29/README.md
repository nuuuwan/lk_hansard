II ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) 9.00 , 2018 30 10.30 . ? ( ) (Hon. Members) Aye! ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Then, this morning, I had a delegation led by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena who raised an issue about this matter, the Motion being sub judice. So, I have already explained my position on the matter, that especially the matter before the House today is not with regard to any Minister, State Minister or Deputy Minister, but with regard to the Secretary to the Prime Minister.

This House has already adopted Motions of No-confidence against the Government, and the adoption of such Resolution or Motion of No-confidence cannot be challenged or disputed in any other forum. The Motion before the House today is a matter which arises consequent to the adoption of the No-confidence Motion. What is sought to be debated today is not the matter under consideration by the Court of Appeal. As such, there is no impediment to this Motion being debated in the House.

In any event, the proceedings in the Court of Appeal are not in the nature of a trial before an original court and I am of the view that no real and substantial danger or prejudice would be caused to the outcome of those proceedings by this House debating this Motion.

In any case, there is no case pending relating to payment of expenses in the Prime Ministers Office. Therefore, I am also convinced, having consulted expert constitutional lawyers in the country, that this matter does not fall within the purview of Article 152 of the Constitution. Therefore, as such, I permit this Motion to be debated in the House today.

Anura Dissanayake) , , . , . . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) ,- ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , . ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , . [11.26 a.m.] ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Speaker, we listened to my Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, the learned President's

Counsel and a controversial Minister in this illegal Government. I must put certain things in the correct perspective, though I am not at cross-purposes with the purpose with which he made that speech. But, certain matters have to be put in the correct perspective to clear the doubts that may arise in the minds of the general public of this country.

Firstly, Sir, he being a leading lawyer in the country and a long-time Legislator in this House knows the concept of separation of powers and that the three important institutions of the State, namely the Executive, the Parliament and the Judiciary, have their own competencies. The need to have a careful balance between the competencies of all these three institutions is the paramount objective of all law-abiding citizens. The office bearers of these institutions, those who hold office, have to be mindful of the fact that each do not trespass on the competency of the other. If that does not happen, none of these problems could have arisen. So, this happened little realizing that the Nineteenth Amendment was meant to curtail the powers of the Executive President in a certain manner.

I also, in the meantime, put in the matter that arose out of the Hon. Anura Dissanayakes contention of the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe occupying the Temple Trees. We say the decision by the President to remove the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe is void ab initio and that matter is now before the Supreme Court through another petition that has been filed and is to be supported soon. Therefore, we cannot come to the conclusion that the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe is illegally occupying the Temple Trees. He has been one who had always respected the verdict of the people and very honorably left the Temple Trees when the verdict of the people was otherwise. Here, when the Executive President has unlawfully and unconstitutionally removed the Prime Minister, it is the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe's contention and our contention too that he can remain there as the legal occupant unless the court holds otherwise. And I would dare say that we would even be willing to replenish all the damages or whatever the cost that might incur out of wrongful occupation of the Temple Trees, if the court holds otherwise.

So, Sir, on the issue of one institution of the State trespassing the competency of the other, we are in a very grave situation today. This has to be rectified. I fully understand the purpose underlying the statement by the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. We appreciate that. It is up to you, Sir, whether to consider such a reconciliation and bring to conclusion this unnecessary confrontation. You are not the first Speaker who has had to face such a difficulty; several of your predecessors had to face similar problems. Particularly after the enactment of the 1978 Constitution, we have had several instances where this House and the Executive were at each others throat not knowing whose competency they were trampling upon.

Therefore, we can always reconcile these differences. But, the facts as to whether who unconstitutionally abused the powers that were sought to be conferred on them is a matter that we have to seek clarification from

317 318

2018 29

the Judiciary. There is no other place than the Supreme Court of this country for us to go to seek interpretation of the Constitution. So, we have had to seek the intervention of the Supreme Court since, in the long list of constitutional violations, His Excellency the President sought to dissolve Parliament and since we consider that dissolution once again void ab initio, we have challenged it in court and we had no other alternative. Therefore, that is not a matter for judicial purview of the House. Of course, courts exercise judicial power through Parliament. But, that does not mean that we can just fold our arms and wait when the Executive takes a decision to dissolve Parliament totally unlawfully and unconstitutionally. Therefore, our resort to judicial remedy was totally justified in those circumstances.

Quite apart from that, if there is a move to reconcile the differences, we can always try and sort them out. Since you are the custodian of our rights, Sir, you are fully within your rights to negotiate and bring this to an acceptable solution since it has a severe impact on the economy. There has been no Government for the last 30 days in this country. There has been an illegal Government put in place and the purported Government does not have the guts to face the people and in the pretext of boycotting this House, they are turning their backs on the people of this country. I consider the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa also as a great democrat and he himself knows through his own conscience what he is doing is wrong. These two people, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesignhe and the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, had been longstanding Hon. Members of this august Assembly since the 70s. Who came first and who came last is not the issue. But the fact is, both of them have had sufficient experience within the House to know the basic tenets of the law and the basic positions enunciated by the Constitution.

Therefore, Sir, putting those matters in the right perspective, I urge you to act according to your conscience in resolving this unnecessary confrontation that has arisen because of the illegal, unconstitutional actions that had been taken by certain bearers of constitutional office.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . , . [..11.36] ( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) , . ; . , .
