"This Parliament resolves to commemorate the 150th Birth Anniversary of the late Mahatma Gandhi, who spearheaded the Independence Movement of India through his non-violent campaign which was a forerunner of several similar movements throughout the world, particularly in South Asia including our own country."

Mahatma Gandhi is shared by all of us. Though he is known for leading the freedom struggle in India, his influence was such that it immediately influenced the countries around India, such as Sri Lanka. But then as his fame spread, it has today engulfed and covered the whole world, where non-violence and democratic movements of protests have taken over from violence and some of the biggest changes or revolutionary changes made in the last four - five decades has been due to the campaigns of Gandhi which were copied by people elsewhere.

Mahatma Gandhi, Hon. Speaker, is known as the icon of nonviolence. What did he preach? He preached first and foremost, Ahimsa or nonviolence - achieve your objective through nonviolence. The means of achieving an objective through nonviolence was Sathyagraha, the fight for truth and his objective for India was a Swaraj. That was the Mahatma Gandhi nonviolence; firstly, do not commit any violent act, refrain from violence. He stopped some of his mass campaigns when people resorted to violence. His force was Sathyagraha - the truth force. What did it mean? It meant mobilizing large numbers of people to whom truth was the objective and mobilizing a large number of people to indulge in non-violent activity and that non-violent activity was to be the change agent. Actually Gandhi utilized this means of non

1561 1562

-violence to achieve his main objective, "Swaraj". But for him "Swaraj" meant not merely political independence but also self-sufficiency of reviving the villages in India.

In the mid 20th Century when one world war was over and armaments not seen before were available; when large empires were created; when there were revolutions such as the Soviet Revolution, Gandhi used a simple weapon. What did he say? He said, "I can see that in the midst of death, life persists; in the midst of untruth, truth persist and in the midst of darkness, light persists." That was the confidence that he gave the people of India; the confidence which others copied from the people of India as they struggled to win their freedoms.

Gandhi, as I said, was the icon of non-violence but he was more than that. He was a political strategist who created non-violence and who enshrined non-violence as a means of achieving objectives.

His mentor in Indian politics was Gopal Krishna Gokhale. He was a mentor not only to Gandhi but he was copied by Jinnah; he was copied by F.R. Senanayake and the leaders of Sri Lanka. But Gopal Krishna Gokhale advocated his freedom struggle within the constitutional framework. Gandhi realized that to free India, they had to mobilize the masses and they had to use the legal framework as their tool. So what Gandhi actually did was to mobilize the people. Actually, I could call him, an extraordinary political strategist because he challenged the largest Empire of the world, not with the armies, not with the Royal Navy which is the largest fleet in the world, not with the Royal Air Force, but with the poor people of India through Satyagraha.

He declared Purna Swaraj on 26th of January, 1930 what is called the, Republic Day of India" and to prove it in a very simple act, a handful of people started walking to Dandi where they made salt in defiance of the British laws. By the time he reached his goals, there were 60,000 people marching with him. He went to the shores, he made salt and he gave himself up. He went voluntarily to prison followed by a large number of elite in India. Within villages, people found different ways to protest. They protested, Do not pay taxes; do not cooperate; leave your employment in the British Empire.

He took the British Empire on at one of its strongest points. That is its economy. Gandhi realized that the industrial revolution created the United Kingdom, because the United Kingdom was the first manufacturer of textiles and they started exporting textiles to their empires and that was a very easy measure that they could take. In our part of the world, the traditional dress was really the undress or people wore very little clothing. So, when the United Kingdom came along, it took over the colony and passed a law against "obscenity" or "indecent exposure" and then it was able to clad hundreds of millions of people. Twenty five per cent of the world was clad in British clothing. Gandhi did not ask his people to

go naked. He said, Wear your traditional dress, give up the British cloth, set fire to your British cloth, make your cloth in India and wear the clothes yourselves. He wore the traditional dress of peasants. Others preferred to wear the Indian national dress which they devised, but the main purpose was to deprive the British economy of one of its sources of income.

As people gave up British manufactured goods, that also affected the British economy. So, it became a political weapon; it became an economic weapon. At times, India became ungovernable and then there were roundtable conferences where Indians started making progress. Sometimes we wonder what would have happened if India like Sri Lanka had the Universal Franchise in 1931. As some of our leaders said, we received seven-tenths of what we wanted. But India had to go through a difficult time.

Mahatma Gandhi was a person who brought about change. Not only did he bring about change, but he was also overcome by change. The last phase of his life saw the World War II with fighting in the Far East and Asia. But, nevertheless, after the war was over, after the British Empire had won, they did not have the complete strength or the ability to control their Indian Empire. The consciousness that Gandhi had raised was such that the British had no option, but to give Independence to India. But, that independent India was away from Gandhis thinking of having one common unit; it came in two. It was accompanied by violence, which distressed Gandhi and Gandhis life was cut short by the same violence.

So, here we have a person whose influence was felt and has changed this part of the world. It was followed by Martin Luther King in the United States, whose ideals have also been followed in many other parts of the world. Mahatma Gandhi was a person without the Nobel Peace Prize. But, the "Peace Prize" he had given us is far bigger than the Nobel Peace Prize: "Ahimsa" - nonviolence - and "Sathyagraha". Those are the forces he left behind.

The India of today may not be the India that Gandhis ideals strove for. Modernization brings its own changes. So, all of Gandhis ideals could not be accommodated in a modern State. The other extreme was China. The Revolution of Mao Zedong is not what you find today in China. Those are vast countries, economies and India will become one of the greatest economies of the world. They say that the second largest economy will be India. A modern State is being built up.

Then, what is it that Gandhi had left us? Gandhism has imbued democracy and enshrined non-violence in democracy. You need not have revolutions like the French Revolution or the American War of Independence to insist on democracy. Today, Ghandhis ideals and democracy are interwoven and those democratic changes can be achieved by peaceful means. That is the lasting contribution that Mahatma Gandhi has made to democracy and the rule of law. But in a bigger sense, he had preached non-violence and that is much more relevant to the world today than even in his time.

So, Hon. Speaker, on behalf of the House, I would like to mark here the gratitude that the people of Sri Lanka have towards Mahatma Gandhi, when we commemorate the 150th Anniversary of his birth.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you, Hon. Prime Minister. Now, I call upon the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Rajavorathiam Sampanthan, to second the Motion. [1.45p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, it is with a great deal of humility, Sir, that I rise today to a say a few words on this Motion moved by the Hon. Prime Minister, commemorating the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, perhaps the noblest human being who traversed the earth in the past several centuries.

The country of his birth, India, was under foreign rule. He was convinced that the Indian people should receive Independence and rule themselves. He organized several movements to achieve this objective. One was the Non-Cooperation Movement. He took the view that if the Indian people refused to cooperate with the British rulers, the British would not be able to rule them. The objective of that Movement was to make the British rulers lose control of India. His was a non-violent movement based upon Ahimsa, Satyagraha - the truth and civil disobedience. An illustration of the Civil Disobedience Movement was the Salt Satyagraha - the Dandi March - designed to resist taxation and the British monopoly over salt. He convinced the people that power lay with them and that if they engaged in non-violent civil disobedience, they would emerge victorious and independent, that the British would wilt in the face of such resistance, and the British did wilt and realized that India could no longer be ruled against the will of the Indian people.

Then, there was the Quit India Movement. He called upon the British to quit India. He told the British in no uncertain terms that they had no business to be in India, that rule of India must be left in Indian hands. The Conservative Government under Winston Churchillattempted to resist his demand. But, the defeat of the Conservative Government and the election of the Labour Government in the mid 40s somewhat changed the British attitude and resulted in Round Table Conferences and negotiations that led to Independence of India.

Sir, before Mahatma Gandhi started his Satyagraha, his Civil Disobedience Movement based on Ahimsa in India, he was a young lawyer practising in South Africa.

As a young lawyer when he practised in South Africa, he led the Indian people and the South African people against apartheid. There was one incident that happened in South Africa which attracted the attention of the whole world. That was when Gandhi defied apartheid and travelled in a train compartment which had been reserved for the the Whites, defying White South African Rule, the result being that he was pulled out of the compartment and thrown on to the pavement.

I remember, Sir, listening to a speech made by President Barack Obama - the first Black Presidnet of USA - some years ago, shortly after he assumed Office as the President of the United States, at a Joint Session of the Indian Parliament - the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha - when President Barack Obama said, My journey to the White House commenced on the day Mahatma Gandhi was thrown out of that train in which he was seated in a compartment meant for Whites. That was the day on which my journey to the White House commenced. So, really, Sir, Mahatma Gandhis influence was not only in India, his influence was all over the world.

Mahatma Gandhi was a person who, I think, was largely responsible for many countries in Asia achieving Independence including Sri Lanka and we must all be grateful to this great son of India for the concept of non-violence -Ahimsa, Satyagraha- truth and civil disobedience, which he introduced into the thinking of the ordinary people as an instrument to fight injustice, inequality and subservience.

He also, Sir, united India; he unified India. India is a large country currently with a population of 1,000,200,000 people. There are both large States and small States in India. He preserved their identity. Every Indian, whether he is a Bengali, a Panjabi, a Telugu, a Malayali or a Tamil, first call himself an Indian. Mahatma Gandhi united them. Mahatma Gandhi unified India and made India one country which belonged to the Indian people in which the Indian people lived with self-respect. Their own identities, individual identities came thereafter.

He was responsible for ensuring, as the Prime Minister said, that there was every effort made not merely to achieve political independence but to bring about self-sufficiency for the people of India. I think Mahatma Gandhi played a big role in regard to that matter and he also played a big role in uniting India, keeping India together, not merely by recognizing linguistic identity and carving out States on the basis of linguistic identity but ensuring that its linguistic identity did not, in any way, surpass the Indian identity. By preserving the Indian identity, he ensured that all Indians, with their own languages, their own culture, their own civilization and their own history would be able to preserve their independence, their individuality and their identity in their own States. It was a great service that Mahatma Gandhi rendered to the Indian people.

I might mention, Sir, thinking of our own country and the situation in our own country, I have often thought that in 1977 when there was a UNP Government elected under President J.R. Jayewardene and we ourselves had come to

1563 1564

Parliament in large numbers from the North and the East of this country, we could have averted an armed struggle in this country if we had resorted to satyagraha, civil disobedience and ahimsa on the lines of what Gandhiji taught us.

In 1977, we, the Tamil Members of Parliament were elected very substantially to Parliament from the North and the East. We won all the Seats in the North and the East except one Seat which we lost by a few hundred votes. If we had launched a Satyagraha campaign against the Sri Lankan Government on the basis of ahimsa, on the basis of satyagrahaya - truth and civil disobedience - we could have averted an armed struggle and won our own self-rule in our areas without violence. I think, it was a mistake that we did not engage in such a course of action. It is my hope that we will never have violence in this country again, that we will abide by the teachings of Mahathma Gandhi. If the Government fails to deliver on its commitment to find an adequate solution to the national question, the Tamil people, instead of resorting to violence, will resort to satyagraha, will resort to ahimsa on the basis of truth, on the basis of civil disobedience to win their rights.

Sir, I thank the Hon. Prime Minister and the Government for introducing this Motion today in Parliament and giving us an opportunity of paying our respects, our highest regard to the late Mahathma Gandhi who not merely influenced the course of events in India but the course of events in the whole world.

I thank you Sir. [.. 1.56] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka - Minister of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms and Chief Government Whip) , .

When he was studying in the university in England, his professor was jealous of him because he was extremely brilliant and outstanding, and because of his high qualities, he attracted very many people of that university. So, this particular white-skinned English professor wanted to irritate, humiliate and penalize him. Once, he called Mahatma Gandhiji and said, Look here, you Indians are like horses in our country, which are of different colours. We find horses of different colours in our country. Likewise, Indians are of different colours; they have different-coloured skins. Then, the respectable Mahatma Gandhiji, in a very polite manner, replied him back and said, Of course, yes, Sir. I fully admit what you say because we Indians are of different colours like the horses in your country. Similarly, you white-skinned people, men of one colour, are like the monkeys in our country. All the monkeys in our country are of the same colour. There is no colour difference. So, you all are like the monkeys in our country. This polite reply made the professor humiliated, irritated and penalized. So, the professor thought that he made these utterances to a wrong person, who was Mahatma Gandhiji.

Thank you, Hon. Speaker. On the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi - Mahatma Gandhi - we are gathered here today to commemorate interesting facets of the iconic effervescent life of a philosopher, political activist and most of all, his colossal persona as a prophet of non-violence in the freedom struggle of India.

Personally I believe, Mr. Speaker, of his multi-spirited and multi-dimensional activism, every aspect remains relevant to the current world of politics. Of these what holds most immediate currency for the politics of the day is his unswerving potential of non-violence struggle for democratic self-rule and the constitutional process that he supported.

The Indian Constitution, needless to say, remains a historical document relevant globally even at this day and age, when thoughts are evolving on systems that look beyond nation States. Mr. Speaker, we all know that Mahatma Gandhi was not directly involved in the making of the Indian Constitution. But all his ideas were sufficiently reflected in the two plans that he submitted in 1946 and in 1948 - incidentally on the day of his assassination that was in 1948. A follower and enthusiast of Gandhi, Shriman Narayan Agrawal drafted the Volume, Gandhian Constitution for Free India. Mahatma Gandhi made a comment about it in a Foreword of this Volume published in 1946 where he says, The Constitution based on his writing is not inconsistent with what I would like to stand for. This draft was based on

1585 1586

[ ]

2018 12

the principle that violence leads to centralization. The essence of non-violence for him meant decentralization and devolution for the periphery.

In Mahatma Gandhis draft Constitution, the primary political unit would be the village Panchayat where the Panchayat Members would be elected by the village elders. Obviously, this was fraught with disapprovals and contestations at that time. However, these thoughts remain valid to date and demand serious consideration and deliberation even in Sri Lanka.

Mr. Speaker, his own thoughts of non-violence kept evolving to a point that in his latter days, he stopped using the word, non-violence. He says, My vocabulary on the subject is still in the process of formation. This was because of his thoughtfulness towards the minority languages and his sensitivities towards their understanding of this concept, especially when he had to address the Muslims of the North who were embroiled in the Khilafat Movement against the British. He also had to appease to them, then to the Hindus in Gujarat, the people of Panjab, the Sheikhs, then a mixed audience in Calcutta et cetera. He adopted the term non-cooperation instead of "non-violence" for want of a better word in vernacular translations to appease to all sentimentalities, to mobilize them to unite for a single course to take the Swadeshi vow to boycott foreign goods.

He praised the Muslims in his autobiography. I quote:

The Musalmans have adopted a very important resolution. If the peace terms are unfavourable to them, - which may God forbid, - they will stop all co-operation with Government. It is an inalienable right of the people thus to withhold co-operation. We are not bound to retain Government titles and honours, or to continue in Government service. If Government should betray us in a great cause like the Khilafat we could not do otherwise than non-co-operate. We are therefore entitled to non-co-operate with Government in case of a betrayal.

This is just an example evident of his all-encompassing power and belief in inclusivity, how he included the Muslims of the North to adopt his cause. Needless to say that his struggle for inclusivity against communal and religious discrimination, womens empowerment against marginalization of impoverished groups, rights of farmers and the trading communities and also the Indian merchants rights, their own internal struggles in a continuum are all mind-blowing. That, in itself, was an achievement that he rejoiced. The Mahatma, as you could see, had many internal victories to celebrate before he could ultimately win Independence.

He transformed Indian nationalism that evolved to inextricably intertwined integrities of equality, liberty, solidarity sans inconsequential politics and inclusive nationalism. That bulwark is gone, but the Mahatmas heroism lives on. Sir, as President Obama proclaimed recently, the Mahatma's heroism is not something just for India, but for the world. I quote the words of former President Obama:

in the life of Gandhiji and in his simple and profound lesson to be the change we seek in the world."

"As just as he summoned Indians to seek their destiny, he influenced champions of equality in my own country, including a young Martin Luther King.......

Hon. Speaker, we are indeed very pleased to be involved in this particular Debate to pay tribute to one of the greatest sons ever to set foot in this world and we pay him homage through this Debate.

Thank you. [.. 3.46]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees), ! [4.58p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for the opportunity to speak a few words at this historic occasion when this House commemorates the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. It is indeed a historic occasion for neighbouring Sri Lanka to recognize who Mahatma Gandhi was, his legacy, the impact, the imprint he left in the world and how much of that came to the benefit of our own country and I thank the Hon. Speaker and the Party Leaders for having decided to use this Session today in memory of Mahatma Gandhi.

We had His Excellency the President, the Hon. Prime Minister, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, all Party Leaders and senior Members of Parliament make speeches remembering Mahatma Gandhi.

Mohanlal Karamchand Gandhi was educated in the UK as a Barrister. He practiced his profession in South Africa, where seeing the oppression that the non-Whites were subjected to, became an activist and became conscious of the role that he could play in transforming society. In many of our visits to South Africa, we have our friends there who proudly say this time and again to anyone. They say to the Indians, "You sent us M. K. Gandhi, we sent back Mahatma Gandhi to you." They recognize that it was in South Africa, in the context of the oppression that the people of South Africa were subjected to, that Mahatma Gandhi truly became conscious of his own obligations in leading a freedom struggle.

He chose "non-violence" and I think that is the one word that can describe this great soul. It was nonviolence, he was non-violent and it was he who singularly demonstrated to the world forever that non-violence was a weapon that was far more lethal and stronger than violence itself. That is the impact that Mahatma Gandhi made. That is a legacy he has left behind. So, in all our contexts today when we remember him, it is impossible to remember him without the phrase, "non-violence". That is what described it more than anything else and that has relevance to us today.

We heard the Hon. Leader of the Opposition earlier this afternoon reminiscing on his and his Colleagues role in the 1977 Parliament, and in a very humble way, voicing his concern wondering aloud as to whether they made the mistake in 1977 of not embarking on a non-violent ahimsa satyagraha struggle to win the rights of the Tamil people. He wondered if he and his leaders then had done that, whether they could have averted the Tamil youth taking to arms. It is not just asking that question in a rhetorical form, I was deeply touched by that gesture of humble reminiscence.

His Excellency the President also referred to the many examples that Mahatma Gandhi has left behind and reminded us of a fact that we all know, a fact that we have all seen - that he has the picture of Mahatma Gandhi in his residence. The first time when I visited His Excellency Maithripala Sirisenas residence, that was something that struck me, that Mahatma Gandhis picture was on the wall. It is that kind of influence that this great soul has imparted. For us, today in this country, as we remember Mahatma Gandhi, we cannot, but escape, look at our own selves, look at our country, look at where we are in reference to non-violence and political freedom.

We have been taught non-violence. We saw it from close quarters. As Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah just spoke, we even had Mahatma come to our shores, to Jaffna. We saw him in flesh, and yet we do not seem to have fully appreciated the hard non-violence stand that he took in pursuing political freedom for his own people. I do not say this in a way that points fingers at anybody else, but in retrospect, in looking back at our own selves as to whether we should have strictly adhered to the path of non-violence enunciated by Mahatma Gandhi.

As was mentioned by Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah, there are many instances where he stopped his struggle of

1605 1606

[ . ]

2018 12

a programme that he had initiated when violence broke out. He did not ever want violence to mar his pure struggle based on non-violence. Even if he was not responsible for it, even if others had moved on to violent activities, he stopped the struggle. Not only that, every time when violence broke out between communities in India, between his own people, he went on a fast. He punished himself when his own people fought against each other; when they used violence each against other. And I think in all instances it paid dividends: they stopped the violence.

Particularly, during the most difficult period India has gone through during the partition of India, he travelled thousands of miles. Once he had to undertake a fast in Calcutta and in many other parts just to stop the violence amongst his own people. He used non-violence and satyagraha as a pure means to achieve something good, something that was just to free people.

It is indeed impossible not to reflect on the fact that some of our own brethren have undertaken a fast as we commemorate Mahatma Gandhi today in this House. Several prisoners detained under the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act have been fasting demanding justice for themselves for the long years of incarceration that they had been subjected to under this oppressive law which this Government has recognized as oppressive. Just earlier this week a Bill was placed on the Order Paper, which amongst other things is to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and to remove the most obnoxious provisions in the Prevention of Terrorism Act and that of the admissibility of confessions. In most of the cases under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the only evidence is a supposed confession made by the accused person to a police officer.

Today, as we commemorate the 150th of Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, as we remember the stand that he took, the means that he used of satyagraha, and as the two Leaders of this Government have spoken volumes today of the life of Mahatma Gandhi, it is our appeal to the Government to turn their faces and look at these persons who are fasting for several days now asking only for justice to be done in their case.

So, as I wind up I leave this thought with the Government. I am glad that at least one Cabinet Minister is present and I believe he will take the message, that of a cry of people who have been denied justice, who have come to the end of their tether, have resorted to the very weapon that Mahatma Gandhi used. At least on this day, when we remember and speak of that great soul, I appeal to the Government to release those persons.

Thank you Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. [.. 5.13]
