JUDICATURE (AMENDMENT) BILL: DETERMINATION OF THE

SUPREME COURT ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I wish to announce the Determination of the Supreme Court on the Bill titled, Judicature (Amendment) in respect of which petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution.

The Supreme Court has determined that Section 12A(1) of the Bill is inconsistent with Article 154P(3)(a) of the Constitution and an amendment is required to be made to the Constitution to give effect to Section 12A(1) of the Bill. This requires the Bill to be passed by a two-thirds majority. However, if the jurisdiction is conferred on the High Court of Provinces under Article 154(P)(3)(C), like in Act, No. 10 of 1996 and Act, No. 54 of 2006, this amending Section will cease to be inconsistent.

The amending Section 12A(2) of the Bill requires the Judicial Service Commission to nominate judges to the Permanent High Court at Bar. This is inconsistent with Article 154(P)2 of the Constitution and an amendment is required to be made to the Constitution to give effect to Section 12A(2) of the Bill which requires a two-thirds majority. However, if 12A(2) of the Bill is removed

and Article 154P(2) remains as it is, this inconsistency will cease.

The amending Section 12(A)(7) is inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution. However, if the Chief Justice is given the power to decide whether to hold a trial at bar or not, this amending Section will cease to be inconsistent.

I order that the Determination of the Supreme Court be printed in the Official Report of todays Proceedings.

I read this in English because the Determination was given in English.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama - Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade) Hon. Speaker, I answer the Question as follows:

Table 2 - FDIs including loans taken by the investors and FDIs received without loans from 2005 to 2017.

(v) Mainly due to global economic conditions

at that time and perhaps, because there was a minority Government. So, they would have been waiting to see what the policies are like. But in 2017, we had the highest ever FDIs recorded in the history of our country, which were US Dollars 1.7 billion from the BOI companies and US Dollars 200 million.from non-BOI companies. So, in total. it was about US Dollars 1.9 billion.

asked the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs:

(a) Is he aware that -

(i) in the Kallaru village belonging to the Kandawalai Divisional Secretary's Division of the Kilinochchi District, a total of 243 houses comprising of 143 permanent houses built for those affected by the tsunami and 100 houses built for resettled families under various housing schemes have been constructed;

(ii) only 186 houses out of the above-mentioned houses are occupied at present and that no one is occupying the remaining 57 houses; and

(iii) the people who are currently residing in the above village are faced with grave difficulties due to the lack of drinking water, decent transportation facilities and road repair activities;

(b) Will he inform this House -

(i) whether steps will be taken to develop the infrastructure facilities of the aforesaid village;

(ii) if so, of the date on which it will be done; and

1101 1102

(iii) whether action will be taken to offer the above-mentioned unoccupied houses to families which do not have a house?

(c) If not, why?

.. ( ) ( .. - , , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Sir, I table* the Answer for that Question. * : * : * Answer tabled:

(a) (i) 143 houses were given under the tsunami housing scheme and 100 houses were given under the financial assistance of the European Union for resettled families in Kallaru village belonging to the Kandamalai Divisional Secretary's Division of the Kilinochchi District.

(ii) Housing scheme was given in Kallaru area in 2005 to those who were affected by tsunami while living in coastal areas after displaced from Jaffna District. When houses were granted in 2010 to resettle the families who have been displaced in 2009, some families resettled in Jaffna District where they were originally residing and some families migrated to other areas due to unavailability of sufficient infrastructure facilities, lack of drinking water and due to their private necessities. Therefore, 56 houses are remaining vacant.

(iii) 01. Drinking Water Problem:-

In the year 2014, UN-Habitat organization with the financial assistance of Coca-Cola Company constructed rainwater harvest tanks for 125 families residing in this village.

Karachchi Divisional Secretariat initiated the construction of a drinking water scheme costing Rs. 5.14 million under the financial allocations of Northern Provincial Council and its constructions are on the final stage by now. Once this scheme is completed, drinking water could be supplied to this village without any obstruction.

As a temporary solution, drinking water is supplied through Divisional Secretariat during drought seasons.

02. Transport Services:-

Private transport services are being continued between Kallaru village and Kilinochchi Town.

03. Road Repair Activities:-

Three damaged major bridges and two damaged culverts in Pulliampokkanai - Kallaru Road, one of the main roads which lead to this village were renovated in year 2015 by the UN-Habitat organization.

Damaged culverts in Chundikulam - Kallaru Main Road were renovated in the year 2016 under rural infrastructure facilities development programme for Rs. 1 million.

1 km length of Chundikulam - Peyiparayipitti Main Road was renovated with metal and tar. The rest is temporarily maintained with soil up to Kallaru village by the Department of Road Development. A major bridge has also been constructed. Currently, 5 km of

the Chundikulam-Peyiparayipitti Main Road has been selected to be renovated under combined road development investment project.

(b) (i) and (ii) No financial provision is available in our Ministry in 2018 to provide infrastructure facilities. If allocation is received, steps will be taken to provide infrastructure facilities to this village.

(iii) Steps have already been taken to inform the owners of the unoccupied houses through Grama Niladhari to settle back in those houses and arrangement was made to provide deeds for the families who have already been granted houses. If owners of unoccupied houses are not responding, action will be taken to provide these houses to the families which do not have houses after due notice in writing and published in newspapers.

(c) Not relevant.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) No, it is only if the interest is over Rs. 1.5 million. [Interruption.] 1.5 : : :? [ ] . : . , .

. , the misconception that the "Capital Gains Tax is at 10 per cent on the sale price" is also not true. This tax is applicable on the gain derived from the sale of an extra land or house and the sale price is seen as the cost. Cost is equal to market value as at 30th of September, 2017 in spite the property was acquired years ago. Gifts exempt is, in any number of gifts, land or houses to a blood relation, one house is exempted. Assume a land acquired 30 years back for Rs. 50,000, sold for Rs. 1 million on 30th April, 2018 and the market value of that land as at 30th September, 2017 is Rs. 900,000, the Capital Gains Tax on that will only be Rs. 10,000. That is very reasonable.

"Sale of a vehicle is subject to Capital Gains Tax" is again an absolute lie. Capital Gains Tax is only applicable on the capital gains from lands, buildings and security.

. , "tax on employment income is excessively taxed" is also not true. Actually, those who received a monthly salary of Rs. 100,000 prior to the 4th of April this year were already taxed Rs. 1,500. , : . . 8 ,000 . . 8,500 : . Sir, how much time do I have?

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Your actual time ends up by 2.15 p.m. Obviously, if you need more time, the Leader of the House can give.

0 ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Minister, can have more time, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Okay. In fact, as I said earlier, the Governments tax policy has focused on some key principles and objectives:

(i) Increasing the share of government revenue which had declined to 11.6 per cent of GDP by 2014. This would enable us to better meet our debt repayments without compromising government expenditure on health, education and so on.

(ii) Achieve this revenue increase by increasing the share of Direct Taxes from 18 to 40 per cent to create a more progressive tax structure. Broaden the tax base to bring in the informal economy into the formal sector. This would create a level playing field by ensuring that everyone complies and shares the burden of taxes.

(iii) Reduce discretion in tax policy and shift to a simple, transparent, rules-based framework. In future, the Minister will not be able to change the rules and regulations according to the whims and fancies of those in power. This is required to minimize potential corruption and reduce tax leakages due to ad hoc exemptions.

The new Inland Revenue Act goes a long way towards achieving all of these objectives.

Sri Lanka has a highly regressive tax structure with 82 per cent of tax revenue being indirect taxes and only 18 per cent being direct taxes. Indirect taxes such as VAT, NBT, Customs Duty, PAL et cetera are paid by all citizens regardless of income levels. Therefore, a citizen who earns Rs. 20,000 a month will pay the same tax on a packet of milk powder as someone earning Rs. 200,000 per month. This is a highly inequitable outcome.

In order to correct this imbalance Sri Lanka must shift its tax structure towards more direct taxes such as Income Tax, Withholding Tax, Dividend Taxes and so on.

By enhancing income tax collection, we can ensure that the burden of taxes falls more to those who have greater income levels, and who can afford to pay.

The burden of tax payment has so far shifted to the poor with ever-increasing indirect taxes.

The primary objective of the Inland Revenue Act is to shift this unjust tax burden to a more equitable balance between direct and indirect taxes.

A major objective of the Inland Revenue Act is to increase tax collection by rationalizing tax exemptions and closing out tax loopholes. Sri Lankas biggest problem is not the tax rates, but the lack of tax compliance.

Therefore, even with the new personal income tax regime, the highest tax bracket is 24 per cent, which is a lot lower than peer countries.

For example, in Bangladesh, it is 30 per cent. In Brazil, it is 27.5 per cent. Our neighbour India charges 35

1113 1114

per cent. Malaysia charges 28 per cent. Vietnam charges 35 per cent. So, as you see, our tax bracket - the one introduced- is one of the lowest in the region and in the world.

Furthermore, under the new Inland Revenue Act, all SMEs get taxed at a lower rate of just 14 per cent Corporate Income Tax.

Companies predominantly engaged in businesses such as exports, tourism, IT, agriculture, education, are all taxed at a rate of 14 per cent. This is significantly lower than again the regional averages.

Employment Income Tax has a tax-free threshold of Rs. 100,000 per month. Thus, only those earning above that are subject to any income tax at all.

At income levels above Rs. 100,000 per month, the tax is at brackets of 4 per cent for every additional Rs. 50,000 per month up to a maximum of 24 per cent.

Therefore, an individual earning of Rs. 150,000 per month, will pay income tax of approximately Rs. 2,000. 8 ,000 0,000 :. This equates to just over 1 per cent of his or her total monthly earnings.

What the Inland Revenue Act does achieve is, it closes out loopholes. Previously, the corporates could avoid paying tax through various allowances such as vehicle allowance, entertainment allowance et cetera, which usually accrued to high income earning senior management. Such allowances are now captured as income and are subject to tax.

Another important source of direct income tax is the Withholding Tax. Before this Government came into power, the Withholding Tax - WHT - rate on interest income on bank deposits was up to 8 per cent. : . Due to low interest rates prevailing at the time in 2015, the Government as a concessionary measure reduced the Withholding Tax to 2.5 per cent and now this has been increased to 5 per cent as per the new Inland Revenue Act. : , .

Therefore, for a deposit of Rs. 1 million earning interest of 12 per cent per annum, the monthly interest income is Rs. 120,000 and the tax would be just Rs. 6,000. To provide context, the interest rate on an average fixed deposit in 2015 was 6.9 per cent. Today, that rate is 11.5 per cent. Therefore, interest income is a lot higher at present. : fixed deposits . . : : interest income .

For senior citizens, as I mentioned before, a special concession is provided where the first Rs. 1.5 million per annum is exempt from WHT.

The WHT in the new Inland Revenue Act does apply to investment income derived from foreign currency assets. Previously, this was exempt since Sri Lankas Balance of Payments was weak and reserves were poor. Today, the external sector is strong and the new Foreign Exchange Act has made meaningful liberalization in capital markets which will enable Sri Lanka to continue to attract foreign currency inflows which allows a Withholding Tax of 5 per cent creating equal treatment to local currency deposits.

A popular misconception, Hon. Speaker, is that the Inland Revenue Act has removed all investment incentives. This is totally incorrect. The Inland Revenue Act has done away with untargeted, open-ended tax holidays that have previously been handed out without a proper basis, causing significant erosion of the tax base and creating room for corruption.

According to the 2016 Tax Expenditure Statement, the cost of income tax exemption alone in the past era was 0.6 per cent of GDP.

The Inland Revenue Act provides targeted tax relief based directly on the level of investment. Accordingly, for every capital investment above US Dollars 3 million, there is an additional 100 per cent capital allowance provided. This means the investor can set off his or her investment amount against future taxation in effect allowing him or her to have tax relief until the investment is recovered.

This targeted tax relief is attractive for genuine investors who believe in investing in the future of Sri Lanka. As a Government, we will do our utmost to minimize upfront costs of investment, but once an investment is successful and profitable, we expect a fair contribution to society through taxes.

For investments above US Dollars 100 million, the benefits are even higher with 150 per cent capital allowance and there is also a capital allowance provided for investments below US Dollars 3 million as per Schedule 6 of the Inland Revenue Act. And also, for the North, they will be getting a 200 per cent capital in allowance as an incentive to repair and rebuild the war-torn North.

I have a few more things to say, Hon. Speaker. I would like to table the rest of my speech because there are other speakers and I do not want to take more time. Therefore, I table* the rest of my speech and request you to include that in the Hansard.

I thank you for the time given. : :: Rest of the speech tabled:

A special allowance is made for investments that do not have a major capital component, particularly the IT sector, which gets an additional deduction for their investment in employment creation.

There is also a 100 per cent additional deduction allowed for investments in R and D.

Common Misperceptions

Will remittances be subject to tax?

No. The status quo remains and remittances will not be taxed.

Investment income from foreign currency bank accounts will however be subject to the 5 per cent WHT - creating equal treatment as local currency deposits.

Will EPF be subject to tax?

No. status quo remains.

The Inland Revenue Act and the IMF

When Sri Lanka commenced its most recent EFF agreement with the IMF, our economy was in a very difficult position due to both external and domestic factors.

Looming external debt repayments accumulated during the previous regime, combined with a tightening of global capital markets, contributed to this challenging environment.

Global market confidence in Sri Lankas ability to meet these debt repayments was veining. It was in this context that Sri Lanka entered an EFF agreement with the IMF.

This provided immediate confidence to global markets that Sri Lanka was on a credible reform track - international borrowing costs declined and we have seen the stabilization of the economy.

With the IMF, it is not the quantum of the loan that is important to Sri Lanka - but the signal it provides to the world that Sri Lanka is on the right path. This enables the market stability that is needed to attract investment, support exports and manage debt.

The principles that are adhered to in the EFF include fiscal discipline, rule-based tax and expenditure policy, transparent public reporting of fiscal outcomes. These are principles that have merit regardless of whether we are in an agreement with the IMF or not.

At the end of the day the IMF can only provide advice and technical assistance to the Government of Sri Lanka. It is up to us the extent to which we implement the advice.

The IMF for instance provided technical assistance in the development of the Inland Revenue Act - sharing global best practices in principles of taxation. But it was developed and created by our own officials and experts tailored to Sri Lankas own development objectives and circumstances.

In fact, since I took over as the Minister of Finance, we made more than 200 amendments to the then Inland Revenue Bill in order to reflect the views of broader stakeholders and the Governments economic policy objectives.

During this near two-year period with the IMF, the economy has made important gains.

Government finances had its first primary surplus in decades.

Exports and FDI hit record levels in 2017.

Foreign reserves have reached comfortable levels of US Dollars 7.9 billion.

National inflation in February, 2018 was down to 3.2 per cent with monthly prices declining in January and February.

The results of this stabilization have not yet translated into GDP growth because of the climatic disruptions we have faced. I am

confident that the benefits of the policy measures we have put in place will materialize in the near term.

Let us also remind ourselves that we have made these gains in macroeconomic stabilization whilst ensuring continued focus on Government expenditure and improving the quality of that expenditure. The Governments expenditure on education, higher education and skills developments has increased from 1.9 per cent in 2014 to 2.4 per cent in 2017. Similarly expenditure on public health has increased from 1.39 per cent in 2014 to 1.74 per cent in 2017. We will continue to invest in our people and invest in our future.

A premature interruption of the fiscal consolidation process will destabilize the economy and erase the gains that have been made. Whilst being committed to fiscal consolidation, the Government has always found room to ease taxes on essential items to ensure public welfare. When the drought resulted in an increase in food prices last year, we reduced taxes on a number of food and related items to provide relief to the public.

Whilst these tax relief measures have hurt over revenue performance - these are necessary measures to ensure public welfare, particularly at a time of drought. Once the impact of the Inland Revenue Act materializes, we will be able to gradually reduce rates on indirect taxes such as VAT, Customs duties and so on. . . Question proposed. ( ) (The Hon.
