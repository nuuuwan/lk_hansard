Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, with this Excise (Amendment) Bill, Section 15 of the Excise Ordinance (Chapter 52) is amended by the repeal of paragraphs (b) and (c) of that section, and the substitution therefor of the following, I quote:

" '(b) no tree producing toddy, other than kithul tree shall be tapped;

(c) no toddy shall be drawn or lowered from any tree other than the kithul tree.' "

Sir, I humbly tell you that this amendment is wrong. We have to make some amendments to Clause 2 of the Bill. Therefore, I request you to insert the words "palmyrah tree and coconut tree, immediately after the words kithul tree in Clause 2 (b) and 2 (c).

I have already submitted my amendment to the Table Office.

Hon. Minister, last year you increased the tax from Rs. 200,000 to Rs. 1 million for toddy production. I tell you that you can do it for the companies functioning around Colombo or in big towns. This is not suitable for the cooperative societies which depend on toddy tapping from palmyrah and coconut trees. They are poor people. Please consider this and divide the tax imposed into two. Natural toddy tapping cooperative societies should be given an exemption for their production. You are correct, Hon. State Minister, you can impose Rs. 1 million tax from the companies which import spirits from other countries and make artificial toddy here. I am not opposing that. I am requesting you only to exempt the natural toddy tapping from this tax.

Secondly, you have mentioned only kithul tree in the Excise (Amendment) Bill. Therefore, I kindly request you to include palmyrah tree" and "coconut tree along with "kithul". Thank you very much.

Sir, the Hon. Minister and the Hon. Deputy Minister are here and I thank the Hon. Minister for taking this matter up immediately for discussion to find some remedy to the problems of the Tamil palmyrah toddy tappers in the Northern area. The Hon. Minister and the Hon. Deputy Minister immediately discussed the matter with me and asked me to take up the matter with the Secretaries, to explain it to them. Also, he contacted the Hon. Minister of Finance and Mass Media, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera and explained the situation and asked him to find a remedy. Then, he informed us that they would take up the matter and find a remedy.

Even last December, immediately after this Bill was gazetted, we, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran and myself, contacted the Hon. Minister of Finance and Mass Media, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, and informed him that it was a very discriminatory Bill against the Tamil toddy tappers in the North and the East. We pointed out that for finding a remedy or to allow them also to enjoy the same tax-free status, an amendment should be included. This morning, the Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan, during the course of his speech, submitted an amendment to this Bill. I also supported that. I request the Hon. State Minister of Finance to amend the Bill by including the following words to avoid this discrimination against the palmyrah toddy tappers in the North - immediately after the word kithul tree in Sections 2(b) and 2(c), also insert the words palmyrah tree and coconut tree.

Treating the Tamil toddy tappers in the northern area and the toddy tappers in other areas as equal citizens of this country is very important. I request the Hon. Minister - the Hon. Deputy Minister is also agreeable - to get the word of the Hon. Minister of Finance and Mass Media to reduce the taxes on bottling and selling of toddy. I think there is consensus not to remove the tax totally, but to reduce it. The State Minister is here. We request you to include the words, palmyrah tree and coconut tree, immediately after the word, kithul tree.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) If I might just respond to the suggestions that have been made, really, the kithul tree has been included as the exception. It has nothing to do with any geography. It is for the fact that it is not an item that is being bottled, distilled or in the tavern. That is the basis on which it had been included. All the others, including palmyrah, were included not because we are trying to curtail in any way the industry; it was done in the interest of regulating the industry. Because, in 2002 - 2004 period, according to a WHO study, Sri Lankas pure alcohol consumption was about 2.2 litres per individual, which, today, is more than double - 4.5 litres. So, it is only a regulation to make sure that that is accounted for. The illicit liquor industry has also grown in this country quite rapidly. It is just to make sure that there is a control and illicit liquor is not growing.

Hon. Member, can you give me another two minutes to say something?

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Thank you. I would also like to say that there is absolutely no intention of discriminating against any part of the industry - everybody is being treated equally. For example, when we give tavern licences we have a tender system in any part of the country and it goes at a price. It is only in the North we do not have a tender system, because largely the cooperative societies are involved in this industry. We have taken that into account.

Then, on the distilleries we impose a licensing fee of Rs. 1 million. But again in the North, for the reasons that I have already said, like the cooperatives are also involved in it, the licensing fee there is only Rs. 250,000.00. Then, as regards raw materials - for coconut we have imposed Rs. 5.00 as a raw material tax and we have imposed Rs. 10 per kilogram as a tax for molasses, fruit and maize. But, for palmyrah, wherever - maybe in the North or maybe elsewhere - we have not imposed a tax. We are very conscious of the fact that the Northern Peninsula is emerging after a conflict. We are giving this space so that the industries in the peninsula and in all the Northern districts could actually recover. Even if you

369 370

take a tavern, at the end of the day the residue in the tavern normally has to be destroyed in the rest of the country, but we allow in the Northern Peninsula the residue to be taken either for a distillery or for a bottling plant.

The other request that came in the Debate today was to reconsider the cost of the toddy bottling licensing. We will consider that and we will reduce it, particularly for palmyrah. I am giving you that undertaking now.

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Thank you very much. However, after the amendments we will see how it will be helpful to the palmyrah toddy tappers.

[.. 5.06] ( ) ( - ) The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne - State Minister of Finance) . . . Today, before this Adjournment Motion was taken up, we were talking about some of the amendments and changes that we brought about on this industry.

Now, I think there is a misunderstanding on what the Government is actually doing and the intention of bringing the changes - particularly the previous speaker also alluded to it. Sir, I want to make those absolutely clear because I think we should not go on with the wrong intentions. The Governments primary objective is actually to reduce the consumption of alcohol. When you look at that, on the one hand, you have the intention to reduce the consumption of alcohol and on the other, you have the intention to protect the local industries. Like in most things, sometimes, there is a conflict between the manufacturer and the consumer. The manufacturer has certain objectives - making profits is an objective - and the consumer wants it at the cheapest price and the product to be of the highest quality. So, that kind of conflict is there. But, we are also very clear, that we want to reduce the consumption of alcohol.

So, taxation is used only as one method. But, I must make it very clear that todays discussion had nothing to do with taxation, per se but with regulation. So, the intention was to find out how you actually regulate this. Going back to the 2002 - 2003 period, we know that the consumption of pure alcohol in the country was about 2.2 litres per individual. It has climbed up to about 4.5 litres per individual in Sri Lanka by 2017. So, there has been a rise in the consumption of pure alcohol. That is the recorded part of alcohol consumption. Along with that, the unrecorded or the illicit consumption of alcohol has also rapidly increased during this period. So, the intention to regulate it comes when you see a development like that. Therefore, the intention is only to regulate it, so that you know the people who actually tap any tree, the sap of which they can subsequently convert into some form of alcohol, soft liquor or hard liquor, and will be able to monitor it. That is the intention of this. The kithul tree was exempted only because the kithul sap is not, in that

sense, distilled and sold in a tavern or bottled. That is the reason. Also, I must make it very clear that there was no intention of actually looking at the regions of the country where those trees are grown when that distinction was made.

Now, from palmyrah also, you have certain products that come out which are consumed at the table in a house. But, if you look at the percentage of that consumption, actually, it is relatively small compared to the percentage that goes from palmyrah basically into the liquor industry or the toddy industry.

I also want to make it clear, I made this clear earlier in the Debate, but I would say it again because there has been some misunderstanding from the various discussions that just happened prior to me getting up to make a reply. We are very conscious of the fact that the Northern part of the country, particularly the Districts of Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, Jaffna, Mannar and Kilinochchi are emerging from a conflict situation. The rest of the country is also emerging from a conflict, but these districts, in particular, were severely affected. So, we are very conscious of the fact that the industry must be protected and then the industry must be built, so that eventually those industries also could compete without protection. That is why recently when the Inland Revenue Bill - which is a law-based system - was introduced in Parliament, we made sure that the discretionary concessions were removed so that the rules are clear and nobody can come and sit outside the room of the Finance Minister or the Deputy Finance Minister looking for concessions. So, when that Bill was made, we took away discretionary concessions, particularly tax exemptions, but, we introduced something called a "capital allowance as an incentive to invest. People invest money and then they make profits out of it. But, as far as the capital allowance is concerned, if you have invested up to US Dollars 100 million or some amount like that, then you can basically set off all your profits up to the investment over a period of time. If the investment is bigger, you are given a longer period of time. Now, that was what was set in the Inland Revenue Bill. When it came to the Northern area of the country, we really doubled that. Instead of 100 per cent, we have made it 200 per cent if an investment goes to the North. The reason is, the North is emerging from a conflict situation and, therefore, there are barriers for investors to come and till those barriers gradually disappear, we are giving them this capital allowance. Another way you can look at is, it is a tax allowance so that more investment will go into the Northern part of the country.

Now, even in this industry, of which I am not very familiar with personally, you have taverns. In the other parts of the country, when the licences are given for taverns, we have a tender system and it goes on the tender auction. I am told by the officials here that a single licence go around Rs. 50 - 60 lakhs or Rs. 5 - 6 million at the tender auction. But, for the North, we do not have a tender system because we are conscious of the fact that the cooperative societies are involved in the manufacturing processes and the industry. When it comes to distilleries also, basically, there is a distinction. Usually, the licensing fee for other areas is Rs. 1 million,

but in that area, we have reduced it to Rs. 250,000 because of the cooperative system in those areas. I noted that somebody had applied for a licence and paid the full amount of money, but the licence had not been issued. If you pass on the specifics of that, we will take note and follow it up. We will find out what happened and make sure that it is expedited or if there is actually a problem, we will also convey that problem to you.

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Hon. State Minister, the aim of this Adjournment Motion is to get permission for the toddy tappers to sell the toddy before 11.00 o clock. That is, they seek permission to sell toddy to the co-operative societies from 9.00 o clock.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I fully understand that and I am coming to that.

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) My request is to permit them to sell toddy from 9.00 o clock.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I am coming to that and I am going to be closing with that. The reason that I have been repeating this in the Adjournment Debate is this. Our senior Member was here on the front row - some of the other Members were not there - when I corrected some points. I could see that there was a misunderstanding when the Debate was going, that there appeared to be a wrongful idea that the Government had acted, maybe with the wrong intention, and I was just trying to correct that. That was the only reason.

I was also saying at that time, when raw materials are used, if it is coconut, molasses or maize or fruit, for coconut, we have Rs. 5 tax per litre, and for molasses, fruit and maize, we have Rs. 10 tax per kilogram, but, we do not have a tax for palmyrah. We have done that intentionally as well. When it comes to taverns, when you have the toddy at the end of the day, that toddy has to be got rid of. But we allow, in the Northern part of the country, that residue at the end of the day to be sent to a distillery or to a bottling plant.

Then, there was another request and I have already conceded that. Toddy bottling licence fee, we will reduce that for palmyrah only. It is Rs. 1 million for everything. We will have another Gazette shortly, hopefully before the new tax year, and we will be reducing that as well. Though it would be Rs. 1 million for the rest of the country, we will bring that down for palmyrah taking into account the industry in the North. We see that the industry in the North needs to be protected. At the same time, from the discussions we have heard also, we want to see a drop in the consumption of alcohol.

389 390

I would like to say this as well. In one of the speeches, there was a concern that maybe some liquors or illicit liquors are going from the South to the North.

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Artificial toddies are going.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Yes, artificial toddies are going. I would just make this comment only. Hon. Member, the comment I would make is that we must allow the free movement of people and the free movement of goods all over this country. But, if there is something illegal happening and if there is an illegal transportation of something, I will certainly take the point and, if we have the information on that, we will certainly clamp down on it because we must make sure that the law is being upheld. If that information can be provided, we will certainly look into it.

On the licensing-

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Hon. State Minister, in the North, because of the palmyrah industry, sufficient toddy is there for drinking. What they are asking is to allow them to hand over the tapped toddy before it is fermented, before 11.00 o clock, to the co-operative societies. If toddy tapped around 8.00 o clock is kept for a three-hour period, till 11.00 o clock, that toddy will get fermented. To avoid that only they seek permission to sell that before 9.00 o clock.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) As you know, the Schedule that was put forward by the Minister on 18th January, 2018 has basically 17 categories of different kinds of places at which alcohol of different kinds are consumed and they have different times. I agree with the Hon. Members who just said that particularly for some of the liquors and some of those look like foreign liquors, longer periods of time are allowed; that is from 8.00 a.m. to 8.00 p.m. and 9.00 a.m. to 9.00 p.m. and for the local liquors, there are shorter periods of time. This has been there decades and decades ago and it is still there. I heard the concerns and they are practical issues, because there is a three-hour gap between the morning session and the afternoon session. So, the suggestion is to see whether they can keep that gap away and have one continuous session, so that those who are manufacturing, will not incure a loss due to those things being going bad.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Member, as I said, I am not a specialist in this field, for sure. But I understood the problem. Unfortunately, the Hon. Minister of Finance is not present today. That is why I cannot give you a definite answer. But I will certainly refer this to him immediately and we will see to your practical issue and consider it. The Hon. Minister of Finance himself, I think, will convey that to you after looking into it whether this time limit could be expanded to overcome this problem. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you. .
