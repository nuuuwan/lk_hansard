China does not have a high potential to supply graphite to the world market. The highest quality that is available in the world market is from Sri Lanka. We have just wasted time by not developing this. Their only interest is in agents and buyers. I am sorry to say that. It is just like what the Hon. State Minister said about potato farmers. It is the same plight. Like the potato farmers, industrialists are facing the same crisis today. , . , GSMB . , .

What has the Co-operative Development Department done? How have they intervened? They have not intervened. They keep silent and pass the file to another department and say, "This is not our role. This belongs to the Central Bank". How can the Central Bank alone handle co-operatives? Co-operatives have a statutory function under the Co-operative Act. . .

[2.46 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Thank you, Sir. Hon. (Dr.) Sivamohan has given his time to me.

Today, we are discussing the Votes on the Ministry of Mass Media which is one of the most important Ministries. But, I have my doubts as to whether the Hon. Members are interested in debating on media, because I have seen ample time allocated on the notice board. This is the situation in this country, the extent to which the Government and the Opposition is giving importance or consideration towards media.

I am going to speak in Tamil since I do not see many Members here to listen. I want the officials of the Ministry to carefully listen to what I am going to say and take action accordingly. This is the fourth time I am speaking on this subject. For the last four years I have spoken on this.

The IGP, Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa or whoever it is- I do not know how to say it- all are ignoring the journalists. Even this Government, Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe's UNP Government, does not take proper action. They are here only to condemn the media. That they do very systematically.

This time the Prime Minister, or the Opposition or somebody has to answer, otherwise I am going to take this up internationally with other media groups. I am going to work towards that. I assume their priority is to safeguard certain journalists, certain Ministers, or certain Members of Parliament and that is why they do not take action. We have never seen anybody being punished up to now. The Defence Ministry is responsible, the Minister in charge of Media is responsible and on top of them the Hon. Prime Minister is responsible.

If you do not penalize the culprits and allow them to freely move about, how can a journalist work freely? They are still scared of them. Still, there are people - witnesses - to give evidence. You must punish the culprits. Even if they are Members of Parliament, Ministers and so on, they have to be taken to court and charged. But, nothing is happening here. Why? Is the IGP conniving with those culprits? The IGPs responsibility is to file action against them and find out the truth. Why is he not doing it? Has he got any political force behind him, preventing him from doing so? He has to answer this.

Sir, I take this opportunity to inform you that in the year 2006, the Uthayan newspaper was attacked by seven gunmen. We have the witness. We told this eternally. We told this to the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa who was then a Minister and to the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, the then President. Immediately after the shooting incident, around 7.30 p.m., the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa gave me a call - I was then in Colombo - and said, People got killed in your institution. They will catch the culprit or the murderer." In fact, they have caught the murderer, but the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa got him released telling that they have caught a wrong person. But, I have the name. The records are in the hospital, I will not tell in which hospital, because they may go and destroy them. But it is there. I have got the witness to prove, but they are not taking up the case. How many times did we go up and down to the Police Station, the IGP and others? This incident was investigated by one ASP, who was subsequently a DIG. I met him accidently. He said that after his investigations he gave the report and the then IGP apparently had told him to leave it aside. He told me. This is the Governments attitude towards the killing of people, attacking a newspaper. No action was taken. So, how can a journalist work freely without fear? Without taking them to task, you are allowing them to freely control the journalists. They can threaten the journalists; they can give calls. See how many websites are attacking the people. What action is taken against them? When there was something published in the facebook tarnishing the image of His Excellency, immediately, they arrested the person. Why it is not applied to the others? They say, We do not have laws to control the websites. So, under which law did they catch the person who attacked the President in the facebook? You have different yardsticks; the IGP has different yardsticks. For the President you have one yardstick and for the public you have another yardstick. This is continuing. If it is during the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksas period, we can forget about it. It is four years. Tell me the Government Members, have you punished even one person? No. You have to answer. The Minister of Justice, the Hon. Thalatha Atukorale is not here, I suppose

The Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defence, all are responsible. The known culprit is one of the Members

of Parliament here. Everybody knows it; I do not need to tell the name. He has been doing this; people of his Party killed the ITAK members when they were visiting the Delft Island. The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah was very badly attacked and was hospitalized; Hon. Sivajilingam was very badly attacked and was hospitalized. But, the culprit escaped.

Now, I am telling you very positively that it is the same person who - then he was a Minister and on the instruction of his party leader - attacked Uthayan office and killed people. We have their names. Even the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe is helping him by not taking any action on those cases. Because you want the Tamil persons to show that as and when you need somebody, they are the people whom you can buy easily. By giving ministerial portfolios, you can buy them. You can take them to the UN and take them to anywhere in the world to show that there is a Tamil person with you. This is what the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa did; wherever he goes, he was taking him. In fact, that particular MP was not allowed to enter India. No visa was given to him because he was charged with murder. But then, they arranged telephone investigations and the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa took him to Delhi along with him. Now, in what way, is the UNP Government of the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe different? It is the same thing. We were told that he was looking for a ministerial post, but our Party was not much interested in it and then, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe gave it up. You should not have even asked for that.

In 2013, they got into Uthayan press in daytime and burnt the press; they burnt the entire web offset. After that every ambassador, whoever came there - even the then Prime Minister David Cameron visited there - had seen that. This is the democracy. Have you rectified the democracy? Have you safeguarded the journalists? No. What are you doing with regard to Lasantha Wickrematunges case and Eknaligodas case? Why are you delaying those? You can have a Special Court or something like that and finish the matter off. But, you will not do that. I will tell you, again even if any other party comes in, they will not take action against these people.

First and foremost, the press should have freedom. The journalists should have freedom. Without that, how can you call it a democratic country? There is nobody to speak like this here and therefore, I am coming out with all these facts. That is what I said in Tamil when cases of Sinhala people are not taken up by the IGP, what about the cases of Tamil people? There were so many Tamils killed; Taraki Sivaram, Nadesan, Suhirtharajan and so many people were killed. Five people in my institution were also killed, but nothing happened with regard to them. It is a simple matter for the Inspector General of Police. So, anybody can go and kill anybody and he will definitely escape. That is how that particular MP escaped. Why can you not charge him? Why can the CID not charge them? Now, that particular report given by the ASP is there in the IGPs Office. The Minister of Mass Media should take action immediately calling for the report and look into the truth of it.

We are prepared to produce the witnesses. Now when I tell you that I have the witnesses, I do not know whether they would be killed tomorrow or day after. Therefore, I think, the ruling party along with the Minister of Mass Media, should identify the cases not only in Colombo but right throughout Sri Lanka immediately and take them up and the people affected have to be compensated. First and foremost, they have not been compensated. But, if it happened here, you would have compensated them. But, not a single Tamil family has been compensated yet.

( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijewardene) Can I answer you? . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Yes, please. ( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijewardene) Hon. Member, in fact, some of the Tamil journalists have asked for time to come and meet me to discuss compensation for all the Tamil journalists who died. So, I am hoping to meet them sometime next week or the week after when they come to Colombo and I am following that up and I will sort that issue. But, when it comes to the investigations, I believe, most of these investigations are with the Attorney-General at the moment. So, there is nothing much I, as the Mass Media Minister, can do about it. But, what I can do is, I can follow it up with the IGP and the Attorney-General and see how far these cases are going. Then, as for the compensation, we can arrange that, for sure.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Thank you, Minister. As far as the investigations are concerned, it was only two cases that have been investigated. I even handed over the papers to the Attorney-Generals Department regarding two or three cases. But, those were kept aside. There was no response. Is it a simple matter when gunmen got into a media institution, shot and killed people randomly and injured a number of people? Is it a simple matter in Sri Lanka - I mean, in our country? No! Why are actions not being taken? Forget about the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksas period, because the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa safeguarded that particular culprit. He is a Member of Parliament today.

So, you will have to start up those investigations. We are prepared to give all the evidence and produce witnesses. I waited from 2006. So, how many years today? We waited for so long. But, no justice was meted out. So, this is what I say. The culprits should be punished somehow or other irrespective of their capacity; whether they are Members of Parliament or laymen. Justice must be done. There are so many people. I know that the Hon.

Mangala Samaraweera and the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe have the intention to do so. But, the Attorney-Generals Department and the IGP, they all will have to cooperate with this and give them the maximum support. But, partly, they are working for the other party. As you know, all the Departments are working for two parties. This is another problem that we are facing today. So, they are unable to do anything.

So, I want the case of burning of my press and the incident in 2006 be investigated immediately. I do not know which machinery is responsible for it. But, I remember that I gave the papers to the Attorney-Generals Department twice. They spoke very nicely and when I came out, I felt that it would be done in a day or two. As I told you, the ASP who investigated the matter met me after he became a DIG. He met me accidently after his retirement. He told me, I gave the papers immediately but my boss told me to keep them aside. So, this was the situation then. So, who would have directed? It was a politician who would have directed him not to take up that case. Sometimes, in another five years time, the witness may also die due to aging. So, this is what I have to say.

I thank you for giving me this opportunity.

[6.35p.m.] , , ( - , , , , ) (The Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen - Minister of Industry and Commerce, Resettlement of Protracted Displaced Persons, Co-operative Development and Vocational Training and Skills Development) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Sir, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Resettlement of Protracted Displaced Persons, Cooperative Development and Vocational Training and Skills Development is responsible for promoting industrial development, State-managed domestic and FMCG trade, consumer protection and market measurements, domestic trade development, national entrepreneur development and SMEs, rural consumer support through cooperative policies, local business development through Registrar of Companies, preserving and developing national traditions of crafts, handlooms, and designs, and national vocational development and skills development. The Ministry also supports resettlement of long term - protracted - IDPs.

To implement the Governments vision, this Ministry collaborates with local business Chambers, local industry institutions such as plastic and rubber industry, international organizations such as UNs Industrial Development Organization -UNIDO- and Genevas ITC.

The fifth budget of the Yahapalana Government by the Hon. Finance Minister, Mangala Samaraweera- Budget 2019- focused on medium term development, SME and entrepreneur development and safeguarding local contractors.

As the Minister of Industry and Commerce, I welcome Hon. Finance Ministers proposals to help industries, SMEs and various other sectors connected to these aspects. As the Industry Minister, I welcome his proposal to reduce PAL on the local manufacturing industry, specially PAL reduction to 2.5 per cent.

1903 1904

[

2019 23

I also welcome Hon. Finance Ministers proposal for an accelerated CESS reduction programme for intermediate goods that drive up costs in sectors such as construction and manufacturing.

I am pleased to say that industries under my Ministry have shown strong performance. Our industries directly under my Ministry are in 35 industrial estates, in 19 Districts occupying 1,075 acres by end of December 2018. In these estates, 244 industries were in commercial manufacturing with 425 investors employing 20,217 persons. Almost Rs. 40 billion have been invested in these 35 zones. Of this, Rs. 3.5 billion was government investment and Rs. 35.4 billion came from the private sector. I am also pleased to say that the Industrial Development Board has 18 industrial estates in 16 districts as of December 2018. Nine thousand three hundred and forty six industrialists have been benefited from its programmes and services.

Many State industry enterprises under my Ministry were running at a loss at the time I took over, but are now showing a positive performance.

We successfully issued RFP submissions for Lanka Mineral Sands Limited. I am pleased to say that LMSL is reporting Rs. 676 million net profit after tax in 2018. There are no plans to privatize or sell the Pulmoddai mineral deposits since we consider it to be a national asset. The Kahatagaha Graphite Lanka Limited under my Ministry is an export-focused public enterprise. We are preparing a background note for its restructuring. The profit-making Paranthan Chemicals Company Limited under my Ministry has reported a total sales revenue of Rs. 208 million and Rs. 47 million operational profit by December 2018.

Mantai Salt Limited under my Ministry manufactures salt that is recognized as the best in quality compared to salt from other parts of the country.

Our Ministry has introduced robotics technology to Sri Lanka. The Centre of Excellence in Robotic Applications of IDB will operate as a company to benefit industry on all robotic and automation activities and help bring this technology to Sri Lankan industrialists.

Not only State industry enterprises under my Ministry that were loss making have now turned around but even State enterprises in trade and FMCG are showing positive performance. The Sathosa or the CWE, which was running at a loss and which distributes essential commodities, reported a net income of Rs. 581,149 in 2018. Actually when they handed this over in 2018, there was a loss of nearly 3.4 billion. There was a Rs. 14 billion loan for rice. Last year we reduced that loss to Rs. 1.6 billion. The number of outlets was below 300. Now it has more than 400 outlets. We have opened new outlets and helping the rural areas through Sathosa.

As the Minister of SMEs, I welcome our Finance Minister Hon. Mangala Samaraweera's many proposals to support the SMEs and entrepreneurs. There is the Nangwamu Lanka Micro and Small Enterprise

Development Programme. From that, we are expecting to create nearly 100,000 new employment opportunities through small businesses and small industries. Our Ministry also supports SMEs through various ways including National Enterprise Development Authority.

Sir, as Sri Lanka advances beyond US Dollars 5 billion apparel exports, apparel and textiles need increased. The Sri Lanka Institute of Textile and Apparel - SLITA - under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce conducted 137 training courses in apparel sector generating many new employment opportunities. Acquiring NVQ level for HND in its Textile and Apparel Technology courses is among its plans for 2019. Due to high quality, SLITAs training and testing are now highly demanded programmes among our industrialists. This is supporting our US Dollars 5 billion worth of apparel export industry.

The Department of Measurement Units, Standards and Services and the National Measurement Laboratory issued 497 registration certificates last year with a revenue of Rs. 1.16 million. We are supporting the co-operative sector which has eight million members. We have successfully introduced the National Co-operative Policy. The National Institute of Co-operative Development under the Ministry conducted 67 courses for 1,661 trainees last year. The NICD plans to establish regional training centres. The Co-operative Employment Commission conducted awareness and training programmes.

We believe that a strong private sector results in strong economic growth. Sri Lankas private sector is directly supported by the Ministry through the Department of Registrar of Companies. From January to December 2018, the Registrar of Companies performed 11,534 new company registrations, and registered 1,086 societies. Now we are computerizing the Department of Registrar of Companies. This year we will achieve 100 per cent computerization for registration of companies.

My Ministry supports Sri Lankas crafts, handlooms and design sectors so that it shall become an export competitive sector. The National Design Centre under me produced 507 prototypes and introduced 531 new designs to the craftsmen last year.

The National Crafts Council promotes and preserves Lankan handicrafts and craftsmen and from January to December of 2018, 1,382 new handicraftsmen were registered bringing the total registered craftsmen to 28,121.

I welcome the latest addition - Vocational Training and Skills Development - to my Ministry. I believe that many institutions under my Ministry such as NEDA, SLITA, National Crafts Council, Co-operatives, IDB and NICD have already been performing in-depth training sessions to their stakeholders and therefore, I believe my Ministry can successfully use the vocational training and skills development institutions assigned under us. With

1905 1906

the return of Department of Commerce, we are able to greatly contribute to export development vision of the Government and I look forward to work with the Minister, the Hon. Malik Samarawickrama, and his Ministry to enhance our international trade.
