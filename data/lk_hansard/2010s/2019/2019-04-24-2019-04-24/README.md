. , . The Royalists should stand up. My Friend, the Hon. Leader of the House, knows that Royalists should stand up, not just dodge and run away. That is what should have been done. You admitted that from the 04th of April, information was available. What did the Government do? Today, after there was a massacre in the City of Colombo at Catholic churches and foreigners had been massacred, they come and say, "We did not know". How can you say you did not know? Inquiries were on from 2016 when your Prime Minister was in the National Security Council. - [Interruption.] Do not talk of things that you do not know. You had better be in Tangalle rather than talk nonsense.

If it had not appeared in the newspaper, you had better release it immediately to the newspapers. Then the innocent people in the country will protect themselves; foreigners will protect themselves; the religious dignitaries will protect themselves. It is a shame that a certain higher-up in the Government made an utterance that he knew and he did not go to church. Did they not have the courtesy in the name of God to inform the Minister concerned or the Cardinal? Is this the way our Ministers or the higher-ups are behaving? This country has no Government, Sir. That is why the Leader of the Opposition asked you all to quit and hand over the Government which could not save our country from this disaster.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , . The next speaker is the Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan. You have 30 minutes, but I am told that you are not taking the full time as you are giving part of your time to Hon. Sumanthiran.

[11.33 a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Mr. Speaker, Sri Lanka was struck by an enormous tragedy on Sunday the 21st. Several attacks were carried out. It was a well-planned attack. Over 300 people were killed; over 500 people were injured. Amongst the people killed, there were over 30 foreign tourists. It was an act of fanatical fundamentalism deserving of the strongest condemnation. The perpetrators must be brought to book. They must be brought before the law and given the severest punishment. I convey our very sincere and deep condolences on behalf of myself, my Colleagues of the Tamil National Alliance in Parliament, to the victims. We request the Government to ensure that all victims are adequately looked after, compensated, provided all relief, that the church buildings are properly renovated as per the wishes of the church authorities and that everything be done to provide all possible relief to the persons who have been victimized.

Having said that, Sir, there are a few questions I would like to raise, some of which have been discussed in the House this morning. It would appear that some information was available. It is now clear that information was in fact available, at least some days earlier in regard to this possible attack. If the information had been acted upon, this tragedy could have been averted. The entire conspiracy could have been unraveled. Consequent to that not being done, innocent lives have been lost. An independent investigation needs to be conducted in regard to this matter and the truth should be made public. That is something which the people of this country, I think, are entitled to know.

The second question I wish to raise, Sir, is, did this attack have an international dimension. The attacks have been carried out in terms of a well-planned plot. The Christian community had been the main target. Three churches have been attacked on a holy day. It was also a Sunday. There were a large number of worshipers in the churches. The attack on the Batticaloa church also has an ethnic flavour and I am informed that all the victims were Tamils.

There had been attacks on luxurious hotels in Colombo. It had been an attack on the tourist industry and on the countrys economy. This is bound to have serious implications on the country. More than anything else, Sir, relative peace that prevailed in the minds and actions of ordinary people has been shattered. The calm atmosphere that prevailed has been completely reversed. This is not good for the country. It is harmful for the country. People need to acquire the confidence that the enforcement of the law has been revamped.

Cosmetic action in regard to this matter will not do. The next question I wish to pose is, where do we go from here? The country needs to be turned around from this disastrous situation.

An important question that needs to be answered is, why was Sri Lanka chosen for the attack? Was Sri Lanka chosen for the attack because we are politically divided on account of our own interests and not on account of the interests of the country? Was Sri Lanka attacked because we are economically weak on account of wasteful expenditure on a war which should never have occurred? If commitments made to moderate Tamil politicians had been implemented in due time, a war need not have ever occurred. On account of corruption, on account of profligacy and waste, were we attacked? Because our security was weakened, again on account of our internal divisions, the attackers saw in Sri Lanka an easy target. They were perfectly right because as we now know, not even the information passed by other countries to Sri Lanka has been properly used in order to avert the attack. The countrys only hope is that of being turned around. How can we do that? The Parliament has unanimously committed itself to giving this country a new Constitution. Why are we not doing that? Why are we not following the unanimous commitment that this Parliament has made to the country and to the world to

51 52

give this country a new Constitution? Will Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe answer that question? Will President Maithripala Sirisena answer that question? Will Opposition Leader Mahinda Rajapaksa answer that question? That must be done forthwith in the interest of the country.

The countrys image must change. People must begin to feel that the country has changed. We must cease to be a divided country. We must be a united country. People in this country and abroad must have a new image of Sri Lanka. If we want to achieve that, your commitment through a unanimous Resolution adopted in this Parliament that this country will have a new Constitution must be implemented and that Constitution must come into being, and from such a Constitution coming into being, the people of this country and the world must know that Sri Lanka has taken a new direction, a new path. If you do not do that, you will not survive. If you want to survive keep to your commitments. You have made commitments in this Parliament. You have made commitments to the people in this country. You have made commitments to the whole world which you have not implemented. You are at default and you must be ashamed of yourselves that you are in that position. If you want to survive, keep to your commitments. There is no doubt, in your interest, you can survive only if commitments are kept. If you do not keep to your commitments there will be no alternative but for you to perish.

I do not wish to take any more time, Sir, but I want to earnestly appeal to all Members of Parliament, particularly to the leaders of political parties to keep to your commitments.

Former President, Mahinda Rajapaksa made some comments in the course of his speech yesterday. Hon. Member, Dinesh Gunawardena made some comments in the course of his speech today. I would like to comment on them but I do not have the time, Sir. There are other Colleagues of mine who would like to speak. They will answer them. You are only interested in coming to power. Your only ambition is not to serve the country, not to protect the country, not to take the country forward but come to power. You think that if you come to power everything will be solved. It will only get worse. Nothing will be solved.

Therefore, I appeal to all of you to be more sensible and in the interest of the country, come together to give this country a new Constitution and a new future.

Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. You have five minutes.

[12.56p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Presiding Member, I rise with a heavy heart to say a few words at this time. Firstly, I wish to convey our deepest condolences to all the relatives and friends of those who were killed on Easter Sunday and we also pray for speedy recovery of those who were injured.

I am a Christian and I share in the sorrow of the Christian Church in Sri Lanka at this time. We believe in Jesus Christ who came into this world, suffered as we do and took the worst of evil onto himself and was crucified unjustly. But he defeated all evil through self-sacrificial love which is what we celebrate on Easter, the Resurrection Day. We are grieving, but yet, we will not allow hate and revenge to overtake us.

I can only quote Reverend Father Jude Fernando who was celebrating the Easter Mass at St. Anthony's Church, Kochchikade when the explosion took place. I quote:

We love peace. We forgive. Our God is a God of peace. He is not a God of revenge. We love each other. We forgive.

This does not mean that those who are responsible for this carnage can go scot-free. It does, however, mean that we do not respond to perpetrators who acted out of hate with hatred ourselves. The objective should not be revenge, but seeking the truth, accountability and justice. It is the duty of the State to vigorously pursue them and bring them to justice in accordance with the law. Very serious questions have arisen as to why preventative action was not taken when information was available. Those responsible for this, from the very top, must at the very least resign.

I raised the issue of the President keeping the Police Department under his charge during the Budget Debate. This is clearly unconstitutional. The Police came under a separate Ministry called Law and Order when the Nineteenth Amendment was passed. The Constitution identifies only three subjects that the President can hold: Defence, Mahaweli and Environment. Law and Order is not one of those. But, unlawfully holding onto this portfolio, the President has now become the first person who should take responsibility for these attacks that could have been prevented.

I attended the funerals of some of the victims in Batticaloa on Monday. Our Party called for a Day of Mourning, not hartal, to be observed in the North and East today. I visited the Catholic Bishop of Batticaloa, and the Governor of the Eastern Province and conveyed this message. Unfortunately, the Governor has stated that it was a hartal that was called for. This is despite very clearly saying that this is not a hartal. There are many serious questions that are being asked about the Governor and his connections to the National Thowheed Jamaath.

, . '' . National Thowheed Jamaath .

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, there is one minute left unless you ask for more time.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I will finish in a minute.

This must be investigated. So must all connections this group has had with various other politicians and previous Defence officials be investigated. The Muslim people, to their credit, have repeatedly complained about these miscreants.

Years ago, Muslim groups raised the issue of radicalization with Government Intelligence officials and appealed that steps be taken to halt this process. Further, in 2017 itself, they even held a demonstration in Kattankudi and asked that Zaharan be arrested. I must in this respect commend the brave conduct of the Hon. Kabir Hashim who has set a great example for all of us.

Finally, I appeal to all, politicians in particular, not to blame this tragedy on any particular community. The Muslims of this country have never reacted with violence even when violence was thrust upon them. We value that very much, and we will march towards a better tomorrow for all of us; Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and others, hand in hand.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) I thank you for that speech, Hon. Member.

Next, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, please.

79 80

[1.02p.m.] ( , ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning, Water Supply and Higher Education) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, I speak today before you, yet unable to come to terms with the horrendous and barbaric terror inflicted on our Christian brothers and sisters, as well as members of other faiths who had been unfortunately caught in this carnage on Easter Sunday this week, the bloodiest coordinated series of attacks ever that the Christian community faced in the history of Sri Lanka.

First and foremost, I bow to the Christian community and the reverend clergy who have proven their magnanimity in practising the words of Lord Jesus Christ, - "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also." - and by preaching calm to the bereaved Christian communities at a time of grief and desisting backlash to the Muslim community living in absolute fear.

Speaking of His Eminence the Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, I express my profound gratitude and admiration for his reconciliatory expression of forgiveness towards the terrorists who he rightly described as those devoid of any allegiance to any religion or faith and a misguided people.

We must however confess and concede that we are collectively guilty of complacency in not taking immediate action when there were intelligence reports pointing towards the possibility of these heinous attacks.

The Muslim minority in Sri Lanka living here for over a thousand years has preserved its ethno-religious identity with remarkable peace and resilience. Our faith of peace has helped us lead a harmonious co-existence in this country. The Muslims and the Christians and others have shared a very similar faith system in the Abrahamic religion and have never in the modern history had any animosity or enmity towards each other. We, in fact, have been two extremely closely linked religious communities just as much as we have been with the other communities. With all Christians, the Roman Catholics, the Anglicans, the Methodists, the Protestants and all of the Christian denominations including the Evangelicals we share special affinities of common ethno-linguistic and religious similarities as one community of Sri Lankans. We also profess an extreme degree of tolerance towards other communities as preached by Lord Buddha. We, as minorities, have also faced similar persecutions and attacks by other extremist groups on our Mosques and Churches, all the same in the past. There are only too many commonalities and solidarities that we share in faith and now in fear.

Mr. Presiding Member, I must also say this in Sinhala.

, " ; . . , , . , , .

. . , . ? , . , . . ISIS , " . , " . . , . , . . , . . , . . , . , . , , .

It is only a matter of degree. As far as the complacency issue is concerned, all of us are guilty. I do not think we should start pointing fingers at each other and allowing the enemy to benefit from this. We are creating an unnecessary situation. Therefore, Mr. Presiding Member, it is our fervent wish that at a time of national crisis of this nature, let us all unite, concentrate and be vigilant. Now we are all pushing panic buttons. This is not a time to push panic buttons. It is quite expectedly we do that when such situations arise.

I think declaring Emergency is unavoidable in a situation like this. I am sure, those powers will be used in full measure keeping in mind of course that those extraordinary powers will be resorted to in a rational and justifiable manner proportionate to the purpose of investigation. Also, I must make sure that as the

81 82

2019 04

Parliament, every month, we will come here for renewal. Then, those who are using this power must use it proportionately and to the extent necessary. I am sure, that will be followed by the forces who would be using it.

Yesterday, I observed the Hon. Prime Minister, when he was fielding questions from the foreign media; then, the former President, the Opposition Leader and the Hon. R. Sampanthan in the morning, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran and many others have displayed their maturity and I must thank all of them. Though of course sometimes with occasional outbursts when someone interrupted them, they would have used certain political brickbats. But apart from that, they have been very mature and they have never gone down to the level of trying to use this for political purposes, particularly, not attributing this terror to one particular community or religion. That is very important. Though this has happened by a misguided set of people who are now isolated, and we could easily track down, if we all get united.

Mr. Presiding Member, I must mention here that one of the important persons who finally had to succumb to the bullet of the terrorists was the late Foreign Minister, the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar. He said, An act of terrorism anywhere is a threat to everyone, everywhere.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) You have seven minutes, Hon. Minister.

[3.39p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member.

This is a time when our nation, which was emerging from conflict and was beginning to work together for a brighter and more prosperous future for all our people, has been shaken to the very core. In fact, 359 persons have been killed, 45 of them were children and over 500 have been injured. I would like to take this opportunity, first of all, to offer my condolences to all those who have suffered loss and anguish as a result of the brutal and senseless violence unleashed by extremists on Easter Sunday at churches and hotels in Sri Lanka. My thoughts and prayers are with each and every individual who is grieving and I pray that each one of us in this House and each and every citizen of our nation finds the strength and wisdom required to work with determination to stand together, undeterred by those who seek to divide us and make us become so consumed by hatred, anger and vengeance that we lose our resolve to work together to build a reconciled, peaceful, stable and prosperous nation for all.

Sir, at this very sad moment, in the midst of the tragedy we experienced last Sunday, we also saw many acts of heroism. We saw parishioners and workers who risked everything to rescue victims; people who ran to help and rescue victims instead of running away to save their own lives; the ultimate sacrifice paid by brave policemen who acted to prevent more crimes and apprehend perpetrators; the devotion of health professionals who faced unimaginable and unexpected, providing the best support for each person at their most vulnerable, irrespective of race, ethnicity, gender or age; good-hearted people reached out to help those in need in numerous ways cooperating the law-enforcement authorities and conducting themselves with restraint tolerance and patience; journalists, media personnel and media organizations who reported the truth in a responsible manner without engaging in sensationalism as some of our TV stations did and those committed individuals who painfully went through information especially on social media to separate the truth from the fake and inform the public and heartwarming gestures of many people flocking to donate their own precious blood to save the lives of others that were unknown to them, to people they have never met or spoken to.

Sir, this is the goodness of our nation, our citizen heroes who did not hesitate even for a moment to check out who the victim was in order to help. They did not wonder is my blood from this or that community? Blood is not Buddhist, Muslim, Christian or Hindu. Blood is what reminds all of us of our common humanity.

This is not, Sir, the time to point fingers. This is not the time to score political points; not to score debating points and manipulate the emotions of our people by misleading and confusing them. This, in fact, is a time to introspect.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Okay.

Mr. Presiding Member, it is important that we act with responsibility. It is important to realize that not all problems can be solved with guns and bombs and by changing a few individuals. There is a sense of sophistication that is required to deal with sensitive issues of this nature and countering violent extremism and radicalization require a careful and an intelligent approach.

Unlike earlier when Sri Lanka had to deal with a separatist movement based on its own soil, we are now dealing with an international terrorist network based on religious fanaticism. Therefore, we need the support and know-how of the international community who too have become victims of this plague.

It is, in fact, a triumph of our foreign policy that the international community - our friends in the international community - has rallied around our country in this hour of need. In fact, some of the leaders of the principle nations of the world have been calling our Prime Minister and the President. From President Trump to Prime Minister Theresa May, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of Japan and everyone has called Sri Lanka to offer their assistance, their help as well as their sympathies.

Therefore, Mr. Presiding Member, as I said before, the need for introspection, the need for collective action along with the international community and the need for each individual to act with responsibility become far greater. Citizens have a duty to preserve the peace. We must take great care to bring to the notice of law enforcement authorities details of those who may be brainwashed into causing harm. We must learn from other countries that had been dealing with similar situations regarding best practice, including rehabilitation, counselling and capacity building among communities for psychological support.

I believe my seven minutes is up now. So, I really do not want to take any more time. In fact, I was going to take a few minutes to talk about the impact of this incident on our economy but due to lack of time I table* that document.

* 2 : : Document tabled:

Sir, our economy was on a steady path of recovery following a series of natural disasters in the form of droughts and floods in 2016/2017, and a man-made disaster the political crisis of 2018. We had stabilized the economy as inflation was brought down to 2.9 % by March 2019, the trade deficit declined to its lowest level in over 5 years in February, accordingly the rupee has appreciated by 4.5 % - the 3rd best performing currency in the world in 2019. Our foreign reserves stand at US$ 7.7 billion - covering over 4 months of import requirements. Interest rates have declined by over 100 basis points this year as fiscal consolidation delivered results with a 0.6 % primary budget surplus in 2018.

It is clear, Sir, that we had laid a sound foundation for the economy to withstand shocks of the nature that we faced on Sunday. Nonetheless, there will be an impact on the tourism sector even though it is now off-season. Our tourist industry has had long experience of protecting our visitors even through a 30 year war, and there is no doubt the sector will bounce back. We have taken significant measures to support tourism through policy interventions in the budget, and also outside of the budget such as the visa waiver. We will discuss with the industry to identify further measures to support them through this challenging period.

We could also see some stresses in FDI and portfolio investment in the short term. In both instances, I urge investors to focus on the macroeconomic fundamentals which are, as I have outlined, very sound. Sri Lankas investment proposition remains very compelling. We have taken pro-active measures to refinance external debt in the first quarter of this year, and have already completed large external debt repayments in January and April.

Along with that I also table** the rest of my speech to be included in Hansard. Thank you. ** : ** :: **Rest of the speech tabled:

It is also critical, Sir, that we look at this in a wider context including education reform. Content of education from pre-school onwards as well as the structure of our schools are worth being revisited. I am no expert. Yet, I cannot help but wonder whether segregated schools in our country may be causing incomprehensible harm. Moreover, the exam-oriented focus of curricula needs to be reconsidered at the earliest possible. Each of our religions has such valuable life lessons to teach us. Lessons that help us cope with the stresses and strains of life. Yet, the way religion is taught in an exam-oriented and compartmentalized way and the lack of emphasis on universal values make it impossible for children to gain real and meaningful benefit for their personal growth or to understand or respect other religions, practices, beliefs or diversity and overcome fear.

Lastly, Sir, we have ignored for far too long much needed transformational reform and development of the security sector that should have been undertaken soon after the end of the conflict in 2009, to ensure that Sri Lanka gains for itself a respectable and advantageous position in the spheres of national socio-economic development and foreign affairs, ensuring sustainable security through the primacy of law and order. These include: review and rationalization of major security legislation ; review, re-orientation and development of national security and defence sectors; and review, re-orientation and development of the public security and law-enforcement sector.

Sir, I hope and pray that at least now, at this time of tragedy, we realize the importance for Sri Lanka to transcend partisan considerations, whether political, administrative or functional and introduce lasting institutional cohesion to its security sector and associated processes. Policies and plans should be geared towards building and maintaining the right security instruments and capabilities - appropriately resourced, specialized and economically

135 136

focused on their respective tasks without duplication, but with maximum unity of effort.

Sir, all problems cannot be resolved through fire-power. Securing our common future- the future of each citizen and individual who lives in this common space that we share and call our home - requires sustained socio-economic development guaranteed through sophisticated strategic cooperation, diplomacy, intelligence, policing and law enforcement, infrastructure protection, territorial surveillance and border management. The primary security instruments of the future, Sir, are not firepower or manpower. Sadly, we have not reflected on these aspects with due seriousness and this is what is made most apparent in the tragedy of Easter Sunday. I hope we do this now, without getting bogged down in pointing fingers and conjuring up conspiracy theories.

Sir, we must take a clear decision about the society we want to be. The choices are stark. Do we resign ourselves to live in segregated segments, in shreds of society, talking only with those who are similar, hiring only those in our group, befriending only the right kind of person and creating fear against others? Do we resign ourselves to an uneasy coexistence or do we aim for the more ambitious goal of reconciliation?

The challenge is to evolve in our nation, a more profound sense of belonging; one in which we do not merely tolerate the other, but we celebrate their differences, their culture, their language, their identities.

The challenge is the paradox of being different and profoundly equal; equal in humanity, equal individual rights, equal in our love to this our Mother Lanka.

That challenge, Sir, should be our common obsessive dream; the promise of a Sri Lanka in which children of all communities play and grow together; one in which no one feels discriminated because of their language, identity, gender or beliefs; one in which everyone feels the pain of another citizen and lives and grows in compassion and solidarity where there is absolutely no space for recurrence of violence. Truth- seeking, justice and reparation become ever more important in this context. We must continue to strengthen our democracy and work on enhancing strategic cooperation with friendly nations in the region and beyond whose support is essential to Sri Lankas progress as a peaceful, stable, prosperous and democratic nation where rule of law and fundamental rights of all our citizens are secured.

I would like to say this in closing. We need to recognize that we are facing an international ideological terrorism, a terrorism which has raised its head in many countries in the world. We were a soft target. Innocent people have perished because of this terrorism. We are thankful for international support, but we have the confidence in our police and the armed forces that we could respond to the security threat faced by all of us. But we also have a long-term problem that we will unite with the international community in resolving. I insist on all of you, the Parliamentarians, to come together, put aside our differences: Party, Presidential, Government and Opposition. The time will come and then we can review. Those who are responsible will have to pay for the mistakes that they have made. Priority must be given to the country, to the citizens and to the safety of citizens.

Finally, I would like to appeal to the media not to glorify the terrorists or make heroes out of them, and when these terrorists are captured, not to publish even their names. In the last few hours, more have been taken into custody and among them were even suicide bombers. We will relentlessly pursue this because terrorism will not be allowed to thrive in this country.

Thank you for the time that you have given me.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you very much. , ... . .

[5.46p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Hon. Speaker, thank you for giving me this opportunity to participate in the Debate this evening.

We are meeting today at a sad time for the people of our country. Not only have over 350 of our fellow citizens been killed and nearly 500 injured, but also this has been done through inhuman and barbaric attacks on several places of religious worship and public places such as hotels. What is most heinous is that these attacks have been carried out while people had gathered together to participate in masses on Easter Sunday, which is of great religious significance to the Catholics and Christians the world over.

We express our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims in their moment of grief and also pray for the speedy recovery of the people who are wounded. We know that our words of sympathy will not erase the memory of the experience that our fellow citizens have undergone. However, rest assured that the people of this country, including the Muslim community, stand shoulder to shoulder with our Catholic brothers in condemning these senseless attacks and will do everything possible to ensure that a tragedy of this nature will never happen again in our country.

The first task before us as a nation is to get to the bottom of these incidents and bring before the law those who planned, supported and executed these dastardly attacks. It is the duty of the authorities to ensure that this is done speedily. The next is to ascertain why sections of the law enforcement agencies chose not to act on the intelligence they had with regard to the possibility of attacks on churches on Easter Sunday. There has been no failure in gathering of intelligence, but a real failure in acting on such intelligence. At the very least, why was security not provided to these churches? If that had been done, many lives would have been saved and the trauma that many families had to undergo would have been prevented.

I also wish to thank Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith for the leadership he has given to the Catholic community at this time of grief. His wise counselling has helped greatly to hold in check the emotions that are inevitably aroused as a result of such acts of violence.

What of the future? We, as a country, have undergone enough strife and loss of life in the recent past. The Easter Sunday events came at a time when we have been making an attempt to slowly rebuild our economy and heal the wounds of the past. But, once again, we have suffered a setback. We cannot, however, allow the acts of a few to destroy the hopes and aspirations of the people of this country.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Fowzie, the time allotted to you is coming to an end.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) We have to ensure that the rule of law is established once again and that anyone who breaks the law, irrespective of which community he belongs to or what positions he holds, is brought to justice. We also have to work towards rebuilding relationships between our people and communities so that we can become a strong nation where the people are happy. Thank you.
