I think there is a lot of work that is being undertaken by the Ministry of National Policies, Economic Affairs, Resettlement and Rehabilitation, Northern Province Development, Vocational Training and Skills Development and Youth Affairs.

For instance, lands under State custody are increasingly being released and a National Policy on Durable Solutions for the Conflict Affected and Displaced has been launched on 07th March of this year. Then, there is a National Programme on Mine Action.

I want to talk about the housing programmes for the conflict affected Northern and Eastern Provinces. Fifteen thousand owner-driven brick and mortar type housing programme for the Northern and Eastern Provinces has already been started. Ten thousand brick and mortar type houses have already begun their constructions at a cost of Rs. 1 million a home. Then, construction of 7,000 new technology houses has been proposed in the Eastern Province. Then, there is a High Priority Roads Project programme for the Northern and Eastern Provinces based on 100 per cent financing facility brought by the

contractors and bidders. The financial negotiations are currently undertaken by the Department of External Resources to execute these projects early.

Then, we are also building a four-lane highway from Talaimannar to Trincomalee via Vavuniya. The Kokkilai Bridge will also be constructed. Of course there are many more constructions that are being undertaken in the previously conflict affected areas. There are some of the high priority interventions such as to develop the Palaly Airport as a regional airport, to develop Kankesanthurai Harbour with Indian loan assistance, to strengthen the Saltern in Elephant Pass, to construct the Lower-Paali Aru Scheme; the reservoir for water supply in Jaffna Peninsula, to develop the fisheries harbour Point-Pedro, then to reactive Valaichchenai Paper Mill, to reactivate Oddusuddan Tile Factory in Mullaitivu and to reactive Paranthan Chemical Company Limited to provide employment for the youth in that area.

There are so many things that we are doing. Hon. Douglas Devananda, I am glad that you are attentively listening to what I am saying. This is the work that is being carried out under the Hon. Prime Ministers Ministry.

So, that is on the infrastructure side. What we have got do with the Geneva matter is, we have got to deal with it, with our heart and soul. As explained by the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, we are dealing with it on our own. The rollover is nothing, but an extension of what we are doing, what we presented to Geneva in 2017. The

only difference is, we have added all the other things we have done since then. So, let us proceed without making another mess of this, because if you recall the only issue that was being discussed before the last Presidential Election was the electric chair.

I wish to raise certain questions directed at the Hon. Prime Minister. I am very happy that he is available in the House at this time. These questions, I hope, will be taken in the spirit that I pose them, namely with no malice, but with the highest interest of the public and the country. I hope the Hon. Prime Minister will answer these questions in the course of his final reply in this House at the end of the day.

Sir, I wish to ask the Hon. Prime Minister;

1. Did you not assure this House and the Bond Commission regarding the trustworthiness and credentials of Arjuna Mahendran and do you still maintain your position or do you not? Are you aware that the Bond Commission observed that you should not have placed trust in Arjuna Mahendran?

2. Did you not insist on Arjuna Mahendrans appointment as Governor, Central Bank of Sri Lanka disregarding President Maithripala Sirisenas strong objections and did you want the President to reappoint Arjuna Mahendran even after the Bond scam for a second term? Does this not explain why you deliberately brought the Central Bank under your purview?

3. By your assurance given to the Cabinet and to the President, did you not take personal responsibility for the honesty and trustworthiness of Arjuna Mahendran and did you assure this House that you will have Arjuna Mahendran brought back here at any necessary given time? Can you account for that statement now?

4. Did Arjuna Mahendran play a role from his safe haven even in the recent days to find foreign fund resources to the Central Bank at 8 per cent of interest?

5. Did you appoint a Committee comprised of some lawyers known to you to go into the Bond scam who returned a verdict of not guilty regarding Arjuna Mahendran whilst the COPE under the Chairmanship of the Hon. DEW Gunasekara and later the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti, found Arjuna Mahendran to be thickly involved in the Bond scam?

6. Still, later, did the Auditor-General and the Bond Commission find that Arjuna Mahendran was the principal actor in the Bond scam which resulted in an immediate gain of Rs. 16 billion to Perpetual Treasuries Limited which correspondingly was a loss to the public and the Government?

I wish to refer to the excellent Report of Ajith Nivard Cabraal, former Governor of the Central Bank in which he explains the cascading effect of the losses to the country and which Report he submitted to the Bond Commission. I would like to table* this Report for the benefit of those who will not be able to listen to the details contained in it while I make my submissions.

7. Did the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe file a case in court at your instance to prevent the Report of DEW Gunasekara being made public which obviously was to conceal your involvement as the Report clearly says that Arjuna Mahendran, in his evidence, states that he did so on your instructions?

8. Are you aware that I made a complaint against you in the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption to the effect that you are the main suspect who colluded with Arjuna Mahendran in the Bond scam and have you been questioned on this up to date?

I suppose no is your answer. You have to say no because I know that you have not been questioned. Certainly, I do not say that these were mainly to make any personal gains for yourself. But, your involvement and your element of dishonesty in that involvement is presently to be explained by you even though none was for your personal gain.

I must be charitable to you at least to that point.

9. Is not Arjun Mahendran your great and intimate friend and does he continue to be so, and do you seriously say that you do not know his whereabouts now?

10. Were you not the 3rd Respondent in my petition to

the Supreme Court in SC(FR) No.209/2007 which led to the Supreme Court declaring that the Sale of Oil Bunkering Facility of the Port of Colombo operated by the State-owned Lanka Marine Services Limited to John Keells Holdings was wrongful, unlawful, illegal and fraudulent?

11. Did you not appear through Counsel to take up

preliminary objections to this case being heard by the Supreme Court as COPE also was inquiring into this matter at that time?

12. Did the Supreme Court Judgment dated 21.07.2008 not overrule your preliminary objections and proceed to hear and adjudicate upon the above case?

13. Had the Supreme Court Judgment at page 68 not

stated as follows?

"All agreements entered into between the Board of Investment and Lanka Marine Services Limited are declared null and void and the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue is directed to recover all taxes due on the basis that such agreements had not been in force? "

14. Do you not admit that Arjuna Mahendran was the

then BOI Chairman who gave such illegal and fraudulent BOI approval to John Keells Holdings on the purchase of Bunkering Facility of Port of Colombo owned and operated by Lanka Marine Services Limited and what influence did you have in making this decision?

15. Does the Judgment at page 3 not state as follows?

"It is further alleged that in a collateral proceeding John Keells Holdings obtained tax-free status for

its investment in Lanka Marine Services Limited from the Board of Investment. Since the applicable Regulation did not cover the Agreement entered into, John Keells Holdings got the Regulations amended and a fresh Agreement entered into by the BOI. Thus, it was alleged that impugned privatization was lopsided and moved in the reversed direction of public enterprise reform by converting a tax-paying public enterprise to a tax-free private enterprise which claimed a monopoly in the relevant business." 16. Do you not admit that Lanka Marine Services Limited shares had been sold to John Keells Holdings for only Rs.1,200 million which was a ridiculous valuation. The profit of Lanka Marine Services Limited as given at page 21 of the Judgment from the year 2002 to 2006 was a total of Rs. 2,458 million whereby in 4 years John Keells Holdings had recovered double their purchase price? These are unconscionable profits. 17. Do you admit that the Department of Inland

Revenue has recovered the taxes due from John Keells Holdings according to the directions given by the Supreme Court? 18. In view of the foregoing facts, do you not admit that Arjuna Mahendran had been found by the Supreme Court to be a fraudulent manipulator which was an important and relevant fact you had knowingly suppressed from this House and before the Bond Commission which tantamount to giving false evidence?

You knew as a Respondent, in the case I filed that Arjuna Mahendran was found to be guilty of having manipulated in giving the tax concessions to John Keells Holdings. You were also a Respondent in the case I filed. So, you knew that your Co-Respondent was guilty of his dishonest conduct according to the Supreme Court Judgment. Then, why did you place trustworthiness and such credibility on the mans conduct when you were seeking the appointment for him as the Governor of the Central Bank? How can you account for your knowledge about the man and reconcile it with your request to have him appointed as the Governor of the Central Bank when you knew about the mans conduct or his misconduct according to the Supreme Court findings?

19. Do you not admit that you, as the then Prime Minister, had pressurized the then Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Parakrama Dissanayake, to sign the above Sale and Purchase Agreement for the sale of Lanka Marine Services to John Keells Holdings as it had been recorded by him in the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Minutes on 23rd August, 2002 and that the said Chairman of the SLPA had signed the Agreement only subsequently? My Counsel then, the Hon. Sumanthiran, will confirm what I say.

20. Do you not admit that at page 61 of the Judgment, it is recorded that the Monopoly Clause in the Agreement had been struck down by the Court of

319 320

,

Appeal as illegal, whilst the Cabinet Paper had been submitted by the then Cabinet Minister Karu Jayasuriya, who was the Second Respondent in my case and now, the Hon. Speaker, who collaborated on this transaction knowingly and deliberately?

21. Do you admit that the Fourth Respondent in my case was former President Chandrika Kumaratunga and that she had signed an illegal transfer of eight-and-a-half acres of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority's land for Rs.1,199.4 million, but which money had not been received by the Treasury although she had confirmed under her signature that this money had been paid? The Treasury has replied in response to a query by the COPE that this money has not been received. So, eight-and-a-half acres of Sri Lanka Ports Authority's land has gone into the possession of John Keells Holdings under this transaction without a payment at all and after all, these are not State lands, but the Corporation's lands, which she could not have given away.

21 A. Up to now the forensic audit has not even commenced. We would like to know why the forensic audit has not been commenced by the Central Bank, which is under your purview, though the Commission recommended it some time ago.

22. What will the Attorney-General do in view of all this evidence I have placed before the House? Will the Hon. Speaker report the Prime Minister to the Committee on Ethics and Privileges for telling untruths to this House deliberately and being dishonest, which impinges on the dignity of this House?

Sir, I hope you will allow me to table the Report made by Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal, the former Governor of the Central Bank, which excellently explains the cascading loss the Government has had to suffer.

Then, I also have the Judgment of the Supreme Court and also the other documents that I have referred to, including the Minutes of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority issued under the signature of the then Chairman of it, the Deed by which the land of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority was transferred by Chandrika Kumaratunga, in which she had signed to say that the money had been paid and the document which says that the money has not been received by the Treasury. I table* these documents and ask you, Sir, to kindly allow me to have these included in Hansard, if possible.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I object to that.

( ) (Hon. Members) Why? ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Sir, I object to that report by Nivard Cabraal being included in Hansard because he is under investigation and there will be a forensic audit. You can table it; I have no problem with it being tabled.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) No, I want it included in Hansard. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) The other thing is, without our verifying it, a document that has been read out in the House, or without the authority of the House, you cannot include it in Hansard.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) I will reply to that.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) We have not given the authority. If he wants to table and keep it in the Library, he can certainly do so.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) , .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) But, Nivard Cabaral is under investigation and the forensic audit - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) , . ?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) No, just wait. I am only telling you that a forensic audit is to be done.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) This is not the stage for you to reply.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) So, I think it is not a document to be included in Hansard. But, the others are cases.

What is the name of that case which you mentioned? Against whom did you file it?

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) That is the only case in which you were a Respondent when I was the Petitioner.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I want to refer to the case. What is the name of the case?

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) The name is Marine Services Limited and it was given over to John Keells.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) No, the name of the case was not "Marine Services Limited". It was something else.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) The name of the case is - ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) It was Nanayakkara versus - ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Do you want the parties to the case? ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) The parties to the case were Nanayakkara Vs. Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Third Respondent. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Who was the First Respondent? ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) The First Respondent was Mr. K.N. Choksy.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Then, the Second Respondent? ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) The Second Respondent was Karu Jayasuriya. - [Interruption.] So, I am producing these. These are documents of the Supreme Court.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) That is all right. That is a Supreme Court case and yes, it can be tabled. But, to the other one, a report by a person who is under investigation, we object. The Commission has recommended a forensic examination into the whole matter. With regard to tabling the other papers, which are official documents and court cases, we have no problem. I will explain that case to you.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Mr. Chairman - ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, Hon. Prime Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I would like to say a few words to reply. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Then, we have to ask for extra time. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Yes. If you can give me extra time - ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Okay. You may take five minutes. [6.53 p. m.] ( , , , , ) ( - , , , , , , ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - Prime Minister and Minister of National Policies, Economic Affairs, Resettlement and Rehabilitation, Northern Province Development, Vocational Training and Skills Development and Youth Affairs.) Before I deal with the Ministry facts, there was a personal attack on me by the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, who asked me a large number of questions - first, about the Bond Commission. All I am asking him is to read the Reports of the Bond Commission where there is nothing against me. This, of course, is a personal allegation that he wants to put on to the media. I just want to ask one question. Have you read the Bond Report? That is all I want to ask him.

Then, secondly, he accused me, you and the others, of the Lanka Marine Services case. This is all I would like to say. The Cabinet decision was taken on the 17th of August 2000 by the then Government - neither you nor

401 402

2019 , 14

I were Ministers or the Prime Minister at that time. The Public Enterprises Reform Commission, that was in charge after we formed the Government, was responsible for implementing it. We did not reverse it. That responsibility we take. The Supreme Court held that the Public Enterprises Reform Commission went beyond the decision of August, 2000. The Minister in-charge was not you, not Mr. K.N. Choksy - it was then Minister of Economic Reforms, Milinda Moragoda. The Supreme Court has really commented on the Public Enterprises Reform Commission, which was headed by none other than Mr. P.B. Jayasundera. Then why is he talking about me or the BOI or the Ports Authority or you? What he has said is, the Cabinet had not even authorized PERC to make reconsideration of the sale of the LMS shares". It was done by the PERC and there were a lot of comments on the conduct of the then Chairman. So, what is he coming here and asking me? I just want to ask him whether he was aware that there is a judgement. He may not be aware of the judgement. It was the Hon. Sumanthiran who appeared for him. The other counsel was Mr. Nihal Sri Ameresekera. I would like to ask him if he stand by what he said about the PERC and Lanka Marine Services shares, then why did he call Mr. P.B.Jayasundera, "Sir" when he was a Minister and Mr. Jayasundera was the Secretary to the Treasury? I want to ask him why. If he is so bad, he should not have served in the Government.

There is one more matter. As I am getting on to this, it was brought to my notice that the "Business" supplement of Daily Mirror has said that Shares fall for 4th straight session on economic and political stability... They are trying to say that because the share market has fallen, economy is not doing well. Share market and economic performance has nothing to do with each other. Basically, the share market was in a very volatile situation. As far as the economy is concerned, I have been telling you that we have done well. I am not going into the details because of short of time. Remember that the share market that these people claim went up when our debt went up and the Employees Provident Fund money was pumped into it regardless of how you got it. I need not say that again. Today, what has happened is people have pulled out, specially, after the October 26th crisis. As the economy has taken a turn for the better, similarly, I think, the share market would gradually pick up. We have asked the EPF to come back into the share market, but they will do so only by putting the safeguards to ensure what happened last time does not happen this time. The trade unions are insisting on it and we have to safeguard the savings of the employees.

Then, I would like to say a few words- ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Order, please! Hon. Prime Minister, we need to get the approval of the House to extend the Sittings by fifteen minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Okay.

. . Accordingly, Parliament resumed.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Leader of the House. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I propose that the Sittings be extended by fifteen minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Does the House agree? ( ) (Hon. Members) Aye. - [ .] . - [ .] Considered further in Committee. - [THE HON. SPEAKER in the Chair.]
