Budget for 2019 presented by our Minister of Finance, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera. Sir, I am indeed thankful to you for giving me this opportunity.

As we all know, preparing a Budget to satisfy all parties is no easy task, especially so these days when our country is facing hard times and a severe financial crunch caused by many factors such as excessive borrowings, wasteful expenditure on public utilities without prioritization, wastage, mismanagement and corruption of all orders, which have depleted our Treasury over the years.

It is in this context that I salute and appreciate the onerous task our Minister of Finance has performed in presenting a Budget with great care and concern to uplift the country and its people. Of course, the Budget is not the only indicator of a countrys economic progress, nor is it a panacea to all evils that are political and economic in a nations life. But this year, the Government has taken extreme care to present a Budget without heaping extra burdens on our people. Thus, appropriately, this years Budget is described as focusing on Empowering the People and Nurturing the Poor.

I do not intend to go into all the details of the Budget, but I must, at the outset, express my appreciation of the specific and positive aspects of this years Budget. This year, things are not any rosier in the economic front. Whatever the case may be, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweeras new Proposals are brought to meet the revenue targets and successfully confront the fiscal challenges as far as our finances can stretch. While there is a greater need to address the public grievances for a better living, as might be expected, the Budget deficit is widening as ever.

On top of it, this year is going to be an election year. Whatever one undertakes to address the financial woes through the budgetary provisions, some of our Colleagues are going to view it with jaundiced eyes to discredit the Government, as if solely to to win the votes - it is quiet understandable - but it is not true in our intent and implementation.

Is this an election Budget, as most of the Hon. Members in the Opposition tend to scoff? In a sense, it is and in another, it is not. It is an election Budget, if it is taken in the sense that some elections are around the corner. Say that the Presidential Election would come first and in that perspective, some consideration has been given not to overburden particular sectors too much at this stage. On the other hand, please understand that this is not the last of the UNP-sponsored Budgets at all. There is one more Budget that the UNP would present in this Parliament, as the next Parliamentary Election would, nevertheless, take place - ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! () .

Question put, and agreed to. , () . , , ( ) () . Whereupon THE HON. THARAKA BALASURIYA left the Chair, and THE HON. (DR.) (MRS.) THUSITHA WIJEMANNA took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Fowzie, please go ahead. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Madam Presiding Member, I was saying that this is not the last Budget of the UNP. There is one more Budget that has to be presented after the next Presidential Election.

Producing election Budgets is not the monopoly of the UNP. Almost every Government in the past seven decades had done it. Election Budgets usually violate the strict rules of prudent economic management. But, that is a trade-off we, as Sri Lankans, are taught to accept.

Populist Budgets usually contain programmes and projects that help the ordinary people. That, in turn, helps generate popular support for the system of governance that we currently have, no matter what its other deficiencies may be. In other words, giveaway Budgets during election times are part of the price that the country pays for democracy. Of course, there are winners and losers in all Budgets, but especially so if you consider it an election Budget. Whichever way we look at it, some of the Proposals that are populist should make good economic and social sense. For example, we must be considerate in bringing proposals to enhance social welfare of the poorest, who are one-fifth of our population.

There are more controversies insofar as the strategy of the Government is concerned. Such strategy that is chosen, will, no doubt, draw criticism from the Left, both inside and outside Parliament. The Government has opted to encourage and deploy a new breed of private enterprise, where success is through merit and the market operates on a rules-based level playing field. Our Government has chosen to reject the protectionist mindset in favour of economic liberalization. We must provide a robust safety net, and state intervention. With a democratic form of governance, this economic cum social strategy is closer to what prevails in some successful Scandinavian countries. Whether such a model would work in Sri Lanka that is much poorer and has a vastly different political culture and social system is a matter for debate.

Leave alone politics. I believe that the Budget has come up with many good Proposals. These range from village and urban development to jobs, education, health, environment, social safety net, poverty reduction, public sector services, housing, religion, art and culture to ethnic reconciliation. Those who are going to directly benefit from the Proposals are the farmers, fishermen, rubber growers, small-scale entrepreneurs, women, exporters, public-sector employees, temples and other places of religious worship, newlyweds, school children, university faculty and students, residents in the North and the East that suffered from the war and many other categories. Hon. Mangala Samaraweera has tried to cover all bases, large and small. I really applaud his wisdom with the support of our party for generously considering the underprivileged sections in our community.

Hon Minister Mangala Samaraweera is absolutely right to stress the importance of increasing the female participation rate in the labour force that is currently estimated to be about 35.1 per cent. This is only slightly below the global lower-middle income country average of 37.3 per cent. But it is well below the average of 54.8 per cent found in the upper middle-income countries. More women in Sri Lanka will have to enter the labour force for the country to reach the upper middle-income level that it is striving for.

Similarly, there are many other Proposals in the Budget, such as assistance to increase pre-school facilities which will be beneficial to children and the use of economic development as a strategy to promote ethnic harmony and reconciliation in the North and the East, which merit the support of all.

In order to meet up with excessive cost of living especially by burdened public servants, the Government has generously added a good slice of income to the tune of Rs. 2,500 per month while giving relief to the ailing pensioners by removing anomalies in the pension rates of those who retired before 2016. Despite economic hardships, the Government is allocating Rs. 40 billion to meet the increase in public servants allowances while allocating another Rs. 12 billion to rectify the pension anomalies. Although this increase is not going to drastically reduce the burden of a great majority, certainly this is meant to provide a much-needed relief at

971 972

2019 11

a time when living expenses are escalating. Of course, this is going to put an additional burden on countrys finances, but a Budget which is not meant to give redress to the public cannot be considered as progressive in its intent.

I do not want to dwell too much on the relief package which is supposed to be given by this years Budget to affected sectors. I agree with the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne that a good Budget must bring in economic development to the country as well. While protecting the vulnerable on one hand, on the other, there must be fiscal consolidation. Thus, the Budget deficit from 7.7 per cent has been brought down to 5.5 per cent. At the end of the next year, it will go down to 5 per cent and even below 4.5 per cent. The GDP will go up from 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent, the consolidation will be kept, and the Government is building a foundation for the next 10 years. In a sense, the Budget is all inclusive because the economic policy of the Government is geared towards that and the Budget reflects that.

It is true that no budget can be balanced without increasing tax burdens. This year, there is no significant burden on the people in general, except as usual the Government is after the luxury sectors in our community. The additional motor car levies are a good example. This may have some dampening effect on the ownership of vehicles which, after all, is not a bad thing given the traffic and environmental hazards due to burgeoning fleet of motor vehicles on the roads. There is a new entry-free tax for those who wishes to patronize casinos. As before, more revenue is to be generated by additional price increase in cigarette and liquor sales.

Madam Chair, we must appreciate the Government for keeping up with expenditure in some vital sectors, such as health, education. Funds have been allocated for education, roads, water, sanitation and for special development of the North and the East. There has not been any discrimination between the allocations for the South, the North and the East. The allocations have been done very fairly. While we welcome the allocations made in this Budget to the war-affected areas, I share the concerns of our Tamil MPs who represent the North and the East that there must be fair and genuine actions taken about the implementation of these Proposals. The proof is in the pudding. Mere allocation of money and actual implementation of the Proposals are two different things. Let us work hard to redress the grievances of the minorities with the assistance of this years Budget.

The Appropriation Bill and the Budget Proposals for 2019 include allocations of Rs. 232.7 billion for the health sector. This includes Rs. 182 billion Recurrent Expenditure and Rs. 50.7 billion Capital Expenditure. Among other expenditures, Rs. 24.8 billion is allocated in the Appropriation Bill for investments in improving the quality of infrastructure in the Government health sectors. In addition to infrastructure, there is a significant investment into patient care. Rs. 1.6 billion is allocated for primary health care units to develop coordination of patient care overtime, referral networks and treatment follow-up measures.

"Suwasariya" Programme has been extremely successful in addressing emergency treatment and critical interventions, saving lives across the country. Rs. 2 billion has been allocated through the Appropriation Bill to support the Programme and a further Rs. 600 million is proposed over two years through the Budget to establish 300 base stations across the country to further improve service delivery.

With the increase of non-communicable diseases, the necessity for palliative care for those who are terminally ill has arisen. Rs. 50 million is allocated to establish capacity building for such treatment. Significant support is provided in the Budget for investment in elderly care facilities.

Investments to detect and treat CKDU continue and Rs. 550 million is allocated through the Budget. Rs. 100 million is allocated for the control of rabies through a sterilization programme which will also help solve concerns about the stray dog population.

I tried to dwell on this vital health sector as I myself, as an ex-Health Minister, have given much consideration to improve the health standards of our people and hence the Proposals for improved health standards have drawn my special attention here to speak about.

While on the subject of Budget for which we have gathered today in this august Assembly, I also wish to say a few words, if you do not mind, on another critical issue facing our Government, country and the people. That is, how far we are going to support the Executive Presidency. Has it done any good for our country? Do we have to necessarily stick to this form of Government? It was J.R. Jayewardenes Constitution of 1978 that introduced the Executive Presidency. He thought that he can continue and he planned this to have a long rule of stay for him. Alas! Very soon, the Presidential system and the powers originally expected to bring in stability to countrys politics, slowly and steadily pushed our beloved country to a state of political turmoil. After all, it is not in the Provisions in the Constitution that the countrys stability rest, but obviously in the hands of individuals who holds these unfettered powers as Executive Presidents. We have witnessed this clearly in the ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Intentionally and unintentionally, his Government, despite success achieved in defeating terrorism, introduced many unsavoury elements in politics. Nepotism, rule of the corrupt, wealth-seeking and bribe-taking politicians thrived under his regime. President Mahinda Rajapaksa could have used executive powers in numerous occasions, for instance, in the application of the Sixth Amendment. But, he had refrained from doing so. He had shown that he would use executive powers when necessary for the benefit of the country, but not to impose the privilege of his office.

Through the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution another more convincing power was granted to the President to make him contest countless number of times for the presidency. this has given a huge hold onto

973 974

a functioning president, to keep his political desire alive. Of course the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution redressed this evil power holding, but again under another president it did not prevent abuse of powers as we recently witnessed during the 51 days political fiasco.

I do not want to beat about the bush and carry coal to New Castle. In todays politics, all right-thinking people have come to believe in one thing. That is, to abolish this wretched executive presidential system, so that no individual will ever do whatever he wants.

Now, returning to the Budget again, despite criticisms from other quarters, no one can deny that this Budget is promoting business and productivity in the country. Giving the needed concessions for the business community, this itself is showing how balanced the Budget is. Do not forget as to how the massive debts incurred by the previous government, which is the biggest burden which Government had to deal with, for the last three to four years. Somehow or the other the Finance Minister with expert advice, managed to ride through such inevitable drawbacks to balance the Budget.

In conclusion, I congratulate the Minister Hon. Mangala Samaraweera for putting forward this years Budget with prudence and care.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . , 8 . [..3.33] ( ) (The Hon. Shantha Bandara) , , 8 . 73 17 . 17 ? . ; ; , 17 , ; . . .

Sir, there is some scientific information with regard to the Aruwakkalu Project. The World Bank Guidelines and Solid Waste Management Policy and Solid Waste Management Guidelines of Sri Lanka has recommended not to choose the underlying limestone area for sanitary landfills.

Further, the selected Aruwakkalu site in the Serakuliya village is very close to the Puttalam lagoon and Wilpattu National Park, which is the longest lagoon and the second largest national park in Sri Lanka respectively.

? Lagoon , - wildlife - . . , ", " . , . , World Bank . The site has a very rich underground resource in Sri Lanka. The site is prone to seismic vibrations due to mining activities of limestone and upcoming mining activity. Agriculture, salt production, shrimp farming and fisheries and other livelihood activities will be intoxicated with heavy metals, if any failure or mismanagement or irresponsibility results, as it happens in Norachcholai Coal Power Plant frequently.

Puttalam people are against this project not because of political reasons, but very clearly for scientific reasons.

Not only the Puttalam people but also scientists and environmental experts are against this project on scientific and viability basis. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .
