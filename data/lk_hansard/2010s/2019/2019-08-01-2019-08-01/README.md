. , . . . . , . . [11.09 a.m.] ( , ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning, Water Supply and Higher Education) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Speaker, on the Votes of Condolence today, I, on behalf of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, wish to say a few words to pay my tribute to three deceased Members of Parliament: the Hon. Abdul Razak Munsoor, former Minister of Trade and Commerce; the Hon. Senaraja Samaranayake, the Hon. Munsoor's one time Deputy and the Hon. V.K. Indika who represented the Hambantota District.

It is a matter of coincidence that both the Hon. A.R. Munsoor and the Hon. Senaraja Samaranayake were from the legal profession. The Hon. Munsoor worked in the Kalmunai Bar for several years before he took to active politics. Similarly, the Hon. Samaranayake served in the Panadura Bar and the Horana Bar with distinction before taking to active politics. Both, coincidently, also came to Parliament in 1977, continued to serve until 1994 and completed their political careers spanning almost 17 years. We have had ample Members from the legal profession entering politics on both sides of the House including the Leader of the Opposition and former President, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa. So, the legal profession is seen as a cradle to enter politics. More from among the professionals, it is lawyers who take to active politics. So, these two gentlemen and their services have had a variety of incidents in which they had served this country with sincere motivation, with absolute discipline and with high dedication towards the people who elected them to this hallowed Chamber.

If I am to talk about the Hon. Munsoor at length, it is my duty to state that my late Leader, the Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff and the Hon. Munsoor - as the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition would testify - were sworn enemies in this Chamber since the Hon. Ashraff entered Parliament in 1989. But, the fate of irony is such that in the twilight of their careers, both the Hon. Ashraff and the Hon. Munsoor, who, by then had retired from politics had

become close friends. So much so, the Hon. Ashraff would seek advice and counsel from the late Hon. Munsoor when it came to very tricky political situations. That is why I said that it is very ironic that sometimes we may be pitted against one another when it comes to competitive politics, but when it comes to the service towards the people, we attain a subsequent realization with maturity that in politics; we never have permanent friends and permanent enemies.

Therefore, when it came to the Hon. Ashraff and the Hon. Munsoor, it is that fact that always comes to mind. As a matter of fact, the Hon. Munsoors second son, Mr. Rahmath Munsoor, happens to be my Coordinating Secretary today. He is also a Member of the Kalmunai Municipal Council representing the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress.

So, this whole episode of the Hon. Munsoors political career spanning from 1977 to 1994 was the most turbulent period in this countrys political history. President J.R. Jayewardenes Government with that massive five-sixths majority could not prevent the 1983 riots which became a watershed in this countrys political history. That prompted, subsequently, the Indo-Lanka Accord in 1987 and the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution which brought in the devolution structure to this country. Then came the first Parliamentary Elections in February, 1989 which was again a historic election for the reason that it was at that, for the first time, that we had the Proportional Representation System which enabled the entry of parties representing identity politics to have substantial representation, which enabled the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress to enter this Chamber. With that came the situation of that famous rivalry between the Hon. Munsoor and the Hon. Ashraff in this Chamber. Between 1989 and 1994, after the Hon. Ashraffs coming to this Chamber, I used to sit in the Gallery and watch both of them arguing against each other many a time. But, the fate of history is such that things changed with the effluxion of time.

Here, I must pay tribute to the Hon. Munsoor for protecting the interests of his Party among the disturbed Muslims in the Eastern Province during those turbulent times, which was a very difficult situation because, as a matter of fact, in 1985, there was a very serious riot that broke out between the Tamils and Muslims in Kalmunai. Several shops belonging to the Muslims were burnt in the Kalmunai Town including a petrol shed belonging to the Hon. Munsoors own brother. There were several rice mills that were burnt down. I can remember that the Bharakath rice mill, the Zam Zam rice mill and some other rice mills were also burnt down. The Hon. Ashraffs own house in Amman Kovil Road, too, was burnt down. It was totally gutted and he had to come to Colombo as a refugee. That situation was druing the period in which the Hon. A.R. Munsoor served his constituency and Parliament. Many were the challenges that he had to face.

Then came the Indo-Lanka Accord with which the entire Muslim community felt that they were betrayed because that paved the way for the temporary merger of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. That resulted in reducing the political strength of the Muslims in the

723 724

[ ]

2019 01

Eastern Province overnight to a position where they were all so angered and were directing the anger towards the Members of Parliament who were serving this House then. I used to have long chats with the Hon. Munsoor subsequently and he used to explain as to how things happened during that period. It is then that I realized that the Hon. Munsoor could never be blamed for what happened then. The decision that the then President J. R. Jayewardene took to sign the Indo-Lanka Accord, which once again is considered as a watershed in this country's political history, was replete with enough incidents all over the country.

Then came several other riots and the so-called "honeymoon period" between the LTTE and the Government during President Premadasa's time. The Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa would remember that there were more than 600 policemen in the Kalmunai Police Station who were disarmed and cold-bloodedly killed. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa) They surrendered. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Yes, they surrendered. Those policemen who surrendered had to face that fate. It was a very difficult period to give political leadership to the people, but the Hon. Munsoor gave that leadership despite the fact that, sometimes, even his house was stoned by his own people because they were so angry, they wanted protection. Such was the time in which the Hon. Munsoor gave leadership to his people. He did not run away from his people, he did not take refuge in Colombo, but was always among the people, serving them. We must realize, whatever political ideologies we may belong to, and appreciate the fact that such gentlemen, when they are no more amongst us, had the courage to give leadership to a beleaguered community at a time when this dreaded terrorism was posing such a threat.

Now, we are living in a time when his own community is accused of terrorism, a time in which the incidents of 21st April have turned the searchlights inwards towards the Muslim community. It is time for us to engage in a serious retrospection to look at where things went wrong. As some would point accusing fingers at political leaders, we must realize that it is the fault of extremism on all sides that finally results in one extremism begetting the other. Therefore, it is important for us to look at the root causes and address those causes, and that is what people like the Hon. A. R. Munsoor did by persuading his leaders to look at issues in the correct perspective. I could talk at length about his service, the way in which he gave leadership to his people.

Sir, I would fail in my duty if I do not mention about the development work he did to his constituency in particular in the Ampara District and in general. In 1978, there was a terrible cyclone that affected the Kalmunai area and the court house got totally destroyed. It was the

Hon. A. R. Munsoor who built the entire court premises for Kalmunai, which still stands testimony to his service. He was a member of that Bar. He built such a massive court house - the court house only had the original courts, the Magistrate Court and the District Court, then - which houses not only the High Court, but the High Court of the Province as well as the Civil Appellate High Courts together with even the Quazi Tribunal when it sits in circuit because it is such a vast premises that he built. He was a leader with a vision.

He built several other public buildings, several school buildings. Wherever you go, people talk about the Hon. Munsoors service. Everybody was astonished when he passed away. The crowds that gathered astounded everybody. He was a forgotten politician, but that people never forgot him was apparent when thousands and thousands of people gathered to bid him goodbye when his Janazah was taken to the burial ground in Kalmunai.

Mr. Speaker he is a personal friend of yours. He always told me that when we proposed him to be sent as Ambassador to Kuwait - you were one of those people who were responsible because you were there selecting the qualified candidates to be sent as emissaries abroad - you were good enough to select him and he always remembered that and always talked about it. He had always had a very special place in his heart for you.

Today, we are paying tribute to such an able politician who is very much missed by his people. He had connections with the famous Kariapper family; he married into the Kariapper family. It is a fact that the Ampara Districts politics, if you see, belongs to only two dynasties. Like the dynasty of Rajapaksa's now, it was then the dynasty of Kariapper's and Majeed Vanniyar's. Those are the two families from which a preponderant number of Members of Parliament came. So, he had the good fortune to marry, I believe, the third daughter, Zohara, who is, I am sure, in the Gallery today. He was also the brother-in-law of the late the Hon. M. M. Musthapha who married another daughter and also was a reputed criminal lawyer from the Kalmunai Bar who came to this House to serve the people. Those two families, the Kariapper family and the Majeed Vanniyar family, had several people representing the people of the Ampara District, the Muslims particularly, in this House. That is a very singular honour to those two families.

So, I would pay my tribute to the Hon. Abdul Razak Munsoor not forgetting several wonderful services he had rendered to his people. His memories will remain fresh in the minds of his people and his contribution in this House, by all. As the Minster of Trade and Commerce and the Minister of Shipping, he had served the people well and he was somebody who would always be remembered for his clean politics, politics devoid of any misgivings that anybody could not point a finger at his political career. He had treated everyone with equal aplomb. People from Maruthamunai still talk about him; people in Kalmunai talk about him and people from Sainthamaruthu talk about him. Yesterday, in fact, I had a lengthy discussion with a big delegation from both these villages who are now fighting with each other for a local

725 726

authority and for division of a Divisional Secretary's Division; there is a big dispute going on. We are trying to resolve the problem by talking to the Tamil National Alliance. Hopefully, we can resolve that problem soon, at least to see that these great gentlemen who are in their graves will be able to lie in peace forever.

With those words, Sir, I would like to convey our condolences to the members of the Hon. Munsoors family, particularly to his wife Zohara, his children Minna, Rahmath and Maryam, his grandchildren and everyone who have come here.

In the meantime, I would also like to pay my condolences to the families of Mr. Senaraja Samaranayake and Mr. V.K. Indika in whose memory we are conducting the Votes of Condolence today.

Thank you. [..11.28] ( ) (The Hon. Gamini Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa) , . , . . .. .

[2.08 p.m.] ( , , , ) ( - , , , , ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - Prime Minister and Minister of National Policies, Economic Affairs, Resettlement and Rehabilitation, Northern Province Development and Youth Affairs) Sir, it is customary for the Prime Minister to say the opening words on a Vote of Condolence. Unfortunately, I was held up elsewhere and could come only now as we are winding up.

I would like to say a few words about the late Hon. A.R. Munsoor. I may not speak at length because I think

the Hon. H.M.M. Harees had said a lot of things that had to be said about the Hon. Munsoor.

The Hon. Munsoor, like me, was a lawyer, but he was far more senior to me. I got to know him when he became the UNP Organizer for Kalmunai and I was the Organizer for Kelaniya and then, for Biyagama. Both of us got resounding victories at the 1977 General Election and we came to Parliament thereafter, and our association lasted throughout those years when we were Members of the Government.

The Hon. Munsoor was responsible for the development of Kalmunai. He started the development of Kalmunai. Kalmunai was a smaller town and without his intervention, it certainly would not have developed at this rate. The Hon. Munsoor also had a difficult task. When the ethnic conflict broke out in 1983, it certainly spread to the Eastern Province. He held that area and did not allow any interruption of work due to terrorist activities.

The Hon. Munsoor started off as a District Minister, functioned as a District Minister and ended up as the Trade Minister under President Premadasa. He was very conscious of the development of trade and exports and certainly made his own contribution to that field. He was also one of those who would take part in debates; he was a very frequent speaker. He was well-read and I must say that he made a lasting contribution to the Kalmunai area and also the contribution he made in this House as a Member has to be remembered. I remember the times when he used to come and request me for school buildings and teachers for the improvement of education in the Kalmunai Electorate. That was foremost in his mind. I remember going down to Kalmunai with him for some of those openings and coming back in the night to stay at Galoya in Ampara. Those were very enjoyable trips, not only because of the school functions, but also because I got to know the area quite well.

Sir, we kept in touch with the Hon. Munsoor even after he ceased to be a Member of Parliament. He was very active in the affairs of the UNP, giving us support. Unfortunately, he passed away and deprived us of that wise counsel we had when he was in retirement. The Hon. Munsoor will be remembered by the people of Kalmunai and the people of that area because he out and gave leadership during very difficult times, both securitywise and politically and he balanced it out. He must be remembered. I still remember the day he became an MP, came down to Sirikotha for the first meeting, the time we came to the old Parliament and the time we came here. His achievements were many.

Sir, I do not want take more time and wish to join with the others in paying my condolences on the death of the Hon. Munsoor.
