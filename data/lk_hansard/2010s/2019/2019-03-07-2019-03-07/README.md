[11.42a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for the opportunity to say a few words at the Debate on the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill for 2019.

Before I address some issues concerning the Budget Proposals, may I take this opportunity to address another matter, now that the Hon. Prime Minister is also in the House. Reference has been made by the previous speaker to the process in the UN Human Rights Council, whose sessions are now happening in Geneva. There was some reference made to this yesterday also in the House. It is important to place on record the history of these events.

After the end of the war in May, 2009, it was in 2012 that the UN Human Rights Council, for the first time, passed a declaratory Resolution primarily calling on Sri Lanka to implement Sri Lankas own Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commissions Recommendations. By then, the LLRC Report had been published in December, 2011 and the Council only asked Sri Lanka to implement its own Commissions Recommendations. The following year, in 2013, again another Resolution was passed, again asking Sri Lanka to implement the LLRC Recommendations. It was a Resolution to promote reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka. After two long years, when there was no movement at all with

regard to Sri Lankas own domestic process - that was the LLRC - it was only then in 2014, a different kind of Resolution was mooted and that was to mandate the High Commissioner for Human Rights to conduct an investigation into several allegations that had been made by then, particularly with regard to what happened at the last stages of the war and an inquiry was conducted. That was called the OISL - the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights Investigation on Sri Lanka. That was the OISL and the Report of OISL was due in March, 2015.

However, in January, 2015, there was a change of Government and using that, the new Government appealed to the Human Rights Council to delay the publication of the OISL Report. It was in February, 2015 those negotiations happened and the Council agreed to delay the publication of that international investigation report - OISL Report - until September, 2015. In September, 2015, on the 16th of September, 2015, the OISL Report was published. Two days prior to that, the then Foreign Minister - the present Finance Minister - the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, made a speech at the high-level segment giving various assurances of the new Government to this multilateral body of the UN. Based upon the Foreign Ministers assurances given on the 14th and the international investigation report that was published on the 16th of September, 2015, a Resolution was adopted on the 01st of October, 2015. That was the UNHRC Resolution 30/1. Sri Lanka rightly co-sponsored that Resolution. I say rightly because that Resolution was negotiated with the main sponsors of the Resolution, which is called the "core-group". The USA, the UK, Macedonia and Montenegro were the core-group countries. Sri Lanka negotiated with them and agreed on the text. We also welcomed Sri Lanka agreeing to attend to those matters that were listed in the Resolution 30/1. The High Commissioner was to present an oral report in nine months and a full written report in 18 months.

When that full written report became due in March, 2017, Sri Lanka again asked for further time to implement several of the recommendations because only a few had just been addressed or started and that was done. Resolution 34/1 was passed in March, 2017, again co-sponsored by Sri Lanka. We welcomed that as well although there was a misinformation campaign carried on in the Tamil areas saying that the TNA was giving the Government further time.

' ' , , .

It was to extend a monitoring and supervision by the human rights body. Now, according to 34/1, a written report is due and I believe that will be presented to the Council tomorrow. The Government of Sri Lanka has already received a copy of that report.

Yesterday, there was disturbing news from His Excellency the President at a meeting with newspaper

379 380

[ ]

2019 07

editors stating that he will be sending three of his own representatives to Geneva and that he will be seeking the UN body to let Sri Lanka handle its own affairs. Now I must say something very clearly here. Sri Lanka has been allowed to handle its own affairs. That is why in 2012 and 2013, this body only urged Sri Lanka to implement its own LLRC recommendations. When that was not done an international investigation was mandated. Subsequently, it was with Sri Lankas consent to promote accountability and reconciliation that Resolution 30/1 and subsequently Resolution 34/1 were passed. It is Sri Lankas assurance of cooperation with this multilateral body, with the world body and with the international community at large, that these issues are to be addressed.

I must also record the fact that we are very disappointed with the pace of these reforms and various actions that Sri Lanka has agreed to take. Even to establish an Office on Missing Persons, it took so long. But even after the law was passed in this House, it took another full year before that law was even gazetted. No explanation was given as to why that delay occurred. Now the OMP is functioning. They are just starting to establish branch offices. One was established in Matara the other day. I do not know why in Matara, but the next one is supposed to be in Mannar. They are only beginning these work. We need the technological support and various other assistances that the international community can give us to continue with this difficult task. Sri Lanka must agree to a further Resolution of which the core-group has already given notice. That is an obligation on the part of Sri Lanka. That is an undertaking that Sri Lanka gave in September, 2015 that all of these things will be done. It is in a spirit of cooperation that the world community is working with Sri Lanka and despite the disappointment due to long delays, we have also agreed that there must be this supervision, there must be this monitoring without which this will not move forward. So, as much as we are disappointed with the pace of progress, our position has been that a new Resolution must be adopted at the UN Human Rights Council and Sri Lanka must, as a necessity, agree with that and co-sponsor that Resolution yet again. There is again a misinformation campaign carried out primarily in the Tamil media and by Tamil politicians to say that we are sailing along with the Government of Sri Lanka to keep granting extensions of time. That is an absolutely false propaganda.

. . , . . . . , . . ,

. , . .

I would be grateful if the Hon. Prime Minister can respond to this because we have had the assurance, not just us but you have given the world the assurance that you will cooperate and therefore it is necessary that the country co-sponsors a new Resolution and not just co-sponsor Resolution after Resolution - this will be the third time - but, actually implement it on the ground. Our people are desperate and are thoroughly disappointed at the pace with which these things have moved.

Having said that, let me quickly move to certain aspects of the Budget.

How much time do I have, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) 25 minutes . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) ? ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Seven minutes . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay, thank you.

With regard to the Budget, our general reaction to the Budget is positive. In that, we think this is a responsible Budget, given the economic constraints that the Government and the country is facing at present. Particularly, we are thankful that a special fund called the Palmyrah Fund has been established. This is something that we have been asking for a long time that the war-affected areas in the North and the East must be developed at a rapid pace and we hope that this Fund will be utilized to the maximum and under the Prime Ministers Ministry, with the new arrangement that we have come to, that we would be able to implement projects that will result primarily in livelihood projects being organized and jobs created for our young people. But, there is another matter that I want to raise.

On the 22nd of February, as the Chair of the Committee on Public Finance, I presented a Report in this House. This is a Report that the Committee is supposed to present within two weeks of the Budget Speech. We are supposed to present another Report within four days of the Budget Speech - a deadline which we can never meet. Nevertheless, we are trying to present it by next

381 382

week for this Budget. But this Report is with regard to the Budget that was presented in November 2017 for the year 2018. It has startling revelations and I have spoken about this in public as well. The reason we have brought that out in public is that for three years we have tried to work with the officials of the Ministry of Finance. Unfortunately we have not had much cooperation. Yesterday we had a meeting and I must say that the attitude has changed. After we went public, the attitude has changed and now they seem to be cooperating a little. But there are very serious issues in the format in which these things happen.

The Budget Estimates - those big red books that are all over the table - have figures which have no relevance to the figures that the Minister of Finance gives when he makes the Budget Speech. A very few people know this. It is in two different formats. The Hon. Minister gives it in an economic format, whilst the Budget Estimates are in an accounting format and you cannot compare the two easily. Eventually what is adopted is something totally different and what is implemented invariably has nothing to do with either the Budget Estimates or what the Ministry of Finance presents as Budget Proposals or the finalized figures - but it is something totally different. Now, this has to change and we have been urging that this must change. For a more responsible budgetary process, one particular format must be followed. We have given the officials a format to give us information on and by last afternoon, we got some of that information. Hopefully, we will be able to present a Report very soon.

But, as I said, there are startling revelations. One is, there is an underestimation of interest payments. We do not know how this happens. An examination of last five years has shown us that underestimation is by 52.8 per cent of foreign interest payments. That just cannot be. The Ministry must have a schedule of payment that are due. They must know how much is due. So one cannot understand how they cannot get this right. The answer they gave us is that there is currency fluctuation because these loans are due in dollars and these figures are in rupees, granted, there may be some variation but that is also envisaged; that is also known that there will be currency fluctuation. It just cannot be over 50 per cent variants in underestimating interest payments.

There are lots of issues. I do not have time to deal with that, I am talking about interest payments, because that is a bulk of our expenditure. If that is off by more than 50 per cent, then the entire Budget figures are false, because you underestimate the expenditure and heavily overestimate revenue. We have given several examples where revenue collection is heavily overestimated. So you put the two together, actual money that is available for all of those fine proposals that you present is minimal. You do not even have half that money to actually implement. So this has been, I think, the most crucial issue. When I started speaking on this issue, I welcomed the Budget approach, the responsible approach and so on and that the very important areas that the Hon. Minister has set out will be developed, will be addressed and all of that. But

our fear is that when we look back at how these things have worked in the last several years- I am not saying just last five years, this is a pattern that has gone on for several decades - our fear is that in implementation, we will not even reach 20 per cent, because when we examined for several years in the last three years, reaching 20 per cent of implementation is considered a success.That is a success. There are certain areas in which even 5 per cent has not been reached. So, it is not good to lay out grandiose plans and announce various reliefs and so on. But in actual fact, everyone knows only a very little of that will ever be realized. So this can change only if the officials - I am glad that the officials are now moving in that direction - co-operate with us.

There is another matter. The Department of National Budget has a huge amount allocated. That is called the "Discretionary Budgeting". Officials tell us, We need that money to keep in handy when the Cabinet or the Ministers says that they want money for something and whenever we are confronted with having to spend on unallocated budgetary issues, we just take it out of that. That is a very bad practice. We have discouraged them and they have given us an assurance that this year they will keep that to 2 per cent of the total Budget. That itself is quite high. So, we have several measures that the Minister announced for which there is no provision in the Appropriation Bill or even in the Budget Estimates. Where is the money going to come from for those expenditures? It is going to come out of this Discretionary Budgetary Provision that you are putting in. So, that has to change. The budgetary process has to be transparent. We cannot go on like this and achieve the kind of development indices that we are aiming at. So the whole process has to change and I urge the Minister. The Minister did another thing the other day. He has announced various measures without even mentioning the cost involved in those proposals.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, I am winding up.

So, we have invited the Minister to the Committee tomorrow, to come and tell us what the implication of that proposal is. There is no rupees and cents given to several of the proposals that were made in the Budget Speech. Those things must change. The whole approach to the Budget must change.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you. The next speaker is the Hon. Wajira Abeywardana.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . 20 . [2.23p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama - Minister of Development Strategies, International Trade) Mr. Presiding Member, the 2019 National Budget has outlined a progressive agenda for action to place the economy on a stronger growth path, with a twin focus on growing enterprises and nurturing the poor.

405 406

The Budget has also ensured that the macroeconomy is placed on a solid footing as well, despite the challenging circumstances that were brought about as a result of the constitutional crisis late last year. For a third consecutive year we forecast achieving a primary surplus on the budget, which should serve as a strong indication to all sovereign bond investors and rating agencies that we remain committed to the ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts and effective debt management. The prudent macroeconomic management outlined in the 2019 Budget will prove to be a cornerstone in foreign investors' confidence in the economy and ensure that the necessary macro indicators remain stable to provide a conducive environment for the enterprise sector to thrive.

I wish to particularly make mention of some important proposals in this year's Budget that relate to my Ministry's agenda of trade, investment, competitiveness and economic transformation.

The 2019 Budget has continued the support to programmes initiated in the 2018 Budget - this includes the Export Market Access Scheme and the National Export Strategy. The Export Market Access Scheme has an allocation of Rs.400 million in the Appropriation Bill. This programme will support companies seeking to establish an export presence, expand exports and break into new markets. The National Export Strategy -NES- has an allocation of Rs.250 million as per the Budget Proposal. These resources will support sectors including electronics, spices and concentrates, boat building, ICT, wellness tourism, processed foods and logistics and help to diversify our export basket. I also welcome the support to the improvement of the National Quality Infrastructure, provided through the budget allocation for the NES. This will help to improve the quality of our products.

The Budget also supports the seafood exports sector through investments in high-end fishing vessels that are compliant with EU requirements to access GSP Plus. This includes vessels with chilling facilities, safety and monitoring features and the Government will bear 50 per cent of the cost of these investments. This comes at a welcome juncture, when our exports to Europe and other destinations are on the rise, and there is a continuing need to upgrade.

The solid tyre sector has become a major export for Sri Lanka and I welcome the proposal where the Government will facilitate the private sector to invest in testing and prototyping facilities for product innovation to enable the industry to remain at the helm of global markets. Support is also being given to improve latex production by doubling incentives for rubber planting.

Sri Lanka is also the world's major producer of Ceylon Cinnamon, and the Budget will support the ongoing initiative to secure Geographic Indicator for this product, which will add to its export competitiveness.

We welcome the proposal to expand the "IT Initiative" - which we began under the 2018 Budget - to train 1,000

non-technical graduates through internship programmes where the Government will bear 50 per cent of the salary. Moreover, the Budget has made an important step in changing the incentives for IT firms - the hitherto applicable minimum employment requirement of 50 employees to benefit from the 35 per cent additional deduction for the IT sector has been removed. This is a very welcome move.

The Government remains committed to the strategy of building a network of trade agreements to link into regional value chains and expand our presence in the growing markets of East and South East Asia. After reviewing the Singapore FTA, the Government will build on progress made in negotiations with India, China, Thailand and Bangladesh. We are very conscious that signing the FTAs alone would not be enough to ensure that our enterprises succeed in the large markets of India and China. Which is why our proposal to support the "Break into India Strategy" and "China Market Entry Strategy" is so important, and I welcome the Budget Proposals to support these programmes. Firms establishing in these and other key markets will be supported by proposed trading houses for priority sectors which will help Sri Lankan firms secure distribution networks, buyer linkages and other requisite support in market penetration.

The Government intends to continue its effort of removing remaining para-tariffs, to reduce the anti-export bias, the anti-trade orientation and improve overall competitiveness of the tradable sector. Yet, we are conscious of the need to help enterprises and workers adjust to the new market conditions brought on by para-tariff removal and trade liberalization. Which is why we are introducing the trade adjustment programme this year. I welcome the Budget 2019 allocation of Rs. 250 million in 2019 to commence implementation of the Trade Adjustment Programme, including setting up of the Trade and Productivity Commission.

The Economic Service Charge of 0.5 per cent has been reduced to 0.25 per cent for export companies including IT and tourism. This will support cash flows of those companies.

I welcome the proposal to continue with reforming the Customs Ordinance, to make it more contemporary and more facilitative of international trade, anchored to the objectives of enhancing transparency, improving risk management and strengthening the appeals processes. Meanwhile, the proposed launching of an "Authorized Economic Operator Programme" in 2019 will greatly improve risk management of high-risk cargo while making it easier for compliant traders. The implementation of the National Single Window will be kicked off this year having already completed the blue print for it in 2018. I welcome the allocation of Rs. 30 million for this purpose.

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. S.C. Mutukumarana) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Sir, with regard to the strengthening the investment climate for FDI, I welcome the 2019 Budgets proposed package for high value investments. This entails removing of upfront investment costs like NBT, PAL and so on for investments over US Dollars 50 million, and additional capital allowances ranging from 100 per cent to 150 per cent. For investments over US Dollars 1 billion, additional benefits are being proposed, including exemptions from dividend tax and PAYE are also proposed. I appeal to the Hon. Minister to raise the capital allowance to 250 per cent for investments over US Dollars 250 million, particularly in the manufacturing sector since we now need to attract big-ticket investors. These will now go through the process of amendments to IR Act. To further attract FDIs, new industrial zones are being developed. Last week, we opened an industrial zone in Bingiriya and we will have new zones in Milleniya and Wagawatta.

To enhance competitiveness and focus on innovation, I welcome the proposal to allocate funds for the "Enterprise Innovation Programme", anchored to the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Strategy 2018-2022 that was approved by the Cabinet recently. This will support the development of new innovative projects and technology by Sri Lankan firms. The Programme will provide matching grants for proof of concept, prototyping, R&D and technology adoption. The EIP was developed in close collaboration and consultation with the private sector and technical input from the World Bank, and is set to be the most unique and impactful scheme of support for enterprise innovation that Sri Lanka has seen. It is most important to invest in research and innovation for sustainable development. Research and innovation should be high on our agenda to take our country to the next level: a middle income country.

I also welcome the continuation of the "Enterprise Sri Lanka" Programme that is providing a major boost to enterprise and innovation in Sri Lanka. The proposed guarantee fund for SMEs will support the implementation of innovative business ideas whose owners lack the relevant capital or collateral, and help banks move

409 410

towards risk and cash flow-based lending. I welcome the new initiative to connect "Enterprise Sri Lanka" loan recipients with institutions such as ITI, ICTA, EDB and the universities to ensure that we build an effective ecosystem for startups and small businesses. It is also noteworthy that the Budget 2019 has proposed that Government procurement will be made more startup and SME friendly. The proposal to ensure that at least 10 per cent of the value of government procurement earmarked for Sri Lankan startups and SMEs is also most welcome.

Hon. Presiding Member, these are some of the many elements contained in the 2019 Budget that provide a fillip to our country's enterpreneurs who have been yearning for new and innovative programmes of support. This Budget strengthens the Vision 2025 ambition of making Sri Lanka a high-growth economy that is driven by private enterprise and also ensures inclusiveness.

So, I congratulate the Hon. Minister of Finance and his team on this progressive forward-looking Budget where every sector has been looked after. For the poor - there will be another 600,000 Samurdhi recepients. The armed forces, public officers, pensioners, the youth, women and the true entrepreneurs are all looked after.

Finally, I look forward to working very closely with the Hon. Minister of Finance and the other Ministries in implementation of these Budget Proposals.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . 11 .
