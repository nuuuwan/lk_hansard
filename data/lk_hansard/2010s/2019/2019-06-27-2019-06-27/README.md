. . . , . They are unaware that this procedure has been adopted right through out. Whether it is a UNP Government or a PA Government or a UPFA Government, we have to adopt this procedure. I am surprised that the Chair is allowing this type of an open Debate without a proper presentation of a report. . . . ? . . , , . . - - . We have been able to bring everyone to book within two months. . I do

not think he can make such a statement. Then, he should come to the House and make a statement; give all the details and close the inquiry. Let the Prime Minister not make another propaganda drive on this. We know, with difficulty, the Leader of the Opposition is extending support to the Government and therefore, we have been able, today, to win back the confidence of most of the countries that clamped on the tourist arrivals. . . travel advisory note has been removed.

Daily Mirror" PSC on Easter attacks: A drama rehearsed at Temple Trees :

Says he had not been summoned before it and would never go before it

19A is an NGO conspiracy and a curse on the country

Totally against SOFA with US

Those are the main lines, the highlights of the President's statement yesterday.

Also, he has said that the Attorney-General had advised him that this inquiry is sub judice and he has informed that to the Hon. Speaker. The House does not know. The Hon. Speaker has not informed us whether he was informed by the President of the country -

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) We would also like to know. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yes, we would like to know; both sides would like to know what is sub judice.

Today, the Hon. Leader of the House raised this. When we get up to raise a matter under Standing Order 27(2), the Hon. Speaker says that we have no right to debate. But, today we spent one hour debating some other issue raised under the Standing Order 27(2). So, the Chair has also not been consistent. It is very sad to say that the Chair has not been consistent in following Parliamentary procedure and practice. I am sorry to criticize the Chair, but that will be a way - if Parliament collapses, there will be an anarchy in this country. So, let us not bring Parliament to a situation of collapse.

I want to quote from The Island which has also the same interview given by His Excellency the

President on this subject. It is worthwhile for everyone to give attention to the Presidents statement.

[3.57 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Hon. Presiding Member, I am happy that I have been given an opportunity to speak a few words on the

occasion of this Debate when we are discussing the Emergency Regulations. Let me, at the very outset, point out that these Regulations have been promulgated to deal with an extraordinary situation that has arisen as a result of the Easter Sunday terrorist attacks.

It is because the ordinary laws are not sufficient in the context of the situation that has developed after these tragic incidents that the President has gazetted these Regulations. However, after the Emergency Regulations are brought into force, there is no purpose served if the powers given to the security forces are not used for the benefit of the people. The main purpose of these Regulations was, in the first instance, to capture and dismantle the terrorist network. It is with the authority of the President and the Prime Minister that this has been achieved and all those connected with the despicable incidents have been captured.

The next important matter is to make sure that the security of the people and the country as a whole is ensured. As Muslim Parliamentarians, we have been deeply concerned about the increased targeting of the Muslim community after the terrorist attacks of April 21st. Although the Muslim community had provided information to the authorities regarding the unacceptable activities of some of the individuals involved in those attacks since 2012, no action had been taken against those individuals. After the Easter Sunday attacks, the Muslim community cooperated fully with the security forces, so much so that the authorities were able to announce within three weeks of the incidents that the terrorist network had been dismantled and 99 per cent of the suspects have been apprehended. However, the three weeks of relative calm ended on May 12th and 13th when gangs of thugs in motor bikes roamed various villages in the Kurunegala District as well as Minuwangoda torching Muslim business places as well as mosques in an organized and premeditated attack. There was hardly any protection given to the Muslims in those areas who had to face the brunt of these attacks.

Hate speech is spreading on the social media as well as other media giving rise to insecurity and fears among the Muslims living all over the country. In the meantime, various individuals and organizations are inciting people and acting in clear violation of the Emergency Regulations by making statements, not only against the Muslims, but also against Islam. Despite these violations of the Emergency Regulations, adequate action is not being taken to restrain these groups thus putting the safety of the Muslims at risk.

It is in this environment of escalating tension and vitriolic attacks on Muslims and Governmental inaction, an announcement has been made that the Bodu Bala Sena is organizing a meeting in Kandy where they expect to gather 10,000 Buddhist monks. Going by past experience, we know what they will say at these meetings, thus creating an environment for breach of peace and undermining the safety and security of the Muslim community. What is of utmost concern is how such meetings are organized and held in total violation of the Emergency Regulations without the security forces taking

preventive action. I am happy that in the case of the blatant discriminatory act of the Wennappuwa Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman who had made an order preventing Muslim traders from selling their goods at the weekly pola, the local police have taken action. So, I wish to call upon the Government to take action also to prevent the planned meeting in Kandy organized by the Bodu Bala Sena and other similar gatherings, by which tension can be escalated.

As you all are aware, it is worth repeating that the Muslim community completely disassociated itself from the actions of the small group of terrorists who launched the devastating attacks on the churches and tourist hotels. The Muslim community not only condemned the attacks with one voice, but also helped the security forces to identify and capture those involved with this group. However, we, as a community, are deeply troubled at the events that have taken place since the attack. There has been a systematic demonizing of Muslims in the past few weeks by feeding, through both conventional and social media, falsehoods and half-truths. An atmosphere has been created in the country where the ordinary Muslim people live in fear and uncertainty and are unable to get on with their day-to-day lives.

What is happening is that the same forces which began targeting the Muslims in or around 2012 are making use of the situation that has arisen after the Easter Sunday attacks to implement their anti-Muslim agenda. Various attempts are being made to change the Muslim Personal Law, the Muslim form of dress, Muslim food habits and, in short, anything that is "Muslim". None of these practices have, in any way, harmed the non-Muslims, but deliberate misinformation about these practices is being fed to the innocent Sinhala-Buddhist community in order to instil fear in them.

The cry for "one country, one law" is totally misleading because, in fact, there is only one law, but the problem is that the law is not applied equally to everyone. For example, innocent people are arrested for minor reasons like having Arabic tapes or books with Arabic letters and not released on bail. However, in contrast, hooligans, racists and religious fanatics who set fire to Muslim shops, houses and mosques are released on bail despite them being acts in the nature of terrorism.

In fact, the Muslims have always stood for one country. That is why they never supported the demand for a separate State by the LTTE. That is why the LTTE drove the Muslims away from the Northern Province in 1990, the mosques in Kattankudi and Eravur were attacked and worshippers were killed.

Then there is a misunderstanding about the Sharia Law. The Sharia is mistakenly associated with the cutting of hands and similar punishments. The Sharia applies only to Muslims and relates to all the practices that Muslims have to follow. For example, Muslims are required to pray five times a day and this is part of the Sharia. Other examples where Sharia is applicable only to

Muslims are, how one should do business; how one should settle all one's debts before one dies; how we are to look after our families; how we should treat our neighbours and so on. According to the Sharia, suicide is a grave sin, which the terrorists committed. Even killing innocent people, as was done by the Easter Sunday bombers, is a sin and is in contravention of the Sharia.

In conclusion, let me remind this House that ensuring the safety and security of the people of this country including the Muslims is the responsibility of the Government. They must not fail in their duty at this critical time when the country is faced with unprecedented challenges.

Thank you.

pending before the Select Committee of Parliament would have a substantial danger, a prejudicial and adverse impact on the ongoing criminal investigations being presently conducted in that regard. Further, the said proceedings would also have a prejudicial and adverse impact on pending judicial proceedings in the Supreme Court and the judicial proceedings impending in other judicial fora. In the circumstances, it would be prudent that necessary steps are taken to inform the relevant authorities of the above concerns in order to ensure that the said authorities take cognizance of same with regard to the matters pending inquiry before the aforementioned Select Committee of Parliament.
