(ii) if so, the reason for not granting permission to GI Travels (R.No. MRCA/umra/041/2018) which submitted the lowest bid for the amount to be charged from devotees out of agents and institutions selected to accompany devotees for Haj pilgrimage; and

(iii) whether opportunities will be made available to the said agency as it has been in possession of the Umra permit for over five years and has discharged its responsibilities satisfactorily and is more capable of performing this task and it has stepped in to accompany Haj devotees to Mecca at a minimum cost?

(b) If not, why? ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Abdul Haleem - Minister of Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs) Sir, I table* the Answer. * : Answer tabled:

(a) (i) In selecting new agencies for accompanying Haj devotees, a method of selecting institutions which have provided a good service without any complaint for five years after being granted Umra permits is in operation.

(ii) In selecting agents for the Haj pilgrimage, there is no bidding process. In the year 2018, only the agents who obtained more than 50 marks at the interview were selected as appropriate. GI Travels had obtained only 28 marks at the interview held in the year 2018 and therefore, was not selected as a Haj agent.

(iii) If the specified number of marks is obtained at the interview for the selection of agents for the coming year, the said institution can get an opportunity as a Haj pilgrimage agent.

The GMOA is better known for the number of murderous strikes it has called jeopardising the lives of the poorest people in this country when they are most vulnerable,

than for any noteworthy contribution to medical ethics or medical education."

"Why I resigned: SLMC President hits out at archaic Medical Ordinance"

, Medical Ordinance . . , . - Sri Lanka Medical Council - 2019 03 - press statement - . It states, I quote:

"Reference web publication (https://www.gmoa.lk/terminate-civil-rights-of-rajitha/) and social media dissemination regarding claims about the SLMC.

1. I was appointed as the President SLMC by the Hon. Minister since January 2019. However to date he has not influenced me on any matter in relation to the proper functioning of the activities of the SLMC.

2. It is the members of the council that decide on the functions of the SLMC.

The Council consists of,

a. President and members appointed by the Minister.

b. Dean/Representatives of State Medical/Dental Faculties.

c. Members elected to the council.

Under the elected categories there are four members who represent the GMOA.

3. I wish to emphasize that the primary objective of the SLMC is to safeguard the rights of patients/people. Unfortunately we have no members that represent public in the Council.

It is not a secret that the GMOA safeguards the rights and privileges of doctors which is acceptable, but their political affiliations are transparent. Therefore it is possible that their opinions in the council are influenced by these factors.

It is mandatory that the minister in charge of an institution, and in this instance the Minister of Health is responsible for all decisions based on statute and any amendments should be recommended by him, through the Cabinet to the Parliament.

4. The SLMC ordinance came into effect in 1927 more than 90 years ago. There have been amendments from time to time. However an overall change in the ordinance is necessary in order to protect the rights of the people/patients and to eliminate as much as possible persons with conflict of interests.

The proposal to change the ordinance is timely since the ordinance is archaic.

The Cabinet Paper was presented for this purpose based on a concept paper developed by a five members committee appointed by the Minister of Health which comprised of the former Attorney-General. The proposed task force to draw up a new enactment will consist of a wide spectrum of professionals and lay people in the formulation of the amendments.

5. Doctors trade unions are there to protect the rights of doctors. But not to protect the rights of the patients. I wish this clarifies the allegations made in the GMOA website, against the SLMC."

"We wish to inform you that a statement mentioned in the said letter dated 12.07.2019 is denied based on the following reasons..."

.

"Chairman of the NMRA Prof. Asitha De Silva was a Senior Professor in Pharmacology who was attached to the University of Kelaniya. He was appointed as a member of the Authority by the Hon. Minister and before accepting his appointment, he declared that financial or other conflict of interest pertaining to his discharge of duties as a member of the Authority vide letter dated 31/5/2016.

Accordingly he has fully informed that of his existing obligations that he need to continue with. He has held various positions in academia over 23 years and has held a post of university professor in pharmacology since 2005. He declared that he is presently (as

well as within the last 3 years) engaged in the areas of work in his professional capacity in teaching and examining undergraduates and postgraduate medical student, performing administering and managing medical research, including clinical trials in collaboration with local and international investigators and institutions, and private consultation practice outside university working hours.

Based on the above declaration Hon. Minister is of a view that no reason to believe that any of the above functions conflicts with his responsibilities as a member of the NMRA nor will adversely affect the Authoritys functions.

And also Chairman of the NMRA has achieved the highest level of academic attainment in one of the most complex and sophisticated disciplines at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, Doctor of Philosophy from the University of OXFORD in clinical pharmacology. He is an accomplished and a respected medical professional and academic. He has received a multiplicity of awards and accolades throughout his career, which has never been any credible complaint against him. His competence has never been questioned. Character never assailed and commitment never doubted and this qualification also never challenged by any one even the court case against him."

Sri Lankas public health successes were highlighted at the WHO Regional Committee for South-East Asia in September 2016, which the country hosted after a gap of 11 years.

The countrys achievements are a testament to robust leadership, unwavering political commitment and strong partnerships dedicated to ensuring healthy lives and positive well-being for all.

. , commitment achievements . , , . . :

Steadfast political commitment helped the country achieve major gains in 2016. Sri Lanka withstood pressure from the food and beverage industry and introduced traffic light labelling on sugary food and drinks. Tobacco taxation was increased significantly despite resistance.

There will be many challenges ahead as the country gears towards plain packaging, introducing stricter tobacco and alcohol control legislation and extension of the traffic light labelling system. WHO will continue to support the country in its mission to resist industry interference and address the growing challenge of NCDS.

Sri Lanka is one of six countries for targeted WHO support on NCD prevention and control from all three levels of the organization - WHO Headquarters, WHO regional Office for South- East Asia and WHO Country Office for Sri Lanka. This will provide a major boost to the countrys efforts to reduce the NCD burden.
