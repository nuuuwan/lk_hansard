ESTABLISHMENT OF AN AMERICAN MILITARY BASE ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) , . . , , , . . . . . , .

821 822

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Leader of the House, are you going to respond? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Douglas Devananda has raised a Question in the context of recent media reports alleging the establishment of a US military base in Trincomalee in the Eastern Province. He referred to the statements made by the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara and the Hon. (Ven.) Athuraliye Rathana Thero.

The United States of America and Sri Lanka enjoy an excellent, multifaceted, bilateral relationship. In a regional and global context, Sri Lanka and the USA are committed to building an open and resilient Indo-Pacific Region where all countries can prosper. We are committed to protect international laws, safeguards and standards and work to protect the sovereignty of our nations.

Sir, the United States of America has not indicated any interest, any wish or desire to establish a base in the Eastern Province in Trincomalee or in any other part of Sri Lanka during any of the discussions that have been held between the two Governments.

The US Embassy in Colombo had also issued a statement on 20th January, 2019 in response to erroneous media reports alleging that the US intends to establish a military base in Sri Lanka.

While thanking the Hon. Douglas Devananda for raising this question and allowing me an opportunity to clarify matters, I would like to urge the Hon. Members of this House to kindly check facts before they decide to make statements to the press on matters of this nature in future.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa)

Hon. Sampanthan, you met me the other day and wanted time to make a clarification on a matter I have already giving a Ruling. Of course, you can raise it as a point of Order. Now you can speak about it.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Sir, I raise the matter I discussed with you as a point of Order. I will not specifically refer to the matter on which you have given a Ruling, but there are other matters which I think in the public interest need to be placed on record and that is what I propose to do in the course of the Statement I make today.

You made a Statement in Parliament, Sir, on the 18th of December, 2018 pertaining to the position of the Leader of the Opposition. In the course of the said Statement, you mentioned that you had received a letter from the Secretary of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance which claimed to have the second largest number of Members of Parliament and requesting that the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa be appointed as the Leader of the Opposition. You also stated that you were acceding to that request as the UPFA had the second largest number of Members of Parliament.

Some Hon. Members of Parliament raised questions in regard to this matter on the said date and stated, firstly, that though the UPFA indisputably had the second largest number of Members of Parliament, they could not hold the post of the Leader of the Opposition as they were a part of the Government. Secondly, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, the appointee to the post of the Leader of the

825 826

Opposition, under Article 99 Subsection 13 (a) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, subsequent to his having become a Member of the Podujana Peramuna, a political party distinct and different from the UPFA, on whose nomination paper his name appeared at the time of the election and 30 days having elapsed from the date on which he ceased to be a Member of the UPFA, ceased to be a Member of Parliament and could not, therefore, be the Leader of the Opposition. You stated that you will respond to those questions on a later date.

I made a Statement in Parliament on the 19th of December, 2018, in the course of which I myself referred to the aforesaid two matters. In the course of the Statement, I stated that in September, 2015, as the Leader of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi, the second largest party in the Opposition in the Sri Lankan Parliament, you recognized me as the Leader of the Opposition. Further, in August, 2018, as the Leader of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi, the second largest party in Parliament, you once again recognized me as the Leader of the Opposition. On both these occasions, you recognized the Leader of the second largest party in Parliament as the Leader of the Opposition for the reason that the largest party in Opposition in Parliament, the UPFA, was also represented in the Government.

The Hon. Deputy Speaker on your behalf made a Statement in Parliament on the 08th of January, 2019, where he stated your position in regard to the aforesaid matters. In the course of the said Statement, there is no reference whatsoever to the UPFA also being represented in Government and therefore, not being entitled to serve as the official Opposition. You have thereby failed to refer to the crucial reason stated by you when recognizing me, as the Leader of the second largest party in Opposition, as the Leader of the Opposition twice: first, in September, 2015 and second, in August, 2018.

In regard to the aforesaid matters, I consider it my duty to place on record the following matters for your information and necessary, appropriate action:

(a) Under Article 30 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, the President of the Republic of Sri Lanka is the Head of the State, the Head of the Executive and of the Government.

(b) Under Article 42 Subsections (1), (2) and (3) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka,

(1) there shall be a Cabinet of Ministers charged with the direction and control of the Government and the Republic;

(2) the Cabinet of Ministers shall be collectively responsible and answerable to Parliament and

(3) the President shall be a member of the Cabinet of Ministers and shall be the Head of the Cabinet of Ministers.

So, you will observe from the provisions of the Articles I mentioned earlier that the President of the Republic of Sri Lanka is the Head of the Executive and of the Government, a Member of the Cabinet of Ministers and also the Head of the Cabinet of Ministers.

The Cabinet of Ministers of which the President is a member and the Head shall be collectively responsible and answerable to Parliament. Further, according to Article 51 of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the current President, as long as he holds the office of President, may assign to himself the subjects and functions of Defence, Mahaweli Development and Environment, and determine the Ministries to be in his charge for that purpose, and the President on his own volition has assigned to himself the subjects and functions of Defence, Mahaweli Development and Environment. The President has also assigned to himself other subjects and functions.

The President is also the Head of the UPFA and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, a constituent party of the UPFA. You will observe, Mr. Speaker, thus, that the current President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, while being a Member of the Cabinet of Ministers holding several portfolios and the Head of the Cabinet of Ministers, the Head of the Executive and of the Government and while being collectively responsible and answerable to Parliament as a Member of the Cabinet of Ministers is also the Head of the UPFA and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, a constituent party of the UPFA.

Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, sought to be appointed as the Leader of the Opposition is a leading Member of the UPFA and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, a constituent Member of the UPFA. In fact, his name has been proposed to the position of the Leader of the Opposition by the Secretary of the UPFA.

You will thus observe that the President who is the Head of the Executive and the Government, member of the Cabinet of Ministers holding several portfolios and Head of the Cabinet of Ministers and the purported appointee to the position of the Leader of the Opposition, Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, are both from the United Peoples Freedom Alliance and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, a constituent Party of the UPFA.

You will thus observe that there is a clear and definite conflict of interest between the duties and functions performed by the President in the capacities referred to above and the duties and functions of Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa in his capacity as the Leader of the Opposition. They both belong to the UPFA and its constituent party, the SLFP. In this context, may I refer to an article written by Dr. Nihal Jayawickrama, in The Sunday Island of 6th January, 2019 wherein Dr. Nihal Jayawickrama, a legal luminary states the following, and I quote:

Under the Constitution, the President is the Head of the Government. Of his own choice, Maithripala Sirisena is also the President of the SLFP and of the UPFA, which is a coalition of like-minded political parties that includes the SLFP. The Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, who claims to be a member of the SLFP/UPFA, is reportedly now the Leader of the Opposition. Therefore, Parliament

827 828

[ ]

2019 25

is entitled to ask the President to explain how he can concurrently serve as Head of the Government and as Head of the Opposition, and whether he does not understand that functioning simultaneously in both capacities is a gross violation of the fundamental democratic basis of the Constitution.

This statement of Dr. Nihal Jayawicrama is really indicative of the extent of the conflict of interest. This position would not arise if the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa was not the Leader of the Opposition, which is a recognition accorded to him by you, Mr. Speaker.

An effort is being made to make out that similar situations had arisen during the terms of previous Presidents. It needs to be pointed out that this question has never been raised before, and no ruling has been given by any Hon. Speaker on this question. Now that the question has been raised, the matter needs to be addressed on the basis of the relevant Constitutional provisions, Parliamentary practices and conventions and the relevant facts relating to the conflict of interest between the Offices of the Head of the Government and the Head of the Opposition.

Hon. Speaker, may I also, in this context, refer to pages 334 and 335 of the 24th Edition of Parliamentary Practice by Erskine May, a leading constitutional authority. This deals with the question of Oppositions time and who determines such Opposition time in the House of Commons. I quote from Erskine May:

Standing Order No. 14 provides that on 20 days in each session proceedings on business chosen by the opposition parties shall have precedence over government business. "

It further states, I quote:

Seventeen of the days so allocated are at the disposal of the Leader of the Opposition, and three at the disposal of the leader of the second Largest opposition party.

That is defined in the Standing Order as the party of those members not represented in the Government, which has the second largest number of members elected to the House as members of that party. It is abundantly clear from the above that any political party to be recognized as the official Opposition must not be represented in the Government. It is also abundantly clear from what I have stated earlier that the UPFA is, in fact, represented in Government. It also emphasizes the importance given to the second largest party in the Opposition, the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi - the Tamil National Alliance - is in that position in our Parliament.

In this context, may I also refer to Section 8 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, which states as follows, I quote:

journals of the Commons House of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, or of the proceedings of the said House, or of a report of any committee of the said House.........

.......shall be received as prima facie evidence.....

The practices prevalent in the House of Commons are thus of relevance to us.

It also cannot be disputed that several members of the UPFA and the SLFP - a constituent party of the UPFA - elected to Parliament on the nomination paper of the UPFA have crossed over to Government, sit on the Government Benches and now represent the Government in Parliament. This circumstance further strengthens the position that the UPFA is represented in Government and in the circumstances, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa who is also a member of the UPFA and the SLFP - a constituent party of the UPFA - and proposed by the Secretary of the UPFA to the post of the Leader of the Opposition is not entitled to hold the post of the Leader of the Opposition.

In regard to the second issue, Sir, pertaining to sub section 13A of Article 99 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist and Republic of Sri Lanka and the impact of the said provisions consequent to Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa ceasing to be a Member of the Party on whose nomination paper he was elected, in deference to your view that you have already ruled on this matter, I will not raise that issue in the course of this statement. I do, however, wish to state that this issue remains an open question and that a determination on this issue needs to be arrived at in the appropriate forum. It is fundamental that the truth be ascertained in regard to this matter. The Constitution - the supreme law of the country - and the facts related to the implementation of the provisions contained in the Constitution cannot be manipulated or subverted to suit the needs of the individuals. To be a party to the such act would be to deny the sanctity of the Constitution. I consider it my duty to place on record these facts to ensure that the Constitution and the constitutional practices and conventions that I have referred to are followed.

I wish to make it perfectly clear, Sir, that I do so not because I or the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi or the Tamil National Alliance are hankering after Office. We have never sought Office. In 1983, 16 Tamil Members of Parliament of the Tamil United Liberation Front, on principle, refused to take an oath and consequently sacrificed their seats in Parliament when we had six years more to serve as Members of Parliament.

I was the first of the 16 Members of Parliament to vacate my seat. We have declined office on other occasions which is a matter of public knowledge. But we do think that the rights of the minority political parties and minority peoples should not be jeopardized by manipulating or subverting either the Constitution or the accepted Constitutional practices and conventions so as to serve the interests of individuals catering to majoritarianism. I do further think that rights which Constitutionally accrue to the minority parties and minority peoples should be protected and preserved. That is why Mr. Speaker, I consider it imperative that I make this statement in Parliament.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, you met me and said that you also have some point to be clarified on that point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .

Now, let me respond to the point of Order raised by the Hon. Sampanthan. - [Interruption.] No, what we thought was to allow one senior Hon. Member from the UPFA to explain it. Now, let me give my Ruling. After that, we can discuss it later. - [Interruption.] No, I am not. I will make my response. Let me make my response. After that, we can discuss it. Let me respond to the Hon. Sampanthan.

I would like to inform the House that the Hon. R. Sampanthan, MP, made a written request to me to allow him to raise a point of Order in respect of the matter that I had made a Ruling on, on 08th January, 2019, which was delivered to this House by the Hon. Ananda Kumarasiri, Deputy Speaker on my behalf pertaining to the Leader of the Opposition.

As this point of Order was raised by the Hon. R. Sampanthan, MP, today in the House, let me inform the House my position in respect of the matters raised.

In my Ruling delivered on 08th January, 2019, I have not touched upon in detail the subject of conflict of interest pointed out by the Hon. R. Sampanthan, MP, in his Statement made on 19th of December, 2018 and I wish to state the following:

1. As indicated by the Hon. R. Sampanthan, MP, the recognition of the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, MP, was not consequent upon any request from the UPFA General Secretary, but because of the age-old convention of this House that the Speaker should recognize the Leader of the Parliamentary Group of the recognized political party having the largest number of Members sitting in the Opposition as the Leader of the Opposition.

The letter sent by the General Secretary of the UPFA indicated to me the Member to be recognized as its Parliamentary Group Leader for the purpose of recognition of the Leader of the Opposition.

In the past, even though some Members belonging to the UPFA were sitting on the Opposition benches, the UPFA, as a party, was not recognized as a party belonging to the Opposition as the UPFA officially constituted a party which formed a national government under the provisions of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution with the United National Party, which had the largest number of seats in Parliament. As I indicated in my Ruling on the 18th of December, 2018, after the UPFA ceased to be a party forming the National Government and having officially decided to sit in the Opposition, it was my duty to recognize the UPFA as the party having the largest number of Members sitting in the Opposition.

2. In my Ruling delivered by the Hon. Deputy Speaker on 08th of January, 2019, I have made my position clear in respect of the issues raised in connection with the contention that the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, Leader of the Opposition, has ceased to be a Member of the UPFA and thereby had vacated his seat in Parliament and in respect of the appointing of a Select Committee to look into matters connected therewith, which decisions stand and I do not propose to delve on these matters further.

3. However, in respect of conflict of interest issues raised by the Hon. R. Sampathan, MP, and later, also by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and the Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma, even though I have considered this matter in depth, I have not given any reasons in my Ruling. The fact that the Executive President belongs to a party which is not the majority party in Parliament to which the Prime Minister belongs is not a new experience or a situation in our country. There was a time when His Excellency D.B. Wijetunga was the President in our country, during which time the Hon. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was the Prime Minister.

At that relevant time, the Hon. Gamini Dissanayake followed by the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, both of whom belong to the United National Party, had been recognized as the Leader of the Opposition. During the said period, His Excellency D.B. Wijetunga held several ministerial portfolios including Minister of Defence and Minister of Buddhasasana. Then again, during the Presidency of Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe became the Prime Minister and the Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka and the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa served as the Leader of the Opposition. At that particular time, Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga held several ministerial portfolios including Minister of Defence, Minister of Mass Communication and Minister of Interior.

Therefore, it is quite clear that this is not a new phenomenon and this situation had arisen in the past as well.

833 834

4. According to the constitutional provisions envisaged in the Constitution in electing the Executive President and constituting the Legislature, I may say that this will not be the last occasion that the party from which the Executive President is elected becomes the main Opposition party in Parliament. It is the right of the President to hold any ministerial portfolio subject to any qualification that the Constitution may impose and if such exercise of his or her right is going to deny the party having the second largest number of Members in Parliament sitting in the Opposition and which is not a party to a national government in functioning as the main Opposition party, I am of the view that this would deny that party of its legitimate rights to enjoy all privileges of an Opposition party including its Parliamentary Leader being recognized as the Leader of the Opposition.

5. I would further state that if some Members of a party in Opposition decide on their own to join the Government by accepting some portfolios, such action cannot deny the rest of the Membership of the said party from functioning as an Opposition party. This would be a serious violation of the rights of the rest of the Members of the party sitting in the Opposition. Hence, I cannot accept the contention of the Hon. R. Sampanthan, MP, that if some Members choose to join the Government while officially the party remains an Opposition party, the said party should not be accepted as a recognized party in the Opposition.

6. Even though the Hon. R. Sampanthan, MP, strives to draw a parallel between the House of Commons of the United Kingdom and Parliament of Sri Lanka, such a parallel cannot be drawn for the reason that the Parliament of the United Kingdom is constituted on the Westminster Model of Parliament and the Sri Lankan Constitution provides for an Executive President elected by the people, who is the Head of the Executive and also the Head of the Government. The Constitution does not preclude the President from appointing a Member from an Opposition party as a Cabinet Minister. In such a situation, to deny a party its right to function as an Opposition party cannot be accepted.

7. Having considered all aspects of the point of Order raised by the Hon. R. Sampanthan, MP, I am of the view that this is a matter that needs be addressed in drafting a new Constitution and we cannot find a remedy within the confines of the present Constitution and the Standing Orders.

So, that is my Ruling.

Anyway, we will leave it at that.

, . , . Daily Mirror .

I would like to quote this and conclude my speech. Daily Mirror of today, 25th of January states, I quote:

Govt. will hold Presidential Election first: Minister Madduma Bandara Minister of Public Administration and Disaster Management Ranjith Madduma Bandara said despite whatever claims of others the government would hold the Presidential election first and that the general election and the provincial council election would follow.

What does that mean? The Governments intention is very clear. Until November, there will be no election other than the Presidential Election. The attempt of the Government is to suppress the voting rights of people. It is not only the voters rights that matters. The Provincial Council system is part of the Constitution of our country.
