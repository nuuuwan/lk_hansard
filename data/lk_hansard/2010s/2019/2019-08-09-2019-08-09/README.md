(ii) the expected objectives of each category;

(iii) whether arrangements have been made to give lands of the tea estates to private entrepreneurs for other projects; and

(iv) if so, what those projects are?

(b) Will he state- (i) whether he will table the details of the private entrepreneurs who receive the relevant lands; (ii) the tea estates located in catchment areas which are proposed to be given for other projects; (iii) whether arrangements have been made to distribute extremely sensitive lands located in the reserved environmental zones;

1129 1130

2019 09

(iv) the reasons why the lands which are proposed to be or have been given to the private entrepreneurs incur losses; (v) if those lands incur losses owing to weaknesses in management, is there not any possibility of elevating them to profit-making level under a proper management; and (vi) if so, is it not environmental- friendly to continue with the tea cultivation without giving them for other purposes?

(c) If not, why? ( ) (The Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka)Sir, on behaf of the Prime Minister and Minister of National Policies, Economic Affairs, Resettlement and Rehabilitation, Northern Province Development and Youth Affairs, I table* the Answer. * : * : * Answer tabled:

(a) (i) In terms of the Tea Control Act, No. 51 of 1957, it has been classified as tea small holdings and large-scale tea estates.

Tea Small Holdings - An area of land less than ten acres in extent

Large-scale tea estates - An area of land, ten acres or more in extent

(ii) * Contributing to the Gross National Product by enhancing productivity of the tea cultivation adopting environmentally friendly good agricultural practices and uplifting the living standards of tea smallholders.

* Contributing to the Gross National Product by enhancing productivity of the tea cultivation adopting environmentally friendly good agricultural practices.

(iii) Large-scale tea estates have been leased out to 23 Regional Plantation Companies. In terms of the conditions in the said Lease Agreements, certain portions of lands have been subleased to private entrepreneurs in line with the Cabinet approved guidelines.

(ii) Not relevant.

(iii) It is mandatory to obtain environmental recommendations from the Central Environmental Authority to give lands to the entrepreneurs. Actions have not been taken to give lands as tea estates to the entrepreneurs. The extremely sensitive lands located in the catchment areas or the buffer zones have not been distributed.

(iv) Many reasons such as management weaknesses, lack of large-scale investments, uncontrollable price fluctuation in the world market, economic sanctions imposed on some Ceylon Tea importing countries and internal crises in some countries, use of the brand name Ceylon Tea fraudulently and entering refuse tea to the market illegally have caused it.

(v) Not only the weakness in management but also the above-mentioned reasons have been causes for not making profits. The Regional Plantation Companies have shown profits for many years after privatization.

(vi) Maintaining tea cultivation by adopting good agricultural practices is environmentally friendly.

(c) Not relevant.

But, I would like to refer to the General Assembly Resolution moved in 1971 during Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike's era: Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. That was the cornerstone of our foreign policy - non-alignment. We shall not be party to any military agreements with any military blocs. That was the non-aligned foreign policy which Sri Lanka pursued. The Resolution had the support of all Indian Ocean countries.

"Conscious of the friendship between our two countries stretching over two millennia and more, and recognizing the importance of nurturing this traditional friendship, it is imperative that both Sri Lanka and India reaffirm the decision not to allow our respective territories to be used for activities prejudicial to each other's unity, territorial integrity and security.

In this spirit, you had, in the course of our discussions agreed to meet some of India's concerns...."

This further states, I quote:

"ii. Trincomalee or any other ports in Sri Lanka will not be made available for military use by any country in a manner prejudicial to India's interests.

iv. Sri Lanka's agreement with foreign broadcasting organizations will be reviewed to ensure that any facilities set up by them in Sri Lanka are used solely as public broadcasting facilities and not for any military or intelligence purposes."

This was signed by His Excellency Rajiv Gandhi, Prime Minister, Republic of India and His Excellency J. R. Jayewardene, President, President of the Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. I do not want to read the whole Agreement. It is a public document. Sir, I would like to table* it.

It had appeared so many times in the daily newspapers. I thank the daily newspapers, irrespective of their positions, for bringing this to the notice of the country so that the country was able to know the gravity of the issue.

The National Physical Plan for 2011-2030 of the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka's Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, which was gazetted in 2011, is now considered to be outdated and the Government has embarked on reviewing it. The new National Physical Plan for 2018-2050 has been approved by the National Physical Planning Council and the National Economic Council of Sri Lanka and is expected to be gazetted shortly. This was expected to be gazetted shortly since February, 2019. It was the time when this was announced. , whether the provisions of the Act are being followed. The provisions of the Act have not been followed. It has to be referred to the Provincial Councils, to so many organizations and ministries. It is only thereafter that a change could be brought about. The Ministry has acted on its own. Why? What is the hurry? . , State Lands (Special Provisions) Bill . The Government, amidst Presidents protesting and not agreeing to this, rushed to gazette it. Sir, you were in the Chair when we raised this. This Bill was rejected by the Supreme Court. When we raised it, Sir, you were in the Chair and you said that you would inform the Hon. Speaker for the withdrawal of the Bill from the House according to the Constitution. Upto now, the Government has not withdrawn the Bill. It is up to the Government, firstly, to withdraw the Bill.

What has now been gazetted? . . Mr. Neville Ladduwahetty, one of the leading analysts on these subjects and who has been writing a lot of articles, has warned about the Millennium Challenge Corporation Agreement and how it encroaches the lands

Read this article titled Betraying our Visionary leader DS Senanayake by Dr. Garvin Karunaratne. I invite the UNP MPs to read this article on how D.S. Senanayake, as the Minister of Agriculture and Lands in the State Council of Ceylon in 1933, acted. It states, I quote:

The vast colonization schemes of the Dry Zone, the peasantry, in thousands that enjoyed the land, earning bountiful crops were all due to the great achievement of our leader, DS Senanayake, and were all achieved during his days as the Minister for Agriculture and Lands. It was his dream to uplift the life of the rural masses and for that purpose he initiated a policy of granting land to the landless poor, making them partners in production and national development. His avowed aim was not only to see that they are free from hunger and starvation but to see that they are established on land and become self-reliant and self-dependant (Hansard: 26/2/1932: State Council of Ceylon) ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) ? ""? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , The Island. You have not read this. The Hon. Leader of the House must read this. It is very clear that the Hon. Leader of the House has not read this. - [Interruption.] The Hon. Prime Minister will not read it because he does not want to read the truth. The article is titled Betraying our Visionary leader DS Senanayake. Hon. D.S. Senanayake introduced the original Land Development Ordinance, which is to be dished by your Government and that is your attempt when you brought this. It further states, I quote:

1159 1160

It is reported that the freehold system has had the vision of foreign specialists. I have quoted ideas from our founding father DS Senanayake, the personage who created the United National Party. Reading through the speeches in the Hansard I find that he had done painstaking work to care for the poor. If further details are required the Government can call on the services of Government Agents who earlier worked as District Land Officers and they hold a wealth of expertise. Let our leaders kindly think again before it is too late.

I have a problem with Prof. Garvin Karunaratne's views. He is a very distinguished professor who has done a lot of development work in a lot of international agencies and in several countries. But, what I would say

after reading his article is that we must not basically be scared of change. I think every human being, every citizen is equal. Often, we take upon ourselves that we have to protect the vulnerable sections of the population and in our attempt to protect those vulnerable sections of the population, we actually disenfranchise them. A country will develop if people have the right to their property. All of us in Parliament - I am sure all 225 Members of Parliament - have some kind of freehold land. So, why are we depriving the others of this country of having a freehold plot of land? Why are we trying to say that we are protecting them by not giving them a freehold plot of land?

, . . , . We will create a cadastral map, which is an inventory of all State lands that will be accessible to everybody. . We will improve the valuation of State and private lands by improving data collection to support it through a computerized method. Thirdly, we will improve the deeds registry by digitizing existing records and linking them to the Digital Parcel information. In other words, to eLand Registry. . . We will improve security for all landholders in the country by moving properties from the deed registration system to the title registration system and then finally, we will provide research support of measures to improve land administration policies. , MCC , .
