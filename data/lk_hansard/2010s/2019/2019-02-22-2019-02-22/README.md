( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) What is your point of Order, Hon. Member? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Deputy Speaker referred to a Report in relation to some incidents that took place within the-

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) What I thought was, once you see the Report, to discuss it at the Party Leaders Meeting. That is the best way, is it?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You can discuss and thereafter make a decision. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, we can discuss once we see the Report. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Because, we are interested in the Rights of the Members of Parliament -

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) That is right. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yesterday, the Hon. Prime Minister agreed that we should not allow our Privileges to be handed over to the police.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I have not gone to the police, some of the Members have gone to the police.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Our MPs have been called by the police. They have been asked to come in relation to the Report of the Deputy Speaker. We have not read it.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) No, not on that.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Until then Sir, the rights of all MPs should be protected.

We are under the Privileges Act. Please! I am not requesting for anything else. You can make any inquiry. You, the Privileges Committee and all that, can make any decision. But when the Report is released in this manner, the public knows, but the MPs are unaware of the Report. Will it be given now? Will it be distributed to all?

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) It will be tabled today. And, there has been a separate investigation, on that I have no role. That happened because two of your MPs have complained against me to the police and they have taken a statement from me also.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, not on that, Sir. Sorry! ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) They are two seperate issues. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) A complaint made against the Hon. Speaker, that is not the issue on which they are being questioned. We are going into a debate unnecessarily. I raised this issue because it involves the rights of the MPs.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Definitely. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) But if you say that our Members can be summoned by the police for an incident within the Chamber, then our Privileges have no meaning. You have to protect the Privileges and the Rights that have been enshrined to Members of Parliament and the House first.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Some of them have given statements. We will discuss this matter at the Party Leaders' Meeting. I take your point.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You have to make a very clear decision on this on which the Hon. Prime Minister agreed yesterday when our delegation headed by the Leader of the Opposition met him.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) On the police inquiry he is aware. He told me this morning also that he did not want to intervene on those issues. That is why I said that the best thing is to discuss this at the Party Leaders Meeting.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I think we should have a special meeting on this.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Yes, we will do that.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We can have a Party Leaders Meeting before proceeding with this in any manner.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) No, we table it today.

removed from that place for construction work directly;

[1.40p.m.] ( , ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning, Water Supply and Higher Education) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, we are paying tribute to three Members of Parliament today in this Condolence Motion. First among them is the late (Hon.) A.H.M. Azwer.

The name, A.H.M. Azwer, to those who knew him was synonymous with Parliamentary practice and Parliamentary traditions. I had the privilege of being the Presiding Member for six years in the Parliament in my first entry. Sir, during those times, Mr. A.H.M. Azwer was known to me as someone who would ad nauseum raise points of Order to no end - to the point that the Chair would get irritated with him. He had this rare knack of keeping on, persisting in his position until the Chair virtually lost its cool and was almost considering expelling him from the House. He would know the exact moment at which the Chair would lose its patience and quickly sit down, so denying the pleasure to the Chair of throwing Mr. Azwer out. Such was Mr. Azwers ability in interrupting Proceedings in Parliament. That was all in the cause of his Party, in the cause of the politics for which he came into this House.

He had this rare distinction of being originally a disciple of those giants of this House like Dr. N.M. Perera, Dr. Colvin R. De Silva, Hon. Robert Gunawardena and many others who had been representing this House on behalf of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. Thereafter, he joined the United National Party and was known to be someone who would be very close to several leaders of the United National Party. He was so with President J.R. Jayewardene, thereafter with President Premadasa, President Wijetunga and even with the current Leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe. Fate had it that he in his twilight years joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, became a loyal supporter of the former President, Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa. Whoever he joined, he would defend them to the hilt. Such was his characteristic.

As far as the Muslim community in this country is concerned, he would be known as someone who fought for the cause of his community within this Chamber and outside. I still remember the all Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference that conducts its monthly meetings in the Zahira College, Colombo. He was a product of Zahira College, Colombo and in these meetings at the All Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference, Mr. Azwer was a member who would unfailingly attend every meeting. He would take up the cause of Muslim education in every such forum and in this Chamber and outside with the Ministers of Education and the Ministers of Higher Education.

Sir, he was also wearing many hats - as a journalist, as a commentator and as an artist. He would be a member of a variety of different organizations, various non-governmental organizations which promoted the cause of his community. The Moors Islamic Cultural Home, the All Ceylon Moors Association, the All Ceylon Muslim League Youth Front, then the Sri Lanka Muslim Media Forum and the All Ceylon Young Men's Muslim Association Conference, in a variety of different organizations, in every event, he would be someone who would be present there.

969 970

His loss is very much felt by the community since he was someone who would fight for the cause of the downtrodden, who would take up even the cause of unknown entities who would come and approach him for help. He was someone who never could enrich himself with anything but by loyal service to his people.

Today, it is my privilege to participate in this Condolence Motion and pay tribute to Mr. Azwer. To us, he was known as "incorrigible Mr. Azwer", but he is an "inimitable Mr. Azwer". I do not think there could be another Mr. Azwer in this Chamber. Be it a friend or a foe within the Chamber, but outside the Chamber, with such comradery, with such wit and repartee he would conduct himself. This House is much poorer by his absence and that is what I would say in tribute to one of our colourful Parliamentarians who adorned this House.

Now, let me also say a few words about the late Hon. P.S. Soosaithasan. Mr. Soosaithasan was a Member representing the Tamil United Liberation Front who entered Parliament representing the Mannar District for a period of four to five years. Perhaps, in the period of 1977 to 1983, the period in which the late Mr. A. Amirthalingam was the Opposition Leader of this House. The Members of the TULF faced many difficulties during that period. That was a period in which the famous Sixth Amendment pushed the Members of Parliament outside the House. They lost their membership in the House; most of them had to seek refuge in Tamil Nadu in Southern India; most of their leaders one by one were getting attacked and eliminated by the armed forces that had taken control of the Northern Province. Mr. Soosaithasan remained a non-controversial politician but who would always stand up for the cause of the Federal Party. He started his career as a Teacher and ended up as a Charted Accountant of repute. I believe he was also a partner of Ford Rhodes Thronton and Company and his ability as an accountant finally enabled him or rather made him Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee in the years of J.R. Jayewardenes rule. A Chartered Accountant Chairing the Public Accounts Committee was indeed a big boon to the Committees work. He told me in his later years that he would always be questioning not the normal audit but would want value for money audit to be the criteria which the deliberations of the Public Accounts Committee must focus on. Subsequently, when some of us became Chairmen of that Committee, the tutelage we had from people of his calibre was so useful.

I would pay my tribute to Mr. Soosaithasan as someone who had contributed immensely to the course of public oversight over public finance; the oversight of this House over public finance by being a renowned member and a Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.

May I also add a few words about the late Hon. Jinadasa Niyathapala who himself was also a very colourful politician who had also been at a time the General Secretary of the United National Party, one of the largest and the oldest Parties in this country.

The late Hon. Niyathapala was a member representing the electorate of Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte. He, I believe, was also a member of the Colombo Municipal Council and also a member of the then Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte, Urban Council. Thereafter, he was the Opposition Leader of the Urban Council, Sri jayewardenepura Kotte. The Hon. Jinadasa Niyathapala was also, like the Hon. A.H.M. Azwer, a journalist and a man of repute who would defend his Party and his cause to the hilt in this House and outside.

May I convey the condolences of my Party and myself to the Members of the families of the late Hon. A.H.M. Azwer, Hon. P.S. Soosaithasan and the Hon. Jinadasa Niyathapala.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) .

[2.12 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana - State Minister of Social Empowerment) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi rajioon. "Certainly, from Him do we come and unto Him do we return for certain." In short, that is what the Holy Qur'an describes about life in this world, that we are born by the mercy of the Almighty Allah, and we return to Him.

Kullu nafsin zaa'ikatul maut, Kullu man alayhaa faan. "Every creation will taste death. All that is on earth will perish." .

Sir, today I rise with a heavy heart to condole the demise and pay tribute to a long known friend to me and my family, Marhoom Alhaj A. H. M. Azwer. This day is a solemn day because we are remembering one of our dear departed Colleagues, the Hon. Alhaj A. H. M. Azwer. Today, Sir, as I stand before you, pleasant and nostalgic memories tingle with a deep sense of sadness flooding in my mind. Many are the precious moments I have shared with Alhaj Azwer and I shall cherish those moments with all my heart as long as I live.

Many a man has trod the soil of the earth. Many more will do so in time to come, but not every one of them will leave their footprints in the sands of time. Whilst a few have done so, and there would be more who would leave their mark. The Hon. Azwer was an illustrious son of Mother Lanka whose indefatigable endeavours and feats have brought honour and dignity to our nation.

977 978

Hon. Alhaj Azwer always had an energetic and enthusiastic personality. He was amicable, amenable and God-fearing. His cherubic face, his cheerful laughter and sense of humour was infectious. His manner of interaction with people from all walks of life sans discrimination was certainly awe-inspiring. He rubbed shoulders with eminent and distinguished personalities, Heads of State and theologians, without losing his common touch, and won much admiration throughout the world.

Azwer was undoubtedly a prolific speaker in all three languages. He would recite Sinhala poems, Tamil odes and English quotations. Thus he displayed his talent in the fluency of all three languages which is certainly not a record in any Parliament in any part of the world.

When he was first appointed as a Member of Parliament by the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, the President insisted Azwer to be present in every Session of the Parliament. So Azwer made his presence at all Sessions for 24 years in Parliament, which is a noteworthy record. He was the first to arrive and last to leave the Parliament premises.

A newspaper dubbed him as Parlimenthuwe Yathura" - "key of the Parliament and yet another dubbed him as Parlimenthuwe Anaya" - "Nail in the Parliament. Call him what you may like, but Azwer was Azwer.

During his lifetime, he was very pious, dedicated in practicing Muslim schools of thought and was an ardent follower of Rifai Tarika and Tablighi Jamaat. He was also associated with the All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama and a host of other religious bodies. He actively promoted the practice of our forefathers recitation of the Mowlood during the different seasons of Mowlood, specially in the month of Rabial-awwal and the recital of Qasidat al-Burda of Imam al-Busiri.

When it came to the question of issues connected with Islam or Muslims, Azwer would not compromise on his faith and religious beliefs, but he knew that he was treading a tightrope and therefore, was always careful in issuing well-thought-out statements that would not antagonize those who matter. He would debate and speak on sensitive issues in tense situations, bearing every community in the country in mind, since we all had a great breadth of vision to see that the ultimate analysis of some of these issues needed solutions on a broader perspective than that of a narrow sectarian interest.

There were many occasions which required him to communicate eloquently in all three languages on matters that were detrimentally sensitive where he would plead with the leaders of the relevant communities very strongly, but amicably and was willing to accommodate and compromise in order to resolve such sensitive issues. This is where I found him as a constructive Member of Parliament of whichever Government he was affiliated to.

Sixty years in politics, 24 years in Sri Lanka Parliament as a Member and a Minister is in fact a long time and is certainly a thing to remember, though not endorsed as an achievement. The late Hon. Azwer did not contest for a Seat from any electorate, but was appointed from the National List. Without contesting a Seat, who else can claim to have acquired a Seat in Parliament on five instances without spending even five cents for attaining it? He was consequently elected to the Panel of Chairmen and was a great exponent of Erskine May. He was a Member of Parliament; State Minister of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs and Minister of Parliamentary Affairs. During his tenure as a Member of Parliament or Minister, he carried out his duties meaningfully. Sir, I have associated with him on many political meetings, conferences, and social work. We have travelled together to the North and the East of Sri Lanka during conflict times and have narrowly escaped through some divine providence being caught between crossfires. It has been a privilege traveling abroad with him.

One such incident was in 1997, when a delegation went to Libya led by the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, during his tenure as the Minister of Fisheries, on the invitation of late Col. Muammar Gaddafi, the then President of Libya, during the time when there was a trade embargo imposed on Libya by the USA. Our delegation was comprised of the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa and his wife, the late Hon. Azwer, late Dr. Mahroof from Kandy, and the great poet and journalist Shams, and also former Member of Parliament the late Hon. Anver Ismail and my good friend and attorney-at-law Muneer and myself. We could fly only up to Malta. After which we had to travel on sea from the Valletta Harbour to Tripoli crossing the Mediterranean Sea on a vessel named "Garnatha". Our eight-hour voyage on sea to Libya was pleasant as it was an overnight sailing. We had a five-day stay attending many conferences, meetings and a distinguished meeting in a tent with Col. Muammar Gaddafi.

Our return to Malta was scheduled on the same vessel Garnatha and our delegation boarded the vessel in the evening with dignitaries from various other countries as well - even President Tito was there - hoping to reach Valletta Harbour in Malta the next morning. However, when we awoke the next morning, we found ourselves still in the mid of the Mediterranean Sea and it was not berthed. Due to heavy storm and rough sea, it was impossible to berth our vessel into Valletta Harbour. So the vessel remained in the mid of the sea for two days. Anxiety began to build up within the passengers as food supplies were running out. The supplies were available for just eight-hour voyage or maybe a little more. But Haji Azwer began reciting Moulood and praying with me and spiritually kept up everybodys hope that nothing harmful would happen until we reach the shores. The scheduled eight-hour voyage ended after 52 hours in the Mediterranean Sea.

Sir, the late Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer will be remembered for years to come, by those whom he served so passionately; and if our ethics are in their right and

979 980

2019 22

proper places, he will be remembered by the progeny of those whom he gave so much of his time. He has left an everlasting legacy in the field of politics and community service to which he so lovingly dedicated his whole life.

All of us, as responsible Members of this Parliament, as a team, we have to live and work in a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-religious pluralistic society. And such a society is where our people must always be encouraged to remember that a policy of tolerance is very important. One should remember that one cannot be right all the time. Even if one is right, sometimes it is best not to enforce the point too hard or harshly. This is where the late Hon. Azwer had this attribute in ample measure and it made him a very welcomed colleague in any team, whether it is the UNP team or the SLFP team. We miss such individuals and their company amongst us, as he was such a dependable person in any crisis such as what we are facing now.

Of course we had heated arguments in the House of Parliament since there were many views very vigorously debated and daggers drawn, but never ended with bitterness, because the late Hon. Azwer was a person who had cultivated a habit of recognizing the value and worth even of his adversaries. He would often quote Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice, and therefore would never carry a heart full of acrimony whenever he left the Chamber.

He always had good, reasonable suggestions and ideas for peaceful solutions and communicated such proposals as he was capable of demonstrating his capacity in working together with people from all walks of life irrelevant of the backgrounds they came from.

I sincerely condole with his family members, his wife, son, daughters and their spouses, grandchildren and extended family members for their personal loss, and we as friends and colleagues as well as the Sri Lankan community have endured a grievous loss by the demise of the Hon. A.H.M. Azwer. May all mighty Allah Subhanahu wa taala grant him the highest facility and may his eternal rest be in Janatul Firdous.

Having said that, Sir, before I conclude let me express my sincere condolences to the family members of the late Hon. P.S. Soosaithasan, former Member of Parliament, and also to the family members of the late Hon. P.A. Jinadasa Niyathapala, ex-member of Parliament. May these souls attain eternal peace!

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) ... . [3.56 p.m.] .... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Hon. Speaker, it is with a deep sense of sorrow that I rise in this House to speak on the Vote of Condolence on the passing away of my close Friend and Colleague, the late Hon. A.H.M. Azwer.

"Azwer", as he was known to all of us, was not just a politician or a Parliamentarian, but a human being who felt more for the people of Sri Lanka than for his own family. He was always dedicated to the cause he was entrusted with and very loyal to the leader of whichever party he was a member or a supporter. He never gave up hope and continued his efforts in what he believed to the end. I knew him well from growing up together.

His parents being people of simple means would never have imagined that their first son would one day be in the National Parliament. When he was admitted to the Zahira College, Maradana after the World War II, he was already conversant in Tamil and Sinhala languages. Having passed the SSC in all three languages, he became an excellent stenographer. He got through the Law College Entrance Examination, but financial difficulties prevented him from completing law studies. Instead, he was employed at Maliban Biscuit Company and later, at James Finlay.

Azwers interest in politics came up with his friends starting the Zahira Majlis, a mock parliament, where Azwer was the Prime Minister. He did not want to sit even in a mock parliament without knowing Parliamentary procedure. Therefore, he mastered Parliamentary practice.

The late Hon. Azwer, before pursuing a political career, was an ardent admirer of Dr. N.M. Perera and Dr. Colvin R. de Silva. This influenced him to join the LSSP and was imbued with socialist thinking learned from Dr. Osmund Jayaratne, Stanley Tillekeratne and V. Karalasingham. An irony of fate made him join the UNP and later, his fate took him away from the UNP to the SLFP in 2008. He was loyal to the SLFP and respected former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the person who gave him a hand when his political career was at a low ebb.

He had trilingual oratory skills and also an ability to translate the vernacular speeches by national and political leaders. He had an ability to recite trilingual kavi - poetry - and they are recorded even in Hansard. He was an active participant in Parliamentary conferences. In Parliamentary debates, he holds a record for interruptions in Proceedings and raising points of Order. He was also carried out of Parliament by his own party Members for

1003 1004

2019 22

disobeying the Speaker and not by the Sergeant-at-Arms. He had addressed Parliament in all three languages. Azwer will certainly be remembered for his antics in and out of Parliament. Before entering Parliament, he had served as the Public Relations Officer to the late Hon. M.H. Mohamed and later, the Secretary to former Speaker, the late Hon. Bakeer Markar.

He showed his mettle in 2014 by resigning his Seat in Parliament as a gesture of loyalty to the then President, Mahinda Rajapaksa. He said that President Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed him as a Member of Parliament and he needed some appointed Member to give up his Seat for Ameer Ali. Hon. Azwer agreed to it spontaneously and did not complain at that moment. However, some time later, the political stand of the Hon. Ameer Ali and other supporters changed and President Mahinda Rajapaksa lost the Election. But Hon. Azwer did not give up hope and he kept Mahinda Rajapaksas flag flying despite severe criticism from some quarters of the Muslim community who later realized that he was right.

The late President, Ranasinghe Premadasa appointed Hon. Azwer as a National List Member and later, in 1989, appointed him as the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs and the Minister of State for Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs. The Hon. Azwer held many Ministerial positions till the UNP lost its Parliamentary majority.

On a lighter side, the Hon. Azwer was a jovial personality and a great stage actor. He wrote and staged several plays which were held in the Ghafoor Hall at Zahira College, Colombo. His acting talent should have made him a big star in the Sinhala silver screen if he really pursued his interest; his portrayal of Muslim Thambi Mudalaili at times kindled many of the spectators. Moreover, everyone heard Hon. Azwers voice during national cricket matches. He was a regular commentator of Test and One Day Cricket events in Sri Lanka and abroad. He could comment in all three languages at the same time and made a lot of quips to make the listeners appreciate cricket shots and bloopers. So, the late Hon. Azwer will also be remembered as a great broadcaster. His voice was unique and ideally suited to entertain people at all levels.

Later, Hon. Azwer devoted himself to the cause of Islam and to the service of the Muslim community. In fact, his loss made Sri Lanka missing a worthy son, but his deeds and words will reverberate forever for others to follow.

With the deep appreciation of the life, career and contributions of Hon. Azwer, I wish to conclude by praying that he will have a special place in jannat, as we say, in heaven.
