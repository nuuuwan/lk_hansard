[2.39p.m] ( , ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning, Water Supply and Higher Education) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, my Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama got very excited about missing offenders from the country. The fact is, there is a difference between offenders and suspects. We know, in criminal law, everybody is presumed innocent until he is proven guilty. So, when it comes to suspects, this Transfer of Offenders Law does not apply; it is an Extradition Law. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I was thinking of the wider picture. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I understand. Now, the question of extradition is postulated on certain principles. You must first have an Extradition Treaty. Then, you have to lodge a Red Notice with the Interpol. The Interpol has to inform the recipient State, or the State in which the so-called suspect is absconding. It is up to that State to do the law enforcement there, inform the receiving State and then, extradite the suspect. So, this whole process has to take place.

Earlier, the Hon. Prime Minister, in reply to Hon. (Dr.) Nalinda Jayathissas Question replied specifically to the same question that you posed, that a Red Notice has been lodged with the Interpol and that the due process should then begin. So, we will have to await that process to take effect. Be that as it may - [Interruption.] I am not going into the politics of it. For you, there is a certain political element. So, you will have to make this whole noise. But, then, as a responsible Government, the certain actions that need to be taken have been taken. If he has violated bail conditions and had not returned, and if there is a warrant out for him, then, that process has to take place; that process has begun. So, let us wait until the

recipient state fulfills their obligations and then informs the Interpol accordingly. The judicial process can thereafter look after itself.

Be that as it may, this question of Transfer of Offenders Act and a variety of different treaties that we have signed with different States, in my opinion, should be looked at from the point of view of our own expenditure. Now we are keeping these offenders. Most of them are serving life sentences in our prisons. Not only they have committed an offence which attracts life sentence, but we are also burdened with the taxpayers money being spent on looking after these prisoners for life time in our prisons. They do not even qualify for Presidential Pardon, even in the rare cases, because they are not our citizens. Therefore, in such cases, it is much better for the Foreign Ministry to engage with the High Commissioners and the Ambassadors of countries which have Missions here. In my foreign trips, I have encountered several countries which are unaware of the number of prisoners who belong to their own citizenship, who are serving jail terms here. Similarly, there maybe occasional cases of Sri Lankans serving elsewhere. I think we must take some proactive measures to identify the number of foreign nationals serving in our prisons. As regards the sentence - it has to be under this Act- he has to have a minimum of one year remaining for him to be transferred. Otherwise, it is pointless for us to be taking that laborious - () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Six months. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)Maybe six months. I saw somewhere that it was one year. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I got it from the text. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, the sentence has to be more than one year, and they have to have a remaining period of more than six months to serve in that prison.

Sir, I saw from some records, there are several women prisoners. In the case of drugs, sometime this is very unfortunate. Some of these prisoners maybe even unaware that they were carrying the drugs. It is a strict liability offence. You are caught with the stuff and you have to say how it came into your possession. If you are unable to prove it, then you are landed for life sentence. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) It is death sentence.

213 214

2019 06

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) It is death sentence converted to life sentence here.

I see our President has gone on record having said that he is going to carry out the death sentence. That has other implications internationally for us. But then, quite apart from that debate related to death sentence, this issue of trying to get rid of these prisoners who have kith and kin, at least from the humanitarian side, why not we make that minimum effort of informing the Missions to look for their relatives and other friends and then see whether there is a desire to get them back. Let them serve sentences in those prisons, because after all we have signed these agreements. There are several such agreements that have been signed by the Ministry of Justice with other countries. But then, we still have a number of these prisoners languishing in our jails and we have to spend the taxpayers money to look after them forever. So, these things have to be looked at from a much more realistic point of view.

Then, we also have the issue of human smuggling and human trafficking. Under the TIP Report, originally, our country was in the Tier 2 category, but now we have been brought down to Tier 3. I wonder whether we have been again elevated to Tier 2 because under the TIP Report, we were enjoying a better status, at least we were recognized as a country which was taking some effective action against human trafficking and human smuggling. We must separate this from the real issue of migration. Legal migration is one thing and illegal migration is another. But then, every illegal migration does not amount to human trafficking or human smuggling, but that becomes a big, syndicated offence. Now, there are several such syndicates.

Now, there is a process called Bali Process where certain countries which are very interested in reducing the number of migrants coming and landing in their shores - like our friends, the Australians - are taking some extra effort. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Now, there is the EU also. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Now, the European Union also has the same problem with the Mediterranean countries. Particularly, after the Syrian Civil War, war in Yemen and in Northern African States, there is this large migratory pattern that is taking place. Several lives are lost in the sea. So, this is a humanitarian issue and in the meantime, this is a collective sale of humans for a variety of different purposes, individuals are trafficked for prostitution and the passports of those poor women are confiscated by the gangs and they are kept as virtual prisoners. I know for a fact that however much we try, the conviction rate in human trafficking and human smuggling is not to a

desirable level. The burden of proof is such that even the Attorney General's Department and the police authorities are finding it extremely difficult to get proper convictions in time.

Therefore, these cases are dragging on indefinitely and there are several such cases in our courts. That being the case, it is important for us to take some effective action so that we will get back to "Tier 2" and we will at least be recognized as a country which is taking effective action, because we have moved as a source country to a transit country, to a certain level. That was because our country was used as a transit point to engage in human trafficking across our shores to other countries.

So, these issues need to be tackled and I must say that the Sri Lanka Navy and particularly the Criminal Investigation Department have done a good coordinated exercise in the last few years to improve our situation, when it came to human trafficking and human smuggling. So, I thought these matters should be improved further.

We only heard yesterday the arrest of Makandure Madush in Dubai. He is supposed to be connected with so many drug offences. Suddenly, there is this big zeal in trying to contain drug offences. While it is a salutary thing which should be done, we need to speed up the legal process in getting the extradition done and the prosecution to be begun so that it will be a lesson for others who have been engaged in such serious offences.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, thank you very much for the time that was accorded to me.

Thank you. [.. 2.51] () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Nalinda Jayathissa) , . . , ; . ; . . , .
