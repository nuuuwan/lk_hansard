0 ( ) (The Hon. Namal Rajapaksa) ,-

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) , . . , . . . .

0 ( ) (The Hon. Namal Rajapaksa) , . ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Hon. Chairman, Budget 2019 has laid out a very clear focus on growing the economy, creating jobs and making the economy more competitive and enterprise-driven and is built on Budget 2018 and the "Vision 2025" plan. The Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade has been playing a key role in driving important aspects of this agenda - particularly trade, investment and exports.

It is now widely recognized that our Ministry has played - and continues to play - a vital catalytic role in

improving the investment climate and in creating an environment in which firms and entrepreneurs have opportunities and incentives to invest productively, create jobs, enhance private sector competitiveness and thereby contribute to strong economic growth. The three institutions under my Ministry - the Board of Investment, the Export Development Board and the Import and Export Control Department - have been working tirelessly aligned to this agenda and the wider "Vision 2025" agenda along with the Department of Commerce.

Let me first highlight the key achievements on exports and FDIs in 2018. Sri Lankas foreign exchange earnings from export of merchandise and services have grown by 24 per cent during the last three years. In fact, the export revenue in 2018 was US Dollars 17 billion. Although the records show US Dollars 16.4 billion, about US Dollars 600 million of goods were shipped in December which has been recorded in January as the exporters have delayed to submit their Bills of Lading. These figures do not include the revenue earned from tourism, which was a further US Dollars 4.3 billion.

It was noteworthy that for the first time in our history, monthly merchandise exports have topped US Dollars 1 billion every month for the past six months. Strong performance is evident in some of the Focus Sectors identified under the National Export Strategy. Notably, electrical and electronics components exports have increased by 16.2 per cent and processed food and beverage exports have increased by 22.6 per cent. The apparel sector that accounts for 33 per cent of total exports achieved 100 per cent of the target of US Dollars 5.3 billion during 2018. New orders from the EU were secured as a result of the GSP Plus benefit.

In the export market, earnings from our two most important regions of USA and Europe have increased steadily by 5.65 per cent and 5.15 per cent respectively. Within the EU Region, important markets like Germany, Italy and Netherlands have shown robust growth of 14 per cent, 9 per cent and 17 per cent respectively. In Japan, where we have embarked on a renewed focus following our trade and investment mission last year, our exports grew by a robust 9 per cent in 2018. It is particularly noteworthy that our exports to South Asian Region have grown substantially by 10 per cent to reach almost US Dollars 1.1 billion, driven in large part by exports to India that grew by 11.35 per cent from US Dollars 689.4 million in 2017 to US Dollars 767.6 million during the year 2018.

Now, let me turn to Foreign Direct Investments. Sir, Foreign Direct Investment inflows in 2018 reached US Dollars 2.37 billion which is the highest ever record in FDI inflow into Sri Lanka. This shows an increase of 25 per cent compared with the US Dollars 1.9 billion worth of FDIs received in 2017.

We are, now, strongly focusing on increasing the contribution from manufacturing and services, especially in export-oriented projects. This year, the BOI has already granted approval to set up an export-oriented oil refinery, as we said earlier, with a proposed investment of US

3279 3280

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

Dollars 4 billion and a steel products manufacturing plant with an investment of US Dollars 1 billion. The refinery was launched in Hambantota on the 24th of last month and the steel plant will be launched by May or June this year.

In 2018, the BOI approved 128 projects to the value of US Dollars 2.5 billion. The breakdown is, US Dollars 1 billion in utilities sector; US Dollars 700 million in infrastructure and US Dollars 800 million in manufacturing and services sector.

In 2019, the BOI has granted approval for 24 projects so far to the value of US Dollars 5.5 billion which includes the export-oriented refinery and the steel plant. Ultimately, FDI in all forms is important for us as it is a key source of non-debt creating foreign inflows.

Hon. Chairman, let me now speak about our Ministrys initiatives on exports and competitiveness that are helping our domestic industries. The Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade is implementing several initiatives that are improving the competitiveness of Sri Lankas domestic enterprises by providing them with supportive policies and strategies, financial and technical support, and enabling infrastructure. Many of the initiatives that we have taken and are championing are things that had been postponed in Sri Lanka for nearly two decades, and was urgently needed to place us firmly on a more sustained and competitive growth path. These initiatives will not bear fruit in a month or a year, but would have lasting positive impacts on the economic trajectory of our country.

The National Export Strategy 2018 - 2022, which has been in implementation since its launch in July 2018, is progressing well, anchored to the plans of action of six sectors and three trade-support functions. The NES is a carefully structured five-year strategy with active public and private sector stakeholder participation aimed at increasing export revenue to US Dollars 28 billion by 2022.

Together with the EDB, the NES Management Unit established under our Ministry leads the coordination, follow-up and the monitoring of the NES while 16 Advisory Committees established by the EDB guide the implementation with the relevant stakeholders. The NES contains elements of modern industrial policy by focusing on what sectors can be promoted given the countrys strengths as well as given emerging opportunities. The NES provides an agenda for action in order to improve the competitiveness of 6 focus sectors, and provides improvement of trade support functions like logistics, trade information and promotion and national quality infrastructure to improve the competitiveness of all sectors.

During this year, we hope to accelerate NES implementation with close follow-up with all implementing partners, taking a whole of Government approach.

In 2018, the EDB launched a flagship programme to make trade more inclusive across our country. We are conscious that the export-oriented sector in Sri Lanka is not as widespread as it could be, and so we have embarked on an island-wide programme to foster new exporters. The 2000 Exporters programme will incubate a whole generation of new exporters in this country, and make the gains of international trade more inclusive.

Entrepreneurs and aspiring exporters from all parts of the country are being helped through this programme, which will cover a new district each month. Already, programmes have been conducted for over 2,500 entrepreneurs in Jaffna, Kandy, Kurunegala, Matara, Anuradhapura and Vavuniya. In addition, a Women Entrepreneur Development Programme to transform them into exporters is also being implemented. This year, we will also include specialized sector-wise development programmes based on the needs of each district, and also hold private-public dialogues on trade policy matters with the business leaders in the provinces.

Sir, in 2018, we also launched a unique programme called the Market Access Support Scheme based on a Budget Proposal of that year. Under this, we have already helped 150 domestic enterprises to improve their products, their marketing and their technical resources towards becoming more successful in the international market. The enterprises get matching grants for applying for special standards and certifications, to make a process or product improvement, to obtain external technical expertise or reach into a new market with a market entry study or participation in targeted B2Bs. The assistance has covered enterprises across Colombo, Kalutara, Kandy, Polonnaruwa, Gampaha, Puttalam, Kurunegala and Hambantota. In 2019, we aim to expand and accelerate the delivery of this programme so that it reaches hundred more enterprises across the country and quickly boost their international trade competitiveness and have it reflected in higher export earnings.

Sir, in October, last year, the Cabinet of Ministers approved for adoption and implementation the National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Strategy 2018-2022". This much-awaited landmark strategy was co-created with the private sector, following extensive consultations with public and private actors and after a diagnostic study was done with the support of the World Bank. Under this, a unique support scheme called the Enterprise Innovation Programme, the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, is due to be launched. Unfortunately, it was delayed due to the political crisis of October 26th, 2018. Through this, domestic entrepreneurs can get matching grants to support them to develop new products, introduce technology into their business, improve processes, conduct R & D, and overall, become much more competitive to meet the global market pressures. This complements nicely the concessionary loans on offer under the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme, under which these entrepreneurs can expand and improve their business with lower cost capital.

In 2019, we hope to launch the Enterprise Innovation Programme as well as operationalize other priority

elements of the I & E Strategy in partnership with relevant Line Ministries and donor partners. To ensure that our domestic enterprises have a favourable business climate and more friendly bureaucratic procedures, we are forging ahead with the efforts to improve on the Doing Business Index and implement the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement. Last year was a noteworthy year for the ease of doing business reform agenda. On the Doing Business Index, Sri Lanka rose up 11 places in 2019 to reach the 100th position due to the focused effort on reforming key pillars that matter like setting up a business, dealing with construction permits and online tax payment.

The World Bank evaluation team has recognized four major reforms conducted by us in 2018, which led to the jump in rankings. Several other reform areas are ongoing and will get reflected in the next years rankings. The latest reform is the appointment of an "Official Receiver" for the first time in Sri Lanka, which is a key part of easing the business winding up process. Our aim is to rise up to the 70th place by 2020 and we are confident that the necessary reforms are underway towards achieving that goal.

We have also commenced a series of reforms to make it easier for foreign and local investors. The most notable of these was the launch last year of the web portal of the Single Window Investment Facilitation Taskforce or SWIFT. SWIFT is continuously improving service delivery times and fast-tracking the approval process of various line agencies within a set time period. Thirteen out of 24 identified line agencies have signed MoUs with the BOI, committing to work under single web platform to facilitate and expedite project approvals, licences and permits by the investors. It is expected that this year it will reduce the time taken for investment approvals by 20 per cent.

The BOI has also focused on promoting reinvestment and a dedicated group for this purpose was established with the mandate of encouraging existing investors to reinvest, expand or upgrade their businesses through facilitating and solving their bottlenecks. Further, this group is also entrusted with identifying new potential investors through existing investors channels.

In 2018, the BOI embarked on a more targeted investment promotion regime by identifying focus sectors and markets. From time to time, inward and outward missions have been organised using a targeted approach. Germany and Japan were some of the key outward missions in 2018 with well-curated programmes and high-level participation from the Government and the private sector.

The BOI identified new target sectors for attracting FDIs and enhance export revenue through an in-depth research study in collaboration with the Harvard Universitys Centre for International Development - CID - and the World Bank Group. In identifying the target sectors, special focus has been placed on export-oriented merchandise goods as well as services with a view to enhance foreign exchange earnings and to diversify Sri Lankas export basket.

We have also identified that the lack of commercial land availability is a critical constraint affecting the investment climate in the country and so embarked on a systematic process to unlock this problem by way of building new industrial zones. Last year, we started work on new zones in Millaniya and Bingiriya, the first new zones in our country in 16 years! The Bingiriya zone was launched last month in the presence of the Hon. Prime Minister. The Zones in Mawathagama, Millaniya and Trincomalee will also follow. These will not only ease the land constraint for investors, but more importantly, generate thousands of new export sector jobs for our youth in those areas. Thirteen investors have already informed the BOI that they intend investing in Bingiriya, which will cover the entire Phase - 1 and will provide employment to 12,000. The investment value will be over US Dollars 150 million.

In the trade facilitation domain, the National Trade Information Portal was launched last year and has changed the way domestic enterprises discover and use trade-related information to operate and grow their business. Moreover, the blueprint for an Electronic National Single Window is complete and development work would begin shortly. With both of these, Sri Lanka would then have an advanced trade facilitation infrastructure, which would greatly minimize procedural delays and transaction costs faced by our domestic enterprises.

The establishment of a Trade Promotion Platform - TPP - is underway to promote exports internationally in a single platform. The platform is designed to cater to prospective and current buyers to source products and services form Sri Lanka and for Sri Lankan entrepreneurs to enhance the reputation of product and service brands and to obtain relevant and timely trade information. This Platform is to be launched in mid-2019 and will specially promote the SME sector, increase business transactions - B2C - through the online trading portal - eMARKETPLACE- and will facilitate business-to-business - B2B - matchmaking.

Mr. Chairman, in 2018, our Ministry continued to be the anchor for several important bilateral trade and investment partnerships with countries such as India, China, Singapore, Bangladesh, Thailand, EU, Australia, Japan and New Zealand.

In 2018, we signed the landmark Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement that has ushered in a new era of trade links with the dynamic and growing South East Asian Region. This Agreement has been widely hailed by both sides as a high quality agreement that signals Sri Lankas commitment to reform and opening up. Despite the baseless allegations and factless claims by a narrow few, this FTA has the potential to bring investment and jobs to benefit hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans.

We continue to progress on the Indo-Lanka ETCA talks as well as the China-Sri Lanka FTA talks. We have also commenced the initial work on the Thailand-Sri Lanka FTA and also commissioned a feasibility study on the Bangladesh-Sri Lanka FTA.

3283 3284

Meanwhile, we launched an important Trade and Investment Framework Arrangement with Australia in April last year, and now use it as a platform to encourage more bilateral trade and attract Australian investment.

The EU Investor Dialogue was held at regular intervals last year, and was the prime forum for listening to and resolving issues faced by EU investors. Several high profile issues were resolved with the leadership of our Ministry, in coordination with relevant line Ministries, and this process has been hailed by the EU Ambassador as a credible and useful platform for EU investors.

Mr. Chairman, the BOI, EDB, and the Department of Commerce will continue to strengthen their efforts to support the reorientation of our economy to one that is driven by trade, investment, and exports. In addition to continuing ongoing programmes that have proven to be useful and have an impact on the trade and investment climate, they will be adding new initiatives based on the needs of the economy.

We are also building new capabilities in these institutions to meet the new needs and continually upgrade and modernize. The Department of Commerce is setting up a Trade Remedies Unit for the first time in its history, staffed by competent officers to deal with industry needs under the anti-dumping and safeguards laws. The EDB will launch a 12 month capability building programme for its staff delivered by Enterprise Singapore, the apex agency that has helped take Singaporean companies go global. The Programme is supported by the Temasek Foundation and Singapore Cooperation Enterprise. This is part of wider ongoing efforts to restructure the EDB and gear it to the new needs of enterprises.

A key new initiative in 2019 will be the Trade Adjustment Programme. In order to ensure that our domestic private sector has a meaningful mechanism to adapt to a more liberalized trade regime, we have prepared a Trade Adjustment Programme for the first time in Sri Lanka. It received Cabinet approval last month, and will commence implementation under our Ministry in close cooperation with the Ministry of Finance. We prepared this after recognizing that alongside the reduction in para-tariffs and tariffs, our enterprises and our workers would need help to adjust to the new market conditions. Moreover, the heightened pressure of international trade means that our enterprises need a meaningful mechanism to seek redress in the event of import surges and dumping from other countries.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Minister, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) I need about five more minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) I will take it off from the Deputy Ministers time. ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Developed with technical inputs from the Harvard Kennedy School and the World Bank, this Trade Adjustment Program - TAP - has been customized to suit the Sri Lankan context and was subject to intense consultations with industry groups and was even released for open public comments. Two important pieces of legislation that underpin this effort were passed last year - the Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties Act and the Safeguard Measures Act. This was yet another landmark achievement, particularly as these laws had been delayed by previous regimes for far too long. Now, with these laws in place, our domestic enterprises have a proper legal cover to combat incidents of import surges, dumping, and unfair trade practices by foreign countries. We consider this an important complement to the trade liberalization and internationalization efforts of the Government.

Under the TAP, there will be a Trade and Productivity Commission - TPC - which comprises of senior private sector experts and academics, to hear private sector submissions on any fallouts faced by them as a result of trade liberalization, and subsequently recommend appropriate adjustment assistance.

This mechanism is a departure from the usual process of narrow interest lobbying that companies tend to do. Therefore, it provides an open and credible platform to address concerns of trade injury. We have arranged for the Australian Productivity Commission to provide technical support for the establishment of the TPC, learning lessons from their highly successful stories and the cooperative manner in which Australia conducted its trade liberalization.

Under the supervision of our Ministry, the BOI has undertaken the redevelopment of the former Bogambara Prison. The First Phase will be completed in June and the Stage - 1 of the Second Phase will be commenced in April this year and it will be completed within a year. We are seeking assistance from the Japanese Government to restore the main prison building which will be Stage 2 of the Second Phase. We have invited the private sector investors to construct a hotel outside the premises and that will be the Third Phase. All the renovations and restoration are being done with the approval of the Department of Archaeology in order to preserve its cultural value. Once the Project is completed, locals and tourists will be able to spend time at this complex where traditional Kandyan arts and craft and Kandyan dancing will be featured. I intend discussing this proposal with all Hon. MPs in both the Government and the Opposition.

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Let me finish and thereafter I will answer you.

In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, all of these initiatives that our Ministry is implementing are things that benefit the many and not the few. We are making the economy better for the vast majority of enterprises and entrepreneurs, not for the few crony capitalists who succeed based on patronage or a parasitic relationship with the State. These initiatives will usher in - arguably are already ushering in - a new era of private enterprise-driven dynamism for our country, reversing from the anti-export bias and the growth model heavily reliant on government spending that we had seen over the last decades and we now know are not sustainable or successful.

Mr. Chairman, there have been many detractors and much opposition, as we just saw earlier in the day, but the reality is clear. We focus on creating good quality jobs for the youth of our country by giving them an opportunity to change their destiny. We are not interested in personal gains and creating political loyalties. We are not interested in naming things after ourselves and telling people that these are gifts from political masters. We are more interested in making sure that the things we do bring in real benefits to our people and that these projects are sustainable and commercially feasible. Our objective is to take our country to the next level and improve the standards of living of all our people and to do so, I seek the cooperation of all the Hon.Members of this House. Let us keep petty party politics aside and work together to build our nation.

Finally, let me thank the Deputy Minister, the Hon. Nalin Bandara, the Secretary of our Ministry Mr. Kodikara, Additional Secretary Mr. Gunesinghe and officers of the Ministry, former Secretary Mrs. Chandani Wijewardhana; the Chairman, Directors, Director-General and the staff of the BOI; Chairperson, Directors, Director-General and the staff of the EDB; Director-General of Commerce and the officers of the Department of Commerce; the Controller General of the Department of Import and Export Control and the staff; my two advisers Mr. Mangala Yapa and Mr. Anushka Wijesinghe; Mr. K.J. Weerasinghe and the FTA negotiating team for their cooperation and untiring efforts.

Let me also thank the private sector chambers and business leaders who volunteered to assist us and continue to support us to make our country a better place for everyone.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) ?

Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) believes the controversy surrounding the proposed USD 3.85 billion oil refinery in Mirijjawila, Hambantota, could have a negative impact on Sri Lankas efforts to remove itself from the Financial Action Task Forces (FATF) Grey List of countries vulnerable to money laundering and terrorism financing.

. , .

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) , .

There is enough of precautions that the banks take when this money is coming here. They are not bringing notes. Therefore, the Transparency International need not worry because this is coming through the banking sources and they do all the checking.

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) Hon. Minister, it is not only the Transparency International, the entire country is worried about this kind of deals.

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) They do not have to worry. ( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) You know, you have become a part of many controversial issues in Sri Lanka. Therefore, no sooner you are involved and no sooner there is a notice issued by the Ministry, people think twice about it.

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) No, Hon. Member, they do not have to think twice. They can see for themselves. We have not done anything wrong and we will not do anything wrong.

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) What is the status of the Volkswagen investment? Can you tell something about that?

3295 3296

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Yes, the Volkswagen investment- ( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) No, there is absolutely nothing to tell about that. Even the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva prefers refraining from talking about that. Even the main person who took it forward is refraining from talking about that.

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Hon. Member, even I do not want to talk about it. ( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) Yes, because it is not coming. It is a shame. It is a shame of your Government.

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) This investment came from your own people. This investment came from Mr. Noel Selvanayagam who was campaigning in Hambantota with Hon. Namal Rajapaksa. I think, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa is also aware of that.

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) Now the Hon. Prime Minister has laid two foundation stones but none of the investment is coming in. Nobody is coming in. Everybody is pulling out the investments.

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Sir, this is a very serious allegation. Arjun Aloysius is not a friend of mine and I have nothing to do with his businesses. But, he is a friend of Hon. Namal Rajapaksa who was at his brother's wedding as well. I have nothing to do with Aloysiuss and he has nothing to do with our Ministry.

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) In which capacity, did you attend the breakfast meeting at the Central Bank with regard to the Bond scam? You attended that meeting but you were not a Member of Parliament at that time. Also, the Hon. Kabir Hashim and the former Minister of Finance, all of you, attended that meeting. After that meeting only, that mega Bond scam took place.

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Hon. Chairman, I attended that meeting as an Adviser to the Prime Minister. I have very clearly stated that the Hon. Kabir Hashim and I went there only to find out the money that was required to pay the contractors and the Bond Commission has accepted our statement. So, these are all baseless and false allegations. Please, do not do that.

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) You all are responsible for the Bond scam. You all have not been cleared by the Bond Commission. Please, do not mislead the House.

Now, Hon. Presiding Member, I want to talk about Hon. Mano Ganesans Ministry, particularly about the Office on the Missing Persons. This is something that we agreed to in Resolution 30/1. I would like to read from something that the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera had written under the heading, The Truth about the Geneva Human Rights Council Resolution and I am tabling* this document in this House today.

I will tell you why that is important. There has been a lot of loose talk that we must get out of the UN Resolution and that this was done without the approval of the highest in the land. You know, it is unfortunate that these kinds of things are happening in this country today, because I know for a fact, when I led the Delegation in 2017 to Geneva I had the expressed approval of everyone including the President, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs to go ahead and roll over the Resolution as 34/1. The Resolution 40/1 is nothing but a re-enactment or rolling it over again.

I want to read a paragraph in that document written by the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera which states,

The decision to request for a technical/procedural rollover this year was taken after consulting both HE the President and the Hon. Prime Minister in February, 2019 ahead of the organizational meeting of the 40th session of the Human Rights Council on 16 February, 2019.

So, either the President is trying to mislead the people or the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera is trying to mislead the people. If that is the case, this is a serious matter. I table* this document in this House and I want it to be included in Hansard.

It further states,

Instructions pertaining to co-sponsorship were merely conveyed to Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva, Ambassador A.L.A. Azeez by Mr. Mano Tittawella, Secretary-General of the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms (SCRM) which comes under the Prime Ministers Office. The SCRM was formed by the Cabinet of Ministers in 2016 for the overall coordination of reconciliation activities including implementation of Resolution 30/1. The Minister of Foreign Affairs Hon. Tilak Marapana was also fully aware of these instructions which were conveyed by him to Ambassador Azeez as well. Minister Marapana had also asked Ambassador Azeez to coordinate matters with respect to the Resolution with Mr. Tittawella, and had kept the Secretary to his Ministry Ravinatha Aryasinha informed.

So, I must say what I know about Ambassador Azeez. He is a very respected Foreign Service officer. He has been serving this nation, I am sure, for more than 25 to 30 years holding very senior positions including Ambassador and to direct unsubstantiated allegations at him and to say that he must be recalled - some Member of this House even went to the extent of saying that he must be arrested - what are we trying to achieve here by trying to mislead the people of this nation? If not for the Resolution 30/1 which was rolled over in 2017 and rolled over again in 2019 there will be no Office on Missing Persons.

That is what I want to focus my attention on today. The Office on Missing Persons is something that is solely

needed in this country. The Resolution very clearly states,

, Hon. Minister, why do you think it is so important that you reconcile the past issues? Why is it important that you work with the global community? I will tell you and as an economist, you will understand. I recall, we were having lunch with the Hon. Managala Samaraweera. He went on to explain, That is because an investor looks, not for three years, but for a 30-year horizon. If one is looking for a 30-year horizon, you must ensure that the foundation is laid now, that you all would not have any race riots again. That is number one.

( ) (An Hon. Member) For tourism.

() 0 ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Yes, exactly, for tourism and everything else. So, there is no point in the Hon. Malik Samarawickrama talking about investment, if we, on both sides of the aisle, cannot talk about and agree that what is needed here is to ensure that we have sustainable peace. That is why the Office on Missing Persons is so important. I take my hat off, I really do, and admire the work of the Commissioners of the Office on Missing Persons: Mr. Saliya Pieris, President's Counsel, Chairperson; Mr. S. K. Liyanage, Commissioner; Dr. (Ms.) Nimalka Fernando, Commissioner; Mr. Kanapathipillai Venthan, Commissioner; Ms. Jayatheepa Punniyamoorthy,

3411 3412

Commissioner; Mr. Mirak Raheem, Commissioner and Major General (Rtd.) Mohanti Peiris, Comissioner. They come from different communities, but are focusing on one thing. So, Sir, why it is important that we all rally around and say we are going to continue with the process that we started in 2015 is because it is important that we treat every person in this country the same way and we are willing to take on the responsibility of undertaking the investigation necessary to find out what happened to these people.

Under "Interim Relief Proposals", it states, "The OMP makes the following recommendations to the Government for immediate policy formulation and implementation.... ?

Sujeewa Senasinghe - Non Cabinet Minister of Science, Technology and Research) Sir, please give him five minutes from my time.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Okay. () 0 ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Thank you.

We have set aside or allocated Rs. 500 million in the Budget, 2019 to provide this Rs. 6,000 per family per month. That is a recommendation by the Office on the Missing Persons and we have implemented that. There are many challenges that prevent families of the disappeared and the missing from obtaining the CoA, the Certificate of Absence. The OMP is currently engaged in efforts of addressing these challenges.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghes time has already been taken. Therefore, you have to wind up in another two minutes' time.

() 0 ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Thank you, Sir.

There are other recommendations that have been made. For instance, to give debt relief, particularly to people who are really suffering, having taken microfinance loans and so on and also to somehow connect them with the "Enterprise Sri Lanka" loan scheme.

So, I am indeed happy that we are able to take up these recommendations and have begun to implement those. Therefore, Sir, what we have started to do, we must continue and whatever political objections or sporks in the wheel we may encounter, we must have the resolve, as Members of this House, to agree. We may disagree on various things, but we all must agree on the fact that justice must be done. What we - that includes the President of this land - agreed to, we will implement. Essentially, I am talking about four things: first, the establishment of the Office on Missing Persons, which we have already done and I am glad it is progressing well. Then, the second, the creation of the Office for Reparations. Let me also tell you that just because a person gets Rs. 6,000 a month, that does not mean that when the reparation is calculated, what he got as the interim would be taken in and therefore, the reparation cannot be given. Reparation is a separate thing and what is being given is an interim relief.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, please wind up.

3413 3414

() 0 ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I am winding up, Sir.

The third is, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and finally, a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism established within the Constitution of this country and not, I repeat, not, an international one, in which there would be participation of external actors.

Let me conclude by saying that this whole politicization of the Geneva Resolution and the mud that is being thrown must stop because that is something which is absolutely essential, without which there is no point in talking about investment and exports in the future. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon.

Last year, we have approved and signed projects for US Dollars 2.5 billion. Of course, those will be implemented this year in the country.

( ) (The Hon. Arundika Fernando) That means, you have signed 50 per cent of FDIs after 2015 and before-

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) No, for 52 per cent of the Foreign Direct Investments received, the approval was granted before 2015. Forty Eight per cent of what has been received for projects

from 2015 onwards has been approved by this Government. Also, in addition to that, last year alone we have approved projects up to US Dollars 2.5 billion which will now be in the process of disbursing.
