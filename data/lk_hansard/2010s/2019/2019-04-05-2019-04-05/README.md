The next speaker is the Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan. You have 25 minutes.

[10.57 a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Hon. Chairman, before I commence my speech, may I say that the Government and the Opposition have both agreed to give me five minutes each which means I would have 30 minutes. But, let me commence and go along, Sir. We are on the final day of the Budget Discussion. As I have often stated earlier, the future of the country is not purely an economic issue. It is a very multifaceted issue. Even the future economy of the country is dependent upon several issues; it is dependent upon its unity and its strengths based upon the unity; it is dependent upon the reputation that it enjoys both domestically and internationally. The two issues of utmost importance to the country today, in my view are; the implementation of the Resolution co-sponsored by the Sri Lankan Government and unanimously adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Council in 1915, 1917 and 1919; and the adoption of a new Constitution for the country as unanimously decided by Resolution adopted in this Parliament in 2016. With regard to the first matter, the United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution is also based upon two investigations; the first, conducted by an independent panel appointed by the Secretary-General of the UN comprising of three experts from different parts of the world and the second, an investigation conducted by the UN Human Rights Council itself. Both have come to the conclusion that war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed, that there were violations against international humanitarian and human rights laws during the civil conflict and that the matter needs to be further investigated upon and determined. Sri Lanka has conducted no investigation of any sort, not even a domestic investigation and persists that it will not implement certain aspects of the UN Human Rights Council Resolution. From the point of view of Sri Lanka, there was only one report, the Report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission; even that Report has not yet been implemented. I have spoken on this civil conflict, Sir, in Parliament in 2009 and before that - the conflict came to an end in May 2009 - without being contradicted by the Government and in fact, not merely me, but many others - both those in this Parliament and other personalities - have referred to at least some of the matters that happened during the course of the conflict.

It is my intention, Sir, to make reference to some of these matters to demonstrate what was stated in this Parliament and by others at the time the conflict took place without any contradiction by the Government. I will read, Sir, from the position that I stated in Parliament in 21st January, 2009.

"What has been happening to the Tamil people as a result of the war that is being waged in the North and the East? There is constant aerial bombing, continuous aerial bombing, sometimes several bombings per day. There is constant multi-barrel rocket launcher fire, constant artillery fire, all into civilian populated areas. Is this happening in any part of the world? Are civilian- populated areas being bombed aerially and are multi-barrel rocket launchers and heavy artilleries being fired into civilian populated areas in any other part of the world? I got some statistics here. They are short of food; they are short of medicine; they are short of shelter; they are short of drinking water; they are short of sanitation facilities. People are undergoing immense difficulties in the Vanni. There are about 350,000 to 400,000 people now in the Mullaitivu District, in a part of the Mullaitivu District, running helter-skelter from one place to another depending on where the bombing is taking place, where the shelling is taking place."

That was the position in this area when I spoke in this Parliament in January, 2009, a position which was not contradicted by the Government.

"Nobody knows what is happening in this area. There are no United Nations agencies in this area. There are no International Non-Governmental Organizaitons in the Vanni. They were all asked to get out of that place in September last year and since then, they are not stationed there permanently and they cannot act freely and independently as they wish. "

So, Sir, that was the position that prevailed in the Vanni in 2018 and 2019.

So what do we see in the statements made by Madam Navanethem Pillay who was the Head of the UN Human Rights Commission at that point of time, the statement made by Madam Louise Arbour, who was also the Head of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights a little earlier, and the statement made by Justice Bhagwati - the Chairman of the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons, a retired Chief Justice of India who was in Sri Lanka in order to assist in the investigations that have been conducted by the Udalagama Commission in regard to several human rights violations. They have all made their position very clear, Sir, in the statements they have made.

Madam Navanethem Pillay said, Sir, Certain actions being undertaken by the Sri Lankan military and by the LTTE may constitute violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. We need to know more about what is going on, but we know enough to be sure that the situation is absolutely desperate. She went on to say, Sir, Despite the Governments designation of safe or 'no fire' zones for civilians, repeated shelling had continued in those zones. Other areas holding civilians had also been shelled, she claimed. Credible sources had indicated that more than 2,800 civilians may have been killed and more than 7,000 in these zones in the past few days. Even after the Governments announcement on 24 February that heavy weapons would not be fired into the no-fire zones, close to 500 people were reportedly killed and more than a thousand injured in these areas.

3961 3962

That is what Madam Navaneetham Pillay, High Commissioner for Human Rights had to say in regard to the situation in this area. There are limited quantities of food, reports of severe malnutrition, medicines are unavailable even in the one makeshift medical facility that is still functioning.

Madam Louise Arbour, Sir, was also the Commissioner for Human Rights in the UN. She urged the Government of Sri Lanka to establish in Sri Lanka an Office of the High Commission for Human Rights to be in a position to monitor what is happening in Sri Lanka. That was declined, refused, rejected and this is what she had to say. I quote There was a culture of impunity which had so deeply permeated into the Sri Lankan society, that if we wanted to eradicate the culture of impunity, there was an urgent need to set up a human rights mechanism, a human rights office in Sri Lanka under UN auspices to monitor the human rights situation in Sri Lanka.

Sir,that was the position expressed by Human Rights High Commissioners in regard to the situation prevalent in this area.

Justice Bhagwati, the Chairman of the International Independent Eminent Group of Persons (IIGEP) a renowned jurist, who had been responsible for extreme changes in India pertaining to human rights had this to say. I quote:

Summary executions, massacres, disappearances, wanton destruction of property and forcible transfers of population can never be justified. No efforts should be spared to uncover responsibility, including recognition of command responsibility, for such actions. The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons has, however, found an absence of will on the part of the Government of Sri Lanka in the present inquiry to investigate cases with vigour, where the conduct of its own forces has been called into question

This was the position, Sir, that was stated by the different persons of repute, who are international personalities.

The reason why I am reminding the House of these matters is that you cannot sweep everything under the carpet. Your current approach can do immense harm to this country. Much has been said about the fact that there is a complaint that 40,000 people have been killed and as to how that can be accepted. There were at least 350,000 people in this area, probably around 400,000 based on our own investigations, only 290,000 people came out. What happened to the balance? Your estimate was that there were only 60,000 to 70,000 people who lived in this area at this point of time. You sent food, medicine and other supplies only for that number - 60,000 or 70,000. When the number was as large as 350,000 why did you restrict the number to only 60,000 or 70,000?

We conducted our own investigation in regard to this matter and we were satisfied that there were at least 350,000 to 400,000 people in that part of Mullaitivu at that point of time.

I want to make it very clear, Sir, that no one is saying that all the Armed Forces who fought the LTTE on the instructions of the Sri Lankan State should be blamed or punished. The Armed Forces acted on the instructions of the Sri Lankan Government, but those responsible for domestic and international crimes including those responsible on the basis of command responsibility and the chain of command should not be allowed to get away scot free. I say this, because that would be extremely harmful to the future interests of this country, the long-term interests of this country. It is absolutely essential, Sir, that the truth must be ascertained.

The second matter I referred to was the Constitution. We all adopted a Resolution in this Parliament unanimously to frame a new Constitution, but we seem stuck. I do not know why, but we seem stuck. I want to refer, Sir, to something which President Barack Obama , the first black American President said shortly after he was elected as the President for the first time in the United States. He said, The American people must be true to our founding documents, the documents on which America came into being. American people must be true to their founding documents, the document on which America came into being. Do we, in Sri Lanka, have any founding document, any Constitution to which we can go back and say, This is our founding document; this is the document on which the country is built, our society is built, which we cherish, which we value, which is the ultimate law of the land? Do we have any such founding document? How can we survive as a nation? How can we survive as a country, when we do not have in this country a constitution which has been accepted by the majority of the people in this country based upon a consensus as much as possible a national consensus? And, this Parliament adopted a unanimous Resolution to frame a new Constitution. Much work has been done in regard to that matter, in fact, the constitutional process has been going on from 1988 for almost 30 years. There was a "Mangala-Moonesinghe Select Committee Report during President Premadasas time; there was a Madam Chandrika Bandaranaikes Report during her term as President- August 2000 Constitutional Proposals; there was a proposal made by President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Tissa Vitharana Report - the APRC Report. With all these being available to us, we are still unable to frame a Constitution. And, do you think, that is a good thing for the country? Is it good for the country to go on like this? Can you go on like this indefinitely? Is it not harmful to the country? In regard to the national question, Sir, your position appears to be that you have brought about a military solution and there is no need for a political solution now.

I want to in this context, refer to a Statement made by Srimati Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India. When the new State of Bangladesh came into being in 1971, the late Prime Minister of India, Shrimathi Indira Gandhi, in a letter to President Nixon on 15th December, 1971, in

3963 3964

[ ]

2019 05

regard to the situation in Bangladesh stated as follows. I quote: The fact of the matter is that the rulers of West Pakistan got away with the impression that they could do what they liked, because no one, not even the United States, would choose to take a public position that while Pakistans integrity was certainly sacrosanct, human rights, liberty were no less so, and that there was a necessary inter-connection between the inviolability of states and the contentment of their people.

If you cannot keep the people contented, if you cannot give the people their legitimate rights, then, the sustainability of your unity and your territorial integrity become gravely questionable. Are we not in the same state? How long has the Tamil question remained unresolved? For the last 70 years? And the Constitutional process that we started in 1988 - we are today in 2019 - 30 years down the road. - has not yet been completed and you are unable to complete it. We do not know what is happening. You do not have the will to complete the process and you want to keep the Tamil people as second-class citizens and you want to suppress them militarily even if they were to rise again. Through civil disobedience based upon ahimsa and sathyagraha, you think they can be suppressed. More than 50 per cent of the Tamil population who lived in this country have left this country. Is it your belief that if you proceed with your military course of action even the balance 50 per cent would leave? Is that your position? Is that your thinking? We are committed to a solution within the framework of a united, undivided, indivisible Sri Lanka. We are firmly committed in regard to that. We want to evolve a solution within the framework of a united, undivided, indivisible Sri Lanka. But, if you do not accept that, please do not expect us to live in this country as second-class citizens. We will not live in this country as second-class citizens. We have our own sovereignty to which we will be entitled. In that situation, on account of your lapse, on account of your default to ensure that we are able to exercise our sovereignty within a united country you will create a situation harmful to the country.

Before I conclude, Sir, I want to say a few words on North-Eastern development. I have just sent the Hon. Minister, our good Friend, Hon. Mangala Samaraweera a copy of the letter I gave the Prime Minister yesterday. The North-East, Sir, was neglected in the matter of development even prior to the war commencing. We were backwards. We were not given equal treatment. We suffered in development. When the war commenced, the North-East was devastated and destroyed both by the Army and by the LTTE. When we were trying to rebuild the North-East, I and my Colleague, the Hon. Sumanthiran met the Hon. Minister of Finance and impressed upon him the need to start a special fund for the rebuilding of the North-East in the field of agriculture, in the field of fisheries, in the field of livestock development, in the field of industry, in various other activities, employment generation and skills development to enable our youth, our women, our widows to be able to recommence life and lead a respectable life.

We wanted the Minister to start a fund and the Minister promptly agreed and said, I understand the need for it and we will start a North-East development fund with an initial allocation of Rs. 5 billion from the Ministry to which we add more funds. We will ensure that more funds go in. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

. . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Hon. Minister, do you want to say something? ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Hon. Sampanthan, I am happy to say that we have also started drafting the Bill which will be brought to Parliament and the fund will be called Palmyrah Fund. It will be open for donations from the private sector as well as the diaspora. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Hon. Minister, when we met you, you assured us that you will transfer Rs. 5 billion this year for the commencement of development activities in the North- East. We have eight districts in the North-East. I do not have to give you the names. The Prime Minister started a mechanism under his chairmanship; coordinators have been appointed; they have consulted our people; they have consulted us and come up with proposals. Each district has come up with proposals up to about Rs. 3 billion. We need in all for a start Rs. 24 billion. We are not demanding the whole thing now. But, kindly give us a substantial percentage, at least 60 or 70 per cent of the Rs. 24 billion, to be able to commence the activities that must be given priority, to ensure that we are able to carry on those activities and to have them fully implemented. I have not a slightest doubt that you will be very sympathetic and very understanding in regard to my request. I would urge you to kindly discuss this matter with the Prime Minister.

After all, Jaffna is an important district, a peninsula; there is the Vanni; there is the Eastern Province which is a large area, comprising of Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Ampara where all people have suffered. Tamil people, in particular, have suffered a great deal. There is much development that is urgently required, particularly, in agriculture, fisheries, livestock development, industries and employment. Women, widows, ex-militants and ex-LTTE cadres who have come back to civilian life need to be looked after. All these things cannot be done if there is

3965 3966

no money. We are formulating programmes so that we will be able to deal with these issues expeditiously. That is necessary. There is no purpose in talking about national reconciliation and there is not purpose in talking about goodwill and harmony unless you are able to make a contribution to uplift these people and to improve the standard of living of these people. That is what we are asking for.

So, I would kindly urge you respectfully to enhance your fund for the development of the North-East. Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Thank you. , .. . . [..11.26] .. ( ) ( .. - , ) (The Hon. A.D. Premadasa - State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy) , 2019 .

The projected budget is Rs. 1 billion and we want to cut down on it because we cannot spend Rs. 1 billion on a convention. There are areas where we can cut down expenses such as costs for putting up marquees. The projected budget for putting up marquees is Rs.120 million. So, we have cut down on it. We were looking at cutting down the budget to about Rs. 80 million. So, we have been working on certain areas to bring the budget down. That is what we have done. I think, because of doing that, some people in the Ministry might have got hurt, but as an Member of Parliament I have to be answerable to Parliament and to the people. There should

be transparency. That is what we have been doing. You can come and sit on one of the Board meetings and see what we are doing. Nothing has been done to stop or to block the convention. Everything is going on properly.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . , . 10 .

"The Heritage Foundation" Jeff M. Smith , Sri Lanka: A Test Case for the Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy . * , . 14 . I quote:

the Rajapaksa family and their allies are likely poised for a political comeback, though the opposition led by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe will remain a significant political force, commanding at least 30 per cent to 40 per cent popular support. They are, however, also genuinely popular in Sri Lanka, and the U.S. must be prepared to respect the will of the Sri Lankan public - to a limit.

Let me repeat that. It states, the U.S. must be prepared to respect the will of the Sri Lankan public - to a limit.

The International Cricket Council - ICC - should react properly. You cannot get a player suspended for not handing over a telephone. There has to be something else. I am sure masterminded people are behind this and I want the ICC to look into this and get hold of the right people, not the cricketers. Ultimately, it is the cricketers who will get the blame but officials who are corrupt and who are bookies are getting away.

Of course, we have. It is an open policy. The people who have been stopped are only those who are on Government vehicle permits and we have to do that. As soon as we took office, we could not do it because of the political coup you created in this country and you were a part of. We are correcting that situation.

That is what the Heritage Foundation states. - [Interruption.] I will read that. The Heritage Foundation is a think tank of the Republican Party of Trump. I am just quoting what the Hon. Udaya Gammanpila was also referring to during his speech. That Report further states, That will depend very much on their actions. In some areas their track record is lamentable. US diplomats who have served in Sri Lanka paint a bleak picture: to advance a narrow agenda, the Rajapaksas often worked against the interests of the US, of Sri Lankan minorities, and of the country at large. - [Interruption.] So, what they are saying is that the Rajapaksas worked against the country at large. Then, the Report goes onto state, At times, they acted like feudal warlords overseeing an island fiefdom. - [Interruption.] I repeat, warlords overseeing an island fiefdom. - [Interruption.] No, what the Hon.

Mr. Presiding Member, I would like to say, for the first time in many years, we have had a primary surplus, despite the drop in Government revenue. The primary surplus shows the difference between Government revenue and non-interest expenditure. This year, we have got a primary surplus of the GDP and from the year 2017, we have been showing a primary surplus confirming our fiscal discipline.

I would also like to say that we have been able to bring down the budget deficit. , 2017 5.5 2018 5.3 .

, , we have made a progress in fiscal

4055 4056

consolidation and fiscal reforms, but we have had challenges. Revenue mobilization is still low and the revenue policy is hurting some sectors. Therefore, it should be reviewed and amended. There are issues that some sectors face and I think, we have to look at those. We should increase direct taxation and reduce indirect taxation. In terms of the Government expenditure, we need to move towards credible fiscal consolidation over medium-term. Also, we have to look at the rising debt service and social safety net. At the same time, we have to reduce losses of the State-owned enterprises.

Sir, before I start my winding-up speech, I would like to announce the revisions of some Proposals presented in the Budget on the 05th of March.

Introduction of a levy on foreign payments on commercial transactions instead of the Nation Building Tax of 3.5 per cent. A Levy of 3.5 per cent on foreign payments on commercial transactions by using credit or debit cards will be introduced under the Finance Act, instead of Proposal No. 6 in the Annexure on introduction of a Nation Building Tax of 3.5 per cent on such payments. However, any such foreign payments made by using credit or debit cards to any approved foreign educational institution for the purpose of education or any administrative institution including any embassy will be exempted from this levy. Specially, credit card , .

The correction of the tax rate under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act. Item No. 6.1.1 (iii) of the Technical Notes in page no. 66 on revision of Excise (Special Provisions) Duty on cigarettes of 72-84 mm will be rounded off to Rs. 37,600 per 1,000 sticks instead of Rs. 37,580 per 1,000 sticks.

Next, the removal of the Outgoing Local Access Charge. The Proposal to remove the International Telecommunication Operators' Levy shall be replaced by removal of levy payable on Outgoing Local Access Charge by making an amendment to the Finance Act.

Then, the regularization of betting and gaming. In line with the global initiative on prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing and in keeping with the requirement for Sri Lanka to comply with such global initiative, amendments will be made to the Finance Act empowering the Minister in charge of the subject of finance to regulate the approved betting and gaming activities. I also wish to take note of the Hon. Arjuna Ranatungas request in his speech earlier today asking us to stop gambling on cricket.

It is also proposed to redefine the pharmaceutical machinery and spare parts for the purpose of VAT Act. Accordingly, the machinery and spare parts classifiable under the HS Codes of 8422.30.90, 8435.10.00, 8414.30.00, 8479.82.00, 8479.89.90, 8424.20.00, 8413.81.00 and 8481.80.00 will be eligible under Part II of the First Schedule of the VAT Act, No. 14 of 2002.

Proposal No. 10 in Annexure 1 of the Technical Note, which has proposed to introduce a casino entrance fee of US Dollars 50 per person, will be amended to introduce a casino entrance fee of US Dollars 50 per person for Sri

4089 4090

Lankan citizens only and not for foreigners, as the purpose of the entrance fee is to safeguard the social values of our society.

Then, the revision of Excise (Special Provisions) Duty on electronic motor vehicles. With a view to make affordability for purchase of small electric motor vehicles, I propose to reduce the payable Excise (Special Provisions) Duty on importation of electric motor vehicles with the capacity of motor between 100kW to 200kW as prescribed in Gazette No. 2114/49 dated 14th March, 2019.

Hon. Chairman, in conclusion, I just also want to say something about the ETI question, which has been raised several times in Parliament. ETI depositors will be paid the third tranche of their capital before the Sinhala-Tamil New Year. In fact, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has just announced that Blue Summit Capital Management Ltd. of Singapore and Ben Holdings Ltd. of Sri Lanka have just completed remitting the final tranche of US Dollars 16 million to ETIF, bringing their total investment for selected assets of ETI to US Dollars 70 million.

Now this transaction has been completely concluded. These funds will now be used by ETIF, which is under the Central Banks management, to pay a further 10 per cent of capital outstanding to all depositors before the Sinhala-Tamil New Year holidays. This brings the total capital repaid to all depositors to 30 per cent of their deposit value. In addition, ETI continues to pay interest payments at the CBSL directed rate to all depositors.

The CBSL has also provisionally approved a recovery business plan for ETI and Swarnamahal Financial Services Ltd. - SFS - from Insunaa Investments & Informatics and it is now awaiting implementation. If this new investment materializes, a full recovery of both ETI and SFS is envisaged. The CBSL also has the capacity to draw on the Deposit Insurance Scheme, to partially refund the balance capital to the depositors. The limit on the Deposit Insurance Scheme has been doubled from Rs. 300,000 to Rs. 600,000.

There have been various malicious reports circulating with respect to the investment of US Dollars 70 million by Blue Summit Capital Management and Ben Holdings. At the outset, I wish to point out that if this investment did not materialize, the ETI depositors would have been deprived of the refund of 30 per cent of their deposits. It is obvious that these malicious statements against the investor, its shareholders et cetera are being driven by rival competitors of ETIs subsidiary businesses to create uncertainty and destroy their legitimate competition with no regard to the interest of depositors. It is also unfortunate that some depositors have also succumbed to this plan and are being used by these unscrupulous persons based on falsehoods and pure innuendo.

The fact that a major player in the international mobile industry, Lycamobile of the UK owned by a Sri Lankan Tamil businessman, who is possibly the major shareholder of these investing companies should not be a reason to character assassinate him or his company. We should be proud that the Tamil diaspora feel comfortable enough to make such large investments in Sri Lanka which is benefiting depositors from all communities. The CBSL has approved this investment with the interest of all depositors in mind and no one else. All required

precautions and clearances have been duly obtained by the CBSL before such approval. In addition, the Central Bank, following due process, have also filed action against the Directors of ETI and SFS. We are carrying out all required actions, firstly to rescue all deposit holders and take legal action as described above.

In addition, the ETI and SFS issues first emerged as far back as 2011. Please, listen to this. The then Government failed to find any solution at that time or after that. This is not one of our problems. Again, this is yet another problem you created and we inherited, but we have now dealt with it fairly and squarely. This procrastination resulted in the problem blowing out of proportion. It is only under the present Government, that even 30 per cent of depositors funds was repaid. Once again, we are cleaning up the previous Governments dirt and safeguarding the depositors.

We will have to do the same with respect to the depositors of The Finance Company, which also collapsed along with many other financial institutions of the Ceylinco group, during the period of the previous Government. Entrust is another glaring example of a failed financial institution during the last regime, which has also been dumped at our doorstep. Nobody talks about the inability of the previous Government to solve these problems or of the culprits in these cases. Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones, especially when we are stabilizing and growing our economy and finding solutions to depositors who have lost their money during the previous Government.

I am confident that the Central Bank will, in due course, find acceptable solutions to all innocent depositors of these financial institutions that failed during the Previous regime.
