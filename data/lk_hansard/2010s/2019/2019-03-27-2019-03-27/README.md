Trastuzumab , . cancel College of Oncologists : It is strange that the learned Counsel for the 4th Respondent has been able to narrate a series of facts pertaining to the issues under consideration as the 4th Respondent has neither filed a statement of objection nor filed any affidavit. It is to be observed that even the assertion that the 4th Respondent or the College of Oncologists by no means is seeking to promote the Petitioners drug Herceptin or encourage a monopoly for them has not been supported by any affidavit and thus it is not difficult for this court to reject it totally. Similarly all those factual positions narrated by the learned counsel for the 4th Respondent must also be rejected as they clearly amount to either hearsay material or mere third partys opinions of a given set of facts. Such opinions should not have a place in these proceedings as this court is not interested in the opinions of third parties about the issues that it ought to consider in a case before it. The entitlement of 4th Respondents counsel is only to represent his client and act in court to safeguard his clients interests. He should not be entitled to either attack or assist any other partys factual position or interest without first taking up a position in that regard in his pleadings. Such a factual position has to be supported by an affidavit also. Further this Court cannot see any justification as to why the Petitioners have made the President of the College of Oncologists, a party to these proceedings, in view of the statement by the learned counsel for the 4th Respondent that it is not a party against whom relief has been sought and is not an aggrieved party .

Tackling acute coronary syndrome in low-income and middle-income countries

Editorial . :

Thus, we should applaud the decision of Sri Lanka Ministry of Health, taken after the survey, to provide cardiac stents to hospitals with PCI facilities and to include troponin testing as a routine examination in state sector hospitals...."

Troponin Tenecteplase . It is also laudable the recent introduction of state-operated ambulance services in some parts of Sri Lanka, which could lead to the reduction of the total ischaemic time, with further reduction of STEMI in-hospital mortality.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Next, the Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan. You have eleven minutes.

[11.05a.m.] ( . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) Madam Presiding Member, first I want to bring to the notice of the House the shortage of medical officers in the Northern Province. At present, in 2019, 84 medical officers are working in the Mullaitivu District even though the approved cadre is 130. So, there are 46 vacancies for medical officers in the Mullaitivu District alone.

When we take the Northern Province, a total of 224 vacancies of medical officers exist at present, even though the approved cadre is 862. There are 27 hospitals idling without a single medical officer in the Northern Province. In the Jaffna District it is 10; in Kilinochchi it is three; in Mannar it is eight. In Mullaitivu, four hospitals such as the Primary Medical Care Unit in Thevipuram, Divisional Hospitals in Naddan Kandal and in Thunukkai are idling even without a single medical officer. You have taken some steps to appoint some MOs to two of the hospitals. I am happy that you have taken that step. Even though you have taken that action, those medical officers have vanished without reporting there. They say that they do not have enough facilities in those hospitals.

District General Hospital Vavuniya is the major functioning hospital in the Vanni Region. Patients from Mullaitivu, Mannar, and Kilinochchi Districts and border villages of Anuradhapura District who need specialized services get admission to the District General Hospital Vavuniya.

2383 2384

2019 27

My expectation is that the Hon. Minister would take steady action to appoint permanent Ward Certified Consultants to the District General Hospital Vavuniya. The administrators in the Health Ministry are trying to keep our District General Hospital as a model of a training hospital and they are reluctant to appoint permanent consultants there. A similar shortage of consultants are noted also in other hospitals in the Vanni District. No eye surgeon has been appointed to the District General Hospital Vavuniya for a long period. Poor people and old people in my constituency are greatly affected from lack of eye care services. I humbly request the Hon. Minister to kindly take urgent action to appoint a permanent eye surgeon to the District General Hospital Vavuniya instead of appointing temporary doctors or temporary consultants.

Madam Chair, there are also shortages of visiting physicians and visiting surgeons in the hospitals in the Vanni Region, mainly in the District General Hospital Vavuniya . The other thing is that there are a lot of administrative services that are affected in the Vanni Region and in the Northern Province also. Even though postgraduate studies are conducted with the view of strengthening administrative services in your Ministry, about which I am happy, you have failed to strengthen the health administrative service as the Minister of Health. I got to know that more than 300 medical officers have completed postgraduate studies in MD, MSc in Medical Administration. But, I do not know what happens to them. I heard that all those senior medical officers who have completed MD, MSC in Medical Administration were hanging around without getting proper appointments.

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) When I took up this Ministry, there were 73 vacancies in the Senior Administrative Grade along with the acting posts. I regularized that. It was with the Public Service Commission for a long time. Then, with regard to the 230 Deputy Administrative posts, it too was with the PSC for a long time. I had to struggle with the PSC. So, all these medical officers will be appointed in another weeks time.

( . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) I will now bring another matter to your notice, Hon. Minister. Please make a note of it. Posts such as Regional Director of Health Services for the District General Hospital, Mullaitivu, Medical Superintendents for the District General Hospital, Mullaitvu, Base Hospital Mallavi, Base Hospital, Pudukuduirippu and Base Hospital Mankulam are vacant and all these hospitals are also lacking Deputy Administrative Medical Officers.

However, my problem is that one of the junior medical officers has been covering the duties of the Regional Director of Health Services in the District Hospital, Mullaitvu for more than five years. She has not even completed the training of a medical officer. So, how can the senior medical officers work under a junior

officer? You say that you are appointing administrative medical officers but no officer has yet been appointed for the District Hospital, Mullaitivu. Therefore, my humble request to you is, please take urgent action to appoint a qualified medical officer there. A lot of administrative medical officers are idling. There are more than 300 medical officers who have achieved the required qualifications for Deputy Administrative Officers. There are some vacancies in the Mullaitivu District as well, but your administrative officers have failed to fill those vacant positions.

Then, there is another matter that I would like to bring to your notice. There are unscrupulous attempts taken to block the medical graduates who have completed their pre-medicine studies in foreign universities recognized by the Sri Lanka Medical Council. This started happening recently. To my knowledge, there are 83 medical students who have completed their written final exams in Sri Lanka according to the instructions given by the Sri Lanka Medical Council. Now they are waiting for the viva. But the Sri Lanka Medical Council is not taking steps to hold the viva exam for those students, after the GMOA made objections to the DGHS. So, it is a very unfair act. These type of acts cannot be tolerated. Being the Minister, you are the highest authority in the health sector representing the Government.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. (Dr.) Sivamohan, you have only two minutes more.

( . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) What about the balance 5 minutes? ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) You have already taken that five minutes. ( . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) Okay, I will conclude.

So, the GMOA wrote a letter to the DGHS. That is why the Sri Lanka Medical Council objected to it. Even though there was a notice appeared in the Daily Mirror and Daily News on 22nd March and in Lankadeepa on 23rd March, 2010, the Sri Lanka Medical Council instructed students in 1st of June, 2010 not to enter foreign Medical Universities without getting through the G.C.E (A/L)

They have certificates from foreign universities. They have completed pre-medicine in Physics, Chemistry and Biology. After completion of pre-medicine course only they are allowed to follow medical studies during the balance six years. So, this is very unfair. You will have to stop these type of activities immediately. You are the

2385 2386

highest authority. If you think that the GMOA can do whatever they want, please handover the Health Ministry to the GMOA and leave it. Then, they will run the Ministry. As the Minister, you will have to take a stern action for obstructing these 83 students. Another 200 students are pending. Parents of all those students are complaining. They have spent a lot of money. They sent their children abroad for studies because we do not have any private medical colleges in Sri Lanka. But in South East Asia and all over the world, private medical colleges are there. That is up to you. These students have completed their studies. They have passed their theory and practical examinations and if you obstruct the viva like that, it is very unfair. Therefore, please take immediate action regarding this.

I have a letter and I am tabling* that.

We know that you are keen to promote the local manufacture of pharmaceuticals in the country. For that matter, successive Governments have tried to improve the local manufacturing. But, as per the current status, the local manufacturing companies, including the state owned State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation, provide only 20 per cent of the market need. Sometime ago, considering the economies of some of the giant scale manufacturers in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, we thought that we might not be able to compete, but our local industry has proved otherwise. We believe that they will be able to provide at least sixty to seventy per cent of the Sri Lankan market need. So, the Government has to give them the necessary support. In relation to that, I urge the Hon. Minister to provide a green channel.

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Hon. Member, we now provide a fifteen-year buy back guarantee if they come for a joint venture with the SPMC.

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana) Very good. ( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) If they go independently, we provide a ten-year buy back guarantee. Now about sixteen people have signed agreements with us. Eight have already started the ventures, four are now producing and three have already started supplying.

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana) Thank you very much, Hon. Minister. ( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) We will have about 80 per cent of our products. ( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana) We commend that you have given the buy back guarantee. But at the same time, I wish to remind you that it was initiated during our time. It was the then President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, who initiated it for the first five years. It is a good thing that you have the buy back guarantee, but at the same time I need to remind you at this moment, that there was a green channel for the registration process of local manufacturers. At that time, it was expedited through the green channel. The CDDA - the Cosmetics, Devices and Drugs Authority - had a green channel to expedite the registration process. But, when it comes to the NMRA, National Medicines Regulatory Authority, there is no green channel. On the other hand, the price of registration of products have gone up to about US Dollars 900. You have demarcated this price for the international manufacturers. But, now the Sri Lankan manufacturers also have to pay that amount, which comes to about Rs.190,000 for the complete registration, and this is a staggering amount of money.

Hon. Minister, firstly, I request you to have a green channel. Secondly, I request you to give a concessionary price for the registration process. Rs.190,000 for a Sri Lankan manufacturer is a little too much, I believe.

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) At the concessionary rate, everybody came and registered but they never took part in the tenders. They were having other procedures. Now, only the genuine persons come for registration.

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana) Sir, in that case you can look into those manufacturers. But as a method to promote the Sri Lankan industry, I suggest that you should have it.

Then, there is the buy back guarantee but on the other hand there is a concern about taxation. The local manufacturers have to pay a 7.5 per cent Ports Authority Levy for empty capsules, packaging material and excipients, whereas finished pharmaceutical formulations are imported into this country without any taxation, which is good. If it is transferred to the end consumer who is the patient, it is good. But at the same time, Hon. Minister, kindly make sure that the local manufacturers do not have to pay this tax, the Ports Authority Levy for

2467 2468

[ (); ]

2019 27

the empty capsules, excipients, raw materials and packaging materials. That is also a lending hand for the local manufacturers.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . .

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana) Madam, please give me one more minute. There was a tax holiday for five years for the local manufacturers. Then there was 14 per cent corporate income tax and it has gone up to 28 per cent of corporate income tax during the past years, which is a very high amount for the local manufacturers. You know, these are difficult economic times and they find it extremely difficult because this erodes their profit lines. You have to look into that also.

As a final point, I think the Ministry of Health and the State Pharmaceutical Corporation owe billions of monies to the private manufacturers who have supplied pharmaceutical products to the Government last couple of months. Not only to the private manufacturers, they also owe some money to the State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation. So, kindly look into that matter and settle whatever the monies owe to these companies. Otherwise, they will find it extremely difficult to forge ahead under this difficult economic situation.

Thank you very much.

Hon. Minister, I think in 2012, the Department of National Planning has given approval for Rs. 1,253 million to develop the Kinniya Hospital. But, still, nothing has happened in this hospital. Last year, on 11th May, 2018, the Hon. Minister has arranged a meeting with the officials of the Health Ministry and ordered to prepare a Cabinet Paper to carry out the work in the Kinniya Base Hospital, Mutur Base Hospital and the hospitals in Thoppur and Pulmoddai. The NPD has given approval for Rs. 1,253 million for Kinniya Base Hospital and Rs. 1,406 million for Mutur, Pulmoddai and Thoppur hospitals. So, we have already received the NPD approval. But, I do not know whether the Cabinet Paper has gone or not. Now, almost one year has passed. That is why I reminded that here, Hon. Minister.

Hon. Minister, I think you have prepared a Bill to regulate the private health sector. I think you prepared that before the political crisis that took place on the 26th of October. I do not know what has happened to that Bill.

( ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Hon. Member, I have actually prepared everything. During the crisis period, they took time and now they have filed action against me. But there is no stay order. When I spoke to the Attorney-Generals Department, they asked me to keep that for some time until they settle it in the courts. But if that is getting delayed, I will go ahead with the regulations. With that, we will regulate all the prices in the private sector hospitals. They cannot charge as they want. We have done the pricing, everything is prepared, and the only thing is I have to gazette that.

Hon. Minister, I would make a small request. The vacancies in the Deputy Medical Administrative Grade have not been filled for the last seven years. There are 150 vacancies which have not been filled so far. An interview was held in 2018 to fill these vacancies but up to now appointments have not been given. So I hope that you will take prompt action to fill these vacancies as soon as possible.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Shehan Semasinghe) Hon. Minister, if the company goes into liquidation, then there will not be any possibility of the depositors getting the money. But you said you have a different policy or that you have a plan to sort out this issue. Now without going into liquidation, according to your plan, how long will it take for the depositors to receive their money? Do you have any estimation of how much you will plan to give and what will be the Government's interference into this? How will the government interfere?

2553 2554

( ) The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I think that there is an issue of policy here, and the issue of policy is - this has not happened in the past thirty years - the government does not put taxpayers money to bail out depositors of private companies. All governments up to now have followed that as a policy. Now what they normally do is using the Central Bank as the instrument, they try to resuscitate the business. One method is you capitalize the business by selling some of the assets or other businesses around it and capitalize it. Then some money can be paid back to the depositors. Then usually the investor coming into it resuscitates the company. I cannot tell you exactly what period it will take, because it will be just a guess if I say it, and over the longer term the balance is paid. But then immediately the interest becomes payable and the capital is paid over a longer period of time.
