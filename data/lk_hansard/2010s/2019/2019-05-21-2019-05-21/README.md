: STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ACT:

ORDER [2.26 p.m.] ) ( - ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama - Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade) Hon. Speaker, I move, That the Order made by the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade under Section 3(4) of the Strategic Development Projects Act, No. 14 of 2008 and published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2084/18 of 14th August, 2018, which was presented on 29.03.2019, be approved.

(Cabinet approval signified.)

Sir, under the Strategic Development Projects Act, the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka had identified a project by Waterfront Properties (Pvt.) Limited for a mixed development project at Glennie Street at an initial investment value of US Dollars 650 million in phase 1 and another US Dollars 100 million in phase 2. This project has now commenced, the work has gone on and I believe that US Dollars 340 million has already been invested in the project. Initially, the BOI had given a period of 60 months from the date of the Principal Agreement dated 11th July, 2013 for this company to commence its commercial operations.

However, although the project has commenced construction activities and successfully completed the entire piling work, the basement work and approximately 50 per cent of the concrete work, there have been some delays mainly in piling work due to the rock and soil condition of the site. Furthermore, the excavation work was delayed due to the unexpected heavy rainfall in 2014

and 2015, the difficulties they had faced during basement excavation as the site had to be protected from seepage of Beira Lake into it and because several pits were flooded for over eight months.

Therefore, they requested for an extension of the period of commencement of operations from 60 months to 92 months and I had submitted a Cabinet Memorandum on 19th July, 2018 requesting for this extension and it had been approved on the 31st of July. The Gazette order was also published on the 14th of August, 2018. This is a very reasonable request and I move that this be approved.

Sir, as you are aware, the terrorist activities on the 21st of April, 2019 and the subsequent mob violence on 13th of May will adversely affect the economy of our country, particularly the tourism sector. I am pleased to inform you that the Hon. Minister of Finance, the Hon. Minister of Tourism Development, Wildlife and Christian Religious Affairs and our Government are in the process of implementing a relief programme for all those affected, particularly in the tourism sector and it will be announced in the next few days.

As far as the exports are concerned, I am very pleased to inform you that we are still confident that we can achieve the targets we have set for ourselves in 2019. This is mainly due to the various programmes we have undertaken such as the National Export Strategy, the 2000 Exporters Programme, the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme and so on. But more so, we will achieve these targets due to the untiring efforts of our exporters and entrepreneurs and I wish to thank all of them for their great efforts.

However, as far as the investments are concerned, we will definitely not be able to achieve the targets we have set. Both the local and foreign investors have been thoroughly shaken up with what had taken place on the 21st of April as well as the 13th of May, 2019, where there was mob violence. I am happy to inform you that our security forces and the intelligence units have got the situation under control as far as the terrorist acts are concerned and we are made to believe that within the next month or two, these terrorist can completely be eliminated. However, it is up to us to ensure that this kind of mob violence is not repeated in the future. That certainly has a damaging effect.

As far as new projects are concerned, I am happy to say that some of the new approvals we have granted, particularly in Hambantota for the refinery as well as the cement plant, they are continuing with the work and the investors have told us that they will ensure that the projects are implemented.

At the same time, I will be submitting a Cabinet Paper next week for the setting up of a billion-dollar steel manufacturing and export plant in Trincomalee and I am sure the Cabinet of Ministers will grant approval for that. This types of activities will certainly give the confidence that we need to ensure that our investors are back.

855 856

As politicians, I must say that we cannot evade responsibility for what has happened. We have to take the blame; in some form or the other, we are responsible for what had happened. As you all know, right now, the people in our country detest all politicians, irrespective of whether they are in Government or in Opposition. So, what we do from now on will determine how we can rebuild the country. Therefore, I would appeal to all the Members of this House, let us get together and ensure that there is no more room for terrorism, let us not leave room for mob violence, let us not interfere with the judicial process or with the enforcement of law. The future of our country will depend on the actions that we all take together at this crucial juncture. Finally, I will appeal to all of you, let us get together and rebuild confidence in our country so that our people can have a better future.
