I would also like to refer to an article which appeared, Hon. Speaker, yesterday in the Daily Mirror, saying that you can do this with the existing Penal Code. I would like to remind them that there are ongoing conflicts with competing power centres in Syria; the USA, Russia, Turkey and Iran have all intervened. We also do not want to get drawn into such a situation. Therefore, the defence lawyers can contend that there is no central power authority in Syria and that this provision does not apply to a civil conflict intervened with terrorism. The question is, we talk of foreign power in alliance with us and that is the matter that can be questioned in Parliament. But, Clause 3 (1) (a) of the Counter Terrorism Bill states, I quote:

intimidating a population;

Now you can bring them in under that.

Clause 2(1) shall apply to anyone who commits a crime outside Sri Lanka: intimidating the population of Syria or intimidating the population of Libya. Therefore, it is clear that all those who have returned from Syria are within the ambit of the Counter Terrorism Bill. This Provision of the Penal Code was taken from the United Kingdom law - waging war against the Queen or any friendly power. But all those who returned from Syria have been taken in under the terrorist laws, not under this. Even those who have returned from Iraq, whose central government is backed by them, have been taken in under the terrorism law and certainly not under the existing old law.

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Ashu Marasinghe) In view of the proliferation of fake identity cards, driving licences, passports, birth certificates, and circulation of black money in the economy, will the Hon. Prime Minister look at building a biometric national database including a population register, biometric passports, biometric identity cards, biometric driving licences and install a single-window system for the Sri Lanka Customs that connects with revenue collection system and digitize all key Government departments, Ministries and related organizations and invite the private sector to play an active role in this process?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) An urgent national necessity has arisen to build up and implement an integrated and unified Centralized and Integrated Population Information System to achieve multiple objectives at national level. Absence of such a sophisticated information system has become a barrier to effectively prevent terrorist-related activities, crimes,

money laundering transactions and financial crimes et cetera. This necessity of a comprehensive integrated database was felt more than ever with the recent attacks on the Easter Sunday. Accordingly, I had a meeting with the Minister of Internal Affairs, Minister of Digital Infrastructure and Information Technology, and the Officials of Departments of Immigration and Emigration, Registration of Persons and the Registrar General last week to discuss about a single-window system for Centralized Integrated Population Information System. It was reported that biometrics information systems are maintained at different levels in various agencies. Some of the systems are: National Persons Registry of the Department of Registration of Persons; Biometric Passport System of the Department of Immigration and Emigration; E-Birth, Marriage and Death Registration System of the Department of Registrar General; Revenue Administration Information System -RAMIS- of the Department of Inland Revenue; Automated System of Customs Data - ASYCUDA- of the Department of Customs and Integrated Treasury Management System - ITMIS- of the General Treasury. However, there is no integrated system of sharing available information with different agencies. Many countries in the world have developed and implemented state-of-the-art systems to ensure both national and international security.

Taking these facts into consideration, we have decided to develop a Centralized Integrated Population Information System which would be able to facilitate not only the national security requirements and anticorruption initiatives but also the effective delivery of government services to the citizens. Departments of Registration of Persons, Registrar General, Immigration and Emigration, Census and Statistics, Registrar of Companies, Motor Traffic, Pensions, Elections, Inland Revenue, Police and the Ministries of Defence, Justice, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government will join hands in developing this proposed system. Accordingly, instructions were given to the Ministry of Internal and Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government to submit a Proposal and an Action Plan in this regard within two weeks for the approval of the Cabinet.

Further, the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade is working on developing a single-window system for the revenue collection which is a requirement under the WTO Agreement. Accordingly, the ASYCUDA system of the Customs has been connected already to the RAMIS of the Inland Revenue and ITMIS of the General Treasury for data sharing purposes.

Now, it has all got to be brought into one interchangeable database.

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Ashu Marasinghe) Hon. Prime Minister, are you willing to connect this biometric database with the databases such as the international criminal and terrorist databases of the Interpol?

339 340

2019 08

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) We have already connected with the Interpol and once the local ones are connected, those will be connected to other necessary databases. There is a large number. We will have to select what is necessary.

Sir, I must say this. There are 1,698 asylum seekers. Of them, 869 have already been cleared as refugees in this country. Forty have not qualified and they will be repatriated out of Sri Lanka within the next few weeks. These people have come here as religious and ethnic minorities. The information is available with the Defence authorities and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They have been cleared by the Defence authorities. Therefore, we need to look at these people as people who are fleeing persecution in their own countries. Out of these people, we know that 416 have already been accepted by the United States of America, seven by Great Britain, three by France, 162 - under the Private Sponsorship of Refugees Programme - by the Canadian Government and a further 234 have already been submitted for clearance. Therefore, for about 1,000 of these refugees, the Sri Lankan Government is systematically, observing international law and looking at it with the United Nations Human Rights Commission, trying to find countries to resettle them.

The Holy Prophet Muhammad warned his followers of a group of people after his death. He mentioned their arrival and characteristics more than ten times. He said, When you see the black flags, then remain on the ground and do not move your hands or feet. Their hearts will be like iron rods. There will come towards the end of time a group of people, young men, they have the most grandiose visions, they are speaking the best speech that you will ever hear of any man. But they will leave Islam like an arrow leaves its prey. . - - .
