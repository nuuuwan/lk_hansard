, . . , . "The Island" . , . , . ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) , . ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . Please! You can reply later. I do not want to quote this. I will send you the newspaper.

It is in the Headlines of "the Island" newspaper. You would have read it; I have read it. So, both of us know what is the context of this and we appreciate what the Hon. Rauff Hakeem stated informing the House of the

real position. What we are worried is, Hon. Speaker, whether these Ministers are in their offices or whether they have resigned. Because when the question was posed by the Opposition the Leader of the House did not say that they are holding the miniterships. As a result, you, Hon. Speaker, summoned the Party Leaders on Tuesday and rescheduled the Business for next week assuming that these Ministers have resigned. As a result, the date that you gave, 18th of June, for the No Confidence Motion was not listed.

What I want to find out and get a ruling from you is whether the Debate on the Vote of No Confidence against the Minister - which was presented by over 60 Members of Parliament- is on or not, because it is in the Order Paper. Please inform us and the House whether the Debate is on or not. If the Minister says, I have resigned, he should know how to resign. The Prime Minister says that he has not resigned according to the Nineteenth Amendment. The Hon. Rauff Hakeem will agree with me that the Prime Minister says it has not been accordingly done. So, that is the Prime Ministers view. But the view before the House is whether you are Ministers or not as a result of the statement made by the Secretary to the President. Therefore, we request the Hon. Speaker to make this matter clear, so that Parliament and the country also know where we stand. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay. [Interruption.] Yes, Hon. Rauff Hakeem. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) I am fully possessed of what the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena says. He wants to score a brownie point over our anxiety and anguish. But what we said in Sinhala was very clear that it was a technical issue as to whether a collective letter given to the Prime Minister would amount to resignation by us. The Prime Minister had a genuine difficulty because the only thing he could do based on that letter - since the Constitution says that we have to individually hand over the letter addressing the President - he advised us that it would be better for us to give individual letters. But by the time he advised us the Ramazan festival had come. Therefore, most of us had gone to outstations. In that background, we have submitted our letters today. Therefore, this issue of us continuing in office after Monday is only a technical issue, because though we have openly announced our resignations, it is assumed that as if we are in office. But, the fact is that none of us attended to any of our official functions; none of us attended our offices nor did we take part in official functions as Ministers. That apart, the Constitution itself, whether it is Nineteenth, Twentieth or whatever Amendment, even the previous Eighteenth Amendment, this provision relating to resignation remains the same. So, it should not be confused. Therefore, in this situation, it must be well understood that this is only a technical issue but the fact remains that we had resigned with effect from last Monday.

Hon. Presiding Member, while the House debates today the Institute of Valuers of Sri Lanka (Amendment) Bill brought forth by the Hon. Minister of Finance, I wish to state at this juncture that very little credit is given to the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, one of our nations foremost statesmen and a leader par excellence, who, today, champions the concept of inclusivity, coexistence and moreover hope - hope that the work we do here in this House could shape a brighter Sri Lanka for the future. Hon. Chair, given the vitriolic diatribe prevalent in the discourse in all parts of our country today, our nation is in dire need of leaders like our Finance Minister, someone whom I firmly believe is ahead of our times. I thank the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera.

Madam, I rise today when our nation is in the depths of deep despair in the aftermath of the barbaric terror attacks on the 21st of April. What we witnessed immediately after the attacks is a testament to the true Sri Lankan spirit, where we Sri Lankans are a truly unique people and it is naturally inherent for us to be compassionate, sharing, resilient and tolerant. However, our people are on the brink of falling prey to the acts of

1615 1616

2019 06

undesirable, divisive elements with agendas of the age-old political strategy of divide and rule and which have seized this opportunity to spread hate and incite racial unrest against an otherwise patriotic and peace-loving people in an effort to create political instability for their own gain.

Madam, as a proud Sri Lankan, I am one of over two million Sri Lankan Muslims who have, from time immemorial, always fearlessly exhibited unstinted patriotism to Mother Lanka and have contributed immensely in countless ways to the development of our nation, especially in the preservation of national sovereignty throughout the course of our history. Furthermore, the Muslims in Sri Lanka have practised our faith, a faith that has peace as its cornerstone and tolerance, acceptance and respect for all other faiths and cultures prevalent in our rich diverse country.

This House is well aware of the contributions that the Muslims have made from the times of yore to the establishment of the Republic, to become an economic powerhouse, contributing largely to our nations coffers, and the ultimate sacrifices they have made for the country in this modern day through our times of war and peace. I myself sacrificed my Seat in this House in 2004 and nearly my life for the sake of ushering in peace and stability in our country on behalf of all citizens. These contributions were on full display in the aftermath of April 21st, where the Muslim community worked day and night alongside our gallant security forces to identify those who were directly or indirectly associated with the terrorists. It is purely due to these actions, the Hon. Prime Minister stated two days ago, that Sri Lanka has established a world record in eradicating ISIS terrorism from our country within a period of one month.

This would not have been possible without the direct cooperation and collaboration with the Muslim community in Sri Lanka.

Despite all this, however, we have witnessed regretfully that continuing hatred being unleashed, unrestrained and unabated on the Muslims of Sri Lanka, as the Government looks on silently and passively, albeit a few lone voices are there like that of the Hon. Minister of Finances.

Furthermore, these elements with vested interests have mobilized rabble-rousers to discredit the Government by way of levelling allegations against certain Muslim politicians and accusing them for being complicit with the terrorists of April, 21st attack.

It is in this backdrop, that eight of my fellow Muslim Colleagues in this House and myself, who held ministerial portfolios in this Government, decided to tender our resignations unconditionally with immediate effect three days ago to facilitate the Government to investigate into these allegations expeditiously for the protection and well-being of not just the Muslims, but all people in this country and safeguard the international reputation of our motherland.

Madam, I would like to tell those who were involved in these diabolical and heinous acts that we pledge our fullest cooperation and work alongside the authorities to let the highest penalizations be served upon you, irrespective of who you are and what your beliefs may be.

Furthermore, we would be failing in our duties as elected representatives, if we allow the Muslim community to be racially stereotyped and marginalized based on the whims of a deranged few who claimed to act in the name of our faith. They did not speak or act on behalf of us and we will raise our voices for the rights of the two million patriots who live and breathe for our country.

In this light, Madam, I appeal in the highest possible manner to the leaders of the Government to take swift and punitive action against these hate-mongers, who are walking through our streets spewing vile racism with impunity.

In the same manner, Madam, I appeal to the Hon. Members of this House on both sides of the divide, to avoid the urge to politicize this situation and exercise prudence to establish a bipartisan approach together to assure safety, integrity and sovereignty of our country.

In the midst of all this darkness, let us seize the opportunity to emerge with hope by setting the past aside and look to the future for the sake of our children. Let us defeat hate with love, compassion and tolerance and by doing so, we could destroy the agendas of our enemies. Sri Lanka, our beautiful resplendent country has a bright future ahead. Therefore, let us attain that future by first achieving integration and reconciliation, not in isolation and separation.

Thank you for the time given, Madam. ( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) Madam, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Bimal Rathnayake) , . , . , .
