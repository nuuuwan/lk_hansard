, . . ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) , . . [10.01 a.m] ( ) (The Hon.Vasantha Senanayake) Hon. Chairman, I feel privileged to speak a few words here as I myself have, in a previous avatar, briefly held the position of State Minister of Foreign Affairs and in this context, I am particularly pleased to speak a few words on foreign affairs.

One of the prerequisites for a good functioning Ministry is to have an unbiased Secretary who works in the national interest without any vested interest. In this context, I wish to congratulate the Government in the appointment of Ravinatha Ariyasinha as the Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A good Secretary, of course, will necessarily require the assistance of well-trained career diplomats. But it is not untrue to state that some of our ambassadors that have performed very well for this country in various overseas destinations, such as Neville Kanakaratne in India and the USA, Chris Nonis in the UK and Bharathi Wijeratne in Turkey were non-career diplomats. However, that has proven to be the

exception rather than the norm. More recent appointments of political persons to these offices have proven to be disastrous. Yes, in previous eras too, political leaders made political appointments to these positions. However, the countrys image overseas was often taken into consideration and factors such as educational qualifications of these people, the social skills and the international exposure that they possessed were also taken into consideration before making such appointments.

In the last decade, henchmen of regimes have taken these positions with neither skills nor exposure, but, most often, with deplorable lack of social skills and social graces. When such people took top jobs, what happened was the unfortunate career diplomats had to be the deputy of such persons covering up their mistakes and whitewashing the glaring wrongdoings that they have perpetrated. I would like to point out that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a great backlog of distinguished career officers within their ranks and I wish to urge our political leaders to halt making these political appointments and to give preference to such distinguished career diplomats that have put many years of service into the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

However, an important factor that we have to take into consideration is training of our diplomats and the future diplomats as Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar did. Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar even today is respected in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as one of the ablest Minsters of Foreign Affairs that Sri Lanka has ever produced and his tenure in that Ministry has been regarded as the golden era of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs itself. He invested much in training our diplomats and he saw that as a future investment for our country. In fact, ambassadors Aruni Ranaraja and Dharshana Perera, husband and wife - the only ambassador couple that I know of - who serve in Philippines and Indonesia respectively proved beyond doubt that they are very capable ambassadors. They also gratefully acknowledge that they got where they are now due to the training that they achieved during the time of Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar.

The present Secretary is doing his utmost to keep the Minister informed of what is happening around the world and Minister, in recent times, has done very well, I would say, particularly, with regard to denouncing the Darusman Report and organizations that tend to quote Darusman Report as if it were gospel. The Darusman Report is full of hearsays borrowed and quoted at ad nauseam by prejudicial parties, third parties in some cases, without any corroboration of the facts stated therein. The Darusman Report should not have been denounced by this present Minister but the Ministers before him. But, at least, it is better late than never. And, I congratulate the Minister for having done so. Some people, perhaps, are of the belief that if we bend to the West and agree with everything the West says, right or wrong, the West will favour us and look on us in a positive light. However, I would like to say that this is wishful thinking and the West, like everyone else, must be told when they are wrong that they are wrong.

We must consider our geographic neighbourhood more closely. It has been shown historically as well that the Indo-Sri Lanka relationship is of particular importance to us and a relationship that we should try to nurture and develop. Indian tourism alone can be very significant to our tourism trade. India, as a market, can be of huge potential to Sri Lanka, but not vice versa. India has a billion people and that market, if trapped intelligently, can be of great benefit to us. A cooperative India may assist us in combatting negative international opinion and publicity. Through New Delhi, we may also have links to diplomatic missions and countries that are not represented here. Historically, Emperor Ashoka sent to his friend King Devanampiyatissa his emissaries with the gift of Buddhism, which has since enriched this country with Dharma, tradition and literature.

Since Independence, complex social issues such as the Kachchativu Island issue, the Sirima-Shastri Pact and so on had been sorted out by friendship and negotiation. Similarly, the assistance from the Modi Government to our present Y ahapalana Government in starting a free ambulance service is a gesture of great friendship between our countries. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Senanayake, you have another two minutes. ( ) (The Hon.Vasantha Senanayake) Thank you, Sir. It is true, we may have issues with India. But, it is almost inescapable and as neighbours, we will have common issues. The most persistent and annoying of those issues is the piracy of our fisheries and the destruction of our marine environment. That has to be seriously curtailed, if not stopped altogether. Yet, we, as sister nations, have been able to combat even greater crises. If we have the political will and of course, the negotiative skill, much can be resolved with the cooperation of India. When I met Prime Minster Modi in Kathmandu, Nepal last year, I vividly recall what he was trying to say. He was hell-bent on trying to help Sri Lanka. He is a man who actually wants serious discussions to be followed by actions. He is anxious to help us and has indicated this in very plain terms. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) , . ( ) (The Hon.Vasantha Senanayake) Sir, give me a few seconds and I will finish my speech.

On our part, it is up to us to take advantage of that offer. We have, as the Indian High Commissioner, a man

who has a deep friendship with Sri Lanka, who has at various stages of his life, been in Sri Lanka and who looks to us as friends. India's Minster of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj is one of the loveliest Foreign Minister in the world and I have said that quite often. If we cannot take advantage of this trio to our advantage, I think we do ourselves a great injustice.

It was our Foreign Policy at the time of Independence to be on the friendliest terms with all the nations of the world with enmity to none. We have shifted once again to this vision, but I say that we need to be proactive and not passive in this endeavour, seeking out opportunities and making our way confidently. Competency, responsibility and the will to do so will see us triumphed. It is my hope for this Ministry and this country that we will not be lacking competency in this particular area. Thank you.

Deputy Chairman, I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of Finance, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, for the excellent Budget presented for 2019 under the United National Front Government led by the Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil

2199 2200

2019 26

Wickremasinghe. The Budget has been well accepted by the people, the industrial sector, the entrepreneurs and the business community as a very progressive, development-oriented Budget. Even the Opposition has accepted that. Although this is termed as an election year, the Hon. Minister of Finance has given the highest priority to the strengthening and lifting the economy and developing the country which is highly commendable. It compels me to mention that development is based on freedom and the end of the autocratic regime in 2015 helped restore law and order and rule of law, a significant political achievement which immensely benefitted economic development of this country. The improvement in law and order situation helped revive tourism and the focus on the improvement and development of tourism during the last four years is proved by the fact that Sri Lanka has earned the title, "Worlds Best Tourism Destination" by the "Lonely Planet", "World Travel Guide", "Watchdog", and many other international magazines have recommended Sri Lanka as the ideal destination for tourism. This fact itself denotes the success in the way forward chartered for tourism in the country. The shine of this achievement becomes more radiant due to the obstacles in the form of internal and external challenges that had to be faced in the recent past. The forward march of tourism was interrupted by the ill-conceived political anarchy created in October last year, which burst the tourism bubble carefully created and which led to thousands of tourist arrivals been cancelled and millions of revenue lost. The October political chaos had a massive negative impact on sustainability of tourism and economically for the country with a breakdown on the momentum of development.

As for the Budget presented, as the Minister of Tourism I am pleased with the incentives offered to the tourism sector, which I am confident, will help achieve the targets we have set for the industry while ensuring sustainable growth. At this point, I would like to recall some of the Budget Proposals - I may not be able to go into detail, but will briefly mention them. Allocations have been given to construct the sanitary facilities at bus terminals and railway stations which are very often used by the tourists.

I also welcome the accelerated Cess reduction programme for intermediate goods that drive up costs in the construction and tourism sectors. Then, also, we have the Proposal to exempt the Nation Building Tax - NBT- on foreign currency receipts by tourist hotels registered with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority. Whilst we recognize the benefits of the online reservation system, we are mindful of the need to gradually integrate the SME tourism sector into the formal economy. Then, there is another Budget Proposal. The Economic Service Charge - ESC- applicable for export sectors which are subjected to Corporate Income Tax of 14 per cent, will be reduced to 0.25 per cent from 0.5 per cent. Then, the Central Cultural Fund will provide necessary funds to improve and establish common facilities including restrooms, signboards, security booths, information booths et cetera at popular tourist sites managed particularly by the Central Cultural Fund which are at present in a deplorable state. The entrance fees for national parks and cultural sites will be reduced by 50 per

cent for foreign tourists and online booking for ticketing will be in operation with effect from 1st June, 2019.

The Gamperaliya Scheme, a landmark project and Enterprise Sri Lanka will look into the infrastructure needs that have prevented our villages from becoming the growth centres and empower the new generation of entrepreneurs that will have a positive bearing on the development of tourism driving forward the economy. I am happy that an allocation of Rs. 200 million has been made to develop the infrastructure facilities at Madhu Shrine, an epicentre of worship for thousands of Christian and other devotees arriving throughout the year. These are some of the important Proposals that will have an impact on the tourism industry.

I would also like to state that when I took over the Ministry in 2015, the arrival of tourists were at 1.5 million. By the end of last year, we were able to increase that number to 2.3 million despite obstacles and impediments, and I am very confident that by the end of this year, we would be able to achieve our target of 3 million of tourist arrivals. What this means is that in a matter of four years we have doubled the number of tourist arrivals. , .

I must also dwell on the revenue aspect. When I took over this Ministry, the revenue from tourism was estimated at US Dollars 2.5 billion and Sri Lanka received US Dollars 4.3 billion of revenue last year. By the end of this year, we expect tourism revenue to hit at least US Dollars 5 billion. This is, yet again, a 100 per cent growth in the period of four years. Let me emphasize that this is direct revenue from the tourists who visit the country. On the other hand, the country has received over US Dollars 4 billion in Foreign Direct Investments in the hotel sector and in other tourist centres.

It is no secret that there has been a massive growth in the countrys hotel sector with an estimated 90,000 rooms, both in formal and informal sectors, being added to cater to the growing demand. It is also noteworthy that the biggest hotel brands in the world have already invested in the country or have shown interest to do so. Some of them are yet to be constructed; some have been completed and they are growing. We are also very keen to promote Sri Lanka as a 365-day Destination and in order to increase arrivals in the so-called off-season months from May to October, we have proposed to grant free visa on arrival to citizens of nearly 39 countries. This includes Sri Lankas main tourism source markets and others with potential to increase the present numbers. In order to further promote off-season travel, we also hope to conduct a Sri Lanka Travel Mart towards the end of May in Colombo where 200 foreign tour operators who have never marketed Sri Lanka will be invited to participate. They will be taken around the country and shown our best tourist attractions.

In addition, we also hope to launch an attractive country package for off-season travellers at a discount rate. The package will include air travel, accommodation and inland travel. This will be done in association with all industry stakeholders including foreign airlines and hotel

2201 2202

chains. As a result of these measures, we hope to achieve 20 per cent of growth in the off-season arrivals. I am also happy to inform that the long-awaited country branding under the theme So Sri Lanka was announced at the WTM in London last November. Since then, a digital campaign has been running in the UK, Germany, France, China and India. I am happy to announce that the campaign will be officially launched at the Arabian Travel Market in Dubai next month.

Sir, I am happy to inform you that Sri Lanka is now attracting a large number of young tourists who are interested in adventure tourism. Of the number of tourists, around 60 per cent belong to the traditional tourist category while the balance 40 per cent are interested in adventure activities. There is an immense interest in adventure sports such as surfing, hot air ballooning and Scuba diving. Places like Mirissa, Kalpitiya, Kuchchaveli, Ella and Arugam Bay are now famous adventure hotspots and we hope to develop many other resort areas to cater to the type of tourists who are looking for adventure.

I am happy to mention that we have attracted a world-focused international adventure racing to the country with the Ironman held for the last two consecutive years. The Raid Amazones for all women and the AR World Championship are to be staged here in December, 2019. We are benefitted by these events opening our windows to a worldwide audience.

The Homestay Concept is now becoming popular in the rural areas. We have launched a loan scheme to help small-timers to upgrade their facilities and benefit from tourism. To maximize the impact from the tourist point of view, we are contemplating to provide them with conditional licences for beer and wine as well. The Homestay Concept has opened up a new revenue stream for these people who are now economically benefitting from the tourism sector, particularly, the low-income group.

Under the patronage of Sri Lanka Tourism, dolphin and blue whale watching has now become a tourism hotspot rising in popularity and earning a revenue of nearly Rs. 4 million a day. Well-equipped tourist police stations are being established at popular tourist centres including beaches for the safety of the tourists. A new tourist police station was opened in Mirissa last week.

Sri Lanka Tourism conducts training programmes and examinations for accreditation of tourist guides with required knowledge in languages, history and other aspects and efficient tourist guides are now being trained and put to the industry. I also wish to record that we are in the process of opening up all the domestic airports to the private operators for speedy transportation to tourist destinations within the country.

I also wish to inform that CITES, the world organization for the protection of species of the wild - meaning animals and plants - has decided to hold their next convention in Sri Lanka which will be held in May, 2019 with a massive participation of nearly 4000

delegates; perhaps the biggest such participation in the history of this country. This is a signal for the recognition of Sri Lanka as a popular destination.

Sri Lanka Tourism is on course attracting a large luxury cruise ships to call at Trincomalee, Colombo and Hambantota Harbours bringing in thousands of high-spending tourists who also do the local tours.

I also take this opportunity to mention that plenty of time and effort has gone into lifting Sri Lanka to the level of recognition and success that has been achieved. With the responsible officials of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, I have spared no time in attending to nearly all the major tourism promotion fairs and meetings that are held across the world.

I must emphasize that there are certain impediments that are hindering the growth of the industry. The biggest obstacle at the moment is our Airport which is operating at 160 per cent of its capacity. Therefore, a new terminal is no longer an option but an absolute necessity. I am happy to note that 150 new immigration officers are to be added for duties in order to avoid the delay in the Airport.

We also need to expedite the work of the Central Expressway in order to reduce travel times between destinations and also to open up the Northern and Eastern parts of the country for tourism.

Then, there is also an urgent need to replace the outdated legislation which is a stumbling block to many of our tourism development projects. The 150-year old Customs Ordinance, 105-year old Excise Ordinance and the Inland Revenue Act come to my mind. Appropriate reforms to these outdated legislations will remove the bottlenecks that impede growth, especially in the tourism sector.

At the same time, we are constantly reminded by the investors about the difficulties they experience in getting projects off the ground. The reason for this is that they are being driven from pillar to post at 20 odd different government agencies to secure statutory approvals and licences. So, it is imperative that the approval process is streamlined to overcome discouraging issues so as to restore the investor confidence for speedy development.

Another area that needs scrutiny is the high costs associated with the operating budget airline flights to Katunayake. Our landing and ground handling charges are unattractive to the budget airlines and this is one factor that is hampering the arrival of more airlines brining more tourists to Sri Lanka. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman)Hon. Minister, you have one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, can I have two more minutes?

Sir, I have to speak about the Ministry of Cristian Religious Affairs also. If I do not touch on that, I think that God will not - [Interruption.]

Sir, there must be a domestic process. The call for an international process is because there is no domestic process. If we had a domestic process to look into all these things, none of these allegations would be made. Today, we have an independent Judiciary. I am sure, within the Constitution, we can find ways and means of dealing with these issues. If we are hopeful of completing this journey of comprehensive reconciliation, then accountability is also a part of it.

, , . . . , , . Sri Lanka has become a hub which has to be promoted especially within South Asia. Most of the business enterprises could be attracted to come here because it is a maximum of just one hour to come to Sri Lanka. But in one hour they cannot get to Delhi and hold similar conferences.

same visa. Their numbers are very high. I do not want to quote the number. We should not be misled. We should know the exact numbers, generally acceptable numbers, of those who have visited Sri Lanka for tourism or connected purposes. This has to be corrected if we are to be more gainful in this area.

I wish the Hon. Minister of Tourism to make Sri Lanka a success story because tourism is one of the potential areas from which Sri Lanka can gain. But, as mentioned by the Hon. Finance Minister, as we have been mentioning right throughout and as you have been mentioning from the Opposition, we have to increase as much as possible the Sri Lankan input to tourism, because the cost of tourists visiting Sri Lanka plus maintenance of a fair percentage of them is dependent on foreign imports. This is an area where we should concentrate, because we can increase our foreign exchange.

[ ] . ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Can a dual citizen contest Presidency? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, we have passed law that a dual citizen cannot. The question you asked is very clear. If a dual citizen seeks nomination, he will have to clear himself of whatever obstacles that are there. So, do not get excited. It is a long way. I do not know whom you are referring to. But, you nominated an ambassador to Scandinavia who came before the High Posts Committee and said that she is a dual citizen, and when we questioned, the Foreign Secretary was trying to defend this, cover it up. It had never happened and it should not happen. I do not know what the position of the Hon. Minister is. He answered a Question in Parliament thereafter and said that it is not in a Circular but it is in a Minute. That is why this issue has come up. But whether it is in a Foreign Service Minute or in a Circular, a dual citizen should not be nominated as an ambassador because that person will have dual loyalties according to the law. That is what happens.

, UNHCR issue . . Lord Naseby reminds the UK Government of the US pullout from Geneva and also to reconsider co-sponsoring this Resolution which is based on wrong facts and figures. Now, if the Resolution is based on wrong facts and figures, how did the Sri Lankan Ambassador sign this? Of course, you might say that in 2015 you did not know. Still, Sri Lanka signed a Resolution against Sri Lanka. Again, you go and vote for the Resolution after condemning the Resolution. Hon. Foreign Minister read a Statement condemning the Resolution and citing these wrong figures, which Lord Naseby had openly rejected from British confidential documents which are available, that the number is not 40,000 and it is very much low. So Sri Lanka should be totally exonerated or that they should be away from co-sponsoring to inquire into these matters in Sri Lanka.

Now the question comes. , . ? , . , , , . . ,

. , Medical Ordinance , .

For example, we cannot, Hon. Chairman, bring in legislation to amend the Medical Ordinance to permit someone who is not a doctor to do a surgery. Even if we bring in that legislation with a referendum and a two-thirds majority, the Supreme Court will never allow that type of legislation to be passed. Likewise, we cannot amend the Aircraft Ordinances to permit people who are not having aircraft licences to fly aeroplanes. So, in the same way, when we speak of foreign judges, we do not know what their qualifications are. In the first place, for a person to be appointed a judge, he must have the basic qualification of being an Attorney-at-law. Even foreign medical specialists, when they come here, they have to pass the Act 16 exam. That is a medical exam designed to judge their competency in the field of medicine. He might be a very eminent medical specialist abroad, but when he comes here, he must satisfy that that criteria we require is there in him. So, in the same way, even though I mentioned in my Statement in the Human Rights Commission that it may require a two- thirds majority and a referendum, we do not know whether it is possible

2307 2308

[ ]

2019 26

to pass legislation in that way. Without legislation we cannot, in any case, have foreign judges sitting in our tribunals to adjudicate the culpability of our citizens.

Sir, before I wind up, I wish to thank all those officers who helped me in my endeavours in the Human Rights Council, Geneva. I would appreciate the guidance that I received from His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister. I wish to thank the team that accompanied me and the Hon. Sarath Amunugama and the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe who helped us to draft the statement, Mr. Ravinatha Aryasinha, Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Nerin Pulle and Mr. A.L.A. Azeez, Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva. It was a teamwork that helped us produce this Statement; it is not my Statement alone. We all got together, and with the guidance that we got from His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister, we were able to put a joint effort and produce a document of that nature. So, I am very thankful and I owe it to them to mention that here in this House.

Also, when it comes to the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I wish to thank all the officers who are present here today in the Officials' Box: Mr. Ravinatha Aryasinha, the Secretary, Mrs. Grace Asiriwatham, the State Secretary, Mr. Ahmed A. Jawad, the Additional Secretary, Mr. Sumith Nakandala, the Additional Secretary, the Directors General, the Assistant DGs and all the other officers in the Foreign Ministry who have helped me to answer all these questions and prepare my statements.

Hon. Chairman, there are so many other things that I would like to advert to as being matters that are relevant to our Ministry and which we have been doing.

For example, restructuring the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the missions abroad; recruitment, training, postings and promotions that we make to enhance the professionalism of our cadres; evaluation of the overall performance of our officers in the Foreign Service; our consular affairs' output both here in Sri Lanka as well as our Missions abroad; our relations with the United Nations and other multilateral and regional organizations; our commitment to disarmament and the role played by Sri Lanka at the Conference on Disarmament where, I think, Mr. Ravinatha Ariyasinha was the President of that Conference in the year 2018; development in the fields of Science and Technology; contribution towards our migrant workers; the Intangible Cultural Heritage - ICH; the Buddhist Diplomacy that we have undertaken to foster through our Ministry; combating terrorism, other transnational crimes and the rise of violent extremism; the climate change that we have tackled; Sri Lankas relations with the EU and the Commonwealth; our bilateral relation; the Ocean Affairs, Environment and Climate Change Division of our Ministry. Then, Economic Affairs. Economic Affairs Division has played a very leading role and this Ministry launched the

Economic Diplomacy Programme in mid 2018 by serving as a catalyst in promoting linkages between key government institutions and the private sector responsible for trade, investment, tourism and foreign employment, and the Sri Lanka missions abroad. Then, our Public Diplomacy Programme; our Policy Planning and Research Programme; our sponsorship of this Resolution and other related matters which I cannot articulate and elaborate here without consuming the valuable time of this House.

Hon. Chairman, I beg your permission to table the rest of my speech so that my speech will be a in full.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Minister, you may table it. : :: Rest of the speech tabled:
