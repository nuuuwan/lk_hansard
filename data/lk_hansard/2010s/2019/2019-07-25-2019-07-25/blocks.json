Sir, the visit of the Special Rapporteur on the Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and of Association, which is currently underway, is part of similar visits undertaken by UN Special Procedures Mandate Holders at the invitation of the Government of Sri Lanka. It is we, the Government of Sri Lanka, who periodically invited these special mandate holders. The idea of welcoming such visits is to have a transparent process in place, whereby the Government of Sri Lanka hopes to engage with the international community, including the UN, in a spirit of openness and dialogue.",

This is a very serious matter where the UN Rapporteur had requested for a meeting and the request was sent by the Acting Secretary in writing seeking for an appointment with the Chief Justice and the High Court Judges. The Minister of course would meet anyone. These Ministers are meeting everyone under the sun. But the issue is, direct involvement with the proceedings of four cases and Hon. Minister, you must read the letter, which states, ...and other related matters. It gives coverage to a whole gambit of cases that are pending in court. The Rapporteur has no mandate to do so. He can ask for the mandate from the Foreign Ministry. He has a mandate, as you know, to give a report. These officials come every year. They came last year also and met the Hon. Speaker and the leaders of political parties. That is a different approach. But, are you going to say that this type of interference - summoning the High Court Judges, the Supreme Court Judges or asking for an appointment specifically in relation to a matter that is already sub judice, in the process before courts - is a normal action of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? It is very sad if you are going to maintain that position The officer is answerable today. The Hon. Speaker has summoned him, warned him and he has already apologized to the Hon. Speaker. So, there was no explanation. The officer, as the Hon. Speaker announced yesterday, apologized for the error. So, how can the Minister come and now say that there is no fault of the officer?",

    "text": "Sir, self-determination is categorized as internal self-determination and external self-determination. There was a famous case in Canada in the Canadian Supreme Court pertaining to the Province of Quebec. Quebec wanted to secede from Canada and sought to secede unilaterally from Canada. The Canadian Central Government and the other provinces opposed it. The matter was referred to the Supreme Court of Canada. I have got the judgment of the Court here with me. I will not read it. But, permit me to say what the judgment states. It states, The Court having inquired into this matter stated that self-determination was either internal self-determination or external self-determination. People have the right to self-determination. But, if the people have the right to internal self-determination within their own State, which means that they have access to governance, if they are able to maintain their self-respect and dignity and fulfil their political, civil, cultural and economic aspirations, then they have self-determination. People who have internal self-determination are not entitled to external self-determination. So, in that context, the people of the State of Quebec have no unilateral right to secede because they had internal self-determination within their own State. If you deny the Tamil people the right to internal self-determination persistently and consistently and if the Tamil people are treated as second-class citizens, we as a distinct people with a distinct cultural and linguistic identity with a tradition and a civilization of our own will be entitled to external self-determination on account of your default. So, please remember that. It will be a great error on your part not to remember that.",
