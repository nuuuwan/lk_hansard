Hon. Deputy Speaker, I wish to take this opportunity to address a serious, baseless allegation levelled against me with links to the Easter Sunday suicide bombers.

First and foremost, I wish to record my outright repudiation of this baseless allegation and refusal to be slandered or deterred from my duty at this watershed moment in our politics. I wish to also emphatically state that false accusations against me or my Party, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, will not frighten us from discharging our sacred duty of safeguarding our democratic gains made after 08th January, 2015 and consolidating our efforts to build a plural, multiethnic, multicultural society that is guided by the Buddhist ethos of compassion, tolerance and truth.

I will not be deterred to address the deep challenges that stretch before us to take forward the stability and recovery that the country is making in this difficult decade of the end of the war. In this difficult period, together, we have ended a war, disrupted terrorist networks and are slowly emerging from a new terrorist network that hit the Catholic community, our community, the Muslims, and the country as a whole. At times such as these, facing a rigorous electioneering period and emerging from terrorism, we must believe that the

891 892

prosperity of all communities in Sri Lanka is inextricably linked. Our communities must allow a new era of cooperation, peace and understanding to ensure growth and stability to meet great challenges and work together to keep the peace for a shared future for all the communities.

At times of strife such as these, I have faith that truth will prevail over untruth. In that hardened faith, I offer the following clarifications on the brazen untruths, cunning innuendos and wicked imputations contained in all media reports alleging my links to the Easter Sunday terrorists, conveying disharmony, vicious, slanderous and treacherous content to cause chaos in the wake of the imminent Presidential Election. Such allegations, as a consequence, have resulted in some Joint Opposition Members placing the Report and the findings of the Parliamentary Select Committee on the Easter Sunday Attack under a cloud - that is what the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena raised this morning - questioning its credibility in the wake of its release.

At issue is a video clip of a public encounter in the year 2015, wherein Zahran Hashim, the suicide bomber, was a part of the audience of a group of people I was addressing. There is another picture where Zahran is shown shaking hands with me. Sir, I am the Leader of a Party that represents an ethnoreligious constituency, that of the Muslims of Sri Lanka. The most substantial segment of this constituency is in the Eastern Province. It is common knowledge that politicians passionately cultivate their foundational constituency and I am certainly no exception to that. When we greet the public, we exude geniality and jollity without exception and as you may know, none of us possesses the psychic powers or clairvoyance to read the minds of people, be they contemporary activists or future suicide bombers. How would I have known then? In 2015, this person and all his accomplices, none of them, were known. Even in the Select Committee, they said that it was only after 2017 that he became a fugitive. Other law enforcement agencies had not identified this man either as a terrorist or a potential terrorist then.

My meeting was an open event and not a secret rendezvous under the culvert as was the case when some erstwhile leaders met the LTTE to persuade terrorists to boycott the Presidential Election in 2005. What was depicted in that video was a meeting with some political activists who briefed me on some incidents of violence and coercive pressure linked to supporters of a candidate in Kattankudi, which, in 2019, turned out to be the epicentre of another terrorism. According to reports, he was a religious preacher then. The event in the video clip was held in the immediate aftermath of the defeat of that candidate in the General Election held in 2015. Soon after his defeat, the candidate was politically dexterous to persuade President Maithripala Sirisena to nominate him on the National List. Emboldened by their political bosses' capacity to be all things to all people at all times, his goons carried out violent attacks on opposing party supporters who caused his defeat at the polls. He also exerted his influence to neutralize the police, they alleged.

The people, as shown in the video clip, approached me as the Leader of the SLMC for redress. Given the existing political culture of that time, it was a very ordinary and routine encounter where people sought justice from political leaders because the candidate was a law unto himself under the patronage of the then regime who had been ousted but their local operator had now switched sides. We had to wait for another four years to receive the wake-up call on Easter Sunday in 2019. The video shows me listening to their grievances.

When I visited the hospital to see those injured, especially a pregnant mother who was also brutally assaulted, the so-called video evidence shows the presence of a high-ranking police officer, Mr. U.P. Dissanayake, DIG, Batticaloa with me. Sir, I would like to table those photographs later. I, too, did not go there in any secrecy.

Quite funnily, I learnt last night that the Hiru TV, which posted the videos, has now removed those as the man standing next to the bomber is the current Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna organizer of Kattankudi, M.S.M. Ziyad, who is also now engaged in making arrangements for an impending visit by Presidential Candidate Gotabaya Rajapaksa to Kattankudi. The alleged video evidence is no longer available on YouTube. But, I have the photographs and I will table them.

The preacher Miflal Ibrahim who makes these allegations against me is an accomplished liar and an agent of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna. He has been used by interested parties to undermine Muslim unity in the past and that seems to be his chosen vocation. Mr. Hizbullahs candidacy is a proxy for the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, which knows that all Muslims will never vote for a party that uses extremist racial prejudice to expand its vote base while pretending to observe political niceties towards minorities. In 2015, this Mr. Miflal Ibrahim contested the Presidential Election under the butterfly symbol to divert Muslim votes, knowing very well that Muslims would not vote the then President who was contesting. I have enough irrefutable evidence to prove his intimate links to senior leaders of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna. I have photographic evidence which I will table to be placed in the Library. I will also have a press conference in the afternoon to show these in public because I do not want to show these openly in the Chamber. But, these will be shown to the press when I hold a press conference in the afternoon.

It is sad that the Joint Opposition is stooping so low. Why are people trying to intentionally destroy and damage my political persona and my personal character and credibility? Prof. G.L. Peiris has also accused me of meeting Prabhakaran. Prof. G.L. Peiris should know that I was part of his own Government team which negotiated with the LTTE. He was not only a Member, but was the principal interlocutor of our team and I met Prabhakaran then at their request. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) With him?

893 894

[ ]

2019 23

( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) No. That was, meeting Prabhakaran separately in the Vanni. That was arranged by the Norwegian facilitators as a part of our negotiation strategy.

The Joint Opposition refused to participate in the Parliamentary Select Committee. Now, it wants to subvert the process of discovering the truth of the Easter Sunday carnage. The so-called alleged encounter with the terrorists was very much in the knowledge of these mudslingers when the composition of the Parliamentary Select Committee was announced. On the eve of the submission of the Report, now they have started howling. There is no other avenue available to them to come to terms with the truth. It is a shame that people are now trying to reduce a painstakingly conducted exercise into a political circus.

I reject these false accusations with the contempt they deserve. If you must resort to character assassination to sustain your political argument, it clearly demonstrates how weak your argument is. Do not judge my character based on innuendo and falsehoods. Instead, I ask you to examine the motives of my accusers.

Truth can only be seen by those who know what truth is. Those who do not have truth in them will always be blind to the truth. Do not look far. They cannot kill the truth. So, they want to kill my character. Character assassins do not hate the targeted person. I am sure the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena does not hate me; I know that. They see the damage done to the persons character as a means to an end to realizing their own goals. This is what you all want to do. You want to assassinate my character as a means to achieve a different goal. Please do not do that. That is not done in gentlemanly politics. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Not among Royalists. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Certainly, not among Royalists.

They have no conscience or sense of remorse. They do not care what happens to that person after they destroyed him. It has absolutely nothing to do with the person attacked. It has everything to do with the assassins ultimate objective for power, power at all cost!

Sir, the details of the photographs and the evidence that we have will be placed before the media in the afternoon. I will also table* those photographs so that they will go into the records.

Thank you.

2018 . For the first time since the 1950s, Sri Lanka was able to show a primary surplus balance of 1.6 per cent in 2017. In fact, again we showed a surplus last year, in 2018, and it would be so this year too, despite all these challenges. As you know, from the day this Government came into power, we have had many challenges: in 2016, a severe drought; in 2017, a major flood; in 2018, the Constitutional coup and this year, the Easter Sunday tragedy. But despite all that, even in 2019, we will be able to show a primary surplus balance of at least 0.6 per cent.

. . The first will be the Excise (Amendment) Bill. Presently, there is no provision in the Excise Ordinance for the police officers to initiate proceedings before a magistrate against the offender on matters pertaining to illicit liquor. Therefore, it has resulted in a rapid increase in the trade and consumption of illicit liquor in most parts of the country. Accordingly, Section 35 and 52 of the Excise Ordinance will be amended to authorize the police officers to take legal action on matters pertaining to illicit liquor. . .

The second is, the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill, which provides for the following Value Added Tax Policies: (i) Piece based VAT Rate - The piece-based VAT Rate applicable on domestic sale of certain garments by the export-oriented BOI companies will be increased from Rs. 75 to Rs. 100. (ii) Value of imported goods - The Minister of Finance will be authorized to prescribe the basis for chargeability of VAT of certain goods specified by the Minister by Regulations. (iii) Payment date of VAT - VAT payment dates presently fall on 15th, 20th and last date of the month following each month of a taxable period, which are inconvenient for the taxpayers as well as the tax administration. Considering the requests of the taxpayers, the VAT payment date will be changed to 20th day of the month following the month relevant to such payment. (iv) The locally-produced rice bran oil manufactured out of locally-produced rice will be exempted from VAT.

(v) VAT on the supply of condominium housing units - VAT imposed on the supply of condominium housing units will not be charged where the - (a) unit price of each condominium housing unit of a condominium housing project does not exceed Rs. 25 million. That means all those below Rs. 25 million will be exempted from VAT once this is through. (b) agreement to sell relating to such supply is executed as per Notaries Ordinance prior to the date of commencement of the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Act, or (c) supply of any condominium housing unit which has been completed and in respect of which the Certificate of Conformity has been obtained from the relevant local authority prior to the date of commencement of Value Added Tax (Amendment) Act. In addition to the above, the following Amendments will also be moved during the Committee Stage of the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill. (vi) Reduction of VAT rate applicable on the supply of condominium housing units to 6 per cent and input tax relating to such supply will be counted at 5 per cent. (vii) The supply of goods by the construction contractors to their overseas projects will be treated as exports and they will get all the amenities of the exporters. The third is, the Nation Building Tax (Amendment) Bill. The Nation Building Tax (Amendment) Bill has been prepared to implement the following Nation Building Tax policies, which were proposed in the Budget, 2019 earlier this year. (i) Exemption applicable on the importation of unprocessed gem stones will be granted on the approval of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority, if the payment of such services is in foreign currency and remitted to Sri Lanka. (ii) Exemption applicable on the services provided by the construction subcontractors will be extended to the main contractors as well. (iii) Exemption of hotel services provided for foreign currency. (iv) Exemption of importation of Lucerne meal and pellets. (v) Exemption of locally value added imported palm oil. (vi) Exemption of importation of yachts and other vessels for pleasure or sports in the tourism industry. (vii) Removal of exemption of cigarettes. (viii) Exemption of projects with an investment of US Dollars 50 million or above during the project implementation period or the construction period. The fourth is, the Finance Bill. The Finance Bill provides for the following tax policies, which

955 956

were proposed in the Budget, 2019, earlier this year. (i) Luxury Tax on motor vehicles - The definition of Specified Motor Vehicle for the applicability of Luxury Tax on motor vehicles will be amended to provide for chargeability of the tax based on the price of vehicle instead of engine capacity and specifying the exempt vehicle categories. (ii.) Levy on Foreign Commercial Transactions - Levy on Foreign Commercial Transactions will be charged at the rate of 3.5 per cent on the Credit/ Debit Card payments made to purchase goods and services from outside Sri Lanka. The date of implementation of the Levy will be declared by the Minister by an Order published in the Gazette. In addition to what I mentioned, the following Amendments will also be moved during the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill today. (iii) Carbon Tax - The Carbon Tax which has been imposed under the Finance Act, No.

35 of 2018 will be abolished effective from 01st December, 2019. (iv) Cellular Tower Levy - The Cellular Tower Levy was imposed under the Finance Act, No. 35 of 2018. According to the existing provisions, proceedings are to be initiated at the Magistrate's Court, if any operator defaults the payment of Levy. Provisions for a surcharge will be introduced if an operator defaults the payment of levy, prior to initiating court proceedings. The mobile technology is constantly evolving to keep pace with the growing demand. The Governments ambition is to ensure that consumers have excellent connectivity across the country. In fact, in order to facilitate 5G technology for telecommunication all across the country, I have been told that many more towers are needed and therefore, in order to assist the industry, we are removing this tax completely. Sir, I think my time is up. So, I again thank you for the time given. . . Question proposed.

. startups . Everybody is talking about startups. I saw your presidential candidate also talking about startups. Yes, we must support startups. We must start coworking spaces. We have started coworking spaces in places like Hatch and in other places also, there are coworking places. Beyond that, what we have proposed is for all technology companies to be given benefits of the dividends that founders make. It is the founders - it may be one or two founders or co-founders - who put the original amount of money and the profit accrues to them. The issue is, even though we have brought down the Corporate Income Tax of technology companies from 14 per cent to 5 per cent, what they have been complaining about, Sir, is that on the dividends that they receive, they have to pay another 14 per cent tax. We agree with them that that is not right. That is why we are proposing this and we hope that the Hon. Sajith Premadasa, on the day he becomes the President or in the week thereafter, will be able to completely remove the dividend tax on all technology companies. That is the way, Sir, that we need to incentivize people into complex manufacturing of goods and services and not merely by going up on some stage, looking at some piece of paper, just jumbling something and saying, I will do this" or "I will do that.

Sir, I am going to stop now. This is the last point. Sir, for all the middle-class, young executives who will build the first house, the interest income will be tax free.
