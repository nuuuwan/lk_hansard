Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana, I considered you as a friend. But, your speech was totally wrong. You said that 30 factories have been closed down. That is not true. Ten factories have been closed down, out of 700 factories. You mentioned that fact. There are 700 factories. You come and give different figures. . 15 20 . .

() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana) Hon. Minister, very clearly I said that there are 700 factories and out of that 30 factories are to be auctioned. So, I made a humble request to reschedule the loans. Very clearly I said that. You do that. You were not here during my speech.
