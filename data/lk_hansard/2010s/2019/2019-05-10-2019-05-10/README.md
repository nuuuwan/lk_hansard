( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Various extremists are meeting. Intelligence reports give these information. Let us keep this Debate at a high level. I do not want to criticize individuals of the Government. You have been criticized enough, but you have to do your duty. We are not the Government. The Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa has very clearly stated that we are supporting all security measures that are being taken. But, it is not happening. Day-to-day, the same places are visited and people are being taken into custody; arms, ammunition and explosives are being taken into custody. If the search was correct, that would not happen. This is just one example. . . According to the Constitution ; but cannot remove the IGP. IGP . . IGP . . .

Leader of the House was there. You will agree with me that the state of Emergency has to be extended. We have certain reservations, but we are supporting the extension of the state of Emergency because the country has not been properly provided with the security we want. The day-to-day life has to be restored and all the conspirators should be brought to justice. They have to be taken into custody; they have to be questioned; their links have to be identified. For that, you need the state of Emergency extended as well as the PTA, which has been promulgated. . because the Gazette has to be extended. . . .

the people who send tourists to our country. So, we have to win them over. For that, there has to be a proper programme, which can be expedited across Europe as well as Asia. China is also advising their tourists against visiting Sri Lanka at the moment. In Europe, it is Summer. But, soon after Summer, we have to get ready, for which we have to carry out a very effective propaganda campaign. . . . .

Mavai now asks for Army security to North It is an absolutely distorted news. What I was speaking at that meeting was against the ISIS. The reports had come to the intelligence divisions of Sri Lanka and the Government, but, the President and the Government failed to stop those attacks. So, how can we expect the President and the Government of Sri Lanka would give their security to the Tamil people? I therefore, appeal to the international community and the experienced intelligence divisions of the countries which have diplomats in Sri Lanka to give their protection and security, especially to the North and the Tamil people. They are the most affected even at the moment, on the 21st of April and earlier during the war. That is all I have asked. There is no need to ask the Government at this point even to give security. There are thousands of security officers there.

* : : Document tabled:

As a note of caution, I wish to say that it would also be important to ensure that law enforcement and military responses are carried out strictly in terms of the law; that such measures are proportionate to the envisaged harm and are enforced in good faith and with due diligence. Even at difficult and extraordinary times like this when there exists a realistic and serious threat to national security, and the security of the people of our country is seriously endangered, it is necessary to ensure that the authorities respect the Rule of Law, recognize Constitutionalism, do not violate Human Rights and protect innocent people.

Even when terrorists seem to be inciting civilian communities to act against one another, and engage in retaliatory attacks, let us be

resolute that, while ensuring that we will not allow the ugly face of terrorism to rise its head once again in our blessed country, all communities should necessarily peacefully co-exist in a free and non-discriminatory environment as provided by our Constitution. All communities must enjoy a parity of status, feel secure, and be able to enjoy fundamental freedoms. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) .

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) ? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) 1 9 011 . [ ] . [ ] . What is the problem? This document says, "Around 35 acres of land was leased to the Hira Foundation for the setting up of a rural training centre in 2013 for an estimated lease of Rs. 491,200 per year." . . . It also says, "The taxes per acre amount to around Rs. 14,000 to 15,000." If further says, "We looked into the history of the Hira Foundation and discovered that it was registered on December 10, 2014." 013 . Hira Foundation register 011 . . [ ] .

On July 3 015 . . It is still the same; it is not a university. But the land was given in 2013 and the Hira Foundation was registered in 2014.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

[4.09p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Mr. Presiding Member, I stand up today with a heavy heart to speak a few words with regard to the tragedy that

727 728

[ .. ]

2019 1

took place in this country on Easter Sunday. Several fellow Sri Lankans of the Christian faith who were engaged in religious worship were killed and several others injured. Many foreigners who had come to enjoy the beauty of Sri Lanka suffered the same fate as a result of the explosions that took place at a number of tourist hotels.

The Muslim community has totally condemned these acts of terrorism which are of a barbaric and inhumane nature. These individuals who have committed these acts of carnage have not only harmed innocent human beings but have also dealt a body blow to the country of their birth. Further, they have also caused irreparable harm to the Muslim community by their actions which are completely alien to the letter and spirit of the Islamic teachings.

Let me cite two tenets of the Islamic teachings in support of the view that the terrorist acts of these misguided individuals have no place whatsoever in Sri Lanka. The first is the sanctity attached to human life by Islam. According to the Islamic teachings, if one kills a human being, it is akin to killing the entire human race and if one gives life to a human being, it is similar to giving life to the entire human race. The second is that taking ones own life is condemned and it is an act that attracts the strongest punishment. Therefore, it goes without saying that using suicide as a weapon to kill innocents is all the more reprehensible in the light of the Islamic teachings. Islam is a religion of peace and it deplores violence in any form. Every Muslim is accountable for his actions and is called upon to deal with others with respect. He is required to conduct his life in accordance with Islamic teachings which provide guidance to him in every sphere of life. He cannot escape the consequences of his actions because he cannot hide them from the Almighty Allah.

We believe that every one of those responsible for these inhumane acts should be brought before the law and dealt with according to law. We are happy to note that according to President Maithripala Sirisena, 99 per cent of the terrorists have been arrested. The security forces have been able to achieve this level of success so quickly because they had the cooperation of the Muslim community who hesitantly extended their support to flush out the terrorists. Besides, the number involved, as the President himself has reiterated several times, is less than 150.

I wish also to draw your attention to the need to arrest the phenomenon of hate speech without further delay. This is causing an irreparable damage to inter communal relations. Such hate speech which has targeted the Muslim community has been used on social media and has been going on for some time now. Irresponsible and untruthful comments about the Muslims on social media are poisoning the minds of innocent people and can have dangerous consequences for the country as a whole. The Sinhala people have always trusted the Muslims and maintained good relationships with them in the past. Many Muslim politicians including myself have been elected to Parliament with the support of a large number

of Sinhalese votes. This relationship must not be damaged through the actions of a misguided few.

Where did we go wrong? What faults had we committed? How do we re-emerge as a united nation from these destructions by the terrorists? Can we again resurrect the old glory of our mother country, Sri Lanka? These questions are in everyones mind today in the aftermath of the mayhem and destructions caused on that Easter Sunday morning, just two weeks ago, by terrorists who claimed that they were waging war for the religion. Everywhere, people are in somber mood. Anxiety, fear and concern for the future are consuming everybodys life in Sri Lanka at present. The destructions caused are so vast in terms of lives lost, buildings demolished and economic loss of more than US Dollars 2 billion in the tourism sector alone.

I rise with a feeling of abject embarrassment and trepidation, not just as a Member of this Parliament but as a Muslim who has always been proud of my ancestry in Sri Lanka. Thousand years of our history, thousand years of goodwill and thousand years of mutual understanding among the communities are going up in smoke. Sri Lanka has been the home of Buddhism and in fact, an ordained State by Lord Buddha where Buddhism would survive despite all challenges. Within this belief, my community live as good neighbours with the Sinhala people and other communities.

Our Sinhalese Rulers since way back from Anuradhapura Period took special care to nurture our communities sowing the seeds of tolerance and understanding, so that we lived as true brothers. But all of that are gone in one flame now, and here I stand on this Floor with utmost disgust and anger towards what a small miniscule terrorists have caused in the name of my beloved religion.

We all have known the reason by now. I am not here just to enumerate them.

In short all of us failed in our duty to stay vigilant. A simple dereliction of duty has caused untold sufferings to innocent people including children and our foreign guests.

But why? All of us agree that 10 years of peace and calm after winning a 30 years of ethnic war have lulled everyone in this country into complacency and sleepy state. Now we are woken up with a bang, a bang of lethal bombing that killed as many people and caused damage to our historic churches. How are we going to recover from this?

It is too late to enumerate the reasons for our failure. Basically we all have not comprehended the changes taking place in global politics and radicalization of religious minded and misguided youth.

The rise of ISIS movement provided a rallying point to harness the energy and devotion of the extremist minded youth. They were all misguided and brainwashed

729 730

by the so called leader Shaikh Al Baghdadi and others. Thousands of Islamic youth in the process became cannon fodders to his lofty unrealistic ideology.

Of course, the extremist ideologies enriched the mindset of our Sri Lankan youth like other South Asian and Southeast Asian followers.

Global revolution of information technology also became a serious problem for the moderate Muslims. Dr. Ameer Ali, a moderate Islamic intellectual from Australia nicely define this aspect. I wish to quote his words below from the latest "Colombo Telegraph".

"Those who are being converted to this ideology are the product of the internet generation with handphones and other communications gadgets. Social media brings news and pictures into Muslim homes about happenings outside Sri Lanka and in the Muslim world. A blind religiosity indoctrinated relentlessly through seductive sermons and provocative messages from home and abroad connects this generation to the world Muslim Umma emotionally and imperceptibly. This connection makes it easier for dedicated Islamists to fall prey to jihadist outfits operating internationally."

Many reforms are needed from now on if we are going to see that these things will not be repeated in the future. We must make our school system, Parliamentary politics and even our newly proposed Constitution to shed communalist slant. I know that it is easier said than done and will take, in fact, many years to reverse the damaging trend that we have got used to.

I wish to speak no more than this as my fellow Colleagues are expressing their views very eloquently. All of us agree with their analysis. They are all pointing to one direction that we should come out of this habit as lotus eaters. We need to be vigilant at all times if we are going to fight this menace of extremism. We should mop up all those in hiding and must totally wipe out them as early as possible.

Finally, before I conclude I wish to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt appreciation of humble gratitude to Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith for the role played immediately after the massacre. He exemplified what true Christianity stands for; forgiveness in the presence of God. He showed no malice to the misguided extremist and he was more than determined that no harm should come for the Muslim community at large. He was there to remind us and the world that one cannot blame and the entire community for the damage inflicted by a handful of terrorists and extremists.

After all as Cardinal stood for his principles, we Muslims of the Island equally complemented his stand by whole heartedly cooperating with the Government security agencies to nail down the terrorists without fear or favour.

I propose on the Floor of this august Assembly that His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjiths name should be proposed to be awarded all peace prizes in the globe for what he has achieved and practised. I will even venture to put forward his name to the Noble Peace Prize Committee next year. The Cardinals contribution is that significant to have maintained peace of this country at a time of heartbreak and vengeance. Long live the Cardinal and the Christian principles for which he stand for!

As a Muslim representative in Parliament, I wish to make a humble appeal to our people, especially to the Muslims to behave very responsibly in the hour of crisis. At no time, they should be provoked nor provoke others. The biggest need of the hour is calm, peace and security.

I must emphasize here that my community should not be responsible for the criminal act committed by a very few terrorists. I also appeal to the Sinhala people in general to show their tolerance and kindness that they have always showed to the Muslims in Sri Lanka.

May I call upon all Sri Lankans to unite and work hard to build a strong prosperous Sri Lanka. In such a country, there is no place for any form of violence or hatred for others.

Thank you all. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) I also endorse your suggestion that His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith should get the Noble Peace Prize for his efforts. Thank you very much. The next speaker is the Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena.
