(a) (i) Yes.

(ii) Until the year 2012, the Mahiyangana weekly fair has been conducted in a proper way in the centre of the town in a land owned by the Mahiyangana Pradeshiya Sabha. However, in the year 2012 construction works have been started in that land to build a commercial complex with all the facilities and it is proposed to complete the constructions of the commercial complex by the end of this year.

Because of these construction works the weekly fair functioned in this place is functioning in an empty land near the Budhagaya image owned by the Mahiyangana Raja Maha Viharaya since 2012 with a monthly rent of Rs. 10000.00.

This temporary weekly fair is covered with temporary protect prepared by coconut branches, asbestos sheets and tent clothes without any permanent structures. During rainy days the rain water pouring through these tent clothes and running over the ground, due to this the weekly fair looks dirty in these days.

However, necessary initial activities have been started to construct a fully equipped weekly fair instead of this temporary weekly fair. On the request of the Mahiyangana Pradeshiya Sabha the Uva Provincial Urban Development Authority has included to its 2020 Action Plan and completed the preparation of the plan to build the weekly fair near the proposed commercial complex being constructed in the place where the fair

functioned since 2012. It is expected to complete works of the new weekly fair in the end of the year 2020.

The programme to develop the weekly fair has been included in the Mahiyangana town development programme prepared by the Urban Development Authority as per the request of the Mahiyangana Pradeshiya Sabha and the copy of the town development plan is enclosed herewith.

asked the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation:

(a) Will he inform this House-

(i) whether he admits that the Sri Lanka Railways, which is one of the main modes of transport in Sri Lanka, is faced with the problems of not being punctual, not running railways properly and over crowdedness;

(ii) if so, the reasons for that;

(iii) the number of trains of running condition in the Department of Sri Lanka Railways;

(iv) whether they can meet all the railway transport requirements in Sri Lanka; and

(v) if new Power Sets have been added to the railway service after 2014, what they are?

(b) If not, why? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , table* . * : * : * Answer tabled:

(a) (i) I admit.

(ii) The very outdated condition of the existing engines, compartments and power sets being very outdated.

The need for operating an excessive number of journeys at peak times and non-existence of a railway track system sufficient for this requirement.

Very outdated condition of the signal system of some lines.

At the times of failures in trains, non-availability of sufficient facilities to recover trains from such failures promptly.

Over-crowdedness is caused by the people increasingly opting for using the rail transport because of its convenience and cheapness against other transport modes and the fact that it is not subject to delay caused by traffic congestion. This also caused by the availability of a limited number of compartments and power sets to cater to the increasing number of passenger.

(iii) There are 110 trains in running condition.

(iv) Although the services are carried out to the daily passenger trains and freight trains driven by the engines and power sets of the Sri Lanka Railway, most of the engines and power sets are continuously deployed in operation beyond the number of hours or the kilometers at which the regular services are due. At present, the engines and the power sets are not possible to be kept at rest for servicing of them even at the due number of hours of the kilometers as the train services have to be maintained uninterruptedly. 12 power sets of S13 type (06 duel sets) are due to be received under the Indian Line of Credit and at present only 04 sets of them have been deployed in operation. Around 08 sets are due to be put in operation shortly. Also, 10 engines of M11 type are due to be received

under the same Indian Line of Credit and as of now, one engine has been deployed in service. Further, 09 engines are due to be received. 18 engines (09 sets) of S14 type to be run on the Upper Line (Kandian Line) are currently in the production process, and they will be put in operation in the future. Once the above engines and power sets are deployed in operation, the daily passenger and freight train schedules can be met without a problem, and this will make it possible to direct the trains for services at due times. Further, 20 wagons and 30 oil tanks are due to be received under the Indian Line of Credit. 160 compartments under the Indian Line of Credit and 70 compartments and 20 wagons under the Indonesian Line of Credit are also due to be received. Deployment of those wagons and compartments will make it possible to operate trains on schedules that ensure more passenger convenience, and similarly, the addition of fuel tanks and the wagons to the service will ensure systematic and punctual operation of oil and freight transport services. (v) Yes. Since the year 2014, 04 power sets of S13 type have so far been added to the fleet of the Sri Lanka Railway, which are as follows: S13-959, S13-960, S13-963, S13-964 These power sets have been imported from India, and the first two sets have been imported in December, 2018. (b) Does not arise.

Chair, I rise today to debate in this House the Revival of Underperforming Enterprises or Underutilized Assets (Repeal) Bill, a Bill to repeal the Act more commonly known as the Expropriation Act.

Since the formulation of this Act in 2011 by the previous Government, it created shockwaves, garnered significant controversy and negative uproar from the business community, both here in Sri Lanka and overseas. Furthermore, many burgeoning local entrepreneurs and successful conglomerates have been affected not just on the basis of certain assets meeting the broad criteria of this Act, but also due to political machinations outside their control. As such, this Act created a grave precedent for the country, particularly at a time when the appropriate climate and platforms need to be established to usher in and promote Foreign Direct Investments into our country to offset our national debt and furthermore, develop our economy in a sustainable manner. This sheer lack of foresight on the basis of mere political manipulation by the previous Government in bringing this Bill through the back door in 2011 has resulted in significant backlash, particularly from the international community, who, since 2011, have vividly expressed their discontent and apprehension in investing

capital in Sri Lanka, solely on the basis of uncertainty and the effect this Act had on the Sri Lanka's Ease of Doing Business Index.

Hon. Chair, what was even more alarming was the mechanisms and mannerisms the previous Government undertook to shield this Act from public knowledge until the very last minute, having the Bill drafted not by the Legal Draftsman, but by a private company and thereafter, quietly sending it to the Supreme Court for determination, preventing the draft being made public prior to the 48-hour deadline of the Court, thereby all the while effectively preventing any citizen or people's Representative from expressing their objections at the correct forum. This entire process was not only a sham against the democratic principles of our country and certainly did not have the people's best interests in mind, but was more of a way of legalizing politically motivated seizure of private assets utilizing State machinery with no relief or reasoning provided; in other words, a legalized daylight robbery. This type of sheer overreach over the public-private divide is another perfect example of the mannerisms through which the previous Government notoriously operated and one which the public should never forget.

Henceforth, given the uncertainty and injustice presented by this Act, it was pleasing to note that the Minister of Finance, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, in his Budget Speech of 2018, presented the Governments intent to repeal this controversial Act. Furthermore, it gave further relief to the private sector when the Cabinet reached a decision on 9th April to present a draft Bill to Parliament to repeal this Act in full.

Having perused through the draft repeal Bill, it is important to note that upon passing of this repeal Bill, the assets already taken over by the Government from the private sector will not be returned to the previous owners, but will be maintained under the custody of the Secretary to the Treasury.

This is largely unfortunate. I am of the strong opinion that we, as the Government, should move towards privatization of our State-owned enterprises, especially those that are largely underperforming, given the burden they are placing on our national balance sheet. Nevertheless, it is imperative that measures taken by our Government such as the repealing of this notorious Act be the first.

At this juncture, I wish to note that many criticisms inside and outside this House have been raised against the Hon. Minister Daya Gamage. It is a well-known fact that the Hon. Daya Gamage is one of Sri Lankas foremost entrepreneurs prior to entering the political fray and moreover, a residents of the Eastern Province. We, the citizens of the Eastern Province, and the entire Sri Lankans have benefitted tremendously from the toil and sweat that the Hon. Daya Gamage has put into his entrepreneurial efforts over the years, especially in our area. So, instead of criticizing him to score cheap political points, one must look further and realize that in order for Sri Lanka to achieve true prosperity, it is our

responsibility as elected Representatives of the people in this august House to aggressively promote and introduce far-reaching policies which shall create the enabling environment for many more entrepreneurs like the Hon. Daya Gamages to be nurtured and achieve true success in our country, thereby contributing fruitfully to our economy and our nation.

I thank the Hon. Daya Gamage for his many sacrifices and selfless contributions to our economy through his entrepreneurial efforts, a sacrifice that he is making even today while he too was a victim, due to his political affiliations, of this notorious Act. Still, he will not be able to get back the rights to his property, which was forcibly taken from him by the previous Government, but yet, he is advocating this solely to ensure that others like him shall not meet a similar fate like he did. I salute the Hon. Daya Gamage and all the Hon. Members of this Government who worked hard to ensure that such heinous policies are done away with forever.

Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member), . 12 . [..4.36] ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Lanza) , . , - , - ; . , . ; . , ; .
