( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Deputy Speaker, we will be moving only Item No. 1. We will not move the other Items for obvious reasons. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) All right. The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama to move Item No. 1. You have fifteen minutes. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama - Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade) Ten minutes is enough, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Good. : : SRI LANKA EXPORT DEVELOPMENT ACT: REGULATIONS [10.52 a.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I move, "That the Regulations made by the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade under Section 29(2)(d) of the Sri Lanka Export Development Act, No. 40 of 1979 relating to Scheme for Registration of Exporters and published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2118/60 of 11th April 2019, which were presented on 09.08.2019, be approved. (Cabinet approval signified.)"

Under the Sri Lanka Export Development Act, a scheme was introduced to register all the exporters with the EDB and this was done in August, 1985. The main reason for doing that was, at that time, two of the main Government agencies, that is, the Sri Lanka Customs and the Inland Revenue Department, were finding it difficult to do their work without that registration. However, we have realized that the removal of this requirement would effectively contribute to the improvement of Sri Lankas ease of doing business index. There are other ways and means of finding out who the exporters are. So, this Gazette is to revoke the earlier Gazette that had been published.

Sir, I am sure you are aware that there is a weakening of the global economy and as we all know, there is a trade

war between the two major countries in the world: the USA and China. As a result, the World Bank has downgraded the economic growth in the world to about 3.1 per cent. We have already seen that the GDP growth of India has been reduced to 5 per cent and in China, too, it is about 6.5 per cent. So, this is creating major adverse effects not only in those countries, but in most of the countries in the world.

However, I am very pleased to inform you that our exporters have done extremely well in spite of these global adverse trading conditions and in spite of the issues that we had locally. Firstly, we had this unconstitutional coup in October last year and that was followed by the tragic Easter Sunday bombings in April this year. In spite of that, last year we recorded an export turnover of goods and services of US Dollars 17 billion, which has been the highest-ever recorded in our country. And, I am very pleased to inform you that for the first seven months of the year, our export turnover has been indicated at US Dollars 9.5 billion. The target for this year is US Dollars 18.5 billion and by the way we are progressing, I am sure, we will be able to get close to that. So far, there has been a 6.6 per cent growth in the export of goods and merchandise during the first seven months. These figures show that our exporters are very resilient and I must first congratulate them for their efforts. I must also thank and congratulate the members of the Export Development Board, our Ministry and the other Ministries who are involved in the export sector such as the Ministry of Plantation Industries, the Ministry of Primary Industries and Social Empowerment and so on. We have set targets to achieve this. We have set a target of US Dollars 28 billion by 2025 and taken many steps to ensure that we can achieve these targets.

Firstly, we have realized that we need to diversify our product base. As a result, the National Export Strategy was implemented. This Strategy was developed by the IDB of our Ministry and the private sector. The private sector was fully involved in this process and the NES - the National Export Strategy - has identified six new sectors where we think we should promote exports. They are, boat building, IT services, wellness tourism, spices and concentrates, food processing and electrical and electronic components. So, we need to diversify our product base and that is why these items have been selected. Of course, we need to increase the export turnover from our traditional products as well. In addition to that, we have also identified certain new markets which we think we should enter into. In addition to the traditional markets, I think there is a lot of scope in exporting to Asia, India, China, East Asia and so on. So, those are all being done and we are progressing quite well.

In addition to that, to make the exporters inclusive, the EDB has commenced the 2000 New Exporter Development Programme, which would create 2,000 new exporters and we are having these seminars right round the country. As far as I am aware, about 750 to 800 new exporters have been identified. That is also one additional way of increasing our exports. Then, we have the market access programme where the EDB provides funding, matching grants for these exporters.

255 256

Finally, we are looking at launching One Village, One Product Programme, which is similar to what was done in Thailand some time back. This will also be commenced, hopefully, before the end of this month. So, as far as exports are concerned, I think we are on the right track. When our Government took office, exports as a percentage of GDP was something like 13 per cent or close to 14 per cent and right now, it has gone up to 20 per cent of the GDP. But, I still believe that that is not enough. If we are to improve our economy and get away from all these loans that have been taken from time to time, I think we need to ensure that our exports go up to about US Dollars 35 billion and as a percentage of GDP, we should go above 30 per cent.

Now, we can do this. As I said, apart from these programmes that the EDB has set, we also need to ensure that we bring in export-oriented industries to Sri Lanka. So, this needs a mindset among our politicians, our bureaucrats and our people. It is time that we look at high-value investments. Of course, it will take three to four years to bring in the results, but we must make a start. I am very pleased to inform you that the Board of Investment has already taken steps in this direction. As you probably know, the total FDIs which have come to our country from 1978 to 2018, in 40 years, is only US Dollars 17.3 billion; 40 17.3. But, within the last five years, we have received FDIs up to US Dollars 5.8 billion, which is more than 33 per cent. So, in the last five years, these monies have come in. Of course, some of the projects came up during the previous regime, but the funding came in and the projects were started only this year.

At the same time, I am pleased to inform you that during the last two years, the BOI has approved projects worth up to US Dollars 2,431 million or US Dollars 2.43 billion. Agreements have been signed for almost half of that and in the first seven months of this year, projects to the value of US Dollars 4.6 billion have been approved and agreements have been signed for projects amounting to US Dollars 4.1 billion. Of course, these are long-term projects. The implementation of those will take about two-and-a-half to three years. But, additional export revenue will be brought in when these projects are implemented.

Sir, there is nothing more than that for me to say and as you can see, the Government has done a good job. Our policies are being accepted by our investors as well as the global investors and before long, our economic situation will be much better than before.

Thank you very much. . . Question proposed. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , . 10 .

Malik Samarawickrama) I want to clarify certain incorrect statements that the Hon. Member just made. I am wondering where he has been all this time. He has been in Parliament for a long time, but he does not seem to be knowing what has been going on.

Firstly, let me inform the Hon. Member that it is true that the service exports are most important. This year, there has already been a 13.7 per cent growth in exports of the services sector. He said that the FTAs we have signed have an adverse impact on the exports, which is totally incorrect; it is not true at all. We have not had any issue at all with regard to the FTA we have signed with Singapore. There is a review process, but so far, we have not had a single issue of concern. So, what he had been saying is totally incorrect.

As far as exports of apparel are concerned, yes, it is true that a substantial amount, about 30 to 40 per cent, of the raw materials are imported. But, the previous Government had done nothing to ensure that there was

261 262

[ ]

2019 05

backward integration. Now, he is talking about it. What was he doing all these years, for the past 10, 15 years? They had not done anything. Now, this Government and the BOI are setting up a separate industrial zone to manufacture fabrics for export purposes and for the export industry. That will probably come up in Eravur. We have already identified the location close to the sea and in collaboration with the Joint Apparel Association Forum, we are looking at setting up this plant to produce the fabrics.

Then, he also said that certain project approvals had been cancelled. Yes. Those were the approvals granted by the previous regime. Without any projects, they had given approval. We have taken stock of all that and then cancelled all those agreements that were signed during the previous regime. As far as the approvals given by us since 2016 are concerned, not one project has been cancelled.

With regard to the figures that I mentioned before, the FDI received in 2016 was US Dollars 800 million; in 2017, US Dollars 1.7 billion and in 2018, US Dollars 2.37 billion. You can check the records with the Central Bank and the Central Bank Reports will give you the same figures. So, what I am saying is that the figures submitted by me are correct and I do not know how he had got his figures. - [Interruption.] Maybe, that has to be checked and corrected. I was quoting from the Central Bank Reports; the figures given by me are from the Central Bank.

Prime Minister speaks. Hon. Prime Minister, you have the Floor. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Hon. Speaker, the Debate has been going on and the Hon. Minister has asked for time to come and clarify some of the issues that had been raised. So, since the Hon. Minister is not here, we asked that it be taken up tomorrow where the Minister will clarify the issues and reply. That is all that has been asked for, and at the moment, no one has moved, under Standing Order No. 46, That the question be now put either. - [Interruption.] No, they have not moved. So, Sir, as it is, now the Minister must come and clarify. Since this is a Government Motion, the Government must have the right to decide when to put it to Vote. We had some backbench Members speaking and the Minister has to clarify many of the issues that had been raised. For instance, there were also other issues have been raised. I was following the Debate. For instance, one of the Hon. Members said there has been no growth at all in this country. I mean, what nonsense is this. Even the Central Bank says that there has been some growth, but it has suffered a bit because of the bomb attacks. So, all those facts and figures have to be given and answered. That is why we have asked for time, because the Minister is not available at the moment. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Bandula Gunawardane) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Okay.

Minister, finally, the Minister must either reply or he must say, "I am not replying." - [Uproar.] Here, the Minister wants to reply. It is because the Minister wants to reply that we have asked for it to be taken up tomorrow. ( ) (An Hon. Member) No, you cannot. [Interruption] ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Today, we have taken up Government Business. So, it is we who decide it. - [Uproar.] Today, we have taken up Government Business and we will decide. When to end the Debate is a matter for the Government, not for the Members here. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Order, please! We have already scheduled a Party Leaders Meeting now.

Questions have been asked by the Hon. Members not only on paddy purchases, but even on import of rice. As the Minister in charge of Sathosa, I would like to say that I have also received questions by the Hon. Members on the import of rice, and I am pleased to give all the details now. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has imported 109 million kilograms of rice, which include 68,000,000 kilograms Nadu rice, 25,000,000 kilograms of Samba rice and 14,000,000 kilograms of white rice, from September, 2017 to April, 2018 through the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment, which comes under it.

The importation of these items through the CWE was initiated as per the decision adopted at the special Subcommittee on Cost of Living chaired by His Excellency the President at the Presidential Secretariat on 20th June, 2017. At that meeting, it was understood that the bad weather conditions prevailed in the country resulted in the reduction of paddy harvest during the Maha Season and price increases were expected due to the shortage of rice supply. Accordingly, it was decided to import 300,000 metric tons of rice by the Government and 200,000 metric tons of rice by the private sector.

Later, the Cabinet Subcommittee on Cost of Living, which met on 01st of August, 2017, took a decision to import 100,000 metric tons of all varieties of rice every month. Accordingly, until April 2018, both the private sector and the Government have imported 972,113 metric tons of rice. The importation of rice was also based on the reports submitted by the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute - HARTI - to the Cabinet

Subcommittee on Cost of Living in relation to the fall in the supply of harvested paddy during the Maha Season of 2017.

Sir, I want to inform the House today that apart from these decisions, no other decisions have been taken by the Ministry to import rice. Therefore, all the rice imports by my Ministry are based on such clear approvals and only by following the correct procedures and not on any other directives that are out of the official system.
