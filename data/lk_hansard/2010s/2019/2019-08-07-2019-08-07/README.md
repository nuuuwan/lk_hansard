[6.21 p.m.] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning, Water Supply and Higher Education) Hon. Presiding Member, we have heard a lengthy Debate this afternoon on this issue concerning the so-called "Batticaloa Campus" and the controversy surrounding it. This Adjournment Motion proposed by the Hon. (Dr.) Nalinda Jayathissa from the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna has evoked somewhat emotional and sentimental tirades by several Members of Parliament. As the Minister in charge of this subject, I cannot be drawn into any emotional, sentimental tirades, but I have got to present the factual situation as it stands today and the details as to how this process was undertaken by the Ministry of Higher Education.

In this regard, there had been certain other inquiries that have gone on, particularly by the Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committee on Education and Human Resources Development under the Chairmanship of the Hon. (Prof.) Ashu Marasinghe. It has gone into this matter in detail and submitted a Report. Subsequent to the Report being presented to the Cabinet through the Secretary to the Cabinet, the Cabinet has now taken a decision to appoint a Cabinet Subcommittee consisting of four Cabinet Ministers in charge of related subjects. The Hon. Mano Ganesan, the Minister in charge of National Integration, Official Languages, Social Progress and Hindu Religious Affairs is there. The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the Minister in charge of Finance, is there. Then, the Minister in charge of Higher Education and the Hon. Malik Samarawickrama, under whose Ministry the Board of Investment comes, have also been nominated as Members. That Cabinet Subcommittee is yet to officially meet.

But in the meantime, I must place here on record the process that has gone on through the Ministry of Higher Education in order to consider the request for it to be included as a degree-awarding institution. The Non-State University Section of our Ministry is the authority that needs to evaluate this request. I must say here that there have been several minutes of committees which have gone into that matter. There have been almost 35 instances in which different committees have looked into the requirements regarding the degree-awarding status.

965 966

At the final meeting held on 05th of April, 2019, they had finally come to a conclusion that they cannot recognize this institution as a degree-awarding institution.

The minutes of that meeting states, I quote:

..... given that it does not have the capacity to operate on its own through internally generated funds or even equity. Instead it seems to be dependent on borrowing from both its main shareholder and overseas benefactors (as of now, all assets and operating losses have been financed by borrowings).

The forecasted operational/financial data provided seems to be very ambitious and the basis for such forecast is not explained.

Finally, based on several such reasons, the Committee has decided that the institution cannot be awarded the degree-awarding status. So, that being the situation, Sir, I would like to table* the minutes.

Together with that, since the Sectoral Oversight Committee had requested the Cabinet to consider their recommendations, the Cabinet Subcommittee has to go into this in detail and decide as to what next step could be taken. This includes the future status of the entire complex, as to what we are going to do with it. There have been questions raised about the manner in which funds came for this institution, about the management of the institution and its conversion from, originally, a vocational training institute, a university college and subsequently, into a degree-awarding institution. We have got to re-examine all these processes and see what we would ultimately do with the physical infrastructure that has come up. It is an issue that the Cabinet Subcommittee has to grapple with. I am sure there have been enough previous instances in which these attempts have been made, the recent event being the SAITM and the manner in which it was finally attached to the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University.

Of course, there is also the suggestion made by the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva Committee to look at creating a trust and to allow the trust to continue the operation of this institute. As against that, the owners of the so-called "Batticaloa Campus", Mr. Hizbullah and his foundation, have proposed that you should consider this as a Public-Private Partnership - PPP - project and that they are prepared to abide by the conditions that the Government, as a partner, will impose on the investors as it stands

today. So, these are matters that the Cabinet Subcommittee can look into and finally come to a decision on.

So, this being the case, I do not want to go into much detail. Several suggestions have been made, but we have to look at the issue concerning the future of private higher educational institutions, the investments into the institution and what impact the decision being made in this instance would have on the future of such private investments. Of course, whether there were suspicious financial transactions are issues that the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank should have looked into. The commercial banks through which the monies came have also been examined. I, being a Member of the Select Committee to Look into and Report to Parliament on the Terrorist Attacks that Took Place in Different Places in Sri Lanka on 21st of April, 2019, have also looked into this issue. In fact, Mr. Hizbullah as well as the officials of the BOI, the Bank of Ceylon and the Central Bank including the Governor have come before the Select Committee and explained in detail as to the procedures that have been adopted. So, the Select Committee will submit its report on these issues and I wonder whether any kind of finding could also be indicated in their report, finally. But, all in all, what I expect is that finally the Cabinet Subcommittee that has been appointed will look into all these details and come to a conclusion, which will ensure that this controversy is put to rest and that the unnecessary fears and doubts that have been talked about in the past few months regarding the establishment of this university would finally be decided with its decision.

Thank you.
