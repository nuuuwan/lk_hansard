( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

. [3.23 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama - Minister of Development Strategies, International Trade) Mr. Presiding Member, the tragic events of Easter Sunday last month have left us with enduring grief for the families of those innocent people who lost their lives, but it has also strengthened our resolve to fight this menace of extremist terrorism and bring safety and security to our

people. They tried to break the country and our people. They tried to fill Sri Lankans with fear. But we Sri Lankans are stronger than that. We are more united than we give ourselves credit for.

With the leadership of the President and the Prime Minister, our security forces have engaged in impressive counter-terrorism measures and have begun to break the back of the extremist network that has surreptitiously spread. Suspects are being apprehended and questioned; new security measures are being implemented and targeted international cooperation is being obtained.

Amidst all this, and as we work towards bringing normalcy to our country, now we must collectively focus our efforts on building back confidence in our economy.

One of the most important ways to help our country and our economy bounce back is by encouraging our international partners to keep doing business with us. I have written individually to every major Chamber of Commerce and business association in Sri Lanka as well as to our Ambassadors and High Commissioners in over two dozen key markets seeking their help to reach out to the international business and investor community to encourage them to keep supporting our economy.

Many sectors in our economy rely on positive international support to continue their business, whether it is the globally competitive IT industry, the apparel and other manufacturing industry, the tea, rubber and spices industry, the electronics industry, and of course the tourism industry. We commit to our international investors that our country is being made safe and all efforts are being taken to this end. It is their support during challenging times like this that will ensure that terrorism does not win and Sri Lanka's quest for economic prosperity will not be beaten down.

As we have done before on numerous occasions in the recent history, we will demonstrate that we are a resilient country and a resilient people.

Meanwhile, here at home, I believe the private sector of our country can play a big role in supporting the Government's efforts and helping our economy get through this most challenging time.

We have seen it before. Whether it was during the decades of the armed conflict; whether it was after repeated terrorist attacks on our city and our economic infrastructure; whether it was after tragic events like the tsunami and other natural disasters that occur frequently, our private sector has remained courageous and resilient.

Now is such a time, once again. We need the private sector and Government to work closely together to ensure that we bounce back from this atrocity quickly and we do not let the terrorists win.

I wish to thank the private sector for what they have done so far, whether it is their cooperation with security measures in the aftermath of the attacks; their cooperation

253 254

in ensuring that religious and ethnic harmony is maintained and now, cooperation to ensure that economic fallout can be minimized.

We have already begun formulating an assistance plan for the tourism industry to help them tide through the coming months and we have been meeting with tourism industry representatives over the past two weeks to come up with a suitable package. As a Government we stand ready to listen and assist any other sector that may need support.

But, once again let me reiterate that I believe that our private sector is resilient, competitive and responsible. Let us show the world how a country like ours bounces back from terrorism, like we had done so many times before.

Another reason why I believe our economy will be resilient in the face of these attacks is because we have built a very strong economic foundation over the past four years. The macroeconomic stability we have created will enable us to better withstand shocks of this nature.

By the end of March, our Foreign Exchange Reserves stood at US Dollars 7.6 billion, which is sufficient for about three to four months of import cover. Exports and FDI reached all-time highs in 2018 and the trade deficit in February was the lowest monthly deficit in over five years. Inflation was well under control at 4.5 per cent in April. The rupee has appreciated 3 per cent during this year up to yesterday in spite of this setback. Interest rates declined over 100 basis points this year and we have taken measures to bring down borrowing costs even further by at least 2 per cent, especially for SMEs. The fiscal position continues to strengthen with a primary budget surplus of 0.6 per cent of GDP last year and is projected at 1.5 per cent in 2019.

So, against this backdrop of strong economic fundamentals, a resilient and courageous private sector and the comprehensive measures being taken by the Government and the security forces, I am confident that we will emerge out of this challenge strong and unfazed.

Sir, this is not the time for the fanatics nor the faint-hearted. Our duty as Parliamentarians is not to our party alone, but to the nation and indeed to all our citizens. Our duty is not merely the preservation of political power, but the preservation of peace and democracy. So, let us not be petty when our cause is so great. Let us not quarrel amongst ourselves when our nations future is at stake.

As Members of this august Assembly, we must commit ourselves to working together, putting aside our petty differences and if not completely put aside, then at least postpone for another time our usual blame games and narrow politicking, for this is a time for solidarity and collective responsibility in this Parliament by Government and Opposition alike. Our citizens are watching us and are expecting much from us. So, let us not let them down.

Let us stand together determined in our cause of eradicating terrorism and lead our citizens into new frontiers of peace and prosperity.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) .

. . . . . . ISIS . We never believed that certain members of our community will be suicide bombers. . .

They stated that they would not give them even an Islamic burial. . .

Today, just like every single peace-loving Sri Lankan, I woke up with a heavy heart. This has been so since that bloody day of terror. Sixteen long days of reflection have gone by since the senseless bombings on Easter Sunday, which left over 200 people dead and over 500 fighting for their lives in hospital. Some of them will walk out of the hospital and find out that they have been left behind on this earth without any family. Others will wake up, broken in spirit and scarred for life. You and I cannot even begin to fathom their loss; you and I will never be able to comfort them and tell them that they are going to be all right; we will never be able to ever understand the depth of their sadness and despair. Let us open our eyes and realize that these innocent people are the victims. They are the victims; we are not the victims. The victims are not the rest of us who have to be subjected to security checks. The victims are not the ones who have to take off their face veils in order to help maintain national security. The victims are not the people who have to open their homes to help the Forces to maintain a safe and secure neighbourhood. Those who feel victimized because of these small changes must help the country to get back on its feet again. Therefore, I have to say this to you: "You are not the victims. So, please cooperate with those who are trying to maintain national security in Sri Lanka".

I strongly urge the people who are tempted to play the minority card in order to get media attention on them to please stop. Think like the majority of this country and focus on what is important for this country. Make the necessary changes and let us go forward. Help this country bring back some sense of normalcy as soon as possible. That is the reality upon us. For those who lost a friend or a family member, in some cases, many friends and many family members, life will never be the same again. Let us remind ourselves everyday that their innocent lives will never be the same again. What the ugly hand of terror snatched cannot be brought back. We may be able to rebuild the churches, the hotels and put in place structures that were destroyed on that ill-fated day, but, the deep-seated sense of fear and uncertainty may take a lifetime to be erased. The acute sense of sadness and the loss will remain with us.

The question "How did this happen and why did this happen?" will haunt us in the days, months and years to come. I stand here with a deep sense of shock because once again, our innocent people and our beautiful homeland have experienced a security threat. Terrorists have attempted to snatch peace from us; terrorists have attempted to bring about disharmony and suspicion among the people of our country. We have lived through a period like this and we should never let this happen again. Terror loomed on one of the most sacred days and in the holiest of places. It was tragic. It is unacceptable and let us draw strength from each other in order to stand strong to fight this cancer. As we try to make sense of the overwhelming grief and disbelief, let us look back and draw strength from the past that we all remember, the past that we lived through, the past that we put right. Let us not permit this senseless terror to make us forget who we really are. Who are we, then? We are proud and resilient Sri Lankans. We belong to a country that taught the modern world that it is possible to defeat terrorism completely; we belong to a country that taught the world that when people stand united, terrorism could not get a foothold and we belong to a country that taught the world that multi-race and multi-religious people can once again have one voice against terrorism. We have been there, we have done that and we can do it again.

We have all the experience to overcome that. We, as a nation, have looked in the eyes of senseless terror, fought against it and have won. To the terrorists, I say, "You have provoked the wrong people. We, Sri Lankans, are patient, yet strong-willed. Sri Lankan people will not stand by and let terrorists infiltrate the fabric of our society. You will be hunted down and weeded out! The truth is, we know that the people of this country have suffered enough at the hands of terrorists and this country knows what it feels to experience peaceful existence".

Let us remember Mr. and Mrs. Rangana Fernando and their three children from Negombo, who are no more; let us remember Mr. Ramesh Raju from Batticaloa, who helped save many lives, but lost his life in the process and let us remember the children, little Sharon and Sarah Santhakumar, brother and sister, who also lost their lives. There were about 45 children who died on that day. Let us remember Alma, Agnes and Alfred who arrived on our shores to enjoy a holiday, but who left our shores in coffins; let us remember Mrs. Takahashi, a mother of two, who is no more; let us remember Lahiru Prasanga and Dilini Sanjeewani, newlyweds; let us remember eight-year-old Zayan Chowdhary, the grandson of Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim of Bangladesh; let us remember the three brave security personnel killed in action in Dematagoda and let us remember the staff members of hotels who lost their lives. I can go on because the list is long, but the pain is deep and the victims are from all over the world. We must never forget that fateful day when so many lives were taken and all our lives were changed forever.

Let us also remember the wise and timely words of Archbishop of Colombo, His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith. I thank him for speaking words of wisdom and connecting with the peace-loving people of

this country. His words calmed the troubled hearts of one and all and guided the people when guidance was needed most. I thank him for planting the seeds of love and harmony on that very sad day.

Also, let us remember the Sri Lankan armed forces and the police who have been called upon to perform an important task at this point of time and they have been doing a fantastic job. We must salute them. Our people have often referred to them as "angels who walk among us". How true this is! Let us remember the peace-loving people of Sri Lanka who, in the face of this terror and disaster, have stayed calm and strong. People have stood unmoved by the elements that wanted to provoke them into anger. It is that maturity which will help us get through this. Let us remember all who helped, who came forward with the dead and the wounded. In truth, the life of peaceful existence, as we have known it over the past ten years, has changed and we only have to reverse that.

If we fail at this point, we would fail our country and fail to serve the people of this country, as we have here a job to do. Let us once again work to eradicate terrorism. After all, we know we can do this, we know we have the resources and we cannot be foolish and let our beautiful homeland continue to suffer. We cannot let terrorism and other external or internal elements take our country backwards in time. We are proud Sri Lankans. We have our own brand of patience and our own brand of resilience. The world knows this. It is time to put our best foot forward, rebuild trust and confidence and make our country secure. There is only one way forward: that is, together.
