( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . [12.55p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Mr. Speaker, I do not want to say anything controversial except to mention that the Constitutional Council is a very prestigious institution performing very important duties as far as the country is concerned. They

747 748

2019 21

need to be treated with respect. The persons appointed to the Constitutional Council are eminent persons; and by our conduct using Parliamentary Privilege and being unduly critical or unfair by the members of the Constitutional Council, we should not discourage eminent persons, capable persons, competent persons, persons of unblemished character, refusing to take up positions on the Constitutional Council. That will be a grave damage that will be inflicted on that institution, if that situation comes about.

We, as Members of Parliament, have the Privilege to say anything in Parliament. We are not subject to the law of defamation, whether civil or criminal, but we must not abuse that Privilege in such a way as to discourage persons who can be of use to this country from serving this country and we should be very careful about it.

Talking about the Constitutional Council, we had the Seventeenth Amendment, the Eighteenth Amendment and the Nineteenth Amendment. I do not want to go into the details of all those laws - we know what they are. In my capacity as the Leader of the Opposition, I was an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council for a period of three years. You were, Mr. Speaker, the Chairperson of the Council. You know what happened before the Council.

I wish to recount some of my own experiences. I think we were very prim and proper, very careful, very cautious and very concerned, that we always made the correct appointments. We were deferential to the recommendations made by the President. We always considered very seriously every recommendation made by the President. If we felt that the President needed to make more recommendations, names of other persons, we communicated with him and requested that further names be submitted. So, I think, we always endeavoured to work in close cooperation with the President, holding the President in high esteem because, after all, we have only one President in this country duly elected by the people of this country. We always endeavoured, you, Mr. Speaker, in particular, I want to say on the Floor of this House, to ensure that there was a good working relationship between the President and the Constitutional Council.

The Mover of this Motion referred to the fact that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, meaning me, were entitled to make certain appointments. Yes, we were entitled to make certain appointments. What were the appointments we made? There were five appointments to the Constitutional Council for the purpose of constituting the Constitutional Council, which were made by the Prime Minister and me as the Leader of the Opposition. Three were eminent persons from civil society. There is no question about it. The fourth person was the Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale appointed by the Prime Minister from the UNP.

He also had the question in mind when he made that recommendation.

I had to make the next recommendation of a member of the Constitutional Council. I told the Hon. Prime Minister and you, Hon. Speaker, that I would like a member of the Joint Opposition to be appointed as a

member of the Constitutional Council. In fact, from your room, Sir, I phoned the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was then the Member of Parliament for Kurunegla, and consulted him in regard to the person whom I should appoint from the Joint Opposition to the Constitutional Council. He asked me whether I had any names in mind and I said I had no names in mind, but that you, Sir, had recommended to me the name of the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa. When I mentioned the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksas name to him, he accepted that and I recommended the appointment of the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa. That was how the Constitutional Council was constituted.

It is the Mover of the Motion complaining about the appointment of the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa as a member of the Constitutional Council on my recommendation. What accusation can he make in regard to any recommendation I have made when the name I have recommended is the name of a Member of Parliament of the Joint Opposition and the brother of the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa? So, I think, Sir, this type of thing should not be carried too far, because you can slur your views against each other freely in this Parliament. You can even do so in regard to other persons like members of the Constitutional Council. But, if you do it too frequently and recklessly, you will lose the cooperation, the willingness of eminent persons in this country to serve on an important institution like the Constitutional Council.

We are aware of certain things that happened in this country, Sir. We know how the former lady Chief Justice was impeached in this Parliament. I was a Member of that Select Committee. Because she would not deliver judgments in keeping with your wishes, you brought an Impeachment Motion against her on some flimsy, frivolous charges. You held an inquiry, which commenced one evening, went on to the whole night and you impeached her the next day! That is what you did to her because she would not deliver judgements in your favour. We know of another instance, of yet another former Chief Justice, the successor of the lady Chief Justice that I referred to, who was seen at Temple Trees, the residence cum office of the former President when the results of the Presidential Election in 2015 were coming out and were being announced. I do not wish to say anything which will unnecessarily cause any controversy or against the former President. But, I want to know what was the former Chief Justice of this country, the then Chief Justice of the country, doing at Temple Trees in the early hours of the 09th of January, 2015 when the results of the Presidential Election were being announced? These are questions that concern people; these are incidents that trigger in the minds of people the need to have an independent Judiciary, a Judiciary that will not bow down to the Executive or be subject to Executive directions.

So, Sir, I think we should restrain ourselves, be careful and ensure that the importance, the prestige of the Constitutional Council is preserved, that we do not make the Constitutional Council a political football for you all to play around within this House and that we are able to solicit the services of the best of persons in this country to serve on the Constitutional Council. I thank you, Sir.

Before this landmark piece of legislation was actually introduced, the President had sweeping powers in this country to arbitrarily appoint and promote important police officers, prosecutors, public servants and judges. Therefore, the so-called Constitutional Council of the time was actually not that independent; it actually was more a rubber stamp and that is why we had a situation where the Seventeenth Amendment was emasculated and the Eighteenth Amendment was brought in.

The Eighteenth Amendment was introduced with specific objectives. Firstly, to remove the two-term limit of the President and to have a President for a lifetime. That was one objective. The second objective was to remove the checks and balances that were there in Parliamentary democracy. The third objective was to actually bring the government service to its knees before the executive powers of the President.

The reasons why the Nineteenth Amendment was brought in was to actually reduce the powers of the President. The two-term limit has since been removed; the Independent Commissions have been formed; the powers of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet have been enhanced and also the executive actions of the President are up for judicial review. Even if legislation is not, the executive actions of the President are now up for judicial review. So, most importantly, the Constitutional Council was introduced.

Sir, this Debate is also about the ruler and the ruled. This Debate will show on which side the participants of the Debate are. This Debate is also about separation of powers between the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. If democracy is to prevail, the separation of powers must be protected. We have a situation where the Head of State is also the Head of the Government. That is why it is particularly important that there must be checks and balances on the Executive President. It does not matter who the Executive President is, but there must be checks and balances. Despite the criticisms of the present President, I think his single most achievement would be bringing in the Nineteenth Amendment to Parliament, because this is the Amendment that has truly protected democracy in this country.

We also remember that this was not approved just by the Government - this was in a Parliament that the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa had a two-thirds majority - and except for two Members of Parliament, all the other Members of Parliament voted for this Amendment. So, I think the credit goes to the whole of Parliament for adopting it. On that day, the Hon. Nimal Siripala De Silva, as the Leader of the Opposition, said, President Maithripala Sirisena had succeeded where none of his predecessors could have and then, the Minister of Justice was the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.

We have a history, sometimes, of discrimination and of wrong people being appointed. I am particularly reminded of the situation where Dr. (Mrs.) Shirani Bandaranayake, Chief Justice, was removed by a flawed process and that day, Justice Sriskandarajah, the then President of the Court of Appeal, presided over the Division Bench with Justice Anil Gunaratne and Justice Salam in the matter of the impeachment process of Dr. (Mrs.) Shirani Bandaranayake. They held that the procedure was flawed and that a writ was issued. Justice Sriskandarajah had to pay a heavy price. He was overlooked five times from the appointments that he should have received. He burst a blood vessel and later died. He served as a heart-broken man. Even while he was on his death bed, he expected the then President to still look at his situation. But, he was not promoted. He

767 768

2019 21

died as President of the Court of Appeal. Who was the then Minister of Justice? The then Minister of Justice who proposed this is opposing some of these. Justice Anil Gunaratne, Judge of the Court of Appeal, was also not promoted either as the President of the Court of Appeal or to the Supreme Court because he was also on the Bench hearing Dr. (Mrs.) Shirani Bandaranaikes case with Justice Sriskandarajah. He was overlooked three times until we were able to correct that situation after the 8th of January, 2015. So, discrimination has been a part of history and we need to get more and more away from it.

Then, we also had the situation of actually having independent persons on this Council. We know that Mr. H. L. de Silva and Mr. Colvin Gunaratne were appointed not under the UNP Government but under the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Government and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Presidents. But these people acted independently. It does not matter who appoints them; it is very important that these people act independently. These are examples of people who have acted independently. Also, my thoughts go to the fact that under the UNP Government, Justice Neville Samarakoon, a person from the private bar, was appointed as the Chief Justice of this country and he held against the Government that appointed him. This is the independence of the Judiciary that we really come to admire.

We also have had a debate recently as to whether the Constitutional Council has actually ignored the seniority in approving nominees. Seniority is important, but it alone must not be the determinant, it should be the meritocracy. Whether it is the Judicial Service, whether it is the Public Service, appointments cannot only be determined on seniority. Efficiency should be looked at; good performance should be looked at; integrity should be considered and, particularly, when it comes to judges, their contribution to jurisprudence should also be taken into account. If it is the seniority, a list can be just sent to the President and you do not need a Council. But, you need a Council because discretion has to be used in making important decisions and important appointments. In that process of discretion, proper people need to be appointed. The composition of the Constitutional Council, though we accept what it is, we would have preferred to have more people from the civil society on it.

I would like to make a few comments on the crisis that we are presently facing on the Court of Appeal. The Hon. Speaker has been unduly attacked on this issue. He has made it abundantly clear that upon receiving the Presidents nomination to replace the former CA President Justice Surasena, the Council forwarded the nomination to the Chief Justice to obtain his views as it was explicitly required by Article 41C (4) of the Constitution. According to the media reports, we understand that the Chief Justice did not provide a favourable recommendation. So, the Constitutional Council would be derelict in their duty if they did not pay heed to the recommendation of the Chief Justice. In this situation, with the Judiciary, the Attorney Generals Department, the private bar rife with highly qualified and suitable nominees, the solution is for the President to deliberate over the additional nominees and then ideally

arrive at a nominee which everybody could agree on. This is absolutely essential so that we protect the advancements that we have made in this Parliament in creating an independent Judiciary.

[3.29 p.m.] () ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva - Non Cabinet Minister of Economic Reforms and Public Distribution) Hon. Deputy Speaker, in fact, it is a privilege for me to speak a few words on this very important matter taken up for debate today. In January, 2015, when 6.2 million people voted for the then Presidential Candidate Maithripala Sirisena, what was their expectation? Their main expectation was to strengthen democracy in this country. Of course, they expected many other things and we made many promises. But, the primary promise that we made to the people of this nation was that we will strengthen democracy.

Essentially, it was about the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, under which former President Mahinda Rajapaksa took away the powers of the strong democratic institutions that have been introduced under

the Seventeenth Amendment and concentrated that power in him, allowing this country to be ruled by a person as opposed to it being ruled by the relevant institutions, regulations, laws and policies. That is why we wanted to bring in a system of checks and balances into democracy. In fact, the signature achievement of President Sirisenas One hundred-day Government or which was in operation for slightly more than 100 days was, the introduction of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution. We know that Members of both sides of the aisle voted for it because they realized that we had moved away from the ideal democracy we had wished to create in this country

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Order please! .

.

, , .

Whereupon THE HON. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. SPEAKER took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, please go ahead. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, the President, in fact - I had been with him in his overseas travels, whether to the United States, the UK, India or wherever - took a lot of pride in saying to the international community, Look, I am perhaps the only sitting Head of State who voluntarily gave way some of the privileges, the powers and the authorities I had and we all agreed with him. It was an achievement, not only for President Sirisena, but also for all of us in Parliament who voted to strengthen democracy. The adage "I am the State" of King Louis XIV surely ended with the period of absolute monarchies. And that is really what happened, Sir, with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution. However, in a strange political twist, His Excellency the President has now aligned or rather realigned himself with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his clan and has suddenly started to find fault with the Nineteenth Amendment. He has, in fact, said that the Constitutional Council is the most corrupt place and that we should think about changing the legislation. Some of his disciples or the new disciples have even gone on to say that we must bring back the Eighteenth Amendment to do away with the Nineteenth Amendment.

We saw that. That is an absolute 180 degree turn from what we promised the people. Yes, we have not been able to fulfil all the promises we made to the people and we will continue to try to deliver on those promises. But, our main promise, we have delivered. So, it is unethical for

795 796

[ ... ]

2019 21

His Excellency the President to say that we must get rid of it. It is unethical for those who voted for it to say, "We have to get rid of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution and bring back the Eighteenth Amendment so that the power will once again be concentrated on a strongman" and that is not what the people of this country voted for and desire. Therefore, I would like to humbly request His Excellency the President to look into the facts. Please, do not be misled by some of those turncoats who actually did fight hard to bring in the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution and now say all kinds false stories to you to mislead you.

I would like to take up a few examples. I have been reading in the press that Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who is supposedly the frontrunner for Presidency from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, had said, Give us the vote, bring us back to power and we will get rid of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution and go back to the Eighteenth Amendment. I am certain that the 6.2 million people who voted for us are going to say, You go and jump in the Beira Lake or something like that. Do you know why, Sir? That is because the country in which he is a citizen of -

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) Mr. Speaker, - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, I will give you the Floor once he finishes. Do not disturb him. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) I am not disturbing him. I need to correct what he said. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) You are going to get an opportunity to speak. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Thank you, Sir. - [Interruption.] He is a citizen of the United States. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Once he finishes, I will give you an opportunity. - [Interruption.] Let him speak. - [Interruption.] What is the point of Order? - [Interruption.]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, let me speak. He must realize - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) What is the point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Sir, give me the mike. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Now, your mike is on. What is your point of Order? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Sir, my point of Order is, in his deliberations, the Hon. Minister mentioned that Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, as the frontrunner, had said that we would get rid of the Nineteenth Amendment and bring back the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Nowhere has he made such a statement. So, it is completely false -

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Anyway, you can reply later. There is plenty of time. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) No, it is not a reply. It is a question of - [Interruption.] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) You can reply later. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, you go ahead. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) You can reply later. - [Interruption.] Whether it is fake news or not, I do not know. This is what we read in the newspapers; this is what we hear on the radio; this is what we see on television. So, Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa had better go and look at his Constitution, the Constitution of the country which he is a citizen of. He is a citizen of the United States, where no major appointment of State officials can be made without the Senate approving it. - [Interruption.]

797 798

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Please allow him to speak. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) The Senate must approve, Sir, all the names, be it a judge to the Supreme Court, be it the Attorney-General or be it any other top appointment. So, he is a citizen of that country and believes that he does not even have to give up the citizenship of that country because, I am sure, he is in love with that country. He is in love with it; he loves the United States. I believe that is because of the opportunities he has got as a minority person in the United States. Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa is a member of the minority in the US and he, as a member of the minority has had equal opportunity in the United States to rise and come to whatever status he has come up to in the United States.

Why am I bringing this up? I am bringing this up because even though he has said that he is going to be the Presidential aspirant in another few months, he is not willing to give up that citizenship, because of the love he has for that country.

Now I must correct a few statements made by the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. He has stated that there are no procedures for the Constitutional Council. It is an utter nonsense; it is absolutely false. The Constitutional Council decided to follow the rules adopted under the Seventeenth Amendment. The President was informed by a letter on 17th November, 2016. Parliament was informed on the 8th of December, 2016 and the MPs were asked to send in their proposals. Sir, no Member in this House, including these people who are shouting here today, sent a single observation. Therefore, the procedures remained as it had been in the Seventeenth Amendment.

Then, for the appointment of Chief Justice in February, 2017, the President sent two names, that of Justice Dep and Justice Chitrasiri and requested the Constitutional Council to approve one name. The name of Justice Dep who was the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court and who had acted as the Chief Justice was approved. Then, the appointment of Chief Justice came up in October, 2018. Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe says Justice Eva Wanasundera was overlooked. This is what all of you are screaming here about - the appointment of the Chief Justice. It is the President who overlooked her and I am saying this with authority here. The President sent only one name to the Constitutional Council and that was of Justice Nalin Perera who was four places below in seniority to Justice Eva Wanasundera. He later said that career judges brought to his notice that no career judge had been appointed as CJs since 1988 and therefore, he nominated Justice Nalin Perera. The Constitutional Council approved it. Therefore, these utter lies, the falsehoods, to mislead the people of this country and also the international community must be looked at in a way in which he has maliciously tried to misrepresent facts.

Then the appointment of President of Court of Appeal came up. The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and His Excellency the President find fault with the Constitutional Council for not approving Justice Deepali Wijesundera, the senior-most judge. In January, 2018 it was the President who overlooked Justice Deepali Wijesundera and nominated Justice Surasena, who was several places below seniority to Justice Deepali Wijesundera. Now after he joined forces with the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, the President has nominated Justice Deepali Wijesundera. But the Chief Justice has not recommended Justice Wijesundera. It is not surprising that the Constitutional Council has not approved her name.

Then, there are others; there are multiple things. Then, I want to take up what the Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne said a little while ago. That was about the appointment of the Attorney-General and that the Constitutional Council did not appoint Mr. Suhada Gamlath as the Attorney-General. Why is that Mr. Speaker? I will tell you why.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, you have one more minute. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Okay. Mr. Suhada Gamlath was not appointed the Attorney-General. We all know that. The President sent three names. That was of Mr. Suhada Gamlath, Solicitor General, Mr. Jayantha Jayasuriya, and Mr. Kapila Waidyaratne, both Additional Solicitors General at the time. The Constitutional Council asked the President what his order of preference was. That is all what the Constitutional Council asked. They asked His Excellency the President, His Excellency, please give us your order of preference. What did the President do? The President wrote back to the Constitutional Council nominating only Mr. Jayantha Jayasuriya and the Constitutional Council approved that name. Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was present at both occasions.

There are many other things that I would like to go into, but given the lack of time, Hon. Speaker, what I want to articulate once again, reiterate, is that the 6.2 million people of this country voted to strengthen the democracy of this country, not to weaken it and give strong men the power to rule. They gave the authority for institutions, for laws, for policies to rule this country. It is no longer a monarchy; it is a democracy. So, I believe that you all will take back your allegations and support to strengthen democracy with the Nineteenth Amendment. Thank you very much.

[3.52p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Finance and Mass Media) Thank you, Mr. Speaker. If my memory serves me right, I cannot recall an occasion in Sri Lankas recent political history when the Executive and the Legislature of Sri Lanka drew as much praise and applause as they did, both from our citizens and also from the international community, than on the occasion of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 2015.

In fact, I would say it is the single most greatest achievement of this House in recent times and it stands as President Sirisenas single greatest achievement since his election to office in January four years ago. When at some point in the future, Sri Lanka pauses to reflect on its history, this piece of legislation will perhaps stand as a milestone and a beacon that heralded change in Sri Lanka towards good governance and strengthening of democratic institutions that facilitated our nations advancement as a strong, vibrant and stable democracy and prosperous and peaceful nation.

Mr. Speaker, the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution that was signed into law on 15th May, 2015, by the then Speaker of the House, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa, after being voted virtually by every single Member of this House - I believe only one Member of this House opposed this Amendment - was not the result of a personal agenda of an individual or a group of individuals. In fact, I remember even you, Mr. Speaker, while we were in the Opposition, canvassed for this piece of legislation for many years and I am sure you along with many others like us were delighted that a dream which we had been holding for many years finally came into fruition on that day. This was the realization of the vision and the will of the majority of our people who are pro-democratic and progressive minded. It was the result of a movement to which people of our country including the late Venerable Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thero, politicians, civil society activists, human rights defenders, students, religious leaders, academics, journalists, artists breathed life and gave momentum.

In fact, we realized what a tremendous achievement this was, especially when we remember that there was a time in Sri Lanka where the Judiciary was operated through what I would call, "telephone call judgments". The Judiciary was controlled almost by a remote control

803 804

2019 21

and under this system, all judges were appointed by one single man. All Ministers were chosen by that same man. During that time, the Executive, Legislature and the Judiciary all operated in lockstep in service to this one man. If you were with that man, you could never be charged or convicted, whatever your crime. If you were with that man, including that man, you would be always above the law. However, if you went against that man, his sons, his brothers or some distant cousin, you could be arrested, charges fabricated against you, even accused of terrorism, sometimes convicted, or worse, as we all remember, thrown into a white van. The man was invincible and the country was helpless.

Then, one day in November, 2014, His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena as the General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party risked his life and brought this self-made God to his knees. We know what a huge sacrifice His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena made to bring this freedom to our country. Even at this moment we must appreciate it. All of us united under his leadership, defeated that man on the 08th of January, 2015 and ushered in a new era of true democracy, liberty and independent institutions to this country.

Under our Government, we fortified our nations Constitution against the tyranny or the tyrants of tomorrow. We took politics out of the appointment of judges and key government positions and created an apolitical process where representatives of all political parties and eminent persons from the civil society would vet judicial candidates. We stopped that era where the Chief Justice would be seen serving alms in the residence of the President in an almost routine manner. For the first time in decades, judges of every level could travel the country and the world with their heads raised high. It became clear to the public that they were nobodys lapdogs, that their appointments and promotions were removed from politics.

Today, independent judges give independent verdicts. One former Member of this House has already been sentenced to death for a number of murders. A former DIG had been sentenced to death for running a contract killer squad. The former Presidents Secretary has been sentenced for misappropriating public funds and even the former Chief of Staff of the present President could not, under this new order, escape from the clutches of the law.

However, the Rajapaksa regime came into power again on the 26th of October, 2018 and during the 52 days they purported to serve with him as Prime Minister, we all got to see what their intentions really were. Several police officers and witnesses involved in cases against the members of the Pohottuwa received calls suggesting that they put their lives and the lives of their families before their commitment to their jobs. Suspects waltzed in and out of the FCID wearing shorts and t-shirts. A man under investigation for robbing our national airline was reappointed as the Head of SriLankan Airlines.

Then, all of a sudden, after the 26th October attempt to seize power was ripped apart by an independent Judiciary in the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, they

realized that their true enemy was the very existence of an independent Judiciary. Those who are dreaming of coming back and creating a dictatorship in this country have realized that their real enemy is the independent Judiciary, the Constitutional Council and its Chairman, you, Sir, who guard that independence. Suddenly, these people who dream of a dictatorial future realized that the Judges and the Speaker will not bow down to their threats. This is also why they are targeting and maligning you, Sir. They learned the hard way, that you are fearless, honest and truly independent. An independent Judiciary or an independent Speaker is deadly poison to the Rajapaksa way of governing. Such critical positions must be entrusted with the Sahodara Sangamaya in their world, not with patriots like Karu Jayasuriya, who will put the interests of the country above all else. The President and Prime Minister must be proud of having promoted a Speaker who has become the symbol of democracy of Sri Lanka, not only within Sri Lanka, but even amongst the international community.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, I will finish very quickly.

Sir, you, a former army officer, do not travel around the Island climbing on stages, thumping your chest and bellowing about how much you love the country. You show us how much you love it by fighting to defend it and strengthening democracy.

Sir, the Constitutional Council is primarily aimed at depoliticizing the State and the Public Service and within the brief period that it has been in operation, it has proved to be successful in its intended objective. It is no secret that since the establishment of the Constitutional Council, our country has witnessed a remarkable improvement in the quality of delivery of justice. I am confident that this is a cause for pride for our learned judges themselves when they interact with their peers in other countries. As the Hon. Speaker has clarified, seniority, while being one of the criteria employed by the Constitutional Council in nominating and approving persons for appointment, is not the only criterion. For a country to develop, meritocracy is essential.

. .

Sir, if, on occasion, the Constitutional Council had not approved a nominee submitted by His Excellency the President, which had resulted in the President having to submit fresh nominations to the Council, it is not a reason to be slighted. . . ..

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Minister, your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, just give me two more minutes.

This is what democracy is about. This must be a reason for pride, to see that what one set in motion is actually yielding the intended results. If an impasse were to arise in the course of business, then the Constitutional Council and the President must work together to find a solution rather than engage in action that would exacerbate a situation and weaken the Constitutional Council. This, to me, is the beauty of democracy and what sets us apart from an autocracy or dictatorship.

Since January, 2015, we, who are the elected Representatives of the citizens of this country, have managed, despite hindrances and obstacles, to achieve remarkable progress in terms of checks and balances, thereby curbing unbridled power vested in the Executive. Some of the mechanisms that we have set up such as the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka and the Police Commission perform a commendable role as protector. The Human Rights Commission in particular, which has been accorded Grade A status by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions, has become an institution that all of us, as Sri Lankans, can be proud of.

Finally, any reversal of these good governance gains will not only make our citizens suffer in the hands of autocracy, but it will also isolate us internationally and plunge Sri Lanka into isolation once again. It will have a detrimental impact on Sri Lankas potential for economic development and the achievement of prosperity that all our citizens yearn for and deserve.

Thank you.

Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. DEPUTY SPEAKER took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) .

[5.32p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I thank you for giving me the opportunity in making some comments with regard to the Adjournment Motion as regards to the Nineteenth Amendment and the appointment of judges to the superior courts. His Excellency the President also made some valuable comments and I got the opportunity to speak after my Friend, the Minister, Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe.

Sir, I rise with a sense of extreme disappointment to speak on the infamous controversy that surrounds the Constitutional Council. Being a member of the legal profession, as I am, I rise today with a sense of grief over the performance of the very impartial institution that we thought we had enthroned by way of the Nineteenth Amendment. The process of approval undertaken by the Constitutional Council in respect of judges have come in for severe criticism from all concerned and today the time has come to undertake a self-critique of this institution which has even been placed beyond the pale of judicial review in respect of its functions of good faith. But, allegations of bad faith are being levelled against the Constitutional Council day in and day out, and if this Parliament which created this institution by a two-thirds majority does not seek to evaluate the performances of this institution and take remedial steps, then we will be doing a disservice to this supreme body of Parliament and the nation.

Sir, judges are a voiceless minority who are recognized as a separate arm by the Constitution. They are muted from expressing their views or their grievances by their very appointment. Their independence and impartiality to take a decision without fear or favour can only be promoted and advanced by impartial actions on the part of the Constitutional Council with greater transparency and fair play.

Let me recall the events: the Hon. Speaker responded to the Presidents criticism by a statement made in this House stating that seniority is not the only criterion. But, there are two other criteria, namely, achievements and ability.

833 834

I would like to ask the question, what is the manner in which achievements and ability are being evaluated? It is a well-known principle that if a statutory body has been given a power, it has to lay down the criterion by which it will exercise its power through the promulgation of rules and regulations and it must be presented before Parliament. Moreover, the judges themselves in the public must know that these regulations exist. Sir, whether these regulations were presented and approved by Parliament, is open to question. Therefore, you cannot definitely say that kusalathawaya and hakiyawa are published criteria as far as the promotions are concerned. In any event, there is another question that needs answering.

Who assesses ability? 005 .

Is it recorded anywhere in the Minutes of the Constitutional Council the ability of an approved candidate was considered? There has to be an objective evaluation of the achievements and criteria and as to how competent are the Members of the Constitutional Council to assess the criteria as the Hon. Speaker told in this House.

Are Members of the House who are in the Constitutional Council competent to evaluate the appointment of Judges of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court? I say no"," no" and "no. None of the Members of the Constitutional Council go to courts and if that is the case, how would you assess the ability of a judge? The ability of a judge would depend on the quality of judgments that a particular judge has delivered and I challenge that none of these criteria has been gone into by the Constitutional Council when approving appointments to superior courts. Therefore, Sir, when you speak of the ability of judges, there must have been a subcommittee comprising persons of eminence in the legal field who should have reported on the quality of judgments delivered by judges. I do not think that the Constitutional Council ever performed that task. If ability is the criterion, you must have framed regulations to establish a mode to evaluate the ability of a judge. But, this Constitutional Council has been operating and making decisions, without any of these assessments in place for the last three and a half years. Therefore, all decisions are flawed. They could be challenged for want of propriety, illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety.

Sir, let me single out the recent appointments of judges to the Supreme Court and rejection of two Judges of Court of Appeal which shocked my conscience. These two Judges of Court of Appeal continued to be superseded.

The continuous rejection of Deepali Wijesundara who was appointed to the Court of Appeal in 2011 has sent alarming waves in Hulftsdorp. This is a judge who has

been overlooked many a time. It is disheartening to point out that there is no other judge who has remained in the Court of Appeal over a period of eight years.

The Hon. Speaker made a statement that the Constitutional Council did not approve her nomination by the President because the Chief Justice has not recommended her. No doubt, the Constitution says that you shall seek the views of the Chief Justice but you are not bound by the views. If you are going to be bound by the views of the Chief Justice, Sir, there is no need of a Constitutional Council.

Also, Hon. Deputy Speaker, when you deal with adverse comments of the Chief Justice and recommendations of two previous Chief Justices, why did the Constitutional Council choose to ignore the recommendations of the two previous Chief Justices who thought that Her Ladyship was fit and recommended her to the Supreme Court? If the Constitutional Council chooses to give preference to an adverse recommendation over and above those recommendations of two previous Chief Justices, which were positive, that casts doubts on the recommendatory process of the Constitutional Council. I would also wish to place on record that for the appointment of the Chief Justice, there is no recommendatory process of the sitting Chief Justice.

That shows that this process is flawed. There is ambiguity and lack of clarity in the whole mechanism and this calls for an urgent amendment to this recommendatory process.

Another judge whose promotion has been denied from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court is Justice A.H.M.D. Nawaz. He is being denied his promotion on the basis of allegations levelled against him. This House is quite aware that charges are levelled against even us for various reasons. There are many a case filed against many Members of Parliament. Has it deprived us of the perks, privileges and entitlements? No. It only takes a perverse individual to make a complaint and imperil the career of someone. The existence of a charge does not mean that there is a presumption of guilt. Every man is presumed to be innocent until he is proven guilty in a Court of Law. Therefore, it is illogical and unreasonable to deny this judge his due promotion merely because there is a charge against him. Levelling allegations against a judge can be used as a mechanism to deprive a judge of his due promotion as we are fully aware that an inquiry in any form is likely to take some time. And in the interim, if a vacancy occurs and the judge is not promoted merely because of a pending inquiry, denial of promotion at the appropriate time would cause deprivation and humiliation in the eyes of the public.

Both Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Justice A.H.M.D. Nawaz have been Acting Presidents of the Court of Appeal. If they are found to be competent to act as Presidents of the Court of Appeal, it passes beyond anyones comprehension why does the Constitutional Council not find them competent to hold the permanent office of the President of the Court of Appeal? This

835 836

[ ]

2019 21

denial of due promotions and recognition goes to cast aspersions and misgivings in the minds of the public. By appointing them in the positions of Acting President of the Court of Appeal, His Excellency the President has thought it fit that they are competent enough. That shows that their ratification is only procedural and greater caution should have been exercised before rejection.

Sir, I must also speak a few words about High Court Judges. Some of them have been serving as High court Judges for years, but it is regrettable that some of them do not get promoted to the Court of Appeal, merely because there are unfounded aspersions and allegations created by some, which have not been subjected to any type of inquiry. The Constitutional Council giving weight to such allegations and aspersions cannot continue to deprive them of their promotions. One such judge has been overlooked 8 times to the Court of Appeal. That is Justice Manilal Waidyathilake. I would like the members of the Constitutional Council to touch their conscience and ask whether it is fair and how it would affect them if they suffered the same fate?

Let me also bring to light some mechanisms followed in other jurisdictions for greater transparency and less ambiguity.

In India, the largest and most vibrant democracy in the World, a Collegium which comprises of the Chief Justice and four most senior judges nominates a prospective judge to the Supreme Court. The nomination of the Collegium goes to the President who would approve and appoint the Judge to the Supreme Court. It is very rarely that the President rejects the nomination. Even in the event the President rejects the nomination for the second time, the judge is deemed to have been appointed.

The thinking behind this process is to give an opportunity to the nominating authority to rethink his nomination and not to shut his nomination. In the light of the Indian experience, the Constitutional Council must adopt a cautious approach in not rejecting the nomination sent by the President.

Over the years, judiciary has been enriched from a fusion of career judges and members of the Attorney Generals Department. This has served as a rich combination adding quality to the judicial arm of this country. Therefore, this tradition must be continued unabated. From 1955 to 2019, there have been 120 judges appointed to the Supreme Court. Out of them, 50 judges started their career as magistrates while 45 judges started their career in the Attorney Generals Department and joined the judiciary at various levels. Twenty five judges had been appointed from the unofficial bar and other agencies such as the Legal Draftsmans Department. This fusion is quite healthy enough for the rich development of the judiciary which the Constitutional Council and His Excellency the President should take note of. Thus, no career judge should be overlooked on the basis of appointment to the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court nor a member of the Attorney Generals Department and vice versa. Past records clearly indicate that healthy

balance has enhanced the stature of the judiciary by this fusion. Sir, I would like to table* herewith the consolidated statistics of the above in this House.

For the purpose of clarity, let us once again refer to the Article in the Constitution which deals with the process of appointment to the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal. Article 41C. (1) reads, I quote:

No person shall be appointed by the President to any of the Offices specified in the Schedule to this Article, unless such appointment has been approved by the Council upon a recommendation made to the Council by the President.

In terms of this Article, there is no doubt about the separation of functions. The President has two functions - nomination of a candidate and the appointment of that candidate. The Constitutional Council has one function - the approval or ratification of that nomination. Usually, in various countries nomination and its approval is usually the norm and rejection is an exception. But today, as His Excellency the President pointed out, the Constitutional Council has sought to depart from that norm and now it is a norm to reject and not to accept.

In the past, His Excellency the President used to send two or more names for one position. I humbly request His Excellency the President not to do so in the future as this gives an opportunity for the Constitutional Council to become the appointing authority and usurp the powers of His Excellency the President. The rationale for creating a Constitutional Council was for the purpose of creating non-partisanship and objectivity in appointments to high office. But if the common man today looks upon the Constitutional Council as politically-oriented, that shakes the very foundation of the objective for which this creature was created.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, there is a duty cast upon every Member of this House to see that this creature known as the "Constitutional Council" has greater transparency and greater independence. Also in the times of rejection of nominations by His Excellency the President, there should be a duty cast upon the Constitutional Council, by way of a confidential report or otherwise, to inform His Excellency the reason for doing so. As you know, every person is entitled to know why he has been rejected. In the public sector or in any other government institution where you hold public office, you are entitled to know why you have been rejected. But here when senior judges of the Court of Appeal or the High Court are rejected, they are totally unaware of why they are rejected and this has caused public ridicule. Hon. Deputy Speaker, if there is a mechanism, where the Constitutional Council is obliged to give reasons for their rejection, there would be greater transparency.

Also, Sir, the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe raised an issue with regard to the comments made by His Excellency the President about the Human Rights Commission. As you know, His Excellency the President also respects human rights, but with regard to the functions and the conduct of the Human Rights

837 838

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

Commission - inmates were transferred to another location for the purpose of the greater good and the manner in which the questions were asked, it brings the whole Government to disrepute. I have also seen how the Human Rights Commission has given adverse comments about our Government to Geneva. Unfortunately, the Human Rights Commission has failed in its duty. You can make comments about Sri Lanka, but Sri Lanka should not be discredited and when you ask questions from any State agencies, you have to maintain the dignity and respect of that agency as well.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, please conclude now. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am thankful that I have been given this opportunity and I believe that we all should work together to see that the judges dignity and the respect is maintained and when their promotions to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court are made, the dignity of judges is protected and there is a fair and square mechanism which would not cause them ridicule or public humiliation. As we have seen in various instances where Justice Deepali Wijesundara, Justice Nawaz and the High Court Judge Manilal Waidyathilake have been subject to various kinds of hurt by the conduct of the Constitutional Council. I urge the Hon. Speaker to ask the Constitutional Council to conduct their affairs keeping in mind that judges are also human and that all judges in the lower courts should be respected when their promotions are due to the apex court.

Once again, Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am thankful to you for giving me this opportunity.

[7.08 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) Mr. Deputy Speaker, whilst thanking you for giving me this opportunity to speak, I must state that it is not very unusual in a country to expect further strengthening of democracy, expect good governance, expect transparency and to expect an independent Judiciary.

In 2015, when we gathered in this Parliament to amend the Constitution for the nineteenth time, we voted unanimously in favour of such amendment expecting better governance, expecting that the rights of the people of this country will be further strengthened.

But, it was so unfortunate that from the time these Commissions were appointed, especially the Constitutional Council, the attempt of the Prime Minister and the Speaker was to take control of the Constitutional Council politically into their hands. If you may look at the composition, except for one member appointed among the Members of Parliament, all the others were with the UNP and had contested together in one alliance at the Presidential Election. Out of civil society members, there was one member who was previously the President of the UNP Lawyers' Association.

Today, we heard many Hon. Members referring to a vote been taken in deciding the appointment of the IGP, in deciding the appointment of the Attorney-General. Certainly, when everyone is appointed by the Prime Minister, the outcome of the vote is unanimous.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, what was expected by the people have not been delivered. Not only that the people are disgruntled, but the judges who are appointed to deliver justice, when their rights are infringed, they also feel penalized. When you look at the appointment of judges to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, it is very clear that such appointments were made arbitrarily without giving reasons or taking into consideration what should be taken into consideration. Previously, the criteria was seniority, but the seniority criteria has been set aside. In such circumstances, what was the criteria adopted when selecting judges? Though the provisions of the Constitution clearly stated that the rules and regulations must be gazetted, submitted and passed in Parliament, to date such regulations have not been passed.

If you may look at the promotions from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court, when Justice Malalgoda was promoted from President Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court, next in line was Justice Deepali Wijesundera who was appointed to that position in 2012, but she was overlooked. Next was Justice Nawaz, he was also overlooked and Justice Rohini Walgama was brought up and appointed as President Court of Appeal.

I have no malice; I have nothing against any one of these judges. I must tell you, all these judges either have been my colleagues in the Attorney-Generals Department or before those whom I have appeared. As the President very correctly said, where can the judges who have been overlooked go to when a reasoning is not given? When there had not been any case, pending inquiry or allegation against them, they were overlooked.

Then, when Justice Walgama retired, Justice Deepali Wijesundera, Justice Nawas and Justice Gafoor were overlooked again and Justice Dehideniya was brought up. Neither the seniors who have been overlooked did get any clarification nor did the President was informed as to why they were overlooked. It is not only that. Then, when Justice Dehideniya was promoted, again, Justice Deepali Wijesundera, Justice Nawas, Justice Gafoor and Justice Kumudini Wickramasinghe were overlooked and Justice Surasena was appointed President, Court of Appeal. So, what is happening? The Hon. Members of the UNP want

865 866

to maintain independence of Judiciary. How can you maintain independence of Judiciary when the judges are helpless? Judges are a voiceless minority in this country. There is no forum where they can go to for relief. They are disgruntled; they are unhappy. They are under a lot of stress because they have not been given the long-awaited seniority promotions. Most of these judges had either been in the Judiciary under the JSC or they had come from the Attorney-Generals Department. I can very responsibly say that when a promotion or an appointment is considered by the Attorney-Generals Department to the Court of Appeal, to the Supreme Court or to the High Court, it is decided based on merit and seniority; so is the JSC. Had they committed any offence, had they not been suitable, why is that the JSC did not take any action? Why is it that the Chief Justice did not take any action? These judges have continuously been harassed.

In such circumstances, Hon. Mangala Samaraweera was talking about judges becoming lapdogs. Invariably, the judges who would want to get their next promotion would be compelled to be lapdogs of either the Speaker or the Prime Minister. That is what is happening. In such circumstances, can we say that the democracy is strengthening in this country? Can we say that we are seeing what people expected in order to strengthen democracy and independence of Judiciary in this country? One solid example for that was, when a quo warranto was filed against the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Court of Appeal decided on it in a few days. Presently, there is a quo warranto against the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe alleging that not only he is disqualified to be the Prime Minister but also to sit as a Member of Parliament. But, what is happening? Judges are reluctant to hear that case.The case is getting postponed. Is that not an indirect influence and interference into the system? Hon. Deputy Speaker, this is one example of what is happening.

What happened to High Court Judge Dehideniya who had to retire because of the conduct of the Constitutional Council? What happened to High Court Judge Kusala Sarojini Weerawardena? She was compelled to retire. What happened in regard to the selection of the Attorney-General and the Chief Justice? When the Chief Justice was to be selected two names were sent, but based on the fact that one of the judges was Acting Chief Justice, his appointment was considered. He is an honourable Judge. There is no issue about the appointment. But that was the basis. When deciding the appointment of the Attorney-General, Mr. Suhada Gamlath was the Acting Attorney-General. I must say, the present Attorney-General, Jayantha Jayasuriya did not interfere or did not influence anybody to get that appointment. But due to the fact that Mr. Suhada Gamlath functioned as the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice under Mahinda Rajapaksa Government, he was overlooked and Mr. Jayantha Jayasuriya, who never expected to be the Attorney-General, was appointed.

In the case of the appointment of the IGP, the same thing happened. Now what they say is that it was done on

a vote. This kind of conduct is highly unsatisfactory. I point my finger at the Hon. Speaker. He must answer. He has not been able to give any justification as to why the appointments of these judges were turned down. This is very unfair. It is obvious that there is a clear political agenda behind these appointments. This system is getting politicized. My personal opinion once again is that if we are taking away the powers of His Excellency the President, those should be given to Parliament. It should not be given to the hands of so-called apolitical individuals who are not truly apolitical because everyone has some commitment in some form.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) You have to conclude now. ( ) (The Hon. Chandima Weerakkody) Hon. Deputy Speaker, in such circumstances, my humble request is to rethink about what is happening and long-overdue criteria for appointments, promotions and selections be Gazetted, presented to Parliament and implemented immediately. Until such time do not make any appointments, because it will lead to a chaos in the country and it will not be good for the country. The international community is also looking at what we are doing. However, it is obvious that the peoples rights have been hoodwinked by this Government over and over again. Thank you.
