It is the absolute privilege of the Legislatures and members thereof to discuss and deliberate upon all matters pertaining to the governance of the country and its people. Freedom of speech on the floor of the House is the essence of parliamentary democracy. Certain restrictions on this freedom have, to a limited degree, been self-imposed. One such restriction is that the discussions on matters pending adjudication before courts of law should be avoided on the floor of the House, so that the courts function uninfluenced by anything said outside the ambit of trial in dealing with such matters. . , , .

. . Question proposed. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Next, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Finance. [2.53p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Finance) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, first, I would like to move the following Resolution under Section 3 of the Active Liability Management Act, No. 8 of 2018:

" That this Parliament resolves that a sum not exceeding Rs. 480 billion may be raised by way of loans, in or outside Sri Lanka for such purposes as specified in terms of the provisions of Section 3 of the Active Liability Management Act, No. 8 of 2018. "

Sir, the Active Liability Management Act, No. 8 of 2018, which we shall call, for short, "ALMA" from hereon, was enacted by Parliament, as you know, on the 23rd of March last year with the objective to improve public debt management in Sri Lanka while ensuring that the financing needs and payment obligations of the Government are met at the lowest possible cost over the medium to long-term consistent with a prudent degree of risk. ALMA enables the Government to raise additional funds or contract liabilities over and above the Parliament approved annual borrowing limit as stipulated in the Appropriation Act subject to the conditions that the funds or liabilities contracted in aggregate should not exceed 10 per cent of the total outstanding debt as at the end of the preceding Financial Year. Further, such funds or liabilities contracted can be used only for the purpose of refinancing and pre-financing of the public debt through liability management. Sir, liability management is a process of restructuring the outstanding debt portfolio of the Government to improve the composition of it and thereby, addressing the possible risk arising from servicing of such debt obligations.

In fact, at this juncture, I would like to note that in 2018, a Resolution was submitted in Parliament under Section 3 of ALMA to raise a sum not exceeding Rs. 360 billion for such purposes as specified in ALMA and that Resolution was approved on the 26th of October last year, the very day the infamous Constitutional coup took place in Sri Lanka when an illegal Government took over the reins of governance for 52 days. However, no funds were raised utilizing that approval, as by that time, the ALMA had not been gazetted as required by Section 1. However, the required Gazette Notification enforcing ALMA, Gazette (Extraordinary) No. 2102/41 dated 21.12.2018, was published immediately after the 52-day Constitutional crisis was resolved and the legal Government was restored.

1009 1010

2019 9

Sir, the outstanding Central Government debt as at the end of 2018 amounted to Rs. 11,276 billion, which recorded as 78 per cent of GDP. From the total outstanding debt, Rs. 5,531 billion or 49 per cent represents domestic debt while Rs. 5,745 billion, that is 51 per cent, represents foreign currency denominated debt. Today, the debt service payments for the year are estimated at Rs. 2,079. 7 billion, from which 60 per cent is to be incurred for the debt service payments in terms of foreign currency denominated debt.

As at 26th June, 2019, the total actual debt service payments amounted to Rs. 1,131.5 billion including US Dollars 3,929 million debt service in foreign currency terms. The US Dollar requirements for the second half of the year were estimated at US Dollars 2,079 million approximately, and to meet this liability, actions were taken to raise a second ISB for the year 2019 amounting to US Dollars 2,000 million as of 24th June of this year. Within the given borrowing limit under the Appropriation Act, No. 6 of 2019 for the Financial Year 2019, Rs. 767.7 billion has been obtained by way of domestic sources while Rs. 548.6 billion equivalent amount has been obtained by way of foreign sources of financing. This includes International Sovereign Bonds of US Dollars 2,400 million raised in March, 2019 and the foreign financing for development projects amounting to Rs. 77 billion.

In this background, having taken into account the debt maturity structure during the period 2020 - 2029, specially with the continuous maturity of International Sovereign Bonds between 2020 and 2029 of about US Dollars 1,000 to US Dollars 1,500 million per annum, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has recommended to raise an amount not exceeding Rs. 480 billion being 4.26 per cent of the actual outstanding debt, which is Rs. 11,276 billion as at the end 2018, as stated in the Annual Report - 2018 of the Ministry of Finance, which has already been tabled here, by way of loans in or outside Sri Lanka for such purposes as specified in the provisions of ALMA. It must be noted that the yields in the domestic markets in recent times had been showing a downward trend and could remain so in the near term as per analysts. Although the Federal Reserve has not cut rates as expected in its FOMC Meeting in June, 2019, rates have showed a downward trend; in fact, rates have reduced in comparison to 12 months ago. In this context, given the impact of bunching, specially in the ISB spectrum, it is prudent and lenders also feel comfortable if the Government of Sri Lanka is able to access the market when rates are favourable and thereby, engage in active liability management activities which includes pre-payments and rollovers.

In fact, the recent ISB issuance of US Dollars 2,000 million at a maturity of both five and 10 years at 6.35 per cent and 7.55 per cent respectively, which was well subscribed, and also with interest rates of almost 50 to 30 basic points less than the issuance in March, 2019 has indicated that the Government of Sri Lanka is able to access funds in the international markets and that it is also able to do so at a reasonable cost despite the many challenges it has faced since the Easter Sunday attacks. In

fact, that again demonstrates the confidence the international community has in Sri Lanka.

It is in this background, Sir, that the limits for ALMA need to be approved by Parliament so as to enable a more prudent management of public finances. Accordingly, the following Resolution has been submitted to Parliament requesting its approval by me as the Minister of Finance today: Resolution under the Active Liability Management Act, - That this Parliament resolves that a sum not exceeding Rs. 480 billion may be raised by way of loans, in or outside Sri Lanka for such purposes as specified in terms of the provisions of the Section 3 of the Active Liability Management Act, No. 8 of 2018.

In addition to this, Sir, I will also take a few more minutes to present four Orders made in line with the Budget, 2019 and published in Gazette Notifications to the House. Following Excise Duty revisions were made by issuing following Orders under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, No. 13 of 1989 and published in the Gazette respectively. In fact, Gazette Extraordinary No. 2113/9 dated 05th March, 2019 was issued as a revenue Proposal in the Budget, 2019. The Excise Duty on passenger motor vehicles with an engine capcacity of less than 2,000 cc, three-wheelers and motorcycles was increased by 15 per cent respectively. Along with some other aspects, especially the Excise Duty on cigarettes which are more than 60 millimetres in length was increased by 12 per cent based on the principle of indexation together with a minimum annual revenue increase capturing annual inflation and GDP growth. The Gazette Extraordinary No. 2114/25 dated 13th March, 2019, the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2114/49 dated 14th March, 2019 and the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2123/5 dated 13th May, 2019 relate to the other Orders.

I will not take too much of your time to go into details of each of these Gazette Notifications. But, I would also like to clarify one issue which has been given wide publicity in the newspapers recently.
