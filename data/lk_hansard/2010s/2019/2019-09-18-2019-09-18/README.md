RUHUNU ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OF SRI

LANKA BILL: DETERMINATION OF THE SUPREME COURT ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I wish to announce to the House that I have received the Determination of the Supreme Court in respect of the Bill titled Ruhunu Economic Development Corporation of Sri Lanka, which was challenged in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution.

The Supreme Court has determined in terms of Article 121 and Article 123 of the Constitution that since the provisions of Clause 16 and Clause 17 of the Bill are in respect of matters set out in the Provincial Council List and the Bill has not been referred by His Excellency the President to every Provincial Council for the expression of their views as mandatorily required by Article 154G (3) of the Constitution, the Bill has not been validly or lawfully placed on the Order Paper of Parliament. Consequently, the Bill can be validly and lawfully placed on the Order Paper of Parliament and be placed before Parliament only after the aforesaid procedure has been complied with.

The Supreme Court has further stated that since the Bill has been placed on the Order Paper of Parliament without compliance with the provision of Article 154G (3), it would not at this stage make a Determination as to the other grounds challenged in respect of this Bill.

I order that the Determination of the Supreme Court be printed in the Official Report of todays Proceedings.

. The Merchant Shipping Secretariat is tasked with the enforcement of relevant legislations and promulgation of necessary regulations to give effect to the mandatory IMO Conventions. Those are the major functions entrusted to this Secretariat. The IMO, being the specialized agency of the United Nations in relation to global shipping activities, conducts mandatory audits on member States in terms of IMO Resolution A. 1070 (28). It is commonly known as "III Code" to ascertain the implementation of mandatory IMO Conventions.

The Merchant Shipping Secretariat has identified the need for amending the Merchant Shipping Act, No. 52 of 1971 with the development and transformation of the industry in the world while fulfilling the international obligations effectively and efficiently as a Flag, Port and Coastal State. . .

As desired by the Merchant Shipping Secretariat, the IMO organized and conducted a Mock Audit in 2014 in order to ascertain the compliance with the provisions of the mandatory instruments prior to the scheduled mandatory IMO Member State Audit in 2016. During the Mock Audit, it was revealed that Sri Lanka had not fully transposed several mandatory IMO instruments into domestic legislation in order to give those instruments full and complete effect. Accordingly, the then Minister in charge of Ports and Shipping submitted the Cabinet Memorandum to amend the Merchant Shipping Act, No. 52 of 1971 in order to bring the amendments in line with the IMO mandatory Conventions. The Cabinet of Ministers, at its Meeting held on 29.04.2015, decided to grant approval to amend this Act, thereby paving the way for necessary amendments to accommodate the IMO Conventions into domestic legislation.

So, we are bringing the following Amendments in this House today. The main areas included in the Amendment Bill are as follows: one, it has incorporated legislative provisions for the International Convention on Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 and Protocol 1988 as may be amended and to enable the Minister to make regulations to give effect to the objectives of that part; two, it has incorporated legislative provisions for the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966 as modified by the Protocol 1988; three, it proposes the insertion of a new Part to include the provisions for issue of Certificates for the Sri Lankan Flag vessels in order to prevent pollution from ships in terms of International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 as modified by the Protocol 1978 and the Protocol 1997; four, it has also incorporated provisions for issuing implementing standards for the compliance with the minimum technical standards of the Conventions provided in the Act with the concurrence of the Hon. Minister; five, it has allowed to appoint a panel of experts for imposing the administrative penalties and finally, as the fines have not been increased since 1971, it is intended to increase the fines on the basis of the devaluation of the rupee. So, those are the main areas that will be included in the Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Bill which I have presented in this House today.

"The final section of the Extension of the Southern Expressway from Matara to Hambantota, a 74 km section also studied by this author in 2007, was found to be feasible provided that proposed development in Hambantota preceded the construction of the highway. The cost was estimated at Rs. 33.2 billion (US$ 300 million) or US$ 4 million per km.

However, in 2013/14 the Road Development Authority (RDA) awarded this highway on negotiated design-and-build basis to Chinese companies for a total contract value of Rs. 224 billion (US$ 1892 million) amounting to US$ 20 million per km."

I think the most important thing in the shipping industry is the vibrancy; it is not a static industry. We find that there is a new breath of fresh air with the new Minister taking it over, but I would like him to keep abreast of the situation that is prevalent because we need to seize certain opportunities and advantages for the betterment of our country. We find that Sri Lanka is seriously not taking advantage of the business opportunity -

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Harshana Rajakaruna to the Chair?

( ) (The Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka) Sir, I propose that Hon. Harshana Rajakaruna do now take the Chair.

. . Question put, and agreed to.

.

, , .

Whereupon THE HON. VELU KUMAR left the Chair, and THE HON. HARSHANA RAJAKARUNA took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Please continue, Hon. Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I guess we need to wake up to the business reality because I find that Sri Lanka is not having the sense of urgency needed, which is spreading across all industries. So, I take this opportunity to say that we need to go forward on a thrust-industry basis to reach the full potential of the shipping industry. As you know, India is a giant compared to us and we find that they are awakening, not only to modernization, but also to automation and change of bureaucracy. It is a serious threat to Sri Lanka. So, we must win their confidence and ensure that it is a production base we could make use of. We should use this as a transit point and capture their full potential so that we will be able to reap benefits out of that.

Shipping is our future and the spin-off benefits that would come in as a result of that are, the logistics industry and the freight forwarding industry. I think those are not fully exploited as yet. You see, Singapore has grown by default. Owing to Sri Lankas past civil disturbances, the lack of coherency, consistency and the policy adaptiveness being delayed, Singapore has been able to move forward. You see Dubai, on the other side, has taken advantage of it. Being between the Far East and the West, Sri Lanka could have played a pivotal role, but lost the opportunity to Fujairah. So, Dubai has taken the advantage of it before it moves to Europe.

However, it is never too late to get moving. I guess at this particular moment when we are handling around 7.3 million to 7.4 million TEUs - the potential should have been 15 to 20 million TEUs - we should be able to seize the opportunity that is there before us. Unfortunately, we are having capacity problems and we see the ECT as the future and that should be immediately developed. Also, we need to take one step forward and ensure that we develop the North Port as well. Through the North Port Development Project, we would be able to plan to achieve a sizeable development in the future.

You could see that the CICT is handling roughly around 2.3 million to 2.4 million containers when the potential is about 2.6 million to 2.7 million TEUs. So, we are full to the brim in terms of capacity there. Then, we have the JCT which should be handling about 2.6 million to 2.7 million TEUs, but we are just averaging around 2.0 million to 2.1 million TEUs. So, it is underperforming. Also, the productivity is something which we should be

631 632

[ ]

2019 18

really looking at. I will come back to that matter later. Then, the SAGT is doing an excellent job. When its capacity is 1 million TEUs, they are able to handle 2 million. So, they are well above the capacity owing to modernization, high stacking et cetera. These are the ways that we can take full advantage of before we ensure that the ECT comes into operation to support us with another 2 million to 3 million container capacity, which will help strengthen the tide that is there because if we are unable to meet the capacity, you would find these shipping lines going away and they will never come back to Sri Lanka and that has been the folly. We have been sitting on this without taking advantage. We should have had this operational two to three years ago. So, now we need to ensure that we reach our full potential in the next 12 months or so.

In the process, we find the delays that are taking place in the Port unbearable.

Inter-terminal operations are far too slow. I think we need to have a reality check into our shipping industry because a sense of inefficiency and lethargy has crept in, which needs to be corrected with immediate effect. The delays in inter-terminal transfers are so long that delays in handling ships are also taking place and that is a concern for the shipping industry. So, I think we need to ensure that this type of things are checked, looked at and corrected immediately. We need to have a professional team. If we are unable to discharge the services owing to lack of forethought or planning, let us ensure that efficiency is brought in so that we do not lose the opportunity that is before us.

We can certainly be more innovative. Let us bring in automation of documentation. ASYCUDA, which was to be implemented, has still not been fully put into place. You see that the Customs is not working with its full ability, giving the necessary assistance and is not improving the potential to do things much quicker. We find that they are still stalling, they are not contributing to the process and are part of the lethargic system that is there. I guess this needs to be corrected with immediate effect because these are things that are spoken ill of. Competitiveness is the need of the hour. Unfortunately, we find that the costs are increasing and that the competition check is still there owing to intense competition, but this happens at the expense of domestic containers coming in and subsidizing some of the transshipments. Out of the 7.3 million containers, to my reckoning, about 75 to 76 per cent transshipments do take place. However, this is a good position to be in, but I think we need to ensure that much more is done so that the idling capacities could be converted in to profits for our country. Last year, we lost almost Rs. 8 billion to Rs. 9 billion as exchange loss owing to lack of prudency in financial borrowings that took place before and that is why when it comes to the ECT, it is asked why foreign loans are being taken. There is a necessity to take foreign loans, but ensure that they are basically capped and hedged so that the impact we experienced 30, 40 years ago is not repeated once again.

ECT .

. innovativeness . . . ECT 100 CICT . . . . . . 41 . . . Today, one of the biggest problems you have is, mother vessels going directly to the ports in the Eastern side of India. You could see the mother vessels which previously went via Sri Lanka now going directly to the Ports of Chennai and Krishnapatnam. Now, we have lost the opportunity of providing services to those vessels because of the advancement in the shipping industry in India. Again, the reality check would be when Kerala will have their port coming in to operation in December, 2020. The port will be run by the private sector and have an 18-metre draught depth, which is able to bring in big mother vessels. That will be a serious threat to Sri Lanka. So, I guess it is necessary for the shipping industry of Sri Lanka to engage and bring in the Indian competition to Sri Lanka. I have been mentioning from the day I became the Trade Minister in 2001 that we should embrace India as a major shareholder of our Port in making it a major port in the SAARC Region because they are a production base.

We can have hundreds of ports, but if we do not have a production base which is able to ensure that the shipping industry is taken good care of, we would not be able to fulfill our aspirations for the Port. That is what is staring at us from the Kerala Port. So, I am sure the new Minister would take cognizance of this fact, would be able to take on the competition directly and ensure that we cater to the hunger element in the shipping industry. This is a volatile industry and if we have officials who do not respond from a point of view of developing the shipping industry, we would be lagging behind and giving in to the threats coming from the ports of production-oriented places like India. So, the Port should be looked at more from a point of view of commercial orientation. We should not just hang onto the 100 vessels that come for a month, but look at bringing in bigger vessels, bringing in more productivity, being more competitive and ensure that we are able to achieve the growth rates that were there before. We saw almost a 20 per cent growth rate taking place in 2016, 2017 and 2018. The same elements need to come in. I guess one of the constraining factors would be the capacity, but irrespective of that, we would be able to reach a higher height. The container storage capacity can be improved

633 634

and that will result in a bigger capacity handled out of Sri Lanka. These are the elements that we have got to look at.

I am happy that the Hambantota Port is now coming into operation. We had an idle port and it certainly is a step in the right direction to commercialize it instead of just having a white elephant, saying that we have a port but not having a single container handled via that. We see vibrancy coming through that. That is the way we need to take our shipping industry forward. The Oluvil Port also needs to be put into commercialization. We have some other ports. The Galle Port,too, should be looked at from a more commercial-oriented way. I call upon the Hon. Minister to ensure that officials with a thinking of commercialization put into each port and a target given to them with productivity as the most important aspect, competitiveness as its key word as well as ensuring there is automation, technology development, speed of handling and a modernization approach to be brought into Sri Lankan ports.

Also, ensure that we have a consistent, coherent policy. We should have a shipping policy which will bring in a sense of stability and knowledge where the shipping industry is heading because while shipping leads, logistics and freight forwarding follow. I guess the aggressiveness that has been shown before should be put into really practical, operational activities.

Sir, I do not want to take more time labouring over the same point, but only want to say that we also need to increase our productivity. The JCT, which roughly handles only 23 or 24 containers an hour, needs to be improved to handle 28 to 29 containers. Then, you have the CICT which can be taken as a barometer of real productivity and which handles 28 to 29 containers an hour. That also should be increased so that we will have a quicker throughput. With that, there will be a competitive element coming in so that we can compete within our region and also ensure that the ships are turned around much quickly.

All I could say is, by adding on, we should be able to think not only about transshipment, but also of other areas like the ships that bring in tourists, FSRUs, the LNG vessels that come in and ensure that we have maximization of that. In some areas, we could basically induce them by reducing rates, ensuring that ships call in because it is cheaper for them to berth here, get stevedoring facilities and other replenishments from Sri Lanka, which would help the industry as a whole.

So, I do not want to labour over the subject too much as time is a limiting factor. But, I would call upon Minister Sagala Ratnayaka to ensure that a sense of vibrancy is brought in. I can see some changes happening, but they need to happen much quicker and with much force. Ensure that we get the benefits today rather than tomorrow.

Thank you.
