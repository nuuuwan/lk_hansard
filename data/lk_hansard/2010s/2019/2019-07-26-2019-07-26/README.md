( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . . ( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) . ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Hon. Deputy Speaker, first of all, may I thank the former Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Tamil National Alliance, the Hon. R. Sampanthan, for moving this Adjournment Motion on Constitutional reforms and the national question.

Sir, following the attempted coup and Easter Sunday bombings, many of our fellow citizens ask why our country continues to veer from one crisis to another. In fact, if they are asking that question, they are right to do so. The history of Sri Lanka, I believe, is a history of crisis. In the last 70 odd years we experienced the assassination of a Prime Minister, the assassination of an Executive President, a failed coup, two youth insurgencies and a long bloody civil war.

With one or two exceptions, the common thread uniting these crises is the national question, the question of how our many communities can live together in amity and flourish collectively. Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike was assassinated because of his attempts at conciliation with the minorities.

The 1962 coup was significantly induced by fear of discrimination against Christians. The war, as our academics and intelligence men have observed, was the direct result of treating minorities in this country as second-class citizens.

At this point, Sir, it would be amiss not to reflect on the lessons of the Black July. In fact, this week, thirty six

497 498

years ago, from the 24th of July to the 30th of July, the State failed to protect thousands of its own citizens who were slaughtered in their homes and on the streets. We all know that if there was any one cause for a rag-tag insurgency becoming a full-blown civil war, it was the Black July. Similarly, it cannot be a coincidence that the Easter Sunday bombings took place following the Aluthgama and Digana riots. Although investigations are still underway, there is reason to think that these riots played a role in radicalizing a few Muslim youth.

Even though these issues consumed the energies of this House and the entire Island's since Independence, it is clear that we have failed to resolve this matter successfully. Despite new Constitutions, countless Committees and endless debates, we still have majoritarianism entrenched in our politics and law.

The stakes could not be higher. It is our inability to resolve the national question that is at the very centre of our failure to make Sri Lanka peaceful and prosperous. Sri Lanka has been in crisis, remains in crisis and will continue to be in crisis until we can create a just and equal Sri Lanka for all Sri Lankans.

Sir, this House knows the solution to this problem; it has always known the solution to this problem. But, more often than not, the Members have not had the courage of their convictions to address it. Ever since Independence, all our leaders including the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa know the actual solution to this problem. It has cowered before a small but vocal minority of reactionary forces, and I am sad to say that a truly united Sri Lanka, a Sri Lanka where Muslims do not fear Buddhists, where Sinhalese do not fear Tamils and where Christians can worship in peace, is a cause of mortal danger for certain Members of this House. Sri Lankas future as a prosperous, united and undivided country depends on establishing a Constitution that would embrace and celebrate Sri Lankas multicultural, multi-ethnic and multilinguistic identity based on the principles of equal citizenship, justice and devolution of power. They understood the importance of building a Sri Lankan identity and a Sri Lankan Constitution, which all of Sri Lankas communities could equally claim as their own. In fact, all our national leaders, as I said, including our good Friend, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, have considered ensuring equal rights and a measure of self-government as essential for the countrys stability, security and prosperity.

The first Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, who was also the founder of the UNP, D.S. Senanayake, strongly believed in unity in diversity. He emphatically remarked - this was the first speech made in independent Sri Lanka on the 4th of February, 1948 - I quote:

Our nation comprises many races, each with a culture and a history of its own. It is for us to blend all that is best in usthere is no greater ambition in my life than to get all these communities together

He also went on to say:

For centuries the Sinhalese and Tamils have lived together in peace and amity. We have been governed by their Kings and they, by ours

D.S. Senanayakes policy has always been the policy of the United National Party. The last UNP President, the late Ranasinghe Premadasa, said so in his speech and I quote:

Multi-ethnic democracy has always been my vision for Sri Lanka. There is no other way. It has been my vision from the time I entered politics. My electorate in Colombo was multi-ethnic. I could not have represented my electorate for so many years had I not practised multi-ethnic politics. Furthermore, now as President, my electorate is the whole country. I am the President for all groups and communities who comprise Sri Lanka.

On 2nd March, 1990, during his speech on "Arms cannot bring peace, he said, I quote:

Whatever the race, the religion or the caste that any individual belongs to, we must realize that he or she has a birthright to share of this country. It is only if that right is denied to persons on grounds of differences of race, religion, caste or other such considerations, that a threat of division of this country will arise, that a threat to the sovereignty of this country will arise and foreign powers will have an opportunity to interfere in our affairs.

, .

President Premadasa also had the sagacity to appoint Mangala Moonesinghe, an SLFP Member of this House, to chair the Parliamentary Select Committee on this topic. It is also important to note that the Committees Report recommended a scheme of devolution on lines similar to the Indian Constitution, in other words federalism. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too has been a worthy custodian of this UNP legacy and has always stood for a political solution to the national question.

Similarly, leaders of the other main political party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, too shared this view. Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, who was the SLFP founder leader said in Parliament on 5th August, 1958, I quote:

I am satisfied that extremism in this country consists of the activities of a small minority, whether they are Sinhalese or Tamil, but that the vast majority of the people are reasonable and moderate and only wish to live together with mutual respect as well as self-respect, so that we could march forward together and achieve that progress and that position for us all which have been hoping to obtain under this freedom we have, freedom for the Sinhalese - yes, remember too - that it is the freedom for the Tamils, for the Muslims, for the Malays, for the Burghers, who are all fellow citizens, yes, if it is not freedom in that way for all, I too repeat the words of another leader. Shri Jawaharlal Nehru who stated that if freedom meant internal communal strife or injustice or suppression of minorities to hell with Swaraj.

This was his long-standing opinion. It was based on his view that a centralized government was imposed on us by the colonizers before. In Jaffna, on 17th of July 1926, his speech titled Federation as the Only Solution

499 500

[

2019 16

to our Political Problems described Sri Lankas pre-colonial system of government as decentralized and similar to a loose federation. He stated that the British introduced a centralized form of government and argued it was unsuitable for a country like Ceylon. He is also reported to have said, In Ceylon, each province should have complete autonomy. Earlier that year, in May and June, he wrote six articles to "The Ceylon Morning Leader", making the case for federalism. Allow me to quote the following:

there would be trouble if a centralized form of government was introduced into countries with large communal differences.

But his daughter tried to set things right.

President Chandrika Kumaratunga was brave enough to stand on election platforms and speak truth to power. In fact, I remember Chandrika Kumaratunga coming to Akuressa in 1993 as the Chief Minister of the Western Province, and in the deep South where 90 per cent are Sinhala Buddhists, she said Sri Lanka needs a federal system and at the election, we had a resounding landslide even after that statement was made. She had the courage to boldly state in public what the political class said in private: the solution to the national question was federalism.

I remember the present Leader of the Opposition, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, supporting the 1995 Union of Regions Proposals. He held this view for a long time. In fact, Hon. Rajapaksa, you made one of the best speeches a leader of our country has made at the Inaugural Session of the All Party Representative Committee on 11th July, 2006, long before you chased me out, where I was also present. He summarized the main thrust of his proposed solution to the ethnic conflict. Hon. Leader of the Opposition, I would like to quote what you said in 2006.

people in their own localities must take charge of their destiny and control their politico-economic environment. Central decision-making that allocates disproportionate resources has been an issue for a considerable time. In addition, it is axiomatic that devolution also needs to address issues relating to identity as well as security and socio-economic advancement, without over-reliance on the Center. In this regard, it is also important to address the question of regional minorities.

In sum, any solution needs to, as a matter of urgency, allow people to take charge of their own destiny. This has been tried out successfully in many parts of the world. There are many examples from around the world that we may study as we evolve a truly Sri Lankan constitutional framework including our immediate neighbour, India.

This is what you said at the opening of the All Party Conference.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) He was talking of a political solution, devolution. Read further down.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Yes, there is a long speech, but I am not going to read the whole thing. By saying that he wants to look at India, he is also endorsing a federal model for Sri Lanka with all leaders of this country. In fact not only you, even the Left leaders including the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardenas own brother, the Hon. Indika Gunawardena, endorsed it.

In his concluding remarks, the Hon. Rajapaksa was very firm. He said, I quote:

..any solution must be seen as one that stretches to the maximum possible devolution.

This is Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa. - [Interruption.] Thank you. But, I am sorry that you had to change your views under pressure from various other people. - [Interruption.] , , . .

On 9th January, 2016, the next leader of the SLFP, President Maithripala Sirisena made his views on the matter very clear to the House.

Attempts to build co-operation and friendship among Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Buddhist, Catholic, Hindu, Malay and Burgher failed. Communities became increasingly polarized owing to the shortcomings and loopholes formed in the constitutional provisions promulgated in the country, triggered by the provisions contained in the Soulbury Constitution. This resulted in the creation of the terrorist known as Prabhakaran. Regardless of what people say, I am of the belief that if the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact had become a reality, we would not have witnessed the creation of terrorism. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Okay, Sir.

As I said, the Left leaders also endorsed this view throughout our Independence era. The LSSP leader Dr. Colvin R. De Silvas words during the 1956 Debate on the Sinhala Only Bill were prophetic then, but unless we act now, I fear, all too sadly, they would prove to be doubly prophetic. I will quickly refer to it because it is very important that the new generation knows what our l Left leaders talked about, and I quote:

If you refuse to help a section of our people of a specific racial stock, having their own separate language, their specific and particular culture, traditions and history, if you deny them their language right, then you are running the risk of hammering them in the future into what they yet are not. Today they are but a section distinctive by reason of their particular racial stock and language, from the Sinhalese within the Ceylonese nation. But if you mistreat them, if you ill-treat them, if you misuse them, if you oppress and harass them, in that process, you may cause to emerge in Ceylon, from that particular stock with its own particular language and tradition, a new nationality to which we will have to concede more

501 502

claims than it puts forward now. It is always wiser statesmanship to give generously early instead of being niggardly too late.

Parity, he argued, is the road to freedom of our nation and the unity of its components. Otherwise, two torn little bleeding States may yet arise of one little State.

This is what Dr. Colvin R. De Silva said way back in 1956.

Even the founder leader of the JVP, Rohana Wijeweera supported these views and went further than the others in the Left. In a speech in Jaffna in 1982, which can be watched on YouTube, he argued that the solution to the ethnic conflict was acknowledging and respecting the right of minorities to self-determination. This is the leader of the JVP and I quote him:

We propose to create areas of self-rule where minority communities have large concentrations. We state that any ethnic community or any minority group has the right to self-determination.

Then, the late Indika Gunawardena, a leader of the Communist Party, stood in this very House 19 years ago during the 2,000 Constitutional Debate and said, I quote:

..the standpoint of the Marxist movement is that the right to make self-decisions should not be denied to any citizen. The right of a nation to self-determination is upheld by the working classA separate state of Tamil Eelam will never be a solution to the national problem. The best way to grant the right to make self-decisions to various ethnic groups, i.e. to create a united Sri Lanka, will be autonomous administration in the North and East. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, you have to conclude now. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Okay, Sir.

Finally, all I want to say is, we are at a rare moment in history where the Tamil political leadership is united and represented by a great statesman in the shape of the Hon. R. Sampanthan. His stature, wisdom and temperament are not only a bonus for the Tamil community, but for the whole of Sri Lanka. This may not be the case in the future. We must not let this opportunity go. We must answer the offer and the question he placed before us in Matara - in fact, he came to an event in Matara just two weeks ago - and I would like to quote the Hon. Sampanthan. Actually, it was an excellent speech where all the people of the South, the Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena and all, at the end of his speech, stood up and gave him a standing ovation. I think the whole speech is worth listening to. But, I would quote only a little bit of it.

I want to work with fellow Sri Lankans to resolve this conflict within the framework of a united, undivided, indivisible Sri Lanka, that would be the best thing for Sri Lanka. If we do not, what would be the consequences?

He ended the speech with that question. I believe that all of us, whichever party, whichever side, whichever community, whichever religion we may believe in, must start asking ourselves, if we do not solve this issue, what are the consequences and can Sri Lanka move forward unless we come to terms with the fact that Sri Lanka is a multi-ethnic, multireligious, multicultural nation?

Sir, I am particularly thankful for the opportunity to speak after the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, who spoke this morning in this House because this gives me an opportunity to put many matters straight. The former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in the course of his speech stated many things. He referred to the discussions that the Tamil National Alliance had with his Government in 2011 and stated that it was we who walked out of that meeting. That is furthest from the truth. We met, for the first time, on the 10th of January, 2011, met 18 times and the 18th meeting was on the 16th of December, 2011. In between, once in August, we refused to meet further and that was because at the first meeting, the second meeting and the third meeting, we gave proposals from our side as to what we thought should be the contours of a political solution. The Government delegation was led by the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka. It included the Hon. Nimal Siripala De Silva, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris and the Hon. Sajin de Vass Gunawardena. Subsequently, the Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka withdrew from that Committee and was replaced by the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha. Although we gave our proposals, the Government, having repeatedly assured us that they would respond to our proposals, failed to do that for several meetings and

503 504

[

2019 16

therefore, around August, we said it was useless to continue to meet until they gave their proposals, and we stopped meeting.

Thereafter, there was a meeting between President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Hon. Sampanthan, at which it was agreed that we would resume the talks and that the talks would continue on the basis of five documents and President Mahinda Rajapaksa's speech at the Inaugural Session of the APRC and the Experts Committee held in July, 2006, which the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera quoted from this morning. Those five documents are: the Mangala Moonesinghe Select Committee Proposals, the Proposals for Constitutional Reforms of 1995 and 1997 under President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the Constitutional Bill of 2,000, the Multi-Ethnic Experts Committee to the APRC Report and as I said, also the speech made by President Mahinda Rajapaksa. That was agreed. On the basis of the agreement, we resumed our talks in September, 2011 and proceeded until December and in December, we fixed the next meetings for 17th, 18th and 19th of January, 2012. On those three days, we went for the meeting. The Government delegation did not come. Even though on the first day, the 17th of January, we knew that they had not turned up, yet, the following day and the day following that also we went and sat there.

So, on those three days, we went and sat there, but the Government delegation did not turn up and on those days, the Hon. S.M. Krishna, the Minister of External Affairs of India was visiting Sri Lanka. These are all matters of record. So, it is wrong for the Hon. Leader of the Opposition to say that we left the meeting. Even on that occasion, the Hon. S.M. Krishna stated at a press conference before he left Sri Lanka with Prof. G.L. Peiris standing by his side - Prof. G.L. Peiris was the Minister of External Affairs of Sri Lanka at that time - "As many times before, President Rajapaksa has assured me that a political solution would be found by implementing the Thirteenth Amendment in full and building upon the Thirteenth Amendment so as to achieve meaningful devolution".

The Hon. Rajapaksa referred to "Thirteen Plus" and said that it was not his terminology, but somebody else called it that and also stated what he meant by "Thirteen Plus". This is what was meant by "Thirteen Plus". Not only did Hon. S.M. Krishna say it, but it is in three joint communiqus between India and Sri Lanka: once, between the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the then Prime Minster (Dr.) Manmohan Singh and on another occasion, again, between Hon. S.M. Krishna and Prof. G.L. Peiris, the two Ministers of External Affairs of the two countries.

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe - Non-Cabinet Minister of Science, Technology and Research) . . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, Hon. Minister? ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Hon. Member, I just want to get a clarification. You said that the Hon. S.M. Krishna said that the Thirteenth Amendment will be implemented in full.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) And going beyond that. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) That is what I wanted to make sure. He said that the Thirteenth Amendment will be implemented in full and then, he referred to Thirteen Plus also. Is it?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) And, going beyond that to achieve meaningful devolution.

So, that phrase is in three documents, in three joint communiqus, and it is important to note that because implicit in that phrase is an acknowledgement by the Government of Sri Lanka that the Thirteenth Amendment is meaningless. That is why you had to go beyond that to achieve meaningful devolution. There is an acknowledgement by the Government of Sri Lanka that it is not meaningful devolution; a system of devolution obtained under the Thirteenth Amendment is not meaningful. That is why they said, "We will achieve meaningful devolution in the future, but prior to that, full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment".

And what did we hear from the Hon. Leader of the Opposition this morning? He said in the new proposals, there is a proposal to have provincial police and he sounded horrified at that thought. But, it is there in the Thirteenth Amendment; it is there in the Thirteenth Amendment which he has ad nauseam assured the world that he will fully implement. What is there to be horrified at the thought of law and order being devolved? He has repeatedly assured this country and the world to implement the Thirteenth Amendment in full. If that be so, law and order is a devolved subject in the Thirteenth Amendment. Police is not fully devolved to the provinces, but certain powers of the police are devolved; certain powers of the police will be retained at the Centre. That truth is never communicated properly. Even in the proposals, that is exactly what is given.

With regard to the more recent effort at drafting a new Constitution for Sri Lanka, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition as he commenced his speech this morning said, Enacting a new Constitution must be done at the

505 506

beginning of a Government's term, not at the tail end. But, what did we have at the beginning? At the beginning, as soon as this Parliament was constituted in August, 2015, in December of that year itself, a Public Representation Committee was appointed. That went round the country, got views from all different people and a Report was submitted on the 31st of May, 2016. And beginning 9th of January 2016, this Parliament debated a Resolution four times in this House and eventually two months later on the 9th of March 2016, this Parliament unanimously adopted that Resolution. It unanimously adopted that Resolution, not one single Member called for a Division. And what did that Resolution say? That Resolution is very detailed. It goes on to say how the new Constitution would be enacted, what the drafting process would be, how the Constitutional Assembly will bring that draft to this Parliament and how it will be tested in the Constitutional Assembly for a two-thirds vote first. All of that is in great detail and that was unanimously adopted. And every single decision taken thereafter in the Constitutional Assembly hearings were unanimously adopted, not one person voted against any of those decisions.

We have the Steering Committee. I was a Member of the Steering Committee. That Steering Committee has met more than 80 times. By the end of 2016, as the Hon. (Dr.) Jayampathy Wickramaratne stated yesterday, we had an Interim Report ready. Yes, there was a proposal to abolish the Executive Presidency. That was a promise given to the country. There were proposals for electoral reform. That was also a promise given to the country. But, more than both those was the crucial issue of the solution to the Tamil national question, a question, a problem that has plagued this country for 70 long years. This country has never been at ease from the time it attained Independence and we were trying to resolve that. And during that process, President Mahinda Rajapaksas Representatives in those committee said, Do not rush, do not rush. We must not rush this. We must have time. We must consider this. The Interim Report that was ready in November, 2016 could not be brought out until September, 2017 because they said, "We must have a longer discussion. We must talk within our party". So, you cannot have the cake and eat it. You cannot say, "Do not rush into it at the beginning of a Parliaments term". Then, you cannot say, "We want time; we want consultation". This was done with full consultation and consensus. You take time over it and when that time has passed, you cannot come and say, Oh! Now it is end of the term. Now, we cannot do it. We must always do it at the beginning of the term. You cannot do that. This is a process in which people have been directly consulted. This is a process in which six separate Subcommittees have given Reports on six separate matters. This is a process in which another Ad hoc Committee was appointed, which included the Hon. A. D. Susil Premajayantha and the Hon. Prasanna Ranatunga, with regard to the relationship between the Centre and the Provincial Councils. They have given a Report. And, this is a process in which the Steering Committee, on six other subjects, gave an Interim Report.

All of the principles of devolution were unanimously agreed upon. The first principle of devolution was principle of subsidiarity. What does "subsidiarity" mean? It was readily agreed upon. No one ever objected to that. "Subsidiarity" means, you do exercise power at the lowest level, if it is possible to exercise at that level. Only if you cannot do it at that level, you go to the next higher level. That was agreed. It is on that basis that a three-tiered system was devised in this proposal at the local level, yes, at the provincial level and at the Centre. The Centre has a lot of powers and it did not give up most of its powers, but there was a proposal to give to the provinces substantial exercise of legislative and Executive power so that people who are smaller in numbers, when you take the country as a whole, at least in the areas in which they are a majority can determine their affairs, but not the foreign policy, not the monetary policy and not the defence of Sri Lanka, none of those. All of that will be retained in the Centre. But, with regard to matters that affect the day-to-day lives, decisions will be taken in the provinces. People in the provinces are asking, Why should decisions about our daily lives be taken in Colombo? In fact, all of the proposals on devolution that are contained in the Report, which has a draft, are proposals that are endorsed by the Chief Ministers and Opposition Leaders of seven Provincial Councils other than those of the North and the East, every one of those. The Northern Chief Minister never came before the Steering Committee; the Eastern Chief Minister never came before the Steering Committee. It was the other Chief Ministers and their respective Leaders of the Opposition who came. Every single proposal for devolution is a proposal that was made by the seven Chief Ministers and their Leaders of the Opposition, other than those of the North and East and all of those seven Provinces at that time were ruled by the UPFA, not by the UNP. These proposals on devolution that are contained are proposals by the UPFA Chief Ministers, not anybody else.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) So, what is the contention? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Exactly. I am asking you that question, Hon. Member. Why is your Leader then castigating these proposals that have been made by his own party members, who were Chief Minsters? Why is he saying that this will lead to the division of the country, that this will split the country into nine different parts? That is what we heard him say this morning. These are all your own proposals. And, why are you now saying that this will split the country into several parts? Why did you make those proposals? You have consistently-

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, what is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) I just want to remind the Hon. Member that the nature of politics is such that if you are in a position of power, everybody wants more power. Obviously, the Chief Ministers want more power.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) All right. Thank you for endorsing what I said. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Hon. Member, can I ask you a question? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, quickly without taking my time, please. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) No, they are democratic people. They allow anybody to talk unlike you all.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, without engaging in conversation, will you ask the question?

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) , , . , . . . , . . . , . There has to be a principle.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, I am not only asking questions from the UPFA, I am also asking questions from the Government, from your own Government, today.

We moved this very important Motion yesterday, and there were times at which all of the seats in the Government Benches were empty. There was no senior Minister present, the Front Row was always empty. There was not the Leader of the House, the Prime Minister -

( ) (The Hon. Kanchana Wijesekera) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, what is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Kanchana Wijesekera) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we have given our proposals to this Committee. As the Joint Opposition, we have given our proposals. The only party in this Parliament that has not given proposals to this Committee is the UNP. So, why do you not, having a very close relationship with the -

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That is not a point of Order, Hon. Member. Hon. Sumanthiran, you may continue.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is not a point of Order. You made your point. Thank you very much, Hon. Member.

I want to repeat what the Hon. (Dr.) Jayampathy Wickramaratne said yesterday in this House. When the Steering Committee Proposals were placed before the Constitutional Assembly, the Prime Minister emphatically stated, "These are our proposals." When we drafted the proposals, initially, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, the Tamil National Alliance and the United National Party did not make separate proposals because the main proposals were negotiated and agreed upon. I have all the Minutes of the meetings. All of those proposals were negotiated and agreed upon; nothing was not agreed upon. But, after having agreed upon those proposals, some parties, perhaps as the Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya said, for reasons of electoral politics said, We want to say our positions. So, democracy was such, they were all allowed to make those. After they made their positions, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna said, We also want to present ours. So, we also had to place our position and the TNA also placed it. But, the UNP said, We are not

509 510

budging from our original position, that this was a negotiated position and we will just stand by that. That is what they said. We were happy with that because it was, in fact, a negotiated position. It does not reflect the Tamil National Alliances position; it is far below the Tamil National Alliances position.

( ) (An Hon. Member) It was negotiated. .. ( .. ) The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, it was negotiated.

In fact, we were castigated. Today, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition mentioned my name three times and said various things. I was castigated by my own people when the proposals came, saying, How dare you shift your position? Why have you given this up? Why have you given that up? But, that was a negotiated position. We were all acting in unison to achieve consensus. You can never achieve consensus if each party stands in their own corner and says, "We cannot budge." The whole point of all of those meetings was that we talked, we discussed, we debated, we fought, but we agreed on all of those. All of those Minutes will bear out the fact that it was debated extensively, but it was agreed upon eventually. All of those were agreed. There were a few points at which there was variance, a very few, but those were not contentious issues. In point of fact, on devolution, there was no disagreement. The disagreement, if there were any, were on the abolition of the Executive Presidency and the electoral system-serious disagreements emerged. But on devolution, everybody was tripping over each other saying, Yes, yes, maximum possible devolution.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , 3 .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) 3 .

So, this is an important point that must be made. On every issue, every partys position is there. It is written; it is reflected in the Minutes. Even the UPFA's position - it was called the SLFPs position - is not adverse to devolution. I went through that in the morning. They agree on the substance of devolution.

In point of fact, I must record the fact that after the Second Interim Report, which includes a Draft, was presented to the Constitutional Assembly on the 11th of January, this year, we had a meeting with the President and the Prime Minister. The Hon. Rauff Hakeem was also

there at the meeting. The Hon. Sampanthan and I were there. There were a few people from the SLFP - none of them are here today - and senior Ministers and the Prime Minister from the UNP present. At that, we spoke and asked about the fate of this new Constitution. Three-and-a-half years we have spent in preparing this and even at that meeting, what emerged was disagreement with regard to abolition of the Executive Presidency and the electoral system. Then, the President said, But, on devolution, there is no disagreement. Why do we not do that? So, a four-Member Committee was appointed which included the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Hon. Dilan Perera and myself. We have given our proposal. All four of us have agreed on that, on what can be done on devolution. But, there is no movement forward. Today, in this House, it is the United National Party that is in Government. So, the responsibility is with you.

The Prime Minister constituted a Public Representation Committee in December, 2015. The Prime Minister became the Chairman of the Steering Committee that met over 80 times and have gone through this process and have brought two comprehensive Reports. The second one includes a Draft of the Constitution which was made by the Experts who were advisers to the Steering Committee. All ten of them agreeing, their dissentions, if any, were recorded. Only two of them had comment to say that the form in which it is drafted is not their own, but they agree with the contents and one other member said that she disagrees only on one point and that is, a dual citizen being disabled to contest an election for Parliament or Presidency. Her view is that even a dual citizen should be allowed to contest. Those are the only two disagreements. So, the Experts Committee consisting of ten members have given a Draft. Having done all of that, the Prime Minister comes to the Constitutional Assembly, presents it and says, This is not mine. This is not ours. Experts have given it. He did not take responsibility and on the criticism of that stand of the Prime Minister, I stand with the Leader of the Opposition. The Prime Minister chaired the Steering Committee, he steered this whole process and after all of that time, money, expertise, all of that had been spent, he says, The Experts have given it. Now, it is up to you and did not convene even one Steering Committee meeting thereafter. So, why did we go through this? Was this just a charade? - [Interruption.] No, I am asking them. Was this just a charade that you did to show the world that you are doing some Constitutional reform, you are being liberal, you are being accommodative that you are trying to forge a consensus? In fact, we forged a consensus; we arrived at a consensus. But, you are unwilling. You do not seem to have the courage to take forward the process that you initiated and that is our criticism of you.

The Hon. R. Sampanthan and I have participated in every single Steering Committee meeting. I missed only three meetings; he missed three meetings and in those three meetings, the other person was present. That was the dedication with which we participated. Those in the Steering Committee know how much accommodative we were, how we agreed on difficult questions because we

511 512

[ ..

2019 16

want this resolved. We want this age-old question resolved once and for all. We thought that only when the two main political parties are together, it is possible and that is why we gave it our all. Even if our parties have separated, it is still possible. This is a statesmen's effort; this is not a political project. This House, whichever side they be on, must obviously realize the calamity that has befallen this country because this is not resolved until today.

The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera listed quotations from leaders of all the political parties of this country, all saying the same thing, that power must be shared, power must be devolved and every citizen must be treated as equal. The Opposition Leader is saying, "I built roads; I have put up buildings". All that is good and welcome. But, that does not substitute for political power; material benefits to our people will never substitute political power in the hands of our people. That is what we are asking for. Is that too much to ask for? Is the majority people of this country saying, "No, political power will always be in our hands, and in our hands only. We will never share that power." Is that what the majority people of this country are saying? I do not think so. I do not think the Sinhala people, the Buddhist people are saying that. Their political masters want it in their power, in their hands. They want to hold on to that. But what is the result? For the people who are minority in numbers - I do not describe ourselves as minorities. We are not minorities in this country. We are smaller in number, but we are equals. To be equals, for us to exercise equal citizenship rights in this country, we must also have access to political power. Our people must be able to decide matters in the areas in which they live. That is what President Mahinda Rajapaksa said in July, 2006: "People in their localities must be able to decide their own fate". That is what he said; those are his words. He knew what he was saying then.

But now, he sang a totally different tune. I am very disappointed with the unstatesmanlike behaviour of the Leader of the Opposition today in this House, where he gave a very wrong picture of this whole process, a very wrong picture of the proposals that are before this House. I want to say most categorically that the proposals which emerged in January this year go not one inch beyond what he promised this country and what he promised the world, particularly with India. Why did he do that? Why did he go and made joint communiques with India? We did not tell him to do that. He did it saying that the Thirteenth Amendment will be fully implemented including land and police powers, which are there in the Thirteenth Amendment. Then, he went beyond, acknowledging that it is still not meaningful devolution and said, "But, we will build upon that so as to achieve meaningful devolution". Having said all of that, if he can now turn 180 degrees and castigate this process, raise a war cry, tell the Sinhala people now that this is going to divide the country, that is the most unstatesmanlike behavior that you can find. I regret that I had to use those words about the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, today. But, that is what he is doing.

We would still give our fullest cooperation. I want to say that here today even at the tail end of this Government or whatever. I do not know why people call it the tail

end; this Parliament has one more year. So, we will give it our fullest to complete this process because the future of this country depends on this process succeeding. Mark my words, the future of this country depends on this process succeeding. The Motion that has been moved by the Hon. Sampanthan says that very clearly. He raised that question, which was echoed by the Minister of Finance a little while ago.

What would be the future if we do not succeed in doing that? It would be disastrous, it would be worse than what we have ever seen before. This is not a threat, but anybody who knows the history can say that with confidence. Therefore, I urge the House, I urge the Government which is depleted today in their ranks, today also, showing scant respect for this process that they initiated, showing no importance at all - that is most disheartening - and the main Opposition, please come together and we will still continue to cooperate to achieve a social contract which is agreed to by all the different peoples of this country. So far, we do not have that social contract. That is a fundamental problem in this country. A Constitution is a social contract. It is not just a law; it is a social contract. A social contract must be agreed to by all the parties. We are willing to agree and we have shouted that from the rooftops that we are willing to agree. Even now we are agreeing. Our hand is still stretched out. Do not fail to grasp it because if you fail to grasp our hand of friendship, in the days to come, it will not be this hand that will be stretched towards you.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) . , !

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena got a mandate from the people to introduce a new Constitution to this country and subsequently at the Parliamentary Election, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe too pledged that there will be a new Constitution that they would introduce to the country. During the so-called 100-day Programme of governance, which extended to much more than 100 days, we managed to bring about the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution which reduced the powers of the Executive Presidency. This morning, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa took a dig at the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution and said that once they come to power, they will try to abolish the Executive Presidency altogether. Having enjoyed that Presidency for two terms, of course, he is interested in abolishing the Executive Presidency. Since we have done away with the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, he is certainly at a disadvantage that he cannot contest for the Executive Presidency himself. Therefore, there is a personal reason for the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa to abolish the Executive Presidency altogether. However, not only him, every political leader in this country has been talking about abolishing the Executive Presidency, but having come to office, they changed their mind. Even the current President did so. That is how we had to retain the Executive Presidency.

As far as the minorities are concerned, we were willing to go along with the national leaders in trying to introduce a new Constitution minus the Executive Presidency. But now, all those parties, both His Excellency the President as well as the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, for different reasons perhaps want the Executive Presidency abolished. Similarly, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too wishes that the Executive Presidency should be done away with, perhaps for some other reason. But then, we have to look at this issue holistically and differently.

I mentioned at the outset while I spoke a few words in Tamil that I have been in this House since 1994 and by next month, perhaps I will be completing almost 25 years in this House. My late leader, the Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff, was here since 1989 and he was here for twelve years, two terms, in this House. During those two terms, originally he served in the Mangala Moonesinghe Select Committee. Subsequently, when the G.L. Peiris Select Committee was formed, he became a Minister and he appointed me to be in that Select Committee. I had the privilege of working along with the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran and the Hon. R. Sampanthan in this Steering

Committee and I also had the privilege of working along with the late Hon. (Dr.) Neelan Tiruchelvam then. Similarly, at that time, Mr. G.L. Peiris efforts were being criticized as if that was a Constitution drafted by the Hon. (Dr.) Neelan Tiruchelvam. The same accusation is now levelled against my Friend, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, Presidents Counsel. Of course his leader, Annan Sampanthan, is spared that tag because they are sparing him. But, the Hon. Sumanthiran is being accused in the same way as the late Hon. (Dr.) Neelan Tiruchelvam was criticized when the so-called 1995-1997 and 2000 Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga Proposals were drafted and presented to this House. Similarly, the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Prime Minister, is being criticized today by the Tamil National Alliance for not being serious enough to bring to fruition the efforts that were put in by the Steering Committee to submit a complete Report, which finally ended up as an Expert Committees collection of opinions by various parties and that document is before us for us to discuss. That forms a long list of other documents which have been ad nauseam debated and discussed several times when it comes to the devolution debates in this country.

We have had the APRC proposals, the Expert Committee Proposals, the Mangala Moonesinghe Select Committee proposals, the Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga Proposals between 1995-1997 and finally, the Constitutional Bill in 2000. I remember, while my late leader, the Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff, was engaged in presenting those proposals, he spoke for almost three hours in this House. While he was speaking, we - Mr. M.M. Zuhair, Presidents Counsel and myself - were away in another room discussing with the Hon. R. Sampanthan and other TNA leaders, trying to patch up our differences, to bring in amendments so that we could make the 2000 Proposals a complete one and the Tamil and Muslim people could have substantial devolution in the periphery through the provincial council system.

However, the issue relating to the unit of devolution was very contentious, but the Proposals fell through for a different reason. At that time, the United National Party leadership sabotaged the possibility of that coming into fruition since he packed off some of the United National Party Members to Singapore. That is how the fate of the 2000 Constitution came to an end. The Hon. Sithadthan is here. He was also part of that Parliament at that time when all the drama was enacted in the House. Therefore, the sincerity of political leaders in this House is in question whether they are - [Interruption.] The Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara is claiming that 80 per cent of the electoral defeat is attributed to that Singapore trip.

Anyway, let us forget about all those episodes. Now, we are at the crossroads of the history in this country. My community, particularly after the April 21st bombings in the country, is at a different juncture. Every community has gone through the difficulties of having to face violence. A misdirected, misguided cult, for no political reason, for the first time, has engaged in a horrendous terrorist attack which has now brought into focus the existential threats to a beleaguered community such as ours. We have faced this in the past. We have faced

515 516

2019 16

violence at the hands of the State and at the hands of the Tamil militants, but for the first time, we are now facing atrocities by mobs for the reason that we ourselves were being seen as the perpetrators. So, it has come to a stage where we have got to re-examine the social fabric of the country to find solutions through a democratic process rather than resorting to violence. We condemned what has happened on the 21st of April. That was absolutely for no tangible political reason, but for some warped ideology which no one could understand. We are still looking as to why this had happened, but of course, our community is engaged in a very serious introspection, but others must stop trying to impose solutions from outside. We are voluntarily looking at what has gone wrong, where things have gone wrong and are attempting to do this exercise in all sincerity since we are confident that the cult which engaged in this exercise had absolutely no political motives though they may have tried to attribute some motives. But, the entire community has dismissed those and unfortunately, we are all demonized for something for which we, as a community, were not responsible for.

However, at this important juncture, it is incumbent on all of us to revisit this issue of devolution in the country for the reason that political leaders have been very deceptive, have never been sincere though we, minority parties, have taken a very sincere approach and have compromised as much as possible in trying to achieve a final consensus.

I feel this document has several important suggestions. We are suggesting various important new structures. For instance, a Senate, an Upper House for this Chamber, a Second Chamber is being proposed. That would bring a nexus between the provinces and the Parliament and that is a very good exercise.

We would also like to mention about the need of this. We have very diligently, very carefully had looked at various different issues. One is the question of the State. Since the unitary concept was seen as something that was inhibiting proper devolution, the Sinhala Buddhist majority has been too emotionally involved with the " " concept. So, we were prepared to go along with the fact of having that mentioned in Sinhala itself in the formulation of the provision of the Constitution talking about the State and its structure. We said that " " and means a State which is undivided and indivisible and in which the power to amend the Constitution or to repeal and replace the Constitution shall remain with the Legislature and the people of Sri Lanka, as provided in the Constitution. What is wrong in this, Sir? So, this ensures that unless this House with a two-thirds majority and the people voting at a Referendum, nobody could change even a letter. I am talking about the entrenched provisions of the Constitution. Therefore, it escapes our reason why we should insist on having this convoluted provision relating to a Unitary State, which is impinging on a proper devolution, being exercised in the country. The Thirteenth Amendment gives by one hand and sometimes, the Supreme Court interferes and destroys everything.

Now, look at the court structure. The young Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya is over there. He must understand that

the court structure undergoes some substantive and progressive changes. We are going to introduce, for the first time, a Constitutional Court which will be formed and which will sit side by side with the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court will remain the highest court of record, which will do away with the original jurisdiction of fundamental rights. The fundamental rights will be moved on to the Court of Appeal and there will be a right of appeal to the Supreme Court, which is a better thing. Then, we will have a Appeal Court with 45 judges, who will sit in sessions in the provinces. So, the common man will not have to come all the way to Colombo to spend his hard-earned money in trying to retain lawyers in Colombo.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya? ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Thank you, Hon. Minister, for giving way. If I may ask you, Hon. Minister, is there a necessity to change the word or not include the word Unitary itself? We do not want the Sinhalese word. We want the English word Unitary" in the English draft.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Perhaps, you did not listen to the way that the thing has been formulated. Your fear is, the country will be divided and there will be separation. That is why the Sinhala majority in the country wants to retain the word Unitary, for that purpose. That is being very carefully explained in detail by saying what that means. " " and means "a State which is undivided and indivisible and in which the power to amend the Constitution or to repeal and replace the Constitution shall remain with the Legislature and the people of Sri Lanka, as provided for in the Constitution". That has been repeated ad nauseum by the Hon. Sampanthan everywhere. Last time, when he went to Matara, too, he said this to explain. What is happening is, the Sinhala leaders in this country are so obnoxious; they are just clinging on to some emotions and sentiments and are allowing the inhibition as far as devolution is concerned. One of your own Chief Ministers, Mr. Mahiepala Herath from Kegalle, came before us and told us that he wants more devolution. What is happening is, proper devolution cannot be exercised with a unitary Constitution. That is the difficulty. You do not want federalism. Then, at least, take this word out so that proper devolution could be exercised at the periphery.

So, we talk about the principle of subsidiarity. Now, we have, for the first time, in the Constitution brought in the local government structures also. The local government, for the first time, is going to be part of the constitutional tier.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we are talking about the progressive changes that the new proposals have embodied in order to make a new Constitution for the country. In that effort, several years have been spent. As I mentioned to you, my party has been involving in this exercise for the last 30 years in this Chamber and outside. I must salute my late leader, the Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff. We used to have hours and hours of discussions in his house and outside with the Tamil National Alliance, the then TULF and with late Hon. Murugesu Sivasithamparam, who was one of the former leaders of the Tamil United Liberation Front. We were trying to iron out the differences we had between ourselves. We still have other differences at the peripheral level.

In fact, this morning, the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah also spoke to me. The Hon. H.M.M. Harees is also here. We are trying to resolve the administrative issue of Kalmunai Tamil DS Division. So, we have to find a compromise to resolve these issues at the local level and that will help us to resolve our problems at the national level. We, as Tamil-speaking communities, must act together in trying to bring in a substantial devolution arrangement which can be enjoyed by everyone, not just for ourselves, The Chief Ministers of Sinhalese majority provinces, seven of them, came before us and all of them wanted more devolution, all of them wanted the Governors powers reduced. Whenever the Governors are from the same party, they are very passive. But, when you have a Governor from another party, he becomes very hostile. That is the experience. So, the Governor hangs on to all the financial powers. He has to give assent to all the legislation that would be passed. Of course, the legislative work in the provinces is not even just 5 per cent today because the Centre does not part with power. This is why we want the word unitary removed so that this subsidiarity principle could properly be exercised, not for any other reason. Forget the passion, the fear, the phobia about separation and division in the country. All that was there during the LTTEs struggle and the arms struggle of the Tamils..

Now, we are talking about a post-armed struggle period in which we have to look at the problems of the periphery, not just the minorities, but the Sinhalese

themselves who want more power. In order to enjoy that power, a few progressive changes are being suggested.

We formed a Constitutional Council. That again was tinkered with by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Members because they came in and then, the division between the UPFA in Parliament happened. During the initial period, the President became the Leader of the SLFP.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please, Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Tharaka Balasuirya to the Chair?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, I propose that the Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya do now take the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana) . . Seconded.

. . Question put, and agreed to. .

Whereupon THE HON. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. THARAKA BALASURIYA took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Please continue, Hon. Rauff Hakeem. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Presiding Member, I am glad that you are presiding. Your father, Dr. Jagath Balasuriya, was my Colleague when I entered this House and now, I am glad to be speaking while you are in the Chair. He was also somebody who made very enlightened speeches in this House on the subject of devolution.

Now, let us talk about the problems that arose as a result of the divisions in the UPFA. The United Peoples Freedom Alliance became divided and that has now resulted in the so-called "Pohottuwa" Party or whatever name it is, your party, Sir.

( ) (An Hon. Member) The SLPP.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The SLPP has now virtually come in to stay and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party is functioning on its own, and now, there are talks going on between these two factions. Because of this factionalism, this exercise of the Steering Committee too got embroiled in it and we were unable to resolve some of the issues. Even the goals that we are trying to achieve got messed up.

Ultimately, even the Constitutional Council - we thought we will make it a Council with a little more representation from the civil society - ended up having seven Parliamentarians in it. However, the Council is functioning and that has brought in some salutary changes. But, that was not what was originally intended. Similarly, several other changes were made. One particular difficulty we had was abolishing the Executive Presidency which became difficult.

Now, I must come to the final point about the electoral reforms. I am not in agreement with the suggestions that have been made in this document. This mixed system is impractical, seriously flawed and is going to be seriously harmful for the minorities and I have been fighting about that. We have now experienced it at the Local Government Elections and we see what a mess the local government system is. By the next budget at the end of this year, I think almost all the Chairmen will find it difficult. They may have to go and fall at the feet of every member in order to get the budget passed. It is going to be so difficult; it has become such a mess, a right royal mess.

Similarly, we brought in some changes to the provincial council system. I opposed it tooth and nail. Finally, all kinds of assurances were given to us, we supported it and now, that has gone into limbo. I would urge even at this late hour, let us reintroduce the old system, go back to the old system so that we can have the Provincial Council Elections early. Of course, both the main Opposition as well as the United National Party do not want to have the Provincial Council Elections ahead of the Presidential Election. So, be it; it does not matter. But, let us at least introduce the old system so that soon after the Presidential Election, we will have the Provincial Council Elections and install the provincial administration in those provinces. Sir, your own leader, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, this morning lamented the fact that none of the provinces are having their administrations in place.

So, it is in our interest to install this provincial administration as quickly as possible, at least, to enjoy the limited powers they are enjoying through the Thirteenth Amendment. For it to be established, we have to have the old electoral system in place. What we have introduced is a stillborn baby. The Minister himself voted against the Delimitation Committee Report. That is the comedy of errors that we witnessed in this House. The Minister who brought the Amendments and presented the Delimitation Report himself voted against it. The entire House rejected it. So, I think it is time that we ditch the whole system and then go back to the old system.

With those words, Sir, I would urge that this duplicitous conduct by political leaders must come to an end. Minorities should not be hoodwinked in this manner. It is high time that we act. Progressive efforts had been made for the last 30 years. Several documents are before us. This, the Experts Report, is the latest document that had been compiled together taking into consideration all the suggestions made by several parties and this again, has several progressive features. Let us put them all together, try and address this issue of minority grievances in earnest and solve this once and for all, at least, when the next Government is in place.

Thank you.

[4.33p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Hon. Presiding Member, at the outset, let me thank you for giving me six minutes of the time of this House to speak on this important Adjournment Motion.

555 556

[

2019 16

Sir, many political leaders had stated the need for constitutional reforms in Sri Lanka, primarily due to two reasons: one is to provide a structured solution for the grievances of the majority Tamil population in the North of Sri Lanka, and two is due to the belief that inadequacies of the present Constitution are beyond repair, so it is better served that a new constitution is brought forward altogether.

I do feel, Sir, when we do address the two above-mentioned questions; we should not jumble our answers. The two questions require two different sets of thoughts though not necessarily mutually exclusive. On the question of Tamil aspirations, I have no issue in recognizing that the North of Sri Lanka has at least been the homeland of the Sri Lankan Tamils for a reasonable period in the past and as such they should be entitled to look after matters of interest to them, provided in doing so the other communities rights are not subjugated. It is also reasonable that the Tamil politicians appease the Sinhala majoritys fear that after a 30-year war whatever solution is provided constitutionally will not lead to a separate State in the future. So a Federal solution which provided irrevocable transfer of power from the centre to the periphery might not be the best solution. And furthermore, administratively imposing a principle of subsidiarity can lead to further inefficiencies and higher levels of corruption.

A Federal solution - be it may, by whatever the name it is presented - would constitute a transformation of power, which cannot be taken or interfered by the central government without the consent of the regional governments. And however much things may go wrong in a region or in a province, not necessarily in the North, but let us say administrative-wise in the South or with the rise of a new extremism in the East, the centre will have limited powers or no powers to interfere at all. Imagine for instance if the proposed new constitution, which the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran says is a draft and the Hon. Prime Minister denies it is a draft, had been in place before the April 21st Easter attacks, how well would have the search operations been carried with a separate police chief operating under a chief minister? I know I might be corrected in saying that technically the provincial police chief would be under the Independent Commission and we all know how well that has worked out for the rest of the country.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) .

In any event, an irrevocable solution is not the answer. If we look at our 70-year post-independence history, you will see that we have erred too often when it comes to matters of new constitution and therefore, there is no saying this constitution will work. The authors of the

Nineteenth Amendment now admit the deficiencies of that Amendment. So, Sir, why should we trust the same authors to write a new irrevocable constitution?

Now addressing the contention that a new constitution is needed due to the belief that inadequacies of the present Constitution are beyond repair, I am not sure that that is actually the case. Indias Constitution has been amended many a times. And also, Sir, when we are thinking of a new constitution, we must be mindful of the timing of introducing such a constitution. The geopolitics of Asia has forced many Asian countries to introduce federal constitutions with devastating consequences. Therefore, Sir, if we do introduce a new constitution we should introduce one which works for the whole country and not just answer the question of Tamil aspirations.

Now, I also want to take this time, Sir, to comment on certain remarks that the former Hon. Leader of the Opposition, Hon. R. Sampanthan made in his speech. The Hon. R. Sampanthan attempted to point out that the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, at various times had committed to provide a solution on the question of devolution of power and now he has gone back on his word, and as if it is Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksas fault that the constitutional process has broken down. I want to categorically state that we are in favour of power devolution and that is why we as the Joint Opposition spelt out our position and forwarded a proposal to the Steering Committee. The Hon. R. Sampanthan however does not make mention in his speech that his constituent ally, and the majority partner of the former coalition government, and his friend, the Hon. Prime Minister, who ensured that the Hon. R. Sampanthan was made the Leader of the Opposition, had not given any proposal to the Steering Committee. And in any case, the Hon. Sampanthan forgets his principal ally, the Y ahapalana Government, which the TNA took the unprecedented move to support at each and every Budget and which the TNA supported at each and every No-confidence Motion brought against the Prime Minister and the Government and in which the TNA colluded with the Government to postpone the Provincial Council Elections and deprive the people of their due franchise, a right given to the people in the North after many years by the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa who already had a two-thirds majority. The Government for which you acted as a proxy for years had a two-thirds majority. Therefore, your accusations against Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa are irrelevant.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. Please wind up your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Sir, just give me one more minute, please.

The Hon. Prime Minister had the numbers in Parliament and he could have pushed through with the Constitutional reforms. But, he did not do it. At least the

557 558

Government could have come out with a Draft Constitution. But, they did not even do that. And whose fault is that? So, I think, it is fair to say that the Hon. Sampanthan should accept that he had been led down the garden path by the Hon. Prime Minister and in trusting the Prime Minister, the Hon. Sampanthan has failed to deliver what was promised to his people. Perhaps that is why the Prime Minister has been kind to allow the Hon. Sampanthan retain the residence of the Leader of the Opposition and use the vehicles as a solace during the winter of his life. So, I hope that the Government will put forward at least the Draft Constitution and we have stated our position and we want to provide our support to the devolution provided that it is within the framework of a unitary country and not within a federal solution.
