Mahinda Rajapaksa, who spoke this morning in this House because this gives me an opportunity to put many matters straight. The former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in the course of his speech stated many things. He referred to the discussions that the Tamil National Alliance had with his Government in 2011 and stated that it was we who walked out of that meeting. That is furthest from the truth. We met, for the first time, on the 10th of January, 2011, met 18 times and the 18th meeting was on the 16th of December, 2011. In between, once in August, we refused to meet further and that was because at the first meeting, the second meeting and the third meeting, we gave proposals from our side as to what we thought should be the contours of a political solution. The Government delegation was led by the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka. It included the Hon. Nimal Siripala De Silva, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris and the Hon. Sajin de Vass Gunawardena. Subsequently, the Hon. Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka withdrew from that Committee and was replaced by the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha. Although we gave our proposals, the Government, having repeatedly assured us that they would respond to our proposals, failed to do that for several meetings and",

Only if you cannot do it at that level, you go to the next higher level. That was agreed. It is on that basis that a three-tiered system was devised in this proposal at the local level, yes, at the provincial level and at the Centre. The Centre has a lot of powers and it did not give up most of its powers, but there was a proposal to give to the provinces substantial exercise of legislative and Executive power so that people who are smaller in numbers, when you take the country as a whole, at least in the areas in which they are a majority can determine their affairs, but not the foreign policy, not the monetary policy and not the defence of Sri Lanka, none of those. All of that will be retained in the Centre. But, with regard to matters that affect the day-to-day lives, decisions will be taken in the provinces. People in the provinces are asking, Why should decisions about our daily lives be taken in Colombo? In fact, all of the proposals on devolution that are contained in the Report, which has a draft, are proposals that are endorsed by the Chief Ministers and Opposition Leaders of seven Provincial Councils other than those of the North and the East, every one of those. The Northern Chief Minister never came before the Steering Committee; the Eastern Chief Minister never came before the Steering Committee. It was the other Chief Ministers and their respective Leaders of the Opposition who came. Every single proposal for devolution is a proposal that was made by the seven Chief Ministers and their Leaders of the Opposition, other than those of the North and East and all of those seven Provinces at that time were ruled by the UPFA, not by the UNP.

I have all the Minutes of the meetings. All of those proposals were negotiated and agreed upon; nothing was not agreed upon. But, after having agreed upon those proposals, some parties, perhaps as the Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya said, for reasons of electoral politics said, We want to say our positions. So, democracy was such, they were all allowed to make those. After they made their positions, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna said, We also want to present ours.

Only two of them had comment to say that the form in which it is drafted is not their own, but they agree with the contents and one other member said that she disagrees only on one point and that is, a dual citizen being disabled to contest an election for Parliament or Presidency. Her view is that even a dual citizen should be allowed to contest. Those are the only two disagreements. So, the Experts Committee consisting of ten members have given a Draft. Having done all of that, the Prime Minister comes to the Constitutional Assembly, presents it and says, This is not mine. This is not ours. Experts have given it. He did not take responsibility and on the criticism of that stand of the Prime Minister, I stand with the Leader of the Opposition. The Prime Minister chaired the Steering Committee, he steered this whole process and after all of that time, money, expertise, all of that had been spent, he says, The Experts have given it. Now, it is up to you and did not convene even one Steering Committee meeting thereafter. So, why did we go through this? Was this just a charade? - [Interruption.] No, I am asking them.

Mangala Samaraweera listed quotations from leaders of all the political parties of this country, all saying the same thing, that power must be shared, power must be devolved and every citizen must be treated as equal.

But, that does not substitute for political power; material benefits to our people will never substitute political power in the hands of our people. That is what we are asking for. Is that too much to ask for? Is the majority people of this country saying, \"No, political power will always be in our hands, and in our hands only. We will never share that power.\" Is that what the majority people of this country are saying? I do not think so. I do not think the Sinhala people, the Buddhist people are saying that. Their political masters want it in their power, in their hands. They want to hold on to that. But what is the result? For the people who are minority in numbers - I do not describe ourselves as minorities. We are not minorities in this country. We are smaller in number, but we are equals. To be equals, for us to exercise equal citizenship rights in this country, we must also have access to political power. Our people must be able to decide matters in the areas in which they live. That is what President Mahinda Rajapaksa said in July, 2006: \"People in their localities must be able to decide their own fate\". That is what he said; those are his words. He knew what he was saying then.",

I want to say most categorically that the proposals which emerged in January this year go not one inch beyond what he promised this country and what he promised the world, particularly with India. Why did he do that? Why did he go and made joint communiques with India? We did not tell him to do that. He did it saying that the Thirteenth Amendment will be fully implemented including land and police powers, which are there in the Thirteenth Amendment. Then, he went beyond, acknowledging that it is still not meaningful devolution and said, \"But, we will build upon that so as to achieve meaningful devolution\". Having said all of that, if he can now turn 180 degrees and castigate this process, raise a war cry, tell the Sinhala people now that this is going to divide the country, that is the most unstatesmanlike behavior that you can find. I regret that I had to use those words about the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, today. But, that is what he is doing.",

During the so-called 100-day Programme of governance, which extended to much more than 100 days, we managed to bring about the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution which reduced the powers of the Executive Presidency. This morning, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa took a dig at the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution and said that once they come to power, they will try to abolish the Executive Presidency altogether. Having enjoyed that Presidency for two terms, of course, he is interested in abolishing the Executive Presidency. Since we have done away with the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, he is certainly at a disadvantage that he cannot contest for the Executive Presidency himself. Therefore, there is a personal reason for the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa to abolish the Executive Presidency altogether. However, not only him, every political leader in this country has been talking about abolishing the Executive Presidency, but having come to office, they changed their mind. Even the current President did so. That is how we had to retain the Executive Presidency.",

    "text": "We would also like to mention about the need of this. We have very diligently, very carefully had looked at various different issues. One is the question of the State. Since the unitary concept was seen as something that was inhibiting proper devolution, the Sinhala Buddhist majority has been too emotionally involved with the \" \" concept. So, we were prepared to go along with the fact of having that mentioned in Sinhala itself in the formulation of the provision of the Constitution talking about the State and its structure. We said that \" \" and means a State which is undivided and indivisible and in which the power to amend the Constitution or to repeal and replace the Constitution shall remain with the Legislature and the people of Sri Lanka, as provided in the Constitution. What is wrong in this, Sir? So, this ensures that unless this House with a two-thirds majority and the people voting at a Referendum, nobody could change even a letter. I am talking about the entrenched provisions of the Constitution. Therefore, it escapes our reason why we should insist on having this convoluted provision relating to a Unitary State, which is impinging on a proper devolution, being exercised in the country. The Thirteenth Amendment gives by one hand and sometimes, the Supreme Court interferes and destroys everything.",

That has been repeated ad nauseum by the Hon. Sampanthan everywhere. Last time, when he went to Matara, too, he said this to explain. What is happening is, the Sinhala leaders in this country are so obnoxious; they are just clinging on to some emotions and sentiments and are allowing the inhibition as far as devolution is concerned. One of your own Chief Ministers, Mr. Mahiepala Herath from Kegalle, came before us and told us that he wants more devolution. What is happening is, proper devolution cannot be exercised with a unitary Constitution. That is the difficulty. You do not want federalism.

We, as Tamil-speaking communities, must act together in trying to bring in a substantial devolution arrangement which can be enjoyed by everyone, not just for ourselves, The Chief Ministers of Sinhalese majority provinces, seven of them, came before us and all of them wanted more devolution, all of them wanted the Governors powers reduced. Whenever the Governors are from the same party, they are very passive. But, when you have a Governor from another party, he becomes very hostile. That is the experience. So, the Governor hangs on to all the financial powers. He has to give assent to all the legislation that would be passed. Of course, the legislative work in the provinces is not even just 5 per cent today because the Centre does not part with power. This is why we want the word unitary removed so that this subsidiarity principle could properly be exercised, not for any other reason. Forget the passion, the fear, the phobia about separation and division in the country. All that was there during the LTTEs struggle and the arms struggle of the Tamils..",

One particular difficulty we had was abolishing the Executive Presidency which became difficult.",

By the next budget at the end of this year, I think almost all the Chairmen will find it difficult. They may have to go and fall at the feet of every member in order to get the budget passed.

Finally, all kinds of assurances were given to us, we supported it and now, that has gone into limbo. I would urge even at this late hour, let us reintroduce the old system, go back to the old system so that we can have the Provincial Council Elections early. Of course, both the main Opposition as well as the United National Party do not want to have the Provincial Council Elections ahead of the Presidential Election. So, be it; it does not matter. But, let us at least introduce the old system so that soon after the Presidential Election, we will have the Provincial Council Elections and install the provincial administration in those provinces. Sir, your own leader, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, this morning lamented the fact that none of the provinces are having their administrations in place.",

That is the comedy of errors that we witnessed in this House. The Minister who brought the Amendments and presented the Delimitation Report himself voted against it. The entire House rejected it.

This, the Experts Report, is the latest document that had been compiled together taking into consideration all the suggestions made by several parties and this again, has several progressive features.

The two questions require two different sets of thoughts though not necessarily mutually exclusive. On the question of Tamil aspirations, I have no issue in recognizing that the North of Sri Lanka has at least been the homeland of the Sri Lankan Tamils for a reasonable period in the past and as such they should be entitled to look after matters of interest to them, provided in doing so the other communities rights are not subjugated. It is also reasonable that the Tamil politicians appease the Sinhala majoritys fear that after a 30-year war whatever solution is provided constitutionally will not lead to a separate State in the future. So a Federal solution which provided irrevocable transfer of power from the centre to the periphery might not be the best solution. And furthermore, administratively imposing a principle of subsidiarity can lead to further inefficiencies and higher levels of corruption.",

And however much things may go wrong in a region or in a province, not necessarily in the North, but let us say administrative-wise in the South or with the rise of a new extremism in the East, the centre will have limited powers or no powers to interfere at all. Imagine for instance if the proposed new constitution, which the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran says is a draft and the Hon. Prime Minister denies it is a draft, had been in place before the April 21st Easter attacks, how well would have the search operations been carried with a separate police chief operating under a chief minister? I know I might be corrected in saying that technically the provincial police chief would be under the Independent Commission and we all know how well that has worked out for the rest of the country.",

I want to categorically state that we are in favour of power devolution and that is why we as the Joint Opposition spelt out our position and forwarded a proposal to the Steering Committee. The Hon. R. Sampanthan however does not make mention in his speech that his constituent ally, and the majority partner of the former coalition government, and his friend, the Hon. Prime Minister, who ensured that the Hon. R. Sampanthan was made the Leader of the Opposition, had not given any proposal to the Steering Committee. And in any case, the Hon. Sampanthan forgets his principal ally, the Y ahapalana Government, which the TNA took the unprecedented move to support at each and every Budget and which the TNA supported at each and every No-confidence Motion brought against the Prime Minister and the Government and in which the TNA colluded with the Government to postpone the Provincial Council Elections and deprive the people of their due franchise, a right given to the people in the North after many years by the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa who already had a two-thirds majority. The Government for which you acted as a proxy for years had a two-thirds majority. Therefore, your accusations against Hon.
