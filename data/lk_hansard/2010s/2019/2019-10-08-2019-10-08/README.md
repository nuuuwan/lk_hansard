/!, N& + TU 5/7  * ! VIOLATION OF ORDER MADE BY MAGISTRATE'S COURT, MULLAITIVU F9 9%% (< =  P) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Mr. Speaker, I wish to raise the following Question of urgent and utmost public importance under Standing Order 27(2).

There is an ancient Hindu Temple called "Neeraviyadi Pillaiyaar Kovil" at a place called Semmalai in the Mullaitivu District. A Buddhist Vihara called "Gurukanda Rajamaha Vihara" was forcibly constructed between 2004 and 2009 when no civilian was permitted to go to that area. In the precincts of this temple and more recently, an attempt was made to restore that Buddhist Vihara. This led to unrest between the people living in that area, all of whom are non-Buddhist, and the monks who had by then come into occupation. Upon this matter being reported to the learned Magistrate of Mullaitivu, an Order was made prohibiting the reconstruction of the Vihara. The Chief Priest of the Vihara filed an Application for Revision in the provincial High Court of the Northern Province sitting in Vavuniya, which matter is still pending.

In the meantime, on or about 21st of September, 2019, the Chief Priest of Gurukanda Rajamaha Vihara passed

away in Colombo after taking ill. The Mullaitivu Police has filed an Information in the Magistrate's Court, Mullaitivu stating, inter alia, that:

(a) a police complaint had been filed by the administrative body of the Neeraviyadi Pillaiyaar Temple stating that the Chief Priest of the Gurukanda Rajamaha Viharaya, at that time, had passed away; and

(b) in the event that the body of the said Chief Priest was brought to the premises in dispute, being the premises on which both the Hindu kovil and the Buddhist temple were located, it could result in a breach of the peace in the area.

The learned Magistrate thereupon made an Order on 21st September, 2019;

(a) that the above-mentioned complainants and the present Chief Priest of the above-mentioned Buddhist temple be present in Court on 23rd September, 2019; and

(b) that the body of above-mentioned deceased Chief Priest should not be cremated or buried in the said premises in dispute until an appropriate final order was granted in the matter.

When the matter was taken up in Court on 23rd September, 2019, the Counsel for the Maritimepattu Pradeshiya Sabha stated that steps had been taken for the cremation of the said body without obtaining necessary permission in terms of the Cemeteries and Burial Grounds Ordinance.

The Counsel appearing for the Buddhist Vihara informed the Court that they were willing to conduct the cremation ceremony at an alternate location and the administrative body of the above-mentioned Hindu temple was agreeable to this. Accordingly, the Court made an Order of consent that the said cremation be not conducted at the premises in dispute and instead be conducted in the alternate location.

After the Order was made, a group of monks led by Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thero took the body of the deceased Chief Priest to the very place where the Order of the Magistrate prohibited them from cremating and proceeded to cremate the body despite protest by a large number of people of the area who had gathered in that area. A fracas ensued, during which the priest of the above-mentioned Hindu temple was severely injured. A lawyer appearing for the administrative body of the Hindu temple was also assaulted. The police led by the SSP were present during this entire incident. They did nothing to prevent the monks and others violating the said Order of Court and only prevented members of the Hindu community who were present during the incident from entering the premises in dispute.

Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thero was sentenced for a six-year incarceration for contempt of court in case bearing No. CA (CC) Application 04/2016. He was purportedly pardoned by the President on or about 23rd of May, 2019. He had additionally been found

guilty by the learned Magistrate of Homagama in case bearing No. 11309 by a Judgment dated 24th of May, 2018 for, inter alia, threatening the complainant, wife of a disappeared journalist by the name Prageeth Eknaligoda in open court. He had appealed to the High Court bearing Case No. Appeal 28/2018. The said Appeal was expeditiously concluded and his sentence was suspended. Thereafter, the complainant appealed to the Supreme Court in case bearing No. SC/SPL/LA/ 89/19, which is now pending.

I wish to urge the Government to take immediate steps to bring the culprits who violated the Court Order to book. This must include the police officers who failed, not only to enforce the Court Order, but also facilitated in the process of its violation.

Sir, I wrote to His Excellency the President on 27th September, 2019. I sent him a letter detailing all these facts. I wish to table* that letter and request that it be included in the Hansard at the end of my speech.

You will see, Sir, that in this instance, some Buddhist monks have violated an Order of Court. They have entered a Hindu temple and premises, desecrated the temple by an act of sacrilege and behaved in a most unworthy manner, unworthy as per the practices and the teachings of the Lord Buddha, whom you all venerate and hold in great adoration.

The Government, though the incident happened two weeks ago, has thus far failed to take any action whatsoever in regard to this matter. What is most astounding and thoroughly unacceptable is that the police have been remaining quiet and silent not merely when the incident occurred. When the incident occurred, they were physically present. With an SSP and a number of police officers being there, they did not prevent the Court Order being violated; they did not prevent the monks and their group of people behaving in this utterly unacceptable manner. They merely prevented the Hindu Tamil civilians who live in that area from entering the temple in order to facilitate the commission of this offence by the persons who were engaged in such activity.

This is an unacceptable situation, Sir, calling for very stringent action. The purpose of raising my Question today is to urge the Government not to delay action any further, not to behave in an irresponsible manner, but to take necessary action to bring all the offenders to book for desecrating the temple, violating the Court Order and not preventing this incident from happening.

I thank you, Sir.
