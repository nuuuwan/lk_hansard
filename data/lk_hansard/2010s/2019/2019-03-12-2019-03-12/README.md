Rauff Hakeem) Only solution for this is to go for common service corridors. That, as a policy, we must accept. Otherwise every utility will be digging up roads. So, if we have common service corridors -[Interruption.] Yes, before the roads are built, we must have common service corridors. This is what is happening in Singapore and other places. What we are doing is the other way around. Every utility is going and digging up the roads.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) This is the problem that exists, Hon. Deputy Speaker. The common corridors -

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Not only that. The RDA is charging heavy amounts to repair the roads. So, none of the utilities can afford the rates they are charging .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, out of the four Ministries that we spoke of, you and I constitute two of them. We will get together and ensure that there is a policy on this. These have been spoken for many years, but we see only the negative aspects of it. We are spending monies on just filling the potholes and not getting the main job done. So I think, it is a step in the right direction. These are the biggest problems that we have. Otherwise, we will be talking - even when we are in 2025 - of a pothole that remains due to lack of visionary approach by politicians who have been there. All of them are thoroughly convinced by the officials who come and say, If you do this, the ramifications are such that you will have to pay more in the future. But, unwittingly we have spent ten times more than what was said.

I will just mention this in passing, Sir, so that we will be able to take cognizance of the ability to develop this. While land availability in and around the Port of Colombo is very limited, and therefore, restrictive in its ability to expand marine engineering facilities, which is much needed, expansion of the existing breakwater in Phase II of the original Colombo Port expansion will allow the construction of a custom LNG bunkering facility in a compliant and easily accessible location of the West of the port entrance, to have a quick phase extension to the existing piers that are there, where the LNG storing and the bunkering facility could be easily brought in.

Phase II was originally expected to be constructed in 2025 in terms of the SLPA's long-term development plan. The advantage of rapid expansion will serve several purposes. The first is to fulfil the future SLPA development plans and the second is to expand the deep-water berthing facility of SLPA which is fast becoming important within this region. If you want to take advantage of the development that is taking place, this is the best way to attract those shipping lines that are there. Permitting unique ports in the future, by expansion of ECT-SAGT to become potentially the worlds longest back to back deep water terminal position, to the Port of Colombo, it will be the major relay port when transhipment volumes are going to decline thus positioning the Port of Colombo to become one of the first ports to globally offer LNG bunkering facility. So, I guess these are the situations that are necessary in order to get things moving.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. Rauff Hakeem. You have 15 minutes.

[11.20a.m] ( , ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning, Water Supply and Higher Education) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am glad to follow the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and our former President.

May I, at the very outset, congratulate our able Minister of Finance, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera and the State Minister of Finance, the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne, for having produced a Budget, regarding which the Opposition is only able to make a few cynical comments about the welfare measures, salary increases and the general tenure of the Budget Proposals rather than having any substantial criticism about the entire content of the Budget.

In this regard, Sir, may I be permitted to say that with the political coup that took place on the 26th of October, 2018 and the resultant chaos that it created, we were faced with the danger of many international rating agencies downgrading Sri Lankas capacity. With such a Damocles' sword hanging over our necks, we were able to produce a Budget which was replete with a variety of social security measures, increasing the social security net to protect the underprivileged and the poor as well as to provide increases to public servants salaries, increases in pensions, the allowances to armed forces and payments to differently-abled persons, provide free milk to rural students, housing loans to newly married couples, soft loans to higher education scholarships to Ivy League universities and payment of fees for students to enter private universities as well. We must note that almost 24 per cent of allocations in this Budget has gone towards education, health and infrastructure development.

With all these measures being introduced, we must understand that we have managed to produce such a Budget with a large external debt stock that needs to be serviced. So, in this regard, it is very pertinent, Sir, to note there are certain things that have to take note of, if we are to maintain fiscal consolidation and to stabilize the macroeconomic position of the country.

In this regard, I believe it is pertinent for me to refer to a question that was raised by the Hon. Anura Dissanayake when the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, the former Minister of Finance, was speaking. It relates to the issue of international sovereign bonds. That was started in 2007. For the past decade or more, we have been resorting to this mode of floating international sovereign bonds and the other variety which is called the foreign currency term financing facility. We talk about China, India and various others. There was an interesting article by the current Executive Director of the Institute of Policy Studies, Dr. (Ms.) Dushni Weerakoon. She talks about the entire loan portfolio of the Chinese, that it is about 14 per cent and similarly, the portfolio that belongs to the Indians is also 14 per cent, whereas our external borrowing through the international sovereign bonds and the foreign currency term financing facility is in the region of almost 33 per cent or more.

I am sure the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne will be able to correct me if I am wrong. This mode of financing, what we have to bear in mind when we borrow from the international financial markets where the lending rate is higher and the repayment period is shorter when compared to the bilateral loan portfolios is that we are indeed putting our macroeconomic fundamentals in a wrong-footing. Therefore, we need to be very careful. Though the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa was very carefully tiptoeing on the performance of his Government vis-a-vis ours, he is also equally responsible for having resorted to this mode of financing, particularly, to boost our external reserves at times of difficulties.

Now, what we need to bear in mind is the poor selection of infrastructure projects which are low on long-term returns as well as issues pertaining to poor governance in managing our debt portfolio when it comes to even the State-owned enterprises. I need to say that there are State-owned enterprises which deal with public utilities. Now, we have a variety of such institutions and these are also curtailed by a variety of different government policies. For instance, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board is unable to raise its tariffs for the past six years. This has seriously hampered its ability to repay its loans. Of course, the Treasury has stepped in to pay a substantial portion of the debt stock by providing certain facilities. But, we need to have a novel approach and change the financial model when it comes to state-owned enterprises if we are to reduce the external debt stock. Of course, the Budget, I am sure, does not reflect the entire debt stock of the state-owned enterprises. We need to be a little more prudent in looking at our overall financial and fiscal management issues. Now, of course, we have been able to get certain debt relief through specific arrangements with bilateral donors. For instance, the Hambantota Port issue, we were able to convert the loan into equity and were able to have some relief to a certain extent. This is one typical case of infrastructure projects with financial returns being questionable because there was no proper business plan. So, these business plans need to be looked at very aggressively before we invest in infrastructure projects, particularly, when it comes to income generating infrastructure projects such as ports and other facilities.

1103 1104

So, this issue needs to be looked at a little more critically. I think the Ministers also need to engage with the Department of External Resources and I am sure the Finance Ministry would arrange this so that we will be able to have a proper mix of the loan portfolios that we try to engage with in order to provide the capital infusion to the entities that come under our purview. We must say that when it comes to the International Monetary Fund we have had some relief by engaging with them, but we need to be a little more cautious in approaching the challenges that we are faced with.

In the meantime, I must say that the Gamperaliya Programme and the Enterprise Sri Lanka Programme have surprisingly not attracted too much of criticism from the Opposition. We have had a few cynical comments and apart from that, they realized that these two Projects, which are part of the Budget Proposals, are very critical components of this Budget which, I am sure, will improve socio-economic conditions in our villages and enhance the entrepreneurship among our youth. I am sure, if these funds are provided and concentrated on the deserving target groups and recipients, it will certainly enhance the production of goods and services and improve the contribution to the GDP from the lagging regions. We have always seen the Western region has been the main contributor to the overall GDP of this country and several regions, your area, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Moneragala, is one of those districts which contributes the least amount to the GDP. The Gamperaliya Programme, the Enterprise Sri Lanka Programme, I am sure, the impact of those Projects will enhance the capacity of such poor regions to join their colleagues in the rest of the country to contribute better towards the GDP.

So, this has been the main focus and I am sure that is why the Opposition is unable to criticize this Budget since it has been well-thought out in a very difficult period. They themselves are responsible for having created that Constitutional chaos in October, last year which seriously debilitated our ability to contain the fiscal deficit that was already looming. So, we must say that we have managed to bring the fiscal deficit to somewhere around 4.5 per cent, but I am sure we will be very cautious in approaching the entire year because we have seen this as an election Budget where the proverbial Oliver Twist attitude of continuing to ask for more and more is going to be the attitude of the constituents. Therefore, it is up to the Ministry of Finance now that they have presented a well- thought out Budget, which will ultimately benefit the rural poor and provide that necessary safety net to the socially disadvantaged people in our lagging regions.

I must also congratulate the Hon. Finance Minister for having been very frank about our social security programme, the Samurdhi Programme, that it had certain structural weaknesses, particularly the political bias that was there and that it needs to be corrected. That is why a decision has been taken to increase the benefits and the number of beneficiaries and to see that the selection criteria of those beneficiaries will not replete with political discrimination which has taken place. The Hon.

Mangala Samaraweera having been a Minister in the original regime that had introduced the Programme very clearly told us that there was political bias in the selection of beneficiaries.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) You have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Deputy Speaker, this issue of trying to implement the new social security progamme - not the new one, the earlier one - with a little bit of course correction to see that we have proper target groups selected so that the benefits will really give the necessary cushion for those people who need it the most, is commendable

Mr. Deputy Speaker, there are a few things that I need to talk about, particularly some Proposals that were contained in the last Budget relating to the importance of creating certain reservoirs. For instance, Wee Oya and Yatimahana were important reservoirs that needed to be built in time so that the Western Provinces water supply issues would be corrected. Though there was a decision last year to fund these projects, they have still not come to fruition. We need to look at more dedicated reserviors for drinking water purposes in the upper basins of our major rivers. This is a matter that we have very often raised in our budget discussions with the Finance Ministry. I am sure that the Ministry of Irrigation and ourselves need to have further discussions with the Ministry of Finance on such issues.

I must also thank the Hon. Minister of Finance for having looked at the higher education sector with a broader mindset in order to provide better infrastructure for our universities to improve the quality of teacher resources that we are trying to provide, as well as to give much-needed relief to the students by providing them sufficient scholarships and loan schemes in order to enter higher educational institutions with only about 36,000 intake in our national universities and also with another 36,000 following in instuitions like the SLIATE and various other vocational training institutions. We have also invested heavily on the technological faculties of the universities. So, we must thank the Ministry of Finance for having allocated a sum of almost Rs.26 billion, I believe, towards setting up new technological campuses all over in the university system. With those words, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I conclude my remarks.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan. You have 25 minutes.

[11.35a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I thought I had 30 minutes. Let us see how we go along, Sir.

I want to commence my speech by congratulating the Hon. Minister of Finance who has presented his Budget in a very unfavourable economic environment. He has made substantial allocations for the North-East of the country considering the fact this area had been much affected by a war for a very long period of time, in the matter of housing particularly, and also other development activities including the creation of a Special Fund into which contributions could be made from time to time to enable essential development activities in the North-East to be commenced and executed.

We are told that the country is neck-deep in debt - both domestic and foreign. Debt servicing and Defence Expenditure almost ten years after the war came to an end continue to be our biggest items of expenditure. The two sides, the Government and the Opposition, the former Government, blame each other. But, we all know that they are both to blame. The civil war was a big drain on our economy. If the two sides agreed on a political solution, the war could have been avoided. This was well within the realm of the possible. Moderate Tamil political leadership were ready to cooperate and were deeply committed to a fair political solution.

A Prabhakaran would never have emerged. The Tamil people are not belligerent people. We have deep cultural and religious values. The country was devastated on account of this great folly. It took more than 25 years to end the war. The entire world, the international community supported you to defeat the LTTE. The LTTE was banned in Sri Lanka and also all over the world. You made commitments that you will evolve an acceptable political solution once the war came to an end, but that has not yet happened, despite Tamil moderates once again giving you the fullest support to achieve that. Tamil people are committed to a just reasonable political solution and we will do all that we can to achieve that objective. We are committed to ensuring that if the process of finding a political solution ends in failure, the failure is not attributed to us. We will remain committed to a political solution within the framework of an undivided, indivisible country. Meanwhile there has been corruption, profligacy, waste and egocentric projects at the countrys expense. Both sides keep blaming each other; that is all that you do.

All of this has a very bad impact on the countrys economy. You do not know how to overcome your difficulties. You have to somehow operate and manage. You are unable to attract foreign or even domestic investment in a big way. Who will want to invest in a country that does not keep its domestic or international commitments even after more than 25 years of civil war? The war has been brought to an end but the causes that

led to the origin of the war have not yet been addressed. Everyone in the country and in the whole world acknowledges that.

Many underdeveloped countries in the world have made progress. We often talk about Singapore which in the early 1950s, wanted to model its development on Sri Lanka. Singapores success was on account of its discipline and its commitment to excellence, to quality, to honesty and to equality. You are judged in Singapore only on your merits, nothing else. I do not know whether Sri Lankans can emulate Singapore. You cannot do it by word of mouth. You need to achieve it in action. Take the other countries in our region, in South Asia and Southeast Asia, which are making progress. If I might pick one, Bangladesh in the South Asian Region. Many factories that were closed down in Sri Lanka, when we lost international economic concessions on account of our poor conduct and when we breached international commitments, moved to Bangladesh.

Today the international community is yet hopeful that it can be helpful to us because they feel that as a democratic country, we may still turn around. Sustaining democracy has been our only achievement. There have been efforts to subvert democracy, but they have not been successful and those efforts have been thwarted. I think, Sir, we should praise our ordinary people for that. What do we need to do to change the situation? We do not have true peace. Can we call ourselves a country in which all people irrespective of who they are, the Sinhalese, the Tamils or the Muslims, are treated alike? It has been 70 years since we achieved Independence. This situation cannot continue indefinitely.

What needs to be done? Powers of governance need to be shared within an undivided, indivisible Sri Lanka so as to ensure that all people feel equal, that they have the sense of belonging to Sri Lanka and that Sri Lanka belongs to them. This is how multicultural, multiethnic and pluralistic societies are governed in several parts of the world; in Asia, Europe, Africa, America and Australia. All these countries prosper because they have peace, stability and harmony domestically amongst their own people. Why are we reluctant to do the right thing? Are the people of this country being misled and frightened by some who have their own agendas to capture power politically?

We have been actively engaged in the process of Constitutional Reform from the time of the ethnic holocaust in 1983. The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution constitutionally embodying initial proposals for the sharing of powers of governance was enacted in 1987/1988. The Thirteenth Amendment was not a solution. It was the beginning of a solution thirty years ago. Since then, it has been a continuing process. During President R. Premadasa's time, the Mangala Moonesinghe Select Committee Proposals. During President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga's time, the 2000 August Proposals brought by her to Parliament. During President Mahinda Rajapaksa's time, the Multi Ethnic Experts Committee Report, the APRC process - the Tissa Vitarana Report as the Chairman of the APRC and during

1107 1108

President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's time, the Resolution converting Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly, the setting up of a Steering Committee, Sub Committees and their reports submitted to the Constitutional Assembly and debated in that Assembly. Much work has been done and there has been built through these several processes a great deal of consensus moving Constitutional Reform much beyond the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution giving us the opportunity to derive the benefit of all the work that has been done so far.

Are we going to throw all this away and take the risk of the conflict being resumed, or are we going to do our duty and arrive at a just and reasonable conclusion? Do we not have a duty to study all the Proposals that have been framed so far and in the interest of the country and its people make some wise decision? We must remember that all parties have been involved in these Processes. Some have been under the UNP governance, some have been under the SLFP governance. Both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are committed to bringing this Constitutional Reform Process to an acceptable and satisfactory conclusion. This has been their publicly stated position. The two of them, President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, represent the SLFP and the UNF respectively. There is a general view that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should also be a part of the Process. Several Hon. Members in the Opposition have conveyed that view to us. We are in complete agreement with that view and we would appeal to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to be supportive of the Process. That could infuse the Process with greater confidence.

What former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has said and done so far, particularly when he was in power, has in several instances been strongly supportive of the Process. I would draw the attention of the Hon. Members to such instances. I do this only for the reason that it will be helpful to all of us. You will observe that there is no difference between what the former President said and did and what is happening now.

I would refer, Sir, to some of these matters because they are important. I refer to the Speech that President Mahinda Rajapaksa made at the Inaugural Meeting of the All Party Representative Committee called the APRC and the Multi-Ethnic Experts Committee on 11th July, 2006.

I quote from what he said, Sir:

Our objective must be to develop a just settlement within an undivided Sri Lanka.

He went on to say, Sir:

People in their own localities must take charge of their destiny and control their politico-economic environment. Central decision-making that allocates disproportionate resources has been an issue for a considerable time.

He went on to say, and I quote:

Any solution must be seen as one that stretches to the maximum possible devolution-"

"Given the ground situation, given the background to the conflict, it therefore behoves on particularly the majority community to be proactive in striving for peace and there must be a demonstration of a well-stretched hand of accommodation.

That is what he wanted the majority community to do. These are President Mahinda Rajapaksas words.

Then, Sir, I want to refer to a Joint Statement made by President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Secretary-General of the UN when he came to Sri Lanka at the end of the war on 23rd May, 2009.

This is what the Statement says, and I quote:

President Rajapaksa and the Secretary-General agreed that addressing the aspirations and grievances of all communities and working towards a lasting political solution was fundamental to ensuring long-term socio-economic development."

It further states, I quote:

President Rajapaksa expressed his firm resolve to proceed with the implementation of the 13th Amendment, as well as to begin a broader dialogue with all parties, including the Tamil parties in the new circumstances, to further enhance this process and to bring about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka.

This is what President Mahinda Rajapaksa himself said in a Statement he made with the Secretary-General of the UN.

Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksas brother, Mr. Basil Rajapaksa, an important Minister, went to India in October, 2008. At the end of that visit there was a Statement made.

This is what he said, and I quote:

Both sides discussed the need to move towards a peacefully negotiated political settlement in the island including the North. Both sides agreed that terrorism should be countered with resolve.

The Indian side called for implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment and greater devolution of powers to the provinces. Mr. Basil Rajapaksa emphasized that the President of Sri Lanka and his Government were firmly committed to a political process that would lead to a sustainable solution.

This is Mr. Basil Rajapaksas statement and I have quoted that.

Prof. G.L. Peiris, the then Minister of External Affairs in the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government, between 15th and 17th of May, 2011, on his visit to India, said this in a joint statement. I quote:

Both sides agreed that the end of armed conflict in Sri Lanka created a historic opportunity to address all outstanding issues in a spirit of understanding and mutual accommodation imbued with political vision to work towards genuine national reconciliation.

1109 1110

2019 12

In this context, the External Affairs Minister of Sri Lanka affirmed his Governments commitment to ensuring expeditious and concrete progress in the ongoing dialogue between the Government of Sri Lanka and representatives of Tamil parties.

A devolution package building upon the 13th Amendment would contribute towards creating the necessary conditions for such reconciliation. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Sir, kindly give me five more minutes to finish. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Can I take it off from the Hon. Viyalanderans time allocation?

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Kindly give me five more minutes. Again, Sir, the Foreign Minister of India came to Sri Lanka and this is what he said in the course of his statement made on the 19th of January, 2012. I quote:

The Government of Sri Lanka has on many occasions conveyed to us its commitment to move towards a political settlement based upon the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution and building on it so as to achieve meaningful devolution of powers.

That is the commitment he made. He further said, I quote:

We look forward to an expeditious and constructive approach to the dialogue process. We believe that continuation of the dialogue between the Government and the TNA would pave the way for a political settlement including under the rubric of the Parliamentary Select Committee.

The LLRC in their recommendations impressed the need for extensive devolution and wanted a solution based upon devolution, substantial devolution, maximum devolution. Those are the words used by the LLRC.

And your commitment at the United Nations Human Rights Council was - The Resolution adopted in October, 2015 states, I quote:

Welcomes the commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to a political settlement by taking the necessary constitutional measures, encourages the Governments efforts to fulfil its commitments on the devolution of political authority, which is integral to reconciliation and the full enjoyment of human rights by all members of its population;..

So, this is the position, Sir. If one looks at what President Mahinda Rajapaksa has said, President Mahinda Rajapaksa has all along been supportive of the process of

a political solution based upon maximum possible devolution building upon the Thirteenth Amendment. That is what Mangala Moonesinghe Select Committee brought about. That is what Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas proposals brought about.

That is what the Prof. Tissa Vitharana Report brought about during the time the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa was the President. It was carried on with his blessings. So, all along Sir, the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government has been committed to a political solution based upon the maximum possible devolution, built upon the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution so as to ensure a meaningful devolution of power.

I would therefore, say Sir, that when the three leaders of the country, President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former President, Mahinda Rajapaksa have all been taking the same view and have all been supportive of maximum possible devolution of power being shared in such a way that all the people in this country will feel that they are Sri Lankans and that Sri Lanka is their country. Why are we delaying? Our economy will never improve. You can talk and talk till the cows come home. But our economy will never improve. If our economy is to improve, there must be substantial investment to this country -both domestic investment and foreign investment. Today people do not trust you. You make commitments domestically and internationally which you do not keep. People do not trust you. People must invest in this country. You must develop an export-oriented economy. You must create jobs for our youth. Our youth must be employed. Unless that is done, your economy will never improve and you will never achieve it unless there is a political solution in this country and everybody is equal. I thank you Sir, for the time you have given me.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . 14 .

Having said that, Hon. Presiding Member, I must say that the Hon. Minister of Finance, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, presented last week what has received accolades far and wide as a clean, lean and forward-thinking Budget for the year 2019 in keeping with our countrys commitment to attaining sustainable, holistic and inclusive development for our populace along with ensuring that Sri Lanka leads the charge in working towards transforming the world by attaining the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2030.

The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera has gloriously set a precedent for the future Ministers of Finance to follow by breaking tradition and curbing expectation of the pundits who heavily stipulated that the Budget, 2019 would be nothing short of an election Budget. I am elated that it is far from the same and laud his commitment towards the creation of a new economic and social order for Sri Lanka through meaningful growth.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you, Hon. State Minister. You saved some minutes for us. , . 5 .

"Daily FT" states, I quote:

"It is reported that Sri Lanka will have $ 4.2 billion in debt service payments in 2019, $ 3.7 billion in 2020, $ 3.3 billion in 2021 and $ 3.7 billion in 2022, adding up to a total of $ 14.9 billion during the four years."

"The major challenge in the New Year and years after is to refinance large volume of foreign debt settlements because of increasing Governments debt refinancing cost of external sources due to poor credit ratings and associated political risk."

. ? ? , ? ? "" .

, , . The "Daily FT" also states, I quote:

"Sri Lankas economy grew only by around 3.1 % in 2017 well below the envisaged levels of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), as a result of disruptions from droughts and floods, and policy tightening...."

1161 1162

Why do we need policy tightening? That is because of the huge debt incurred by the country. So, this is not done for our private gains.

"...However, the CBSL expected the economy to be recovered in 2018 and will grow by 4.5 %."

- [ ] . - [ ] , . . Do not shout like a child. If you do not agree, clarify it in your speech. Why are you disturbing? I am making a decent speech and only your mouth is working from the other side.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please!

1167 1168

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, I rise to a point of Order ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, what is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, the Hon. Angajan Ramanathan is speaking. So, let him speak. After that, when they speak, I will disturb.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Please do not disturb. You may continue, Hon. Member. - [Interruption.] Order, please! Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella, Hon. Senasinghe, will you yield? - [Interruption.]

[3.43p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Angajan Ramanathan) Sir, the Budget has been themed Enterprise Sri Lanka - Empowering the People and Nurturing the Poor, a visionary theme. However, based on our historical experiences of unsatisfactory implementation of the past few Budgets of this Government, I would like to consider the new Proposals as more of a political mission than a vision-based plan.

These actions make us believe that the fiscal strategy of the Government remains unrealistic, boosted expenditure and trying to reach the ambitious fiscal deficit of 4.4 per cent of GDP given in Budget, 2019 is a challenging uphill task and an attempt to woo the voters. Also, I would like to remind that the Budget Deficit in 2018 was also targeted at 4.8 per cent, but finally reached 5.3 per cent.

Though I have multiple concerns on the Proposals, in the interest of time, I am planning to discuss only two areas of concern. One area of concern is, the tertiary sector which comprises of over 50 per cent of GDP, especially the tourism sector, which remains a significant contributor and has the potential to grow exponentially. With little support from the Government, the so-called informal sector, on its own, supported by the internet platforms has shown tremendous growth and is earning foreign income for the country.

Apart from incentifying specifically the import of go-karts, which benefits only a small segment of the industry, it is disappointing to note that the Government has not proposed anything meaningful or sustainable towards long-term development of the tourism industry. I believe that the Proposal to only allow online booking of lodging with more than five rooms, if the same are registered with

the SLTDA is not only a mistake, but also an attempt to discourage the new entrants to the industry. Apart from discouraging them, what is the purpose of that Proposal? I am sure all the micro and small operators would want to know that. The added administrative work as a result of this Proposal may discourage the micro and small entrepreneurs and it will eventually place another tax burden on the resource-strapped micro, small and medium-sized homestay operators. Listening to the Hon. Ministers Proposal, I understood that this Government is more interested in jumping into regulate the informal tourism industry which came into life, not because of the efforts of the Government, but because of the internet booking platforms and the citizens of this country with entrepreneurial spirit.

Sir, if regulation, at this point, is a must and if a Sri Lankan entrepreneur has the ability to receive a direct booking to a room in his house from a foreigner through the internet and then receive the payment in US Dollars, can we at least make life of that budding entrepreneur a little bit easier by letting him register his small business through the internet, encouraging his work instead of making him waste time doing administrative work?

Another area that concerns me is the "Gamperaliya" Programme. I wish to believe that "Gamperaliya" has significant potential to uplift the rural economy and livelihoods, but, unfortunately, in my opinion, the functional mechanism of this programme has been designed with an election-oriented political motivation. It simply lacks transparency in the processing of qualifying projects. There is no clear mechanism in place for the selection and vetting of suitable projects and it lacks accountability and transparency. If the objective of the programme is rural development, it must become apolitical and the funds should be directed towards projects based on the needs of the people, not of political authorities. In my opinion, the process can create divisions and disparity at village level, electoral level and will eventually reflect at the country level as well. Therefore, I would like to propose that the programme selection to be based on the needs of the electorates and the merits of the proposal to be in relation with the programme's vision.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. The time is up. ( ) (The Hon. Angajan Ramanathan) Please give me ten seconds more, Sir.

So, a programme which talks of nationwide rapid development should not be politicized for short-term gains.

In the interest of time, I am concluding my speech. Some of my concerns will, however, follow in the coming days at the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of Ministries. Thank you.
