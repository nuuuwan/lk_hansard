( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) , . : 2019 22 " " : 2019 22 PRIVILEGE: DAILY NEWS REPORT OF 22nd AUGUST, 2019

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon Deputy Speaker, I have the Hon. Speaker's permission to raise this matter of Privilege.

As you know, yesterday we had a discussion following a Question on the Colombo-Kandy Expressway. There was an exchange of words. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and I are old Friends and we have been in Parliament for a long time. We do not take these things very seriously. We have our different points of view. That is not a big problem at all. But, I was quite perturbed to find in the Daily News, especially because I was a former Chairman of the Lake House, that this matter has been completely distorted and falsely reported. It finally states after all this - this give and take is perfectly all right; it does not worry me - .Amunugama who did not respond and maintained silence. This, Sir, as you know, is far from the truth. We had an exchange of words without any malice. I had actually raised an important question, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella will also accept, regarding the exits on Stage II of the Central Highway because if you are concentrating on opening that, you will have to look at the whole plan. I suggested that you should have an exit to Pinnawala because that is a very visited spot. That is a very positive suggestion. I think the Hon. Minister also took it in that spirit and said he would look at it. So, there is no big problem.

Therefore, Sir, I would like you very much to call the reporter of the Daily News who has completely distorted this fact - either he was not present here or he must have been sleeping. Talk to him and ask for decent coverage of what is going on. I think the Hon. Members will remember the time when there were people like Jayantha Padmanabha, Mervyn de Silva and Ajith Samaranayake reporting the proceedings of this House. In those days, there was a special column - a Lobby Column. Now, none of these newspapers even have a Lobby Column. ( , ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning, Water Supply and Higher Education) There is nothing wrong in keeping silent.

1581 1582

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Nothing is wrong in that. But, it must be a true reportage of what was happening here. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Silence is golden. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Silence may be golden. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Sometimes, you escape by being silent. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) But, my friends and voters will think that I have kept quiet while all these allegations were made by my good Friend against me. I have no problem with him. But, one would expect a true record of what happens here to be published in the newspapers. I am quite unhappy and as a former Chairman of the Lake House, I should at least take a special interest in seeing that this reportage is correct. I am not saying this with malice to anybody, but it is in the interest of the whole House. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) The Lake House has undergone lots of changes after your chairmanship. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) For the worse. ( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Every six years, it changes. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes, that is right, but for the worse.

But here, I am only raising a bigger issue. Sir, please speak to these newspaper reporters who are here. It will be a good thing if you call them from time to time and express concern that there should be fair and accurate reportage. Of course, it is also incumbent on us as Members of Parliament to point these things out if such things happen so that in the future, even these newspaper reporters will be aware that we are also following these proceedings and will not take things lying down.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) I will assure, Hon. Member, that appropriate action will be taken on that. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) 1, () .

. , . I must mention this again. The

1589 1590

proposed Amendment to Section 12 is to increase the authorized capital of the Bank from Rs. 1 billion to Rs. 50 billion to make it similar to its larger peer State bank. That is the intention of this. In 2014/2015 Report, the Auditor-Generals Department raised concerns about the inadequacy of the Bank's authorized share capital and it wanted that to capitalize itself. To enable the Bank issue debentures for its regulatory capital purposes similar to other State-owned banks, we are moving this proposal.

If there is a default on any liability or any obligation, because Section 13 will not permit a conversion to a non-government entity, then it will remain in the hands of the Government. That is the way this has been actually designed. This provides for the Bank to actually go into the debt market, which opportunity it otherwise did not have while the other banks did. Now, this Bank has the

opportunity of going into the debt market. The decision can be taken by the Bank because all other Sri Lankan State-owned banks have that right. Only the People's Bank does not have it because it is required to get a guarantee from the Government. This releases it from getting that guarantee so that it can go straight into the debt market.

Then, in 2016 and 2018, the Central Bank repeatedly stressed the importance of bolstering its regulatory capital levels. The Monetary Board of the Central Bank reiterated this in a letter in early 2019, and Central Bank requested the People's Bank to expedite amendments to its Act to enable the Bank to issue debentures to meet its regulatory capital.

So, the proposed Amendment to Section 20 (1) is, ".....raise with the approval of the Minister", the Minister being the Minister assigned to the subject of Finance. In other words, the Finance Minister's approval prior to an issuance is requisite. . , . . Further, the proposed repeal of Section 42 2 (c) takes out his authority to determine the form of debentures. The form of the debenture, interest rate - ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena) ,- .

Yesterday and during the last few days, he has been lamenting about the failure of the SriLankan Airlines, UL. The massive drain of our earned foreign exchange. The same situation will happen if you open in this manner the debenture form, which can end up in the share market and finally go into the hands of the private sector. That is why we are pressing and asking the Government to bring the necessary protection. If you fail, we will move the Amendments in order to protect the State Banks from this type of transfer, which is a hidden way of reaching the situation of privatization.

, . "Why did the Coffee King commit suicide?" That was the news of India two weeks ago. So, why did the Coffee King commit suicide? The billionaire businessman was a success story in South India and he committed suicide because of the chase of the Income Tax Department and today, there is an inquiry going on. So, do not try to kill the national industry. Do not try to kill our established national banks. Finally, it will only push our economy into foreign hands.

, . With regard to Clause 2, Clause 3, Clause 4 and Clause 5, which are being debated today in the open, I would like to refer to an article published today in the "Daily FT" by a former Chairman as well as the President of the Bank Employees' Union, Mr. T. Rusiripala. He sends alarming signals, which have not been answered by the Government. That is why this Debate is very important and I hope that, before 04thSeptember, the Government will come back again and agree with the Opposition to make the necessary safeguards in amendments. . Monetary Board . , . , , . , . , .

Sir, in his article in today's "DailyFT", Mr. T. Rusiripala states, I quote:

The determination of the paid up capital under this enhanced authorized limit will be done by an order published in the Gazette and every Order made by the Minister shall be brought before Parliament for approval.

Parliament has to have control over the activities according to the Act. . . ? He further states, I quote:

"But under the amendment proposed banks can with the approval of the Ministry of Finance issue debentures without any reference to the Monetary Board".

It can end up in the stock market; it can finally be bought up by anyone dealing in the stock market. He also states,

"Parliament will have to address these issues and introduce suitable checks and controls unless they favour the issue of shares to public and dilute the State ownership in the bank".

,- [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , 3 . ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , .

, . . Mr. Rusiripala further goes on to state, I quote:

The removal of the requirement to obtain the prior approval of the Monetary Board and the determination of the methodology of a debenture issue through the intervention of the Ministry appear to be a licence to be granted to the Bank Authorities to freely decide the supplementing of any sum of funds through debentures. Judging from their performance over the years and the failure to put the bank on a real commercial footing sounds an alarm bell which should receive the attention of all.

One point I would like to make is that there is no question about the ownership of the Bank going to anybody apart from the Government of Sri Lanka. The Government is the ultimate beneficial owner and it is enshrined in Section 13 of the People's Bank Act. For avoidance of any doubt, I would like to say that Section 13 will not be amended.

The next point I would like to make is about the Monetary Board. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Minister, debentures can eventually end up in the stock market, if the provisions are not protective. You agree, do you not? ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) There in the stock market, it can go into the hands of the private sector. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) No, it cannot because it would be illegal. I have checked with the lawyers. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Have protective laws.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) It cannot go into their hands because it will be contrary to the Peoples Bank Act. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) What happened to the DFCC? It went to the private sector. What happened to the NDB? ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Member, the DFCC and the NDB went into their hands after definite decisions taken by the Government to take them to the stock market. If a future Government, maybe your Government, decides to take the Bank of Ceylon or the Peoples Bank to the stock market, that will be a future decision. But, under these Amendments, it is not possible; it cannot be done.

Just to clarify the last point, the Monetary Boards approval is not necessary for the nature of the debenture or for the interest rates. Not for any other Sri Lankan State-owned bank, is it there. Only the Peoples Bank has been constrained. So, we are making the Peoples Bank equal to the other banks, but the supervision of the Central Bank will not change in any way. . , . . , debentures , . . . Section 13 amendment . ( ) (The Hon.

I will speak in English, Hon. Presiding Member. The first question is, when did the process of amending the People's Bank Act originally commence? 2013. . The second question is, what is the objective of the Amendments? , ? To increase the current authorized share capital from Rs. 1 billion to Rs. 50 billion. 50 . , Bank of Ceylon , . . , . .

, Amendments ; what are the proposed Amendments? , authorized share capital 50 . That is in Section 12.

Then, Sections 20, 21 and 43 deal with the Bank's capacity to issue debentures for its medium and long-term funding purposes, where previously a Treasury guarantee was requisite at every instance the Bank so issued a

debenture. The Amendments proposed aim to essentially enable the Bank to issue debentures without a Government of Sri Lanka Guarantee, being similar to other State banks, thus enabling the Bank to tap debt markets for its regulatory purposes in order to facilitate further growth.

, - debentures - Treasury guarantee . Treasury guarantee debentures issue Basel capital adequacy . So, this only gives the People's Bank the ability to go to the market and raise its required financing through issuing debentures or a long-term paper without getting a Treasury guarantee of the Government of Sri Lanka. . Treasury Guarantee . Treasury Guarantee , .

. Do the proposed Amendments have any impact or consequence whatsoever on the Bank's ultimate Government of Sri Lanka share ownership? . . , ? , "" . , "" . . , . . The Government's ultimate beneficial ownership in People's Bank remains enshrined in Section 13 of the People's Bank Act. For the avoidance of any doubt, this Section 13 is not amongst the proposed Amendments. 13 . 13 . 13 (1) ? It states, I quote:

, . . , . .

, , as it currently stands, that is, being without any changes to its Act, can the Bank issue debentures to meet its regulatory capital requirements? . ? debentures, ? , no. As it stands, Section 21 (1) (b) requires the Bank to obtain a Treasury Guarantee at every instance a debenture is issued. In this context, it must be pointed out that the Government of Sri Lanka does not have adequate capacity or capability to issue guarantees and debentures backed by a guarantee do not qualify for regulatory capital. . , . guarantee debentures ; debentures .

. There is a view that the proposed Amendment to Section 20 seeks to remove the supervision of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka over the Bank's affairs, particularly in relation to the issuance of debentures. Is there any truth to these views? . , no. In this context, it is not. ? . As it currently stands, Section 20 (1) reads as follows:

"........request the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Ceylon to raise on its behalf, any sums by the issue of debentures."

The Monetary Board does not and will not issue debentures on behalf of the People's Bank.

The Teacher Assistants have completed degree course and are waiting for the last 02 years for their degree to be verified. In relation to this, Uva Provincial Road Development and Tamil Education Hon. Minister Senthil Thondaman has submitted a request to the President.

His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena has instructed me to speed up the process. Presently, these Teacher Assistants are facing huge difficulties in getting appointment to Grade 3-1 of the Teachers' Service. I kindly request you to take necessary steps to verify their degree at the earliest.
