2017 :

The current account deficit, which was 2.1 per cent of GDP in 2016, expanded to 2.6 per cent of GDP in 2017, triggered by the widened trade and primary income deficits, moderate earnings from tourism and lower workers remittances. Although 2017 marked the highest ever export earnings with a double-digit growth, the trade deficit expanded to 11.0 per cent of GDP in 2017 from 10.9 per cent of GDP in 2016 due to increased imports of fuel, rice and gold, in particular.

Sir, I want to say a few more words quickly. We are talking about the country's exports and how to increase them. But, the point I would like to focus on is that Sri Lanka is going through a certain demographic change at the moment. We have one of the worlds fastest ageing populations. In a sense, it is fortunate that people are living longer; it is unfortunate in the sense that because the birth rate is very low there is an economic consequence - there are not enough people in the workforce. So, we need to migrate to more value-added services and a value-added economy rather than being a traditional economy.

Our greatest potential to contribute to the economy is in the womens workforce of this country. Women can contribute to the economy. But, unfortunately, even though they are very often better educated, only 28 per cent of women participate in the workforce in South Asia. Presently, they are about 36 per cent women in the workforce in Sri Lanka. It used to be 46 per cent in 2006, 41 per cent in 2010 and has been gradually going down. So, we need to look at this and address the issues that are barring women from joining the workforce and contributing to the economy.

There are many issues regarding women; some are small and some are very big. We know that there has been a lot of controversy around the world recently even on very basic things like tampons and pads for women. In some countries, women revolted against the taxes on those. In India, the Indian Government had to basically exit from the taxes on those. Some other countries like Canada, Malaysia and Australia have actually dropped it. Sri Lanka has also taken the first step by taking away the CESS on those very basic needs of women. Unfortunately, in previous debates and discussions, those items were treated as luxuries just because they were sometimes brought from abroad. That says something about the mindset of the politician and the policymaker. In our context, politicians and policymakers have primarily been males and therefore, we have missed some of these very fundamental and vital issues, which we are redressing now.

One of the barriers that has been there with regard to women is, particularly maternity leave. Under the previous legislation, women employees in the private sector were granted 84 days of maternity leave in respect of only two births. For all subsequent childbirths, the number of days granted was cut by half. We have changed that and have provided 84 days of maternity leave for mothers working in both the private and the plantation sectors irrespective of the number of previous confinements. We have also given the legal right for a mother, particularly a breastfeeding mother, to breastfeed her child even while she is employed.

I just want to wind up by saying that there are a few more things that we need to do quickly. One is that there are some legal restrictions in terms of womens work practices. The idea is that if women work after 8.30 in the evening, it raises the cost of employment. Therefore, the entrepreneurs are reluctant to employ women. We need to remove that. There should not be any discrimination

between men and women. Women should be equal in every sense before the law. I do not think a woman-child can be protected by the State as much as she would be protected by her own parents or her mother.

The other thing that we need to remove is, as you sometimes see in the newspapers, the age restriction for different jobs. I can understand that if it is a heavy job, you might need a younger person to do it. But, that can be done through a selection process, not by discrimination of the law. We should basically remove the age requirement. We have an aging population in this country. A young lady, after a good education, gets married at 25 and at 30, she has children. She might take 10 years off to have two or three children and wants to re-enter the workforce. How can there be an age barrier for somebody like that who is well-educated to re-enter the workforce? We must remove those obstacles.

All of us in this House must get together to create a society where women can fully participate in the economic process of this country. Then, there are also practical things we need to address. We need to provide childcare centres. That needs to be done. Then, there are other practical things too that we have to think about. We will be proposing some of those during the next Budget.

Thank you, Sir, for providing me this opportunity. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you. The next speaker is the Hon. (Dr.) Nalinda Jayathissa. You have 12 minutes. [.. 5.15] () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Nalinda Jayathissa) , , 2018 . The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad . . , - - . . . . . . .
