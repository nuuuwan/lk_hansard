( ) (The Hon. Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. M. A. Sumanthiran. You have 25 minutes. Before that the Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will take the Chair.

, ] .

, , [ ] .

Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. SELVAM ADAIKKALANATHAN] took the Chair.

[10.36 a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you Mr. Deputy Chairman for the opportunity given to speak a few words at the Committee Stage Discussion on the allocations made to several important institutions: the Office of His Excellency the President, the Office of the Prime Minister, Judges of the Superior Courts, Public Service Commission, Judicial Service Commission, National Police Commission, Administrative Appeals Tribunal, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, Elections Commission, National Audit Office, importantly the Parliament itself and many other institutions.

So, this is an important Head of expenditure that has been proposed in this Budget, and when one scans the figures that have been proposed, one can see that the President's Office has the lion's share, only second to the Elections Secretariat. It is almost Rs.3000 million, Rs.2929 million, more than the allocation for Parliament itself which is Rs. 2776 million.

I want to raise a few issues that have already been raised by the speaker who opened the Discussion today with regard to the disputes that exist among several personalities for whom these expenditures have been proposed.So, there is the Office of the President, then there is the Office of the Prime Minister, there is the Office of the Supreme Court and so on. All of these important Offices seem to be at logger heads. All of a sudden, the smooth functioning has been disrupted, thanks to the plot that started on the 26th of October, last year. We are still reeling under that onslaught and all of these important institutions are at each others throats.

One important issue is the present Sessions that are going on in the UN Human Rights Council and the announcement by His Excellency the President that he intends sending three members to represent himself and to

move away from the commitment that Sri Lanka has given twice before with his blessings and then counter to that, the Prime Ministers and the Foreign Affairs Ministers Offices are stating clearly that they would co-sponsor a new Resolution at the Human Rights Council Session, this year. We would like to know what the real situation is, we would like to know from the President whether, indeed, he is sending another delegation and what legal authority such a delegation would have, when two Members of Parliament from the Opposition go to represent the country at this important Sessions in Geneva.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, before we start the Committee Stage Discussion, we would like to know whether there is an official delegation.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Let me speak. This shows the Leader of the House does not know whether His Excellency the President is sending a separate delegation and whether-[Interruption.] I am raising here an issue of propriety as to whether we can authorize expenditure for the Presidents Office, if the President intends to send -

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Yes, Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Sir, I want to ask the Hon. Leader of the House- .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No. You cannot disturb my speech. How can he disturb my speech, Sir?

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Sir, I would like to know from the Leader of the House, since he is so insistent that I must reply right now, whether he is willing to give me the time from the Government side, so that I can deal with this issue before I speak, simple as that. Otherwise, wait till I speak.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Hon. Sumanthiran, please. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Whatever you do between yourselves, do not take my time away from me, please. So, this confusion, the Leader of the House does not know- We are discussing the Head of Expenditure of Presidents Office. If the President intends to send Members from the Opposition ranks - not to represent the Government, but himself - can we authorize that expenditure today? I think that it would be improper for any of these monies to be utilized for the President to be sending unofficial delegations to personally represent him to a bilateral body like the UN Human Rights Council and that such expenditure should be disallowed by Parliament and that is why I am raising the issue.

My question is to His Excellency the President. I do not know why he is not here today. I intend asking the President a number of questions for clarification while we discuss the expenditures that have been proposed for his Office. So, this is one of those. He has proposed two names from the Opposition. Can Members from the Opposition represent the Government? I understand that the Minister of Foreign Affairs is going for the UN Human Rights Council. So, that would be proper for the Minister of Foreign Affairs to go for the Session and to represent the Government. But, how can anybody else represent the Government? It is obvious that they cannot, and if they cannot, can this Parliament authorize that expenditure?

Then, this raises another issue. His Excellency the President is the Head of the Executive. He is the Chair of

47 48

2019 3

the Cabinet. He is the Head of the Cabinet. He is the Head of the Government. Now we raise this issue with regard to the Leader of the Opposition. Can another Member of his own party also function as the Head of the Opposition: two members from the same party, one the Head of the Government and the other the Head of the Opposition? Now we are seeing how that is working. The Head of the Government is seeking to send members of this so called main Opposition to represent him. So, this shows the ridiculous state of affairs that this Parliament has been brought into.

He also wishes to send the Governor of the Northern Province and the Governor of the Northern Province is sending letters - I got a letter from the Governor of the Northern Province - saying that he is going there to represent the people of the Northern Province. How can the Governor represent the people? The Governor is the agent of the President. The Province has elected representatives at various levels. They will represent the people. We will represent the people. The Governor is merely an agent of the President to carry out certain constitutional functions. The Governor also, I understand, has proposed himself to go to India on an official trip to meet with the refugees in India. Is the Governor authorized under the Constitution to do things like that? He has sought the permission to go to India with a delegation and he has suggested persons who must go with him on that delegation. That list strangely includes a member of the Judiciary. The Governor of the Northern Province has sought permission to go to India to meet refugees living in India with a team of persons, which also includes a sitting member of the Judiciary. So, this is the ridiculous state, as I said before, to which the Executive has come.

Now, this is being extended. We are also discussing the Head of Expenditure of the Supreme Court. Last month, when we had a debate here, there were Members from both sides who said the Supreme Court is independent now, see how they ruled in the months of November and December and, therefore, we do not need international judges for accountability. They said, Our judges are independent. That has been established. We can go on with any inquiry with regard to wartime atrocities by a local judicial system. In that debate itself, I intervened and said, That may be so when the contesting parties are two political parties in this country. But, when it comes to the issue of the State of Sri Lanka and an armed rebel group, the local Judiciary will not be independent. This has been proved yet again by certain court proceedings that happened last week. Since those court proceedings have been terminated, the matter is not sub judice and I can speak about it in this House.

I refer to the case of former Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda going to the Supreme Court to prevent his arrest. It has become a joke now, that people run to the Supreme Court. They do not go to the Magistrates Court, where under the Bail Act, you can ask for anticipatory bail. This is a new trend, that you go to the apex court of the country and prevent arrest. In this instance, he was named as a suspect in the Magistrates Court for having had knowledge of the abduction,

disappearance and subsequent killing of eleven Tamil-speaking youths in and around Colombo. They had nothing to do with the LTTE. In this case, where the abducted persons were not members of the LTTE - they had nothing to with the war - the suspects were members of an armed force, of the Sri Lanka Navy, who were running a racket of abduction and extortion of money for ransom and it was revealed that the Commander of the Navy at that time knew about it. He himself made the complaint to the police; he knew about it. You cannot say no to that because the first complaint was by him. Because he was a wartime Commander, a position was taken up in the Supreme Court that he is a war hero and he should not be arrested. I want to ask, if a person had been a Commander of an armed force during the war, does that give him immunity from arrest? I did not see that happening in the case of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka. But here, these were Tamil-speaking youths and they were done to their death in the secret detention camp "Gunsite" in the Trincomalee Naval Headquarters. That is known. Several more had been done to their deaths in that secret detention camp in the Naval Headquarters. There is ample evidence for that. Those may have been members of the LTTE. We have not even got there or anywhere. But, here is a case of very young men, their parents have been looking for them, crying out for justice and then eventually, after ten long years, the machinery moved. But, when it came close to a wartime Commander, immediately the whole State apparatus including the Supreme Court, I repeat, including the Supreme Court, has acted in a partisan manner entirely without justification to prevent his arrest. In that public forum, in open court, Karannagodas lawyer has publicly stated that the Attorney-General and the Solicitor General go to the President everyday asking for promotions and therefore, their view must not be taken into account, and the Additional Solicitor General who appeared for the Attorney-General did not even counter that and in fact, did a summersault when the previous day he insisted on the arrest and after this was stated, he agreed that Mr. Karannagoda need not be arrested. This shows the partisan manner in which the Judiciary, the Attorney-Generals Department, all function when it comes to matters like this.

If this is the case with regard to Tamil-speaking youth who were not involved with the LTTE, how much more partisanship will be seen when it involves the LTTE itself and that is why we insist that the undertakings given to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva must be fulfilled, must be implemented. The Government has given undertakings that the participation of international judges, these accountability issues will be addressed and that must be done and the Government must cooperate with it. Whatever the President might say, whoever non-official representatives of his might go - I do not know where they will say this in Geneva, perhaps, on the streets - whatever they say, that must be done; that is an obligation undertaken by the Government. Karannagodas Supreme Court case has shown to the whole world - I want the UN Human Rights Council to take note of this - that there will be no justice when it comes to issues such as this and in broad daylight, in open court, it was stated by Karannagodas lawyer, It

was the wartime. He could have committed any murder. Why did he have to complain to the police?, stating the obvious that any murder went without punishing, would not have been punished, even now the Commander has immunity and this could have been done with impunity.

Lord Naseby has visited this House over and over again for the last 30 years. What did Lord Naseby get up and say in the House of Commons? He said that Britain is wrong, that Britain has given wrong figures, the British confidential documents prove that the figures given to Geneva by Britain and the Co-sponsors are all misleading, false and has no basis and therefore, withdraw the Resolution against Sri Lanka. That is what Lord Naseby stated.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order. 2 .

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Member, you can point the finger at me, but the responsibility is on the Government. I submitted the Amendment, a Bill, to the Cabinet. If the present Minister of Internal and Home Affairs and Provincial Councils and Local Government and the Government are interested in holding the Provincial Councils Election, they should forthwith present that Bill to Parliament and get it passed, because it is a simple Amendment where we have gone back to the old system. We have protected the 25 per cent female representation. So, the Government, whilst pointing the finger at me, has not been giving an explanation why the Bill is not presented to Parliament. 2 .

Madam Presiding Member, His Excellency the President has taken an effort to make major differences. Obviously, in any government, in any institution, there are lapses; there are faults. But, I would like to say with responsibility that the Nineteenth Amendment, which the President has brought in, has made a change in this country; given freedom which this country never enjoyed. Hon. Members, all of you will take credit for bringing in the Nineteenth Amendment. So, His Excellency the President has taken an effort to make a change in this country. Whilst conceding that in any government, any institution, any person, there are rights, wrongs and lapses, I say that we together brought His Excellency the President to power. We collectively brought in the Nineteenth Amendment and we all are today reaping its fruits. We have a strong Judiciary; we have a strong Public Service,we have a strong police. So, I think, His Excellency the President and all of us should be given credit for bringing in the Nineteenth Amendment.

Madam Chair, once again, I am very grateful that I have been given an opportunity to speak a few words in the Committee Stage Discussion on the Vote of His Excellency the President.
