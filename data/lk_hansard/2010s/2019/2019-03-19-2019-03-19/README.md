( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) . . . . Science, Technology and Research Ministry must be the authority on this. You cannot get views from all and sundry and accept them. Science, Technology and Research Ministry must be the authority on things like this.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Last word! ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Yes, last word should come from them. Otherwise, what is the idea of having a Science, Technology and Research Ministry?

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) I will not disturb you. We have the last word on that as well. The standards are given by us. But, there are so many opinions and there are too many cooks also in the -

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) That is exactly what I am saying. You will have to throw out all the opinions. If you are to get opinions, there will be 101. There are companies that sponsor. This is the naked truth. You cannot get behind it. They have been sponsored - Ministers downwards have been sponsored by these milk powder companies. They are talking of a annual turnover of US dollars 30-40 million. So, obviously, you need to put your foot down. But unfortunately, you are not in the Cabinet to do that. This is what I say. Now, they have rated that the Minister of Science, Technology and Research should be non-Cabinet. I cannot understand this.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) I think, you are spot on that. As you know, everybody has an opinion. Anybody can give an opinion. So, when the opinion comes, sometimes, from one of the Government Ministers, then, it is a bit of a problem for us also. We cannot get into a tussle.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) That is exactly what I am saying. You should be able to override all that and the Government must make as a policy. It must accept that Science, Technology and research will have the loss. I mean, what is the idea of having a Science, Technology and Research Ministry? -[Interruption.] Give him a promotion.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) I think the only solution, as the Sabanayaka said, is a promotion for me in the Cabinet. But, that is not the case. People can have different opinions. But, we have taken a firm decision on that. So, opinions can be given but the final verdict is given by us.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Still you did not get my point. Your final decision is not the final decision of the Minister concerned. So, that has to be sorted out. It is so funny. I mean, it is hilarious. I mean, you have a Minister and the Minister dealing with the subject is not being considered and someone else's opinion is being taken forward. I mean, where do you stand then? Where do you stand on this? Obviously, I do not want to get involved in this.

I want to share my experience with you. During our time, I think, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella will remember this, Kandy Lake issue algae foaming. You remember this.

with World Bank assistance and all that. . . . . Scientists through the Internet, invitation " " . Believe me, more than 30 people responded. They were all well off, they have been there for 20 to 30 years and they did not need any financial assistance, transport or anything else and said, "If we are given the opportunity to serve the country, we will come back. Three people came and one of the Professors is still serving in one of the institutions dealing with Science. Then, one of the Scientists came out with a proposal. ?

The priorities have been mixed up. Nobody knows how it has been done. I do not know how you call the manner in which you have appointed the Cabinet Members or the allocation of subjects to them as "scientific". It is again hilarious. Being a very senior Minister, the Leader of the House and particularly your party's Leader of Kandy, I think you should have a better, bigger responsibility in carrying out the development work. I think it is high time that you discuss that. I do not know whether you are waiting till the end of the year so that there will be a change and then, you will again become an MP supportive of us.

"Meeting with Swiss Ambassador Rauff says country lacks legal provisions to curtail hate speech

SLMC Leader and Minister of City Planning, Water Supply and Higher Education Rauff Hakeem lamented that the country still lacks adequate legal provisions to curtail hate speeches and also pointed out that it lacked the ability to check on messages carried on social websites that affect communal harmony."

"Daily Mirror" * . .

He was my predecessor in the Ministry of Justice and is the successor in the Ministry of Higher Education. I have a very high regard for him. We were batch mates. He is a very good Friend of mine. But it raises a very serious concern when he makes a representation to an Ambassador who is representing a country in the European Union, that we lack a law to curtail hate speeches in the country. And, it is especially at a time, when issues relating to Sri Lanka has already been scheduled to be taken up at the UNCHR in Geneva in a few days time. It has been given very prominent publicity in our own newspapers, because it is one of our senior-most responsible Cabinet Ministers who says that we have still failed to make a law to curtail hate speech, that we are yet in a primitive era and we are a country which is not capable of making an essential law to maintain communal harmony within the country.

...graphene, a recently developed super-mineral could dramatically improve battery technologies. Earlier this year, Samsung announced plans to include graphene-ion in its phone batteries, helping them to charge faster and hold the charge for longer.

It is a 2D atomic layer of graphite, generally created through mechanical exfoliation. In 2010, scientists from the university won a Nobel Prize for the discovery."

To date, graphene is the strongest mineral ever discovered, with 40 times the strength of diamond. It is more effective as a conductor of heat and electricity than graphite.
