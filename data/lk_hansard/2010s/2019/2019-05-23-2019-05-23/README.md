, Grey List , , terrorist financing and money laundering . , Grey List 0194 . , , . .

Sir, I would like to read from a note that I got from the Central Bank on what we are doing to get Sri Lanka out of the Grey List of the FATF. This note states,

"The Financial Action Task Force , the global policy-setter has introduced 40 recommendations on Anti-Money

Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism in order to combat money laundering/terrorist financing and other related offences globally. The Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering functions as the FATFs regional affiliated body and monitors the level of compliance with the FATF recommendations in the region through Mutual Evaluations".

This is important because in todays context, where we are talking about terrorist financing coming from various parts of the world and where we have seen what had happened here in this country just over a month ago, we must be doubly vigilant and must ensure that we have all the safeguards in place to counter such terrorist financing taking place. We were reading in the newspapers reports referring to some of the investigations that were going on and they were, in fact, pointing towards cryptocurrency, how a persons e-wallet, using cryptocurrency, was used before the blast took place.

This note further states that Sri Lanka was subjected to its first Mutual Evaluation in 2006 and the second one was done during 2014/2015. The second Mutual Evaluation Report on Sri Lanka, which was adopted in July, 2015, recommended Sri Lanka to initiate a number of actions to rectify the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism deficiencies identified during the Mutual Evaluation. The point that I am trying to make here is that this Evaluation, which ended up with Sri Lanka being listed in the Grey List, was based on what happened in 2014/2015. So, the Evaluation was in 2014/2015, which looked at what happened since 2006 to 2014/2015. Therefore, when people say that Sri Lanka was put on the Grey List and make allegations against this Government, those allegations, I am trying to show you, are unfounded and baseless.

The note goes on to state, "Accordingly, Sri Lanka implemented a series of measures to address the deficiencies including adoption of National AML/CFT Policy, issuance of Customer Due Diligence Rules for financial institutions and introduction of risk-based AML/CFT Supervision for financial institutions". So, to summarize, we have undertaken to implement some 15 recommendations based on the Mutual Evaluation that took place. Then the note states, "In October, 2016, the FATF informed that Sri Lanka will be subject to a review of the International Cooperation Review Group of the FATF to assess the progress of AML/CFT effectiveness.

After several discussions and progress reports, the FATF informed that Sri Lanka has not made sufficient progress in four areas, namely, International Cooperation, Supervision, Legal Persons and Arrangements and Targeted Financial Sanctions on Proliferations (North Korea & Iran). As a result, the FATF, .............in October 2017, listed Sri Lanka as a jurisdiction with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies in the FATFs Compliance Document, which is more commonly identified as 'the Grey List'." So, this is what happened.

It further states, "Upon listing, a time-bound action plan to address the strategic deficiencies identified was provided to Sri Lanka.

1127 1128

2019 03

Since .......... November 2017, the Financial Intelligence Unit together with other stakeholders has taken a series of effective and tangible steps to implement the FATF Action Plan. Few of the major actions taken are as follows:

Issue of Customer Due Diligence Rule No. 1 of 2018 and other necessary guidelines for Designated Non-Finance Businesses and Professions

Issue of regulations, directives and guidelines implementing United Nations Security Council Resolution on Iran and North Korea

Passing the amendments to the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act,............"

People were criticizing that also in this very House. But, not having legislation on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters is one reason why we ended up in the Grey List. So, there is really no reason to criticize the Government when we are trying to introduce these legislations so that we can get out of the Grey List and show the world that we have taken precautions to prevent these terrorist financing activities going on in this country. According to this note, actions of passing the necessary amendments to the Trust Ordinance requiring to obtain all necessary information including beneficial owners and so on were also taken. Anyway, what I want to say is, with regard to the actions that I just mentioned, the necessary political commitment remains in place to sustain their implementation in the future.

A decision was taken by the FATF Plenary held in February, 2019 to consider taking Sri Lanka out of the Grey List. So, as per the decisions taken by the FATF, a team of evaluators will be vising Sri Lanka during the coming months. In fact, they were supposed to come, but due to the difficulties in travelling, I understand, it had to be postponed for a little while. But, they will be coming here to meet all the relevant stakeholders including the private sector and the highest political authorities to verify the implementation of the FATF Action Plan and to ascertain Sri Lankas political commitment towards implementing Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism. The onsite team will make their recommendations to the FATF Plenary, which could result in Sri Lanka exiting the Grey List soon.

So, the point that I am making is that we got into the Grey List because of what had not happened during the Mutual Evaluation that took place in 2014/2015 and that was long before this Government was effectively in office. Based on those recommendations, we have now undertaken to implement a bunch of changes, reforms, bring amendments to the law and so on and are confident that we will be taken off the Grey List very soon and our country will be back as an accepted, credible player in the global financial markets. Thank you very much.

, . 56 ? , SOFA 2 . 2 . . . 56 , agreement negotiate tactics . . . . Adjust Negotiating Tactics. Even though it is asking for special privileges, the United States has leverage in SOFA negotiations, which derives in very important part from the value the host government attaches to a U.S. military presence. It is clear that negotiating a SOFA is easier when the host government sees a compelling need for the presence of U.S. forces and/or when bilateral relations are generally good. Problems emerge when public attitudes and/or concerns regarding incursions on sovereignty outweigh the perceived need for a U.S. presence".

, ? It is clear that negotiating a SOFA is easier when the host government sees a compelling need for the presence of U.S. forces...... fine example .

The most obvious recent example is the change of position by the Iraqi government. ISIS - Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki . With ISIS at the gates of Baghdad in 2014, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who had previously refused to agree to a SOFA proved willing to reconsider and afford status protections via diplomatic note so as to bring U.S. troops back. , . , "US base .

In responding to the Parliamentary Question, please note that we have no records to prove that any Agreements or Memoranda of Understanding have been signed by Sri Lanka with any country or institution that infringes on the sovereignty, affecting public security or interfering with the internal affairs of the country either before or after 21st April, 2019.

The Government of Sri Lanka signed the initial Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreement - ACSA -with the USA in 2007. The signatories to the 5th March, 2007 Agreement were Ambassador of the US to Sri Lanka Robert Blake and Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. The Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa said that two American citizens - Robert Blake and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa -have signed this Agreement, The validity of the Agreement is for a period of 10 years and the Agreement was due to expire on 6th March, 2017.

A new draft ACSA was proposed by the US side in July 2016. In general, in the new Agreement, the contents are similar and no major changes were observed on the text. However, a key difference with regard to timelines is that the proposed new ACSA will not require renewal, meaning it would continue to remain in force until either party gives 180 days notice of its intention to terminate the Agreement.

This is not a military agreement. military, , logistics - - . It says "through increased logistic co-operation". The provision of logistics support, supplies and services as defined in the Agreement include the following:

"Food, water, billeting, transportation including airlift, petroleum, oils, lubricants, clothing, communication services, medical services, ammunition, base operations support and construction incident to base operations support, storage services, use of facilities, training services, spare parts and components, repair and maintenance services, calibration services, and port services. The term also includes the temporary use of general purpose vehicles and other nonlethal items of military equipment, where such lease or loan is permitted under the national laws and regulations of the parties. The

term Logistics Support, Supplies, and Services refers to support, supply or services from any or all of the foregoing categories".

"Brief on the US-Sri Lanka Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)" "Background" .

"A SOFA does not constitute a security arrangement with a particular country. It establishes the rights and privileges of US personnel in a country, and address issues such as wearing of uniforms, exemption from taxes and fees, carrying of weapons, use of radio frequencies, licences, customs regulations, exemption from the criminal jurisdiction of the host country".

- "exemption from the criminal jurisdiction of the host country" - .

( ,) (The Hon. Jayantha Samaraweera) ,- ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Please do not disturb my trend of thoughts.

Minister of Foreign Affairs informed the US delegation that Sri Lanka would find it difficult to grant immunity from criminal jurisdiction to US forces. , 2 2 , . It was also stated that it would be difficult to implement the 1995 SOFA, agreed through an exchange of Notes - - due to the coming into force of the Diplomatic Privileges Act, No. 9 of 1996, which sets the procedures for granting immunities and privileges. 2 , 2 .
