[ ]

(j) Whereas certain Ministers of the government have acted to obstruct the investigation process regarding the suspects arrested in relation to the Easter Sunday attack on 21.04.2019 and to obstruct or prevent law enforcement in relation to the said crimes;

(k) Whereas the government has omitted to fulfill its duties and

obligations to the people by failing to act with due vigilance and responsibility and by failing to follow the proper procedure to suppress such incidents to prevent the extremist violent actions, such as homicides, damages to property and conflicts among people that occurred in Gampaha and the North Western Province on 13.05.2019 despite the possession of comprehensive set of laws to suppress the recurrence of a similar series of attacks or perpetration of crimes of any other form subsequent to the series of terrorist attacks that took place on 21.04.2019 and failed to prevent such attacks despite the unrest among different communities and the tendency to carry out attacks that prevailed in the country subsequent to the series of attacks on 21.04.2019;

processes of the country even after the lapse of a period of one month since the Easter Sunday attack, and it has failed to bring the school and university systems in the country back to normalcy, and it has failed to restore the functioning of public and private sectors, and where as it has neglected its duties and responsibilities as a government towards the citizens of this country; and

Whereas it has acted creating room for foreign countries to

interfere in internal affairs of the country on the grounds of the anarchic situation that has been created in the country consequent to its failure to prevent the serial attacks on 21.04.2019 and due to its failure to restore the security situation and the civil life of the country back normalcy; That this Parliament resolves that it has further lost confidence in Prime Minister, Cabinet and Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

[2.25 p.m.]

( - ) The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne - State Minister of Finance) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we are debating today a No-Confidence Motion in the Government. I decided to speak in English because the circumstances which led to the Easter Sunday attacks were really inspired by global terrorism.

I want to say why we need to have confidence in our Government. What has this Government done since coming to power in 2015? We have focused on the politics of unity built on key principles. We have tried

1389 1390

hard to build an inclusive Sri Lanka. In our efforts, we established the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation and the National Reconciliation Policy was adopted in 2017. We established the Office on Missing Persons in 2017 to help bring justice and closure to the families who have lost loved ones in a conflict. We passed the Office for Reparations Act in 2018 and established the Office for Reparations to provide compensation for those who were victimized during this period.

We have focused on reconciliation through economic development, which includes avenues of debt relief for communities in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, injecting cash into Government-run reconciliation programmes. In terms of individual freedoms, we have also achieved much during this period. The Government has passed tough, major governance reforms and institutionalized basically the rule of law in Sri Lanka and have upheld individual freedoms. We started by passing the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which has come in for much discussion in the recent period. We established the Constitutional Council and curtailed the powers of the Executive President and constituted Independent Commissions to ensure that all future decisions will be taken free of politicization. We passed the Right to Information Act in 2016 to give the civil society the tools to question the Government and thereby, facilitate transparency.

Prior to 2015, there were abductions, death threats and other means used to silence those who were opposed to the then Government. Since our Government came into office, we have ensured freedom of speech and civil rights to oppose the Government, protest and to express people's views without fear. We saw the strength of the civil society during the Constitutional coup in October last year. Not only was the civil society freer, but the judicial system of this country also worked and we saw it for ourselves. The Supreme Court's Ruling given in December, 2018 was clear evidence of how far we have come over the past four years. We still need to go further, but we have achieved much. We must consider the reasons for the Easter Sunday attacks and the attacks in Gampaha and Wayamba recently in this light. We do not condone for a moment the Easter Sunday attacks. We apologized for the failure of the Government in preventing what really happened.

Sadly, violence against Muslim families and businesses in Minuwangoda and other areas was unleashed by those who cannot politically survive in a free and inclusive society. These politicians have been looking for a new scapegoat and their political careers thrive on hatred. Sadly these individuals have systematically used the Easter Sunday attacks to plant suspicion in the hearts of Sri Lankans. By Stories of forced sterilization, proliferation of "Buy Sinhala" Facebook groups and shaming of children using "Atlas" products, they want us all to feel victimized and threatened by our neighbour to perpetuate the dark fear we felt on April 21st. These stories paint a narrow form of

nationalism that politicians also advance by drawing fantasies about the SOFA and MCC Agreement with the Untied States of America.

Sir, I would like, for a moment, to talk about the MCC Agreement. The MCC Agreement was pioneered by Prof. Ricardo Hausmann of Harvard University, identifying two key binding constraints on Sri Lankas growth. One is economic growth because of weak transport infrastructure and the other is, land administration practices.

The transport project is budgeted at US Dollars 350 million and aims to improve urban and rural mobility in the Western, Central, Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces. First, it will reduce traffic congestion and improve public transportation in the Colombo Metropolitan Region. Getting transport right will make Colombo a more livable, well-functioning city with better connectivity.

The land project is budgeted at US Dollars 67 million and aims to expand and improve the existing GOSL initiatives to increase the availability of land rights. This project will help identify underutilized State lands and maximize rents from State lands. Most importantly, it certifies each individuals right to the land that they own. Digitizing deeds will make them less vulnerable to damage, theft and loss. This is what the MCC project is about and it has been discussed over a long period of time, since 2016.

Sir, there has been a lot of public scrutiny regarding ACSA - Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement. This was first signed by Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2007 and the details of that Agreement were not made public. We have extended and re-signed it and the details have still not been made public.

SOFA is another agreement. It is important to note that both these Agreements are standard Agreements that the USA has made with many other countries. These Agreements have been signed with nearly 100 countries. Our Government will not sign an agreement which is detrimental to the citizens of this country. We have not signed the SOFA, and the public debate on SOFA is welcome.

Being nationalistic and outward-looking are not mutually exclusive. Racism and fear disguised as nationalism have been used as a political tool. There is no room for racism in a peaceful and thriving society. Even as we see a global rise of intolerant governments that use racist rhetoric, the people in every such country of the world have continued to speak out against it. Governments will change, sometimes quite unexpectedly as we saw recently, but people and the society that they chose to make for themselves will remain.

Sir, I am reminded of a story some 40 years ago of the United States of America. When the United States of America was a very racist society, Martin Luther King spoke out against discrimination against the Black. It was his dream that has come about. He said, We must

1391 1392

[ ]

2019 11

learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools. We must come to see that the end we seek is a society at peace with itself, a society that can live with its conscience.

I want to wind up my speech with this, Sir. I was also a foreign student in a different land before I came back for my postgraduate education. A black African student had come to the United States of America and had given birth to a child through a white woman. But, when he returned to his home country, that black child had the opportunity of becoming the President of the United States of America. We must create unity, equality and peace. That is the Sri Lanka we must create. Mahatma Gandhi said, An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.

Let us together create meritocracy. Everything must not depend on age and experience only, but let us create meritocracy. Whenever there is a promotion or an appointment, it must be made based on merit. Let us look at people and see whether they are fit and proper for the task that is ahead.

I am calling upon this House to defeat this Motion of No-Confidence. Thank you, Sir, for the time extended to me.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti. Before he starts, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. (Mrs.) Sriyani Wijewickrama to the Chair?

[4.49 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Madam Chair, I thank you for the opportunity given to me to participate in the Debate on the No-Confidence Motion moved by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna against the Government.

The No-Confidence Motion attempts to lay the entire blame of the Easter Sunday attacks on the Prime Minister and the Cabinet and accuses them of failing to take steps to prevent the occurrence of these terrorist attacks.

Before I comment on the contents of the Motion, please permit me to make a few preliminary remarks on the situation that exists in the country after the horrible attacks that targeted innocent Christian worshippers in churches as well as tourists in our high-end hotels.

April 21, 2019 is a black day in the history of the country. No amount of words can remove the pain of the victims and their families. The least we, as a nation, can do for them is to ensure that never again an incident like this would take place in this country. While the Catholic and Christian community has endured their ordeal with dignified patience, it is unfortunate that there are other evil forces trying to capitalize on the situation and are spreading hate and venom against the Muslim community in order to achieve their own vested interests.

On the one hand, some religious personalities are going round the country uttering half-truths and untruths that create fear and suspicion in the minds of the ordinary Sinhalese. On the other hand, there are politicians who are spreading communal sentiments in pursuit of their electoral agenda. There are also business interests who are attempting to further their own objectives by creating baseless stories against businesses owned by Muslims.

1437 1438

Apart from the damage caused to religious harmony by all these campaigns, these will also result in long-term damage to the economy of the country. It is, therefore, imperative that the Government takes immediate steps to curb the actions of these destructive forces.

Coming back to the No-Confidence Motion itself, I must stress that the events of 21st April could not be prevented because of a system failure as opposed to a governmental failure. Although there was evidence available to the intelligence services for several years before this Government came to power that there were some individuals who were indulging in unacceptable behaviour, no action was taken. These individuals had several brushes with the law and had warrants issued against them, but no action against them was forthcoming.

One cannot blame this Government alone for the system not getting activated. In the final analysis, it is the responsibility of the Government to ensure safety and security of the people. What the Government needs to do is to ensure that systems are strengthened so that in a given situation, they can immediately respond without waiting for political direction. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet were unaware of the buildup to the attacks on April 21, 2019 because the Prime Minister was kept out of the Security Council Meetings since October, 2018.

It must be remembered that in the absence of the President who was out of the country, it was the Prime Minister who took control of the situation and immediate action to bring back a degree of normalcy. What we should do is, not take political advantage, but get together as a country to strengthen systems as well as initiate new steps to prevent a recurrence of any form of terrorism. Unfortunately, instead of engaging in this national task, we only see attempts to demonize the Muslim community and spread communal disharmony despite the active support rendered by the Muslims to the security forces to dismantle the terrorist network and arrest the remaining suspects. Additionally, we see a campaign made by various vested interests as well as religious personalities who are now trying to spread hate among the Sinhalese and attempting to drive a wedge between Muslims and Tamils.

Madam, I wish to take this opportunity to call upon the Government to reassure the Muslim community that their safety and security will be ensured. The Muslim community will stand together with the Sinhalese and Tamil communities in protecting and rebuilding this country, as we have done for centuries. We cannot go on a destructive path. We must build national unity and as a country, we must march forward unitedly to correct the mistakes of the past and move ahead. I, therefore, call upon all Hon. Members to vote against this No-Confidence Motion.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan.

( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. Might I know how many minutes I have, Sir?

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have seven minutes. [5.43 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Sir, we are debating the Vote of No-Confidence against the current Government based on material relating to one event, the Easter Sunday Attack on 21st of April. There can be no question that the Government needs to be condemned, particularly on account of its failure to act despite information made available to the Government by a friendly, neighbouring country. But, we are concerned about the fact that governance is related to a wide range of issues.

One important question that does arise is what happens when the Government loses the confidence of the House. Under the Constitution, the Government must remit office. At the 2015 General Election, people changed the Government; they changed their President. There were several reasons for what has happened. There was a very, very serious violation of human rights in all parts of the country: civil and political rights, economic, social and cultural rights. That was the main reason for the people to bring about a change in the Government. The minority people, the Tamil people in particular, were largely victimized. They had a reason to vote the way they did. The position of the present Government is perhaps, on certain fronts, particularly human rights, better than under the former Government, may not be to our complete satisfaction, but certainly better. If the Government is to be changed and a new Government is to come to office, we do not know what the policies of the new Government are. The Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa was the former President, former Prime Minister and currently, he is the Leader of the Opposition. He may try to come to office, but he has not outlined to the country and to the minority Tamil people in particular, what the

policies of the new Government will be. There have been no enunciation of the proposed policies by the new Government. How can we take a decision consciously to bring down the present Government, which, as I said before, at least on the human rights front, is performing better than the previous Government? We have been sent to Parliament to protect the rights of our people.

A General Election is due, in any event, in a short time. All the people in this country will decide who will govern then. The Government, under the Constitution, has been elected for a certain period in office. Overall, are the circumstances such that we feel compelled to make a contribution that brings about a change in Government? That is the main question we have to address. Overall, are the circumstances of such a nature that we feel compelled to subscribe to bring about a change in Government? It is in these circumstances that we have to take a decision.

We have to be cautious. It is not that we do not have complaints against the present Government. We have several complaints against the present Government. In fact, this morning in front of my House in Trincomalee, there has been a demonstration by some youth who say Mr. Sampanthan is unable to get jobs for us from this Government. Why is he supporting this Government? We want him today to vote against the Government. So, our people, our youth who have been victimized for decades on the question of employment are not receiving justice even under the present Government and that is the complaint that we are very concerned about.

Sir, we have nothing against the SLFP. As far as the UNP and the SLFP are concerned, those are the two main political parties in this country. As far as the SLPP is concerned, it is a new political party. We do not know their thinking; we do not know what their policies are. We have to wait and see. But, we must impress upon the leadership of the SLPP that they need to enunciate their policies, particularly on the minority question, the Tamil question, to the people of the country - particularly to the minority people and more particularly, to the Tamil people of the North and the East. We need to know what their policies are and that is what the SLPP has thus far failed to do. As far as the SLFP is concerned, we have supported SLFP presidential candidates against UNP candidates. We have supported the SLFP to bring down the UNP Government.

The late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike was the first Sinhalese leader who signed an agreement - a pact - with a Tamil leader, the late Hon. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam to create regional councils, keep power over land and establish regional councils with sufficient adequate devolved power to enable them to govern the territories in which the Tamil people lived. We are mindful of all these, Sir.

Of course, we will be voting in a short while, we will make a decision and with divine assistance, we do hope that we will make the right decision.

Thank you.

. . , . what the Mauritian Prime Minister Kumar Jugnauth stated about the International Court of Justice's opinion on Chagos Archipelogo. He says, "General Assembly Welcomes the International Court of Justice (ICJ) Opinion on Chagos Archipelogo, chain of Islands, and adopts non-binding Text calling for the Mauritius Complete Decolonization. Chagos includes the all important military base of 'Diego Garcia', known to be the 'unsinkable aircraft carrier' of the Indian Ocean." What happened at the UN? We kicked the Non-Aligned Policy. , . The UK, the US, Hungary, Israel, Australia and the Maldives voted against the Motion and perhaps the biggest blow was that most of the UK's key allies, including France and Germany abstained from voting and also Sri Lanka.

Sir, I would not take a long time but in conclusion, I quote what the Daily Mirror of 10th July, 2019 states in its headlines:

HSBC paints gloomy economic outlook for Sri Lanka :

* Cuts growth outlook to 2.7%, slowest since 2001 citing policy and political issues

* Says recovery unlikely until key elections held to end current political impasse

* Notes that recent concerns over national security likely to be a further drag on growth recovery

, . , . . we have lost confidence. This is what has happened to the Colombo Business Association, which carries a membership of over 55,000 business entrepreneurs. With the prevailing situation, they were promised five demands. Their delegation met the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister and the Governor of the Central Bank. When they met the President, the following issues were discussed: issues with regard to the Sancharaka Podda loan scheme via RDB. This loan scheme will have to be repaid in three years with the ability for initial instalments to be adjusted to as little as Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 12,000 per year. Even though the Central Bank issued a relief package under Sancharaka Podda, the banks are not providing any relief in toto. Moreover, they discussed about the repossessing and auctioning of any properties and vehicles due to late or non-repayment of loans and leases by enterprises affected by the Easter attacks. The President and the CBSL discussed to issue a fresh circular to banks and finance companies to temporarily avoid repossessing and auctioning of properties and vehicles. , . , , 55,000 . . ; . . . .
