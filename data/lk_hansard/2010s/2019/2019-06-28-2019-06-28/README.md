PERSONAL EXPLANATION BY HON. DINESH

GUNAWARDENA

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , Ceylon Today ; the Ceylon Today has reported my speech out of context.

. . "" out of context .

Sir, I want to bring this to your notice. The Ceylon Today in page one reports under the caption Presidents refusal to testify before Easter Attack PSC: Parliamentary procedures flouted - Gunawardena.

I quote:

"President Maithripala Sirisenas recent remark that he would not testify before the Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) on the 21 April Easter Sunday Terror Attacks shows that Parliamentary procedures are not respected and followed, UPFA Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena said yesterday (27) in Parliament.

Gunawardena, participating in the debate on extending the state of emergency

I do not want to read the whole thing. Sir, I brought this to your notice and showed the relevant context.

The Hansard Department already has the unedited copy of my speech, which is clear.

. , " . , " . , - Then, I quoted PSC on Easter attacks: a drama rehearsed at Temple Trees: Prez, which was the title of a news report that appeared in the "Daily Mirror" of 27th June.

Then, I quoted the main lines of the Presidents interview as reported in that article in the "Daily Mirror", which are as follows:

* says he had not been summoned before it and would never go

before it " This is the Presidents statement. Then, it also states, I quote:

" * 19A is an NGO conspiracy and a curse on the country

* Totally against SOFA with US

Those are the main lines, the highlights of the President's statement yesterday. Also, he has said that the Attorney-General. - this is the issue, I think - had advised him that this inquiry is sub judice......". There had been so many times when the Speakers of this Parliament had given Rulings on matters sub judice.

Then, I went on to say, "......and he has informed about that to the Hon. Speaker". That is, the President. In my speech, I also went on to say that the House does not know what the letter is about. I think the Hon. Leader of the House also agreed with me when I asked about that from the Chair. Then, I said, "The Hon. Speaker has not informed us...." - that is, Parliament - "...... whether he was informed by the President of the country". The Hon. Leader of the House also wanted to know about that. I continued saying, "Yes, we would like to know; both sides would like to know what is sub judice. Today, the Hon. Leader of the House raised this" and so on.

Now, the issue of sub judice has been totally dropped; what I said has been totally taken out of context by the relevant press reporter. I do not want to complain to anyone about that because they are also under stress. The

863 864

Government is under stress; the President is under stress; the Prime Minister is under stress; the Speaker is under stress and obviously, the journalists are, too.

Therefore, I would like you to advise the relevant newspaper. "" . . "" , . , ? . . , ,- [ ]

The "Daily FT gives a correct report and so does the "Daily Mirror. So, it cannot be a mistake. These are very well manipulated to mislead the country. I do not want to make any allegations against the press reporter in Parliament.

Today's Daily FTin its article titled "President-PM stand-off bringing country to collapse: Opposition" states, I quote:

Tension between the President and Prime Minister has led the country to the verge of collapse, charged United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday in Parliament. Joining the debate on extending Emergency Regulations for another 30 days,

Sir, I do not want to quote the whole thing. So, those are the matters which I quoted very clearly. No one can make a mistake of this text. So, I would like the relevant newspaper to follow the Hansard copy, which is now available and make this correction in their reporting today. I think you might be able to direct that newspaper, Sir.

We would also like to know, Sir, about this issue that the Parliament is faced with, which the President has referred to. The President says that he has been informed by the Attorney-General that this is sub judice and the letter was sent to the Hon. Speaker. Why is the Hon. Speaker not telling us about that? At least show the letter to the Party Leaders or the Parliament. So many questions raised by the Hon. Members of the House had been rejected by the Chair saying, "Do not to proceed to ask those questions because those were sub judice. But here, the Hon. Speaker seems to be not informing Parliament of the opinion of the Attorney-General of the country. According to the Constitution, his opinion is normally taken into consideration by the House. Whether we agree with it or not, is another matter. We can criticize, but always the Speaker as well as the President and the Prime Minister have sought the opinion of the Attorney-General. Has the Attorney-General sent such a letter to His Excellency the President? Has the letter been delivered to the Hon. Speaker? If so, can the Hon. Deputy Speaker - I know the Hon. Speaker is not here - read the relevant letter, so that this matter could be cleared before the House?

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) He will be here in the afternoon.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Also, the Hon. Prime Minister, at the time of passing the Emergency Regulations yesterday, was not present in the House. There was a deliberate attempt by the Government not to pass the Emergency Regulations yesterday. If not for the MPs of the Opposition, the Emergency Regulations would not have been passed yesterday, which means the Emergency Regulations would have lapsed last night and the consequences of such a situation would have been very bad, and the dangers that could have been brough upon are very well understood by us. The Prime Minister has a chopper; the Speaker has a helicopter. Whether he was in the high seas or international waters is irrelevant for us, but the Prime Minister could have come.

I am making this request to the Hon. Leader of the House. When you fixed the date for the Debate on the extension of the Emergency Regulations to be taken up yesterday, the Government, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet knew that. But no Cabinet Minister was present except for the Hon. Leader of the House and the Hon. Minister of Tourism Development, Wild Life and Christian Religious Affairs. - [Interruption.] Yes, I appreciate that, I told you yesterday. They were the only two Ministers present in the front Benches, which shows that the deliberate attempt of the Government was to see that the Emergency Regulations were not approved by the House, which is a very dangerous situation. The conflict with the President - [Interruption.] No, very clearly, the conflict with the President is a dangerous situation for the country. - [Interruption.] We mustered the Quorum yesterday.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) We have that confidence. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You have the confidence, I know. You, my dear Friend, will have the confidence, but this is a dangerous situation for the country. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Will you kindly let the Hon. Leader of the House answer that question?
