asked the Minister of City Planning, Water Supply and Higher Education:

(a) Will he state-

(i) whether it is possible for administrations of universities to authorize signing agreements in secret with private companies; and

(ii) whether it is possible to provide the results of a research to a private company for a minimal amount like Rs.100, as the value of the results of a research cannot be determined prior to commencing the research?

(b) Will he inform this House-

(i) whether the Council of University of Moratuwa has entered into an agreement with the private company called CodeGen on 06.02.2017 for a research on artificial intelligence;

(ii) whether the two parties have agreed to provide the result of that research to the said company for a sum of Rs.100 as per that agreement;

(iii) why the academic staff of the University was not informed of the content of the agreement prior to signing it;

(iv) whether a lecture hall assigned for students educational purposes has been provided for the use of the relevant company because of this agreement;

(v) if so, for what purpose;

(vi) why providing a lecture hall has been included in the agreement; and

(vii) the date on which this agreement and its impact will be inquired into by the Committee on Public Enterprises?

(c) If not, why? ( , ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning, Water Supply and Higher Education) , .

( ) (The Hon.Rauff Hakeem) Actually, though the Ministry is asked to reply Questions, universities have a certain amount of autonomy. We do not interfere in everything that they do. Since artificial intelligence is a new area, the university management or the particular faculty, has, in their own wisdom, come to a decision to sign an agreement with whoever, and that power is there for the universities to do that; that is being given under the Universities Act. As the Ministry, we cannot be looking into every minor detail. So, what I could do is to get this agreement down and furnish it for your examination and if there is any wrongdoing, then we can instruct them to correct it. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Yes. Sir, I want to make one last comment with your permission. I understand that there should be autonomy and that the Ministry does not interfere with everything that happens there. But, when a Member of Parliament raises an issue as the one that I have raised, then you have to go into it fully in order to find out the justification for this agreement, the concessions given to this particular company, whatever losses the university has incurred as a result of allocating space for this company, the result of this entire research project and what it ultimately came to about.

Thank you.
