, . .. . : 2019 01 "" : 2019 01 " " PRIVILEGE : DEFAMATORY PUBLICATIONS IN "DAILY MIRROR" NEWSPAPER OF 1ST MAY, 2019 .. ( .. ) (The Hon.M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you Hon. Speaker for permitting me to raise this Question of Privilege today.

All of us are aware of the tragic events of Easter Sunday, 21st of April 2019, when several suicide bombers caused havoc in our country. We are also aware that intelligence information on the impending attacks were

503 504

2019 09

available but not acted upon, that no effort was taken to prevent the said attacks.

There have also been allegations that some politicians knew this but did not warn others. In this context, there was a publication in the front page of the Daily Mirror of 01st May, 2019 under "Political Gossip" which stated that I had planned to attend the Easter Service at Zion Church, Batticaloa, but had refrained from doing so since the Leader of the Opposition, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, had warned me not to attend that Service as he had intelligence information that this church was likely to come under a bomb attack.

This is an absolute lie; very dangerous in the circumstances. It was citing a conversation I had with the Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament canteen. On seeing this, I publicly stated that this was untrue and that I had attended an Easter Service in Colombo as usual and that I did not have any plans to go to Batticaloa for Easter and also that the Opposition Leader had not given me any such warning prior to the bomb attacks.

The next day, that is 02nd May, 2019, the Daily Mirror published yet another news under "Political Gossip" called Clarification which stated that the Leader of the Opposition had in fact warned me on Monday 22nd April, 2019 about a mob attack and that the previous day's gossip was about this subsequent backlash, as they called it, and it regretted the translation error. This is also false since the Opposition Leader did not tell me anything about a mob attack or any backlash at any time.

I am tabling * copies of the said two publications for the record. The aforesaid two publications have cast serious aspersions on my conduct as a Member of Parliament misquoting conversations in the Parliament canteen and thus have violated my Privileges as a Member of Parliament. This is, in addition to being very dangerous in the current circumstances, leading people to believe that I had prior knowledge of the bomb attacks and also imaginary mob violence, backlash et cetera.

I urge the Hon. Speaker to please take stern action against this newspapers rash and unethical conduct which has resulted in the breach of my Privilege among many other dangerous consequences.

Sir, I also wish to state that the Fourth Estate, the media, has a very positive role to play in circumstances like this. This is not just my Privilege as a Member of Parliament, there are serious aspersions cast on various Members of Parliament, rumors that Members of Parliament knew of these attacks and so on. So this is a breach of Privilege, I think, of the whole House and media ought to be circumspect about what they publish. This can lead to very serious consequences. Today, people do not believe in mainstream media and that is why they are getting their news from social media in a context such as this.

My complaint is not just that false information has been published, my complaint is also that the media has not taken on the responsibility that is theirs, particularly in situations like this.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you.

Yes, Hon. Leader of the House. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I would like to suport the Hon. Sumanthiran. This Daily Mirror gossip column is in yellow. It publishes absolute rubbish defaming Members of Parliament, defaming Chairmen of Corporations and when you question them the answer they give is worse, just like in this case involving Hon. Sumanthiran. So I think you should call them. They are defaming and insulting everybody. This yellow column is absolute gossip and it is not supported by any factual evidence. So I think you should call them up, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) I will see what can be done. I will also ask the Secretary-General to convey the contents of todays Proceedings, because the seriousness of it must be made known to them.

"That the Order made by the Minister of Finance and Mass Media under Section 2 of the Special Commodity Levy Act, No. 48 of 2007 relating to Special Commodity Levy and published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2104/30 of 03rd January 2019, which was presented on 29.03.2019, be approved.

(Cabinet approval signified.)"

Sir, there was a reference earlier to a former Cabinet Minister regarding business transactions. We have passed a Code of Conduct for the Hon. Members of Parliament and I think the Code of Conduct that we have passed should take effect. My personal view is, Cabinet Ministers, past, present or future, should not have direct business interests or be involved in businesses. -[Interruption.] Yes, I agree. We have some agreement across the House here. I think this needs to be actually practised and we need to change the practices of the Government. We should not have conflicts of interest. Cabinet is the highest decision-making body in the country. Therefore, the Hon. Members who have decided to accept offers to become Cabinet Ministers - ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Without knowing the correct facts, it is very unreasonable to cast aspersions on another Hon. Member who had been in Parliament for a long time. Hon. Speaker, when an Hon. Member is appointed a Cabinet Minister, if he is a businessman or a Chairman of one of his companies, usually he resigns and allows someone else to take over. So, that is the case and the case law has decided on that long before. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I agree with the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa and my reference is not to the former Minister. That is why I have not even mentioned the name. I am making a wider point: past, present or future. We have a Code of Conduct. It must be followed, particularly by the Cabinet Ministers, for Cabinet is the highest decision-making body. Otherwise, in some way or other, we will run into some kind of a conflict. These practices are there all over the world. So, I think, they must take effect and we should strictly follow them.

Hon. Speaker, there are three things to be taken up today. If I were to give a quick background detail of them, one is relating to a Regulation under the Foreign Exchange Act. As per Section 7(1) of the Foreign Exchange Act, No. 12 of 2017, the Minister shall, in consultation with the Monetary Board and with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers, authorize by regulations, the permitted class or classes of capital transaction in foreign exchange. Under this Section, through Regulation No.1 published in the Government Gazette Notification No. 2045/56 of 17th November, 2017, the Minister is authorizing capital transactions. However, in the said Gazette, no specific permission has been granted for the Government of Sri Lanka - GOSL- and the State-Owned Enterprises of the Government of Sri Lanka -SOEs- to borrow in designated foreign currency from foreign sources. As there is no permission granted for GOSL or SOEs to borrow from foreign sources by the regulation stated above, we have taken necessary actions to incorporate such permission into the paragraph A(1)(f) of the proposed amendments to the said

Gazette Notification. However, at the discussions we have had in the Treasury, it has been revealed that there are practical difficulties that the Department of External Resources had to experience in terms of facilitating borrowings to be made by GOSL and SOEs. Due to the practical difficulty in bringing in proceeds through an Inward Investment Account of the lender, it was decided to remove such conditions for the loans borrowed by the Government of Sri Lanka and State-Owned Enterprises of the Government from foreign sources. However, for information purposes, on all inward and outward foreign currency, a reporting requirement was introduced.

So, I am basically moving this in the House today to be adopted.

Then, there is an Order under the Special Commodity Levy Act.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . [3.44p.m.] ( , ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning, Water Supply and Higher Education) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, we have heard many

emotional and sentimental outbursts in this House ever since this serious and dastardly suicide attack took place.

Today we are discussing under Regulations and Orders that are being debated in this House once again the plight of this countrys economy. It is not a secret that one of the targets of those terrorists as well as their handlers was to create a serious impact on the revival of our countrys economy. So, that was evident from the manner in which several hotels were made targets of these terrorists. In that background, I must congratulate the State Minister of Finance and the Ministry for having formulated a relief scheme for the tourism industry in particular so that they can bounce back to their normalcy.

However, we must also bear in mind the fact that while we have given relief to those involved directly in the tourism industry to a certain extent, there are a variety of other enterprises and businesses that have backward linkages with the tourism sector. We can name a number of them, particularly restaurants, gem and jewellery business people, arts and crafts people, entertainment people, normal taxi drivers, auto drivers and a variety of such people are also affected. So we may have to look at how we can bring all those affected people with backward linkages to the tourism industry as well to enjoy some relief package so that they can get over their livelihood issues that they are compelled to face because of this unfortunate incident.

Together with that, we must also remember that there are certain other sectors of the economy that are not too seriously affected. We have had a bumper harvest and the agriculture sector is not bound to be affected unnecessarily. With the Yala Season, if we can have a better harvest, we could use that to mitigate this situation to a certain extent. Similarly, the manufacturing sector and the industrial sector though somewhat affected, it is not as seriously affected as the tourism sector. Therefore, the manufacturers and industrialists of this country must redouble their efforts to increase the export volume so that we can, to a certain extent, try and bridge the gap and that would definitely be bringing a serious impact on the economy. So with that in mind, it is also pertinent for us to note that every time we impose Emergency Regulations and a State of Emergency in the country, that also to a certain extent, blunts the ability of our law enforcement mechanism to properly investigate matters because they resort to very short-term summary measures that are provided without proper legal scrutiny. So this also should be borne in mind. Now we see that all over the country panic buttons are pushed and people are living in tension.

It is time for us now to de-escalate this tension and get back to normalcy. In this regard, it is important for us to remember that there is a responsibility cast on the media also in this country. Now if you look at the electronic media today, they are sensationalizing news. They are looking for news that could bring further fear and harm to the country. So this also must be handled properly. To a certain extent, warnings have been given. I hope our media fraternity would be a little more

571 572

considerate about the need to de-escalate the tension in the country and not to sensationalize issues. I see all over search operations are conducted. When search operations are conducted, in certain areas, we see those who are going for the search operations are going with video cameras and cameras in tow. This must be avoided. What is important for us is to unearth the truth. Towards that, much has been done and maybe, a little more needs to be done. But in the meantime, we need not unnecessarily sensationalize every trivial incident. What is happening today is, this is adding to the fear psychosis in the country. As a result, today schools are empty. Children are not being sent to schools by their parents. Work places are also facing high absenteeism. Therefore, the entire economy is going to suffer because of an unnecessarily heightened state of security alert. Now it is time for us to de-escalate things. Towards de-escalation, the security forces also have to contribute by trying to be much more balanced in their approach. While not compromising on the need to maintain security in the country we also need to be a little more considerate in giving publicity to every trivial incident that may happen when we go on a search operation to a particular area.

Now, much has been spoken about the knives, swords and all kinds of cutting equipment that have been found in search operations. I cannot see what is so surprising about this. Particular localities where Muslim community reside have been undergoing a combing operation with the focus on unearthing any offensive material that may be found. True enough, whatever that has been found has to be investigated properly and action should be taken. But what is happening today is that exposure to some of these issues is creating an impression as if this countrys Muslim community has been waiting to cut and chop the entire countrys population. The fact is far from that. If you really go and do search operations in other parts of the country where other communities live, you will find equal number of similar items everywhere. This is not to be blown out of proportion creating an unnecessary fear psychosis. We must also remember, in any society, there will be criminal elements and there will be some people who are storing items for their self-defence purposes. This normally happens in a country where we have faced violence all the time. So this should not be interpreted to mean that everybody was waiting to engage in terrorist activities in the country. This is very unfortunate.

It is also necessary for the security forces to see that they do not unnecessarily abuse the Prevention of Terrorism Act. I am sure, in many places, they have acted with a lot of responsibility and avoided putting everybody into one bundle and putting everybody in under the PTA. Instead of that, normal laws should be resorted to where it is appropriate and if the suspicion is not too serious, we could always resort to the normal law. What is happening in law enforcement is, whenever there is a long period of Emergency, the security forces and the law enforcement authorities also get acclimatized to a situation where they even forget how to file cases during the times of normalcy. They have always been used to dispensing with the necessary procedures that has to be adopted in a proper investigation and their entire ability to investigate also gets blunted in the process. Therefore, the

Emergency does not always help a situation. It is an extraordinary power that is vested in the forces to meet an extraordinary situation. That is why the Public Security Ordinance was promulgated. The Public Security Ordinance is not brought into force at every whim and fancy of the political authority. Only when there is a situation where the country faces a serious security risk that we promulgate or bring in the Emergency Regulations. Those must be used proportionately and not unnecessarily so that they bundle everybody together. So, this must be brought to light particularly in view of what is happening today all over the country.

The Muslim community as a whole has begun to have a serious introspection about our own conduct. We are all astounded and are in shock as to how such a murderous and heinous cult could have ever existed among us and using religion for such a terrible crime is a matter of shame for all of us. Therefore, it is time for us to look at these issues with serious introspection and try and prevent such a tendency from developing.

In the meantime, it is also up to the security forces and the police to see that they would not be lumping everybody together. There are a vast number of innocent people who have had to face serious social stigma by the arrests that are taking place. Fair enough. If you have found something offensive, arrest them, inquire them and then, if it is found to be a matter of having something for which they do not offer a proper explanation, have a proper investigation, but then file the B Report so that they would be able to get bail and be released without having to be locked up for too long. That is very important for us because that should not create a fertile ground for radicalization. It is very important for us to bear that in mind. Overreaction to an issue is also creating an unnecessary panic in the country. That has to be avoided.

Mr. Presiding Member, whenever there has been Emergency, there has been abuses. Abuse takes place when there is excessive power vested in law enforcement authorities. In this situation, it is necessary for us to empower our security forces and the police to have these extensive powers. But, while we give them the extensive powers, they must mindful to use those powers sparingly and to the extent necessary and not disproportionately to harass the people. That is what I thought I must highlight because that also impinges on law and order in this country. Law and order is necessary for us to create normalcy in the country. Normalcy will finally result in bringing back the economy to its original position. So, in that regard, these matters must be very carefully borne in mind.

I must thank the Army Commander in particular for having highlighted the fact that their security operations and search operations are being conducted in an effective and efficient manner, the people can get back to normalcy and there is no threat of bombs going off anymore. The Army Commander himself has very diligently highlighted this fact, but despite him saying that, people are still unable to come back to normalcy and it is high time that the political authorities also take charge of the situation and try to quickly de-escalate this matter.

As far as the Ministry of City Planning, Water Supply and Higher Education is concerned, it has notified all the Vice Chancellors of universities today to begin a process of opening universities from 13th onwards. We have told them to open those from Monday onwards - they have their discretion - after having satisfied themselves with a thorough search of the entire university premises. You know, Sir, that universities are in very vast properties, extensive areas. We have got to search every nook and corner of the entire 15 national universities. So, if every higher educational institute is to be checked, it is going to take a little time. But, that has been happening for the last two weeks and we would rather wish that by next week, the process of reopening universities could be started, at least in sections. If there are certain difficulties in opening the entire university, we have asked them to consider opening faculty by faculty to start their academic courses .

It is important for us to somehow get back to normalcy and not feed into the unnecessary panic that has been set in. That is the only way in which we can recover and teach a lesson to that hidden hand which caused this heinous crime in this country that we will never succumb to the designs of these mad terrorists who targeted our nation. It is unfortunate that that small cult was from within our community. I am coming from a press conference where the religious leaders of the Muslim community, the civil society leaders and us, the political leaders, all together addressed the media and gave the same message to the entire nation that the Muslim community has come forward to have a very serious introspection about all matters concerning our community, where unnecessary suspicions have been aroused among our brother communities in the country. We are ready to open a dialogue on every issue so that these suspicions will also be put to rest and we will be able to live as one nation. This motherland has to be saved from this hidden hand, which has decided to destabilize us.

This has happened every now and then and this time, thankfully the situation is calm, if not for the political leadership quarrelling among ourselves. Even in this House, I see that the Opposition and the Government are still finger pointing at each other and are not coming together. At times of national crisis, it is incumbent on all of us to unite and to have a unified approach towards a calamity such as this. Unfortunately, that is absent when you look at the debates during the past few days. We need to realize the fact that it is time that we all unite and get back to normalcy as fast as possible. That is the only way in which we can teach a lesson to those who had been bent on plunging our country back to the days of darkness.

Thank you very much, Sir. [.. 4.01] ( ) (The Hon.Shehan Semasinghe)

Diversity is our strength and we must use it to the maximum. But, this unfortunate situation, which was unfold, is where we basically need to start. 71 , . 21 ? .

Let me just transgress into the particular text, which I read a little while ago. The Easter Sunday attack is telling a lesson for all humanity. Exclusivism leads to extremism and extremism leads to violence. We all should pledge

617 618

not to support or entertain exclusive education institutions in Sri Lanka. It should become mandatory for Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and Christians to study together and learn each others faiths. If we do not learn from a tragedy of such magnitude, scale and intensity, we will shed more tears and blood in the coming months and years. We have no design to develop schools and institutions of higher learning where we study as one nation. Those who attacked our nation on that day were not influenced by Sri Lankan Islam. They were not part of Sri Lankan Muslim either. They were influenced by an ideology foreign to our country and our forefathers. The attackers did not practise traditional and local Islam inherited by Muslims and practised for generations. We should be very careful of introducing religious practices from abroad especially from the Middle East. We should foster local and traditional Islam and reverse resolutely the exclusivism which breeds suspicion, prejudice, resentment, hatred and violence.
