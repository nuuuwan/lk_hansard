[10.35a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) Hon. Deputy Chairman, we are debating today the Vote on the Ministry of Internal and Home Affairs and

Provincial Councils and Local Government. It is an important Ministry, under the purview of which come various important functions of Government.

We have the district administrations in several districts coming under the control of this Ministry. We also have Government Agents and District Secretaries in our different districts and Divisional Secretaries in charge of various Divisional Secretaries' Divisions in the whole country demarcated districtwise under this. Therefore, it must be said that this Ministry is a very important Ministry. The Government Agent and the District Secretary also coordinate activities between the Central Government and the Provincial Government - the Central Administration and the Provincial Administration - and they play an important role as a link between those two different branches of governance in this country.

Provincial councils also come under this Ministry. In fact, the system of provincial councils constitutionally initiated the sharing of powers of governance in this country for the first time under the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution was the beginning of a political journey towards a political solution within a united, undivided, indivisible Sri Lanka ensuring the unity, the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of the country, but at the same time, ensuring that powers of governance were shared in such a way that the people in this country had a sense of belonging, they had a sense of belonging that they belong to this country and that this country belongs to them. The provincial councils were intended to give the people of different provinces a measure of self-respect and dignity by being able to share the powers of governance. That journey has not yet been completed. In fact, this Parliament has converted itself into a Constitutional Assembly in order to be able to complete that journey. But, I think we are stuck somewhere and that is not a good thing for the country. That obstacle must be removed and we must get through with the programme that Parliament unanimously initiated when it adopted a Resolution to convert itself into a Constitutional Assembly in order to give this country a new Constitution primarily dealing with three questions: the abolition of the Executive Presidency, sharing of powers of governance in this country and third, the electoral reform in such a way to ensure that elections were democratic and that people were able to return their representatives in keeping with their democratic wish.

It is unfortunate, in a sense, Sir, that the provincial council elections have not been held. I am in complete agreement with the Joint Opposition. I heard my honourable Colleague, the Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma, referring to the provincial council elections. In fact, he referred to me and wanted to know what our position is. We want the provincial council elections held as early as possible - that is our position - in the whole country including the Tamil areas of the North and the East. Provincial council elections must be held because whatever powers of governance have been shared must be shared by the people in a democratic way. Unless elections are held and members are elected to the provincial councils by the people, by the voters, in the

2589 2590

different provinces and the provincial governments and provincial Cabinets including the Chief Minister and Ministers are democratically chosen by the people, there can be no democratic governance. Governors cannot play that role. That role must be played by the provincial council, its members, the Chief Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers. Therefore, Sir, we urge that the provincial council elections be held as early as possible.

We have some little problems in the Eastern Province in regard to Divisional Secretaries' Divisions. I think there is no serious problem. I am happy that the Hon. H.M.M. Harees, Member of Parliament from Ampara, is here. We should sit down with the Hon. Minister, discuss these matters and come to an acceptable solution. There is one thing I want to say. Sir, I am quoting from the official website of the Department of Census and Statistics of Sri Lanka, in terms of which, in this country, we have a total number of 25 districts, 331 DS Divisions in all the districts and a total of 14,021 Grama Niladhari Divisions in all the districts. One of the Divisional Secretaries' Divisions referred to in the Ampara District is the Kalmunai Tamil Division, which has got 29 Grama Niladhari Divisions. The official website of the Department of Census and Statistics has stated this categorically. There is another division called the Kalmunai Division, which also has 29 Grama Niladhari Divisions. But, unfortunately, it seems that over a long period of time, the Kalmunai Tamil Division has not been given all the powers. There are Divisional Secretaries' Divisions entitled to, particularly land powers and financial powers. This is a matter where, again, there is a problem. If we all sit together with the Hon. Minister and the Hon. Prime Minister, we can resolve it. There is no real problem. The decision has already been made and it must be implemented. Land powers and financial powers must be given to that Divisional Secretarys Division and they must become functional.

We also have a problem, Sir, in regard to the Divisional Secretaries' Divisions of Mutur and Thoppur in Trincomalee. We can settle all that. That is not a big problem. We should deal with these matters in such a way that while we serve the interests of all the people, we do not in any way offend or prejudice the interests of any particular people. As long as the interests of all the people are equally served on the basis of justice, equality and fair play, there is no need for us to be concerned about the little differences that can be sorted out.

Before I conclude, Sir, I want to draw the attention of the Hon. Minister to a request made by all the Members of Parliament from the Trincomalee District, that the Government Agent, Trincomalee, whose term is due to expire shortly, be allowed to serve in Trincomalee until the end of the year. I had the occasion to discuss this matter with His Excellency the President, who told me, I have no problem in regard to this matter, but the union was demanding that, on the conclusion of theAgents' terms, their office be terminated. But I said, We only want him to serve till the end of the year. He has been functioning well. He is a very acceptable officer,

acceptable to all the Members of Parliament of the area. We, the Members of Parliament of the UPFA, the UNP, the SLMC and of the All Ceylon Makkal Congress, everybody, are prepared to work with him. He is an excellent officer. Therefore, we would like to have him.

Hon. Minister, I spoke to your Secretary last morning and he told me that he had a discussion with you and that you have agreed that his term be extended till the end of the year. I would like that to be done and enable the Government Agent to continue because he is performing very well. I am reminded of a small event, Sir, that took place in the 1970s when I was a Member of Parliament. I found the then Government Agent in Trincomalee very difficult. I wanted him transferred out. The President was His Excellency J. R. Jayewardene. I went to see him at his Ward Place residence. I told him, Sir, this man is a problem. I am unable to work with him. He is being difficult. I want you to kindly transfer him. He patted me on my shoulder and told me, That is not a problem, Sampanthan. If you want him transferred, I will transfer him, but the chap who comes might be worse. If the chap who comes is worse, what are you going to do? I said, No, I have chosen somebody, Sir. I have chosen Mr. Lionel Fernando, who is an excellent officer and I would like you to send him. He sent Mr. Lionel Fernando to Trincomalee. Mr. Lionel Fernando served there for several years in a very acceptable way to everyone. That is why we want Mr. Pushpakumara too kept there. The President has told me that he will allow Mr. Pushpakumara to remain there for some time. I told the President that we would like him to stay there till the end of the year. He did not say no to that. So, I will leave it in the hands of the Hon. Minister. The Hon. Minister never says no. But, it does not get moving. I would like the Hon. Minister to get this matter moving. Your Secretary assured me yesterday that the present Government Agent will be informed to continue in office, that a Cabinet Paper is being submitted next week, Cabinet approval will be obtained and that he will be kept until the end of the year. I want you to kindly ensure that that is done.

Thank you, Sir.

I would like to mention that the Municipal Council Ordinance was passed in 1947. , . .

. . . , . , on a scientific basis, we brought in a Cabinet Paper whereby you cannot turn a Pradeshiya Sabha into a Municipal Council overnight. I got a Cabinet Paper passed to that effect. Therefore, any Minister who holds the portfolio of Provincial Councils and Local Government is now bound by that Cabinet Paper. Only after taking into consideration the geographic considerations and economic considerations, you can upgrade a local body.

Therefore, I would appeal the Hon. Minister to carry on this good practice because we saw how Akkaraipattu

Pradeshiya Sabha and Dambulla Pradeshiya Sabha became Municipal Councils overnight. . I know, the Hon. Champika Ranawaka will agree with me. . , . . . . . . . . . .

We had a very inclusive approach; we had discussions and we had a consultative process. So, I urge the present Hon. Minister also to follow the same. The Hon. Deputy Minister is present here. So, I urge him to inform the Hon. Minister that especially in a Ministry like Provincial Councils and Local Government there are diverse views and diverse interests and to protect all these, we need a very inclusive approach.

, . And also we brought in a handbook with regard to by-laws of Local Government Authorities. As you see, a lot of local bodies have difficulties in bringing out by-laws and continuously we gave technical assistance to Provincial Councils and local bodies and I urge the Hon. Minister to follow that course. Hon. Minister, this is a Ministry through which you can do development in every part of the Island.

We have done programmes like " ". Then we have done programmes to uplift local bodies with regard to technical assistance. We also managed to do the programme for improvement of 1000 kilometres of rural roads. , .

Hon. Presiding Member, as a practitioner for over 25 years and as a Presidents Counsel, I am disheartened about the manner in which the office of the Chief Justice had made recommendations in terms of the Article 41 (c) (4) of the Constitution which reads thus, I quote:

(4) In the discharge of its function relating to the appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court and the President and Judges of the Court of Appeal, the Council shall obtain the views of the Chief Justice.

Sir, there are instances where the incumbent Chief Justice makes recommendations of a sitting Judge for the appointment of either to the Court of Appeal or to the Supreme Court, but subsequently the Chief Justice disagrees. Therefore, the same Chief Justice acts contrary to the earlier recommendations and does not recommend the very same judge who was earlier recommended. This lacks uniformity and leads to erosion of confidence and lowers the esteem of the office of the Chief Justice. Therefore, I respectfully urge that this matter be looked into very seriously.

In addition, the mere fact that the Chief Justice has made a recommendation should not be the only yardstick by which the Constitutional Council makes its determination. If that is the only yardstick, then you do not need a Constitutional Council. Therefore, I respectfully urge the Constitutional Council to take serious note of the fact that I have stated that there are instances where the office of Chief Justice recommends a particular name and subsequently the Chief Justice disagrees with that appointment and does not recommend. This is not a healthy practice because public confidence is necessary in relation to independent judiciary. Therefore, I believe that we should take serious note in this regard.

Also, sometimes you see that the Constitutional Council is moving the goalposts in making appointments. So, there is an obligation for the Constitutional Council to use the same yardstick with regard to everybody irrespective of whoever it is.

[4.22p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana - State Minister of Social Empowerment) Thank you, Madam Chair. It is very interesting to follow my Colleague, Member of Parliament of my District, the Hon. Seeniththamby Yoheswaran after his firing speech. These are matters that we have to discuss and settle amicably. We have been discussing these matters with the relevant Ministers and the officials concerned. There are many matters to be resolved amicably.

We talked about the issues faced by the Muslims of the Batticaloa District with the Hon. Prime Minister when he visited Batticaloa recetly in order to hand over deeds. We took up these matters about the Muslims who are faced with an intense dearth of land issues. And also, we are faced with lack of land for the expansion for future generations. Out of 2,610 square kilometres of the land extent available in Batticaloa, our people occupy only 38.4 square kilometres of land. According to the Census of 2012, it was accounted that Batticaloa is comprised of 381,285 Tamil people and they occupy 72.5 per cent of land whereas there are 133,844 Muslims living and they occupy only 25.5 per cent of land in Batticaloa. So, according to the population ratio of the Muslim community, they are entitled to occupy 666 square kilometres of land but their occupancy limit is only 38.4 square kilometres which is an injustice.

If you take the Batticaloa District, which comprises of 248,242 hectares, the Muslim population is clustered within 414 hectares in Kattankudy, 324 hectares in Eravur town, 324 hectares in Koralai Pattu Central and Valaichchenai, 2,502 hectares in Koralai Pattu West and Oddamavadi and 3,564 hectares in Batticaloa. So, as per the population ratio of Muslims, they should get a share of 63,302 hectares of land which is 25.5 per cent of the total extent of land in Batticaloa District. It is only 1.5 per cent out of the entire Muslim population of the Batticaloa District who have the rightful ownership to the land they live in. The rest live with much difficulty in villages and hamlets continuing their day-to-day lives in congested conditions where their wells and drainages are built in

2693 2694

close proximity thus, increasing the risk of contamination of water and other health hazards.

I have been speaking to the Minister, the Hon. Wajira Abeywardana about this. He might be aware that there was a Land Delimitation Commission called the Panampalana Commission. It was appointed in 1999 in order to establish Koralai Pattu Central and Koralai Pattu South Divisional Secretariats in addition to Koralai Pattu DS, Koralai Pattu West DS and Koralai Pattu North DS with the intention of resolving the land requirement of the people of Batticaloa District. Koralai Pattu Central was given 242 square kilometres of limited land allocation without a boundary demarcation and this matter has been prolonged purposely by the District Secretariat of Batticaloa.

Many Grama Niladharis belonging to this particular Koralai Pattu Central Divisional Secretariat are functioning under the adjoining Koralai Pattu North which comes under Vaharai Divisional Secretariat. All the Grama Niladharis, should be brought under the jurisdiction of Koralai Pattu Central Divisional Secretariat without any further delay.

Further, in 1999, the "Panampalana Commission" recommended the area to be demarcated as Divisional Secretarys Divisions of Koralai Pattu Central, Koralai Pattu West, Koralai Pattu South, Koralai Pattu North and Koralai Pattu, with a clear focus on resolving the dearth of land for the Muslim community. Instead, Grama Niladhari Divisions of Vakaneri, Kallichai, Punanai West, Oothuchenai and Vadamunai that belonged to Koralai Pattu West have been taken away and attached to Koralai Pattu South. This action reminds us the adage, from the frying pan into the fire. The aforementioned five Grama Niladhari Divisions should be reattached to Koralai Pattu West - Oddamavadi - Divisional Secretariat.

Hon. Minister, I took up the matter of giving deeds to the landless people with the Hon. Prime Minister during his recent visit. The deeds were not given taking all communities in the Batticaloa District into fair consideration as per the ratio. I even made it a point to mention this fact at the gathering held during that function that the officials concerned have to discharge their duties impartially and in an unbiased manner. For example, I pointed out a matter that 50 houses in Mich Nagar were given way back in 1980, when late President Premadasa was the Minister of Local Government, Housing and Construction.

( ) (The Hon. Seeniththamby Yoheswaran) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Seeniththamby Yoheswaran.

( ) (The Hon. Seeniththamby Yoheswaran) , , , 8 .

( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana) You may say so now, but it is not happening. However, that is not a point of Order, Madam.-[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana) This housing scheme is called Mich Nagar in Eravur Pattu. Even after 38 years, the recipients of these houses have not been awarded their deeds. As a result these families are deprived of obtaining even the basic utilities such as electricity or water supply.

Madam Chair, as I have taken up this issue now, the Commissioner General of Lands has requested the Divisional Secretary to resolve this matter at the soonest by surveying the properties to begin with. But unfortunately the very Divisional Secretary, who comes under your purview Hon. Minister, always procrastinates in taking action and this is what has led to such a delay in resolving this issue.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Please now wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana) At least this time I urge your intervention to give strict instructions to the Eravur Pattu Divisional Secretary and the relevant officials concerned to expedite this matter immediately without any further delay.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. State Minister, you have to wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana) How many minutes do I have?

2695 2696

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) You have already exceeded the time. ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana) Kindly give me two more minutes, Madam. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) No, how can I do that? ( ) (The Hon. Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana) There is so much injustice caused due to biased attitudes of the officials concerned. Anyway, I have so many matters to be mentioned, but I do not have enough time.

Finally, I must thank the Hon. Minister and also Mr. Kamal Padmasiri, Secretary to the Ministry, for arranging the Commonwealth Local Government Conference, which is going to be held in Sri Lanka from 06th to 09th of August, 2019, which the Hon. Minister and I will be co-chairing as the President of the Federation of Sri Lankan Local Government Authorities and also in the capacity as the Director Asia for Commonwealth Local Government Forum. It is a great opportunity for Sri Lanka. So, I am thankful to the Secretary and the rest of the officials who are making all the necessary arrangements for this conference to be held in a successful manner.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you, Hon. Ali Zahir Moulana.
