( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) I am quoting from established statistics. 1,213. , . . . ? ? They have the volcanic soil which is very fertile and the productivity is quite significant. On top of that, the Kenyan tea bushes, relatively to Sri Lanka are very much younger. Ours is sometimes even over a hundred years. When you come to that level, productivity has to decrease. So, to increase productivity, His Excellency the President has announced that Rs. 300,000 be given for replanting. He has also requested us to gazette the replanting figure at 2 per cent annually and we are in the process of doing that. I will bring the gazette notification to Parliament in a few days' time. If that replanting strategy is followed, I think within a few years, we would be able to replace the very old tea bushes with new tea bushes and then productivity will definitely increase. We are also, in addition, trying to promote infilling. We are doing research to introduce new clones, so that we could face the new challenges that we face as a result of climatic changes. In addition, His Excellency the President instructed us to continue to give the fertilizer subsidy, which is now available to anyone without the hassle or problem they faced earlier of having to go to tea inspectors and getting certificates.Anyone in this country who is growing tea can go to their local shop, pay Rs. 1,300 and get that fertilizer mixture. As a result of the adaptive trials that we undertook through the Tea Research Institute, even the fertilizer mixture has now been put into place with the objective of attaining the maximum productivity. The fertilizer mix has been changed as a result of the various requests that we made. The Government has to pay very much more for the fertilizer that is being given at the subsidized rate but nevertheless His Excellency the President felt that the tea smallholders must be supported to get the maximum level of productivity. We are very hopeful that in the next few years, we would be able to increase the productivity levels notwithstanding the inherent shortcomings that we have as a result of what I just mentioned.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, 65 per cent of the production comes from tea smallholdings. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Actually, it is a little bit more. It is about 70 per cent.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, if the regional plantation companies are showing an increase in production, the resultant factor is that production of the tea smallholders is dropping. You cannot be having those 21 companies increasing production and others also increasing. There has to be a drop. Now, in the Budget, you have given - ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . , , Supplementary Questions . . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) 10.00 . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , ; . .

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, I know what you are trying to ask me.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Since that 65 per cent is not giving sufficient production, you are giving fertilizer subsidy and you are trying to give cash subsidy for replantation. All these are of no avail if the cost of production and labour is going up. The 21 Regional Plantation Companies came and made a claim to you that they are unable to give full employment to their people. They are not working on Thursdays and Sundays. So, on that basis, all what you do is cosmetic. Can you not answer all these Questions without bringing the Presidents name into them?

439 440

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) May I set the record straight, Hon. Member, through the Hon. Speaker? You have got it the other way. Actually, the productivity of the smallholders is very much higher than that of the RPCs. The RPCs' production has been dropping whereas the smallholder production has been increasing. This is why for the first time, His Excellency the President has made available a special fund at a subsidized interest rate of 8 per cent so that the RPCs can borrow from that fund repayable in seven years to ensure that the replanting takes place at the figure of 2 per cent that we are expecting. So, what His Excellency the President has really done is to encourage the smallholders even more because they are the ones who are producing 70 per cent of the tea in this country.

His Excellency the President has also now identified uncultivated lands in RPCs and he has made it known that these uncultivated lands will be distributed to those who do not have lands and those who do not have incomes. For the first time they have been given Rs. 150,000 for new planting. For new planting, we have never given Rs. 150,000. Actually, until this year it was Rs. 50,000. But, His Excellency the President has increased that amount by another Rs. 100,000 and we are now giving them Rs. 150,000, so that those lands where tea can be cultivated could be cultivated with tea. By distributing these lands to the smallholders, maximum production can be obtained. So, whilst we are working with the smallholders, we have not neglected the RPCs. But, as far as productivity is concerned, the problem is really with the RPCs and not with the smallholders.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My third Supplementary Question is, Hon. Minister, I hope your intentions are pure and the Governments intentions can be achieved. But, you are trying to skin the cat from both sides. On one side, you are trying to motivate the RPCs and on the other side, you are basically expropriating. Are you going to tell us that these 21 companies will not be expropriated? ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Hon. Member, I will have a cup of coffee with you later and have a chat.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) As the tea Minister, do you want to give coffee?

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) No, no. I know that you are a coffee drinker.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is not the matter.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Okay. We will have a cup of tea and discuss this.

( ) (The Chairman) , . ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Hon. Chairman, since my time is limited, I would like to bring about a very important point. There has been an issue about the share market in the last couple of months and there have been certain allegations about insider dealings. These allegations finally led to the removal of the CEO of the share market and Mr. Marikkar was removed. I remember that when he was being removed, the Chairperson of the share market, Mrs. Indrani Sugathadasa, made a speech. Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, if you may remember, you were the Chief Guest at that meeting. She made a speech where she said , "Those who live by the Dhamma will be protected by the Dhamma". . . . . . , . . , . . .

, . , . 2009 . 2009 .

Actually what happened was, there was a profit Price-Earnings Ratio. Before Prabhakaran died, the Price-Earnings Ratio was 13. But, after Prabhakaran's death, the Price-Earnings Ratio shot up to 19, because the share market really boomed after the war. And, as the war was over, more people started shoving investment in the share market. As interest rates started coming down, pensioners, Government servants and private sector workers went and put their money into the share market. Once they put their money in, what happened? Some people - this new super-rich class - started manipulating the market. I will give you one incident.

( ) (The Chairman) , .

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) , . Ceylon Grain Elevators on 2nd August, 2010, one share was Rs. 29. But, on 3rd of February, 2011 - - the share price of Ceylon Grain Elevators went up to Rs. 265 from Rs. 29. Then, it dropped back to Rs. 190. On 4th March 2011, EPF went and bought at Rs. 190. They bought for a few million rupees and workers' money was invested. After EPF bought, within two days, it started dropping down. Hon. Chairman, now, it is Rs. 90. EPF bought at Rs. 190 and now it is dropped down to Rs. 90. These are manipulations in the market. - [Interruption.] Day light robbery! This is not right. Then, on 7th October, 2011 in the morning, Laugfs Gas was Rs. 41.50 per share and at the end of the day, it went up to Rs. 50.50. Rs. 20 million shares were traded. It was manipulated from inside. On 10th October, the share price was Rs. 50. Then, it dropped by Rs.2 and it was Rs. 48. EPF went and bought shares. Now, the price has dropped down to Rs. 41. Therefore, millions of rupees were lost by EPF.

Blue Diamonds is a bankrupt company. Blue Diamonds has no value and the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation buys Blue Diamond shares at Rs. 9 a share. Today, it has dropped down to Rs. 3 It is a bankrupt company. Who advises the Government to buy shares of bankrupt companies? The Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation had no right to put money there. This is public money and as a result now the market has collapsed. All the pensioners, the retired Government servants and the private sector workers have lost their investment. Those who had investment worth Rs. 50,000, their money is now worth only Rs. 5,000. This is not fair. This is to allow only one class of people to manipulate this market and make millions. They are not even 0.01 per cent of the population. You cannot let those people run this economy.

Since my time is up, I will not take anymore time. At present what has happened is that, what should go up at the right time after the Budget is coming down and what should come down is going up. The prices should be coming down but the prices are going up. The share prices should be going up but the share prices are coming down. That is the result of the Budget.

Thank you.

The caption of that article is, I quote:

Reserves a buffer for tough time: CB Chief

:

Ajith Nivard Cabraal yesterday defended declining reserves, insisting that they were built up to be used in times of need.

, . . . . , , .

, : I quote :

When you see an ant collecting food for winter, no one tells the ant that it shouldnt eat the food to survive the winter because it would decrease the reserve. Sometimes we must learn from ants not just from people who write books. In these complicated times, we tend to forget these simple tales.

. [ ] , . [ ] . [ ] , .

Sir, let me now read from the Holy Bible: Proverbs 6:6-8. It states, I quote:

Go to the ant, O sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise. Without having any chief, officer, or ruler, she prepares her bread in summer and gathers her food in harvest.

I will read it in English because he spoke in English. Giving an interview to the ETV, he talks on the secret of attracting foreign direct investment to Vietnam. This is what he says: We must always deliver on our commitments and promises to our investors. It is a very serious thing. He goes on to say: "We must ensure a liberal business and investment environment so that they may come.

Sir, the Ministry of Economic Development is doing the complete opposite of it. I am actually saddened by this. They have broken all promises given to investors. We saw in this House how promises were broken overnight without giving any opportunity to the investors even to argue their case. During the Committee Stage of the Revival of Underperforming Enterprises and Underutilized Assets Bill, I proposed an amendment. - [Interruption.] I said, please give these people 30 days to submit a restructuring plan. Even that, they did not do. So, they broke all agreements. ( ) (The Chairman) . ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) , 2 .

543 544

I quote: What has happened is really unfortunate, and it will impinge on the countrys equity market in the long term. I should say that Sugathadasa did a decent job heading the regulatory office.

This is what Mr. Aritha Wickramanayake has said. I quote:

It is not the governments job to look at the stock market indices and put pressure on the regulator to bring them up by relaxing regulations that can lead to malpractices. It is even sad to see how a bunch of short-sighted brokers have been able to mislead the countrys President.

This is what the former Director-General, an eminent lawyer in the country, has to say about what is happening in the stock market.

I further quote :

It is no secret that manipulation takes place in the Colombo Stock Market regularly. Manipulation plus excessive credit will be a lethal combination that can create a bubble detrimental to everyone. ........

Sri Lanka had always been a small, illiquid but fairly regulated market. That is why the foreign investors came here and invested. It is only a fool who would invest in this market with developments of this nature.

Hon. Member, there is a problem and I think the sooner we recognize it, the better. There is no point just trading across the floor when there is actually a problem. - [Interruption.] We are not only talking about there being a problem. We can even suggest what is wrong. It is not the regulator who has the responsibility for increasing the performance of the stock market. The writer has said that it is the investment climate that you have created. The expropriation Bill, the independence of the judiciary and all that contribute to this environment. The Central Bank has conflicts of interest, both in management and in regulation. It is the lack of independence in the appointment of Commissions since the amendment to the Constitution.

It is the ineffectiveness of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. It is the lack of the rule of law. It also necessitates the release of political prisoners and bringing a solution to the ethnic problem and freedom of information by not blocking websites and information. That is what which creates confidence in the investment markets; it is not by basically asking the brokers to do a better job or somebody else to do a better job.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I will wind up. I would finally like to say this.

( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen. - [Pause.] - Not here. Then, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. You have 15 minutes. [3.35 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for affording me this opportunity to speak on the Votes of the Ministry that has a lions share of this Budget. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.P. Jagath Pushpakumara) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . , point of Order .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.P. Jagath Pushpakumara) , . . . . . ( ) (The Presiding Member) . . , .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) As I said, Sir, I am glad to speak on the Votes of the Ministry that has a lions share of this Budget. It is over Rs. 104,571,330,000, which is about a 40 per cent increase from the allocation made for the year 2011. That is an enormous sum compared to the whole of the Budget and if one were to look at the Fiscal Management Report for the last eight months in 2011, we are able to assess the kind of development work that the Ministry of Economic Development has been engaged in. Large development projects have been initiated and are continuing and that is there for everyone to see. Yet, as the Opposition, as we speak at this Committee Stage, it is important for us to bring to your notice that several of these projects are not viable. A good example of that was shown just a little while ago when a previous speaker thanked the Hon.

Minister for allocating a sum of money when he requested it just via SMS. That shows the kind of feasibility study conducted before any project is undertaken. Two good examples would be in the backyard of the Hon. Ministers own area, not his present area, but from where he comes: one is the Hambantota Harbour and the other is the Southern Expressway. We all know what happened to the Hambantota Harbour and you also know that. But after it was constructed and its opening, much later, several months later only, recently that rock was blasted. - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister, I am saying that it was after the opening, several months later, the rock at the entry was blasted and that was announced by the Government itself. - [Interruption.] ( ) (An Hon. Member) They said there was no rock.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, that there was no rock. Suddenly, a rock appeared. So, it had to be blasted. - [Interruption.] Secondly, the Sourthern Expressway - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) What is wrong with that?

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Hon. Minister, you did not know that there was a rock. That is what is wrong. We found the rock for you all. - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) With regard to the Southern Expressway, the Minister for Constructions, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities, a Minister in your own Government, has publicly criticized that Highway. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne) Why?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Well, he has said it. - [Interruption.] He has said - it is something that is on record and everyone can ascertain - that no proper environmental impact assessment was done and that is a fact because there is a Supreme Court judgment in Heather Mundys case, declaring that the final trace did not have an environmental impact

551 552

assessment and Rs. 75,000 a piece was granted to each family that was affected as compensation for the violation of their fundamental rights. Sir, I am citing these two examples to show that mega projects can be started, but without any financial feasibility or an assessment of their adverse impact on the people at the ground level. Now, this is also true with regard to the mega projects that are going on in the North and the East of the country, about which we are most concerned. You will agree, Hon. Minister, that a nation cannot be built merely with concrete as much as a political issue cannot be solved by military means. Unfortunately, today, in this country - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) We dealt with terrorism militarily. So, do not twist that. This country suffered from terrorism for 30 years. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I agree with you, any armed revolt against a country must be dealt with militarily. ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) That is right. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am not saying no to that; you do not have to get excited over that. All that I am saying is, as the Hon. Minister in the front row himself would also agree, that armed revolt - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister, you do not have to get up and shout like this. If you are a Minister in the Cabinet, why do you not sit down decently and listen to what I have to say without shouting like this and showing your true colours? There was a political issue for the last 60 years. Your Colleague, the Hon. Minister seated over there, himself took up arms on a political issue. ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda - Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development) That is a well-known. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, that is well known. So, the point that I am making - [Interruption.] Would you disagree that there

was a political issue? No, you would not disagree. - [Interruption.] That political issue must be settled politically and an armed revolt must be dealt with -

( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) A Select Committee will be appointed. You join and -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran I will come to that. Do not get too excited.

( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) I am not excited. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Do not get too excited. - [Interruption.] You must understand what I am saying before you respond to me. All that I am saying is that there has been a political issue for the last 60 years. Perhaps, there was an armed revolt for the last 30 years, which had to be dealt with militarily - I am not complaining about that - but the political issue must be addressed. The political issue cannot be addressed either militarily or with concrete. ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) You cannot clap with one hand; you have to clap with both hands.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes. As you know, Hon. Minister, we have been engaged with your Government in talks since January this year. Until today, we have had 16 rounds of talk. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) But, you are not sincere; your political concept was not sincere.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, do not ask me to speak about sincerity. We have been sincerely engaged in talks. If the two Hon. Ministers who are in the Government delegation say that we are not sincere, I will take it. I will take it from them. But, they will not say that.

( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) We do not know that .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) They would not say that. - [Interruption.] But, not you. You are immaterial; you are irrelevant. - [Interruption.] If the two senior Ministers who are in the Government delegation say that, I will accept it. They would not say it because they know - [Interruption.] We even challenged them publicly in August, this year to say that and they did not say that. - [Interruption.] You do not seem to know what is happening in the country. We challenged the two Senior Ministers to say that and they refused because they know very well that we are engaged sincerely and with commitment to achieve a solution. Now, today as I - [Interruption.] Ah! I will come to diaspora. Now, Hon. Minister, only a couple of days ago the Government was inviting the diaspora to come and invest. I was going to speak on that because I am speaking on the Votes of the Ministry of Economic Development. Now, why are you asking the diaspora to come and invest when every time in this House you speak ill of them? You do not like them, you do not want them. Now, it has become so bad that the very mention of the word diaspora has become a dirty word because that is the context in which you referred to the diaspora all the time. But, you want their money. You speak of terrorism, you speak of conquering terrorism and who do you have in your ranks? The person who became the leader of the LTTE after Velupillai Prabhakaran died is happily living with you. There are no charges against him.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) We have released 17,000 LTTEers.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Exactly, I will come to that. You have released the LTTEers but there are people who are languishing in Boosa for the last 13 to - [Interruption.] Please listen to me. - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister, will you please listen to me without shouting? We expect a more dignified behaviour from you. - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister, please listen to me. You say you have released 17,000 LTTEers. Okay, we are thankful. I am not saying no to that. Whatever good you do, we will say it is good. But, please consider the plight of others who have been languishing in prisons for so long for merely giving a food parcel to some LTTEer. They have been there for 13 years. That is not justice. It is easy for you to shake hands with persons who had actually been in combat. You have released them. But, people who have been in prisons for

some technical violation of the law, for selling a coconut to an LTTEer, giving a food parcel - [Interruption.]- technical, I will tell you. You must know because you are an Attorney-at-Law. Under Section 5 the PTA, failure to give information to the police is an offence. The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake will know that failure to give information to the police is an offence only under the PTA, and not under any other law. There are about 800 people in prisons today for over 10 years for offences like that and you have not considered them. You have refused to look at their plight. But, you are very generous with the LTTEers. We do not complain. They also have surrendered. Maybe they went in the wrong path, they had a political objective and in dealing with them, you are dealing properly. So, we are thankful to you for that.

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) You give a list of such persons detained. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) All that has been given. Your own Minister, the Senior Minister, the Hon. DEW Gunasekara himself said one year ago that there are between 600 to 900 people who are in prisons for over 10 years. So, do not ask me for the list. You have the list. He was the Minister of Prison Reforms at that time.- [Interruption.] Please speak with dignity, please speak with responsibility. I know what I am talking about and your Senior Ministers know all these facts. So, it is pointless standing up and shouting out like that. The point that I am making is, economic development is important, but as I said, you cannot achieve development of a country; you cannot build a nation merely with concrete. You must consider this very seriously. There is no point in shouting back at me. Roads, bridges in the North and the East will not win the peoples hearts towards you.

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) Why?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You try that and see. Obviously, it is an absurd question that you are asking. You must build their lives. You must help build their lives.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only one minute more. Your time is fast running out.

555 556

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay, thank you. It is a question of priorities, as I said at the Debate on the Second Reading of the Budget itself. Priority is to address the day-to-day livelihood issues of the people. I am not saying that you are not doing it. So, do not get me wrong.

( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) The people who are living there know what is happening there.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will ignore that comment. - [Interruption.]Yes. He is a champion of the people. We know what he does to the people.- [Interruption.] Yes, we know very well. - [Interruption.] Just travel to India once and come back if you can. What did you do in Choolaimedu? - [Interruption.] A wanted criminal in another country, you have as a Cabinet Minister in this country.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) A wanted criminal, a proclaimed offender in another country is a Cabinet Minister in this country.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you may wind up your speech now. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is your priority and that is the man who shouts the most.

( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Douglas Devananda.- [Interruption.] Hon. Minister -

( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) When I was going to start my speech, he started shouting. So, I replied to him. You also can shout.

( ) (The Presiding Member) All right. Hon. Minister, you can start your speech now.
