... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Member says that the President cannot hold any portfolio which is in contravention of Article 44 (2) of the Constitution. Sir, it very clearly states, I quote:

The President may assign to himself any subject or function and shall remain in charge of any subject or function not assigned to any Minister under the provisions of paragraph (1)"

Therefore, Sir, even in India, the President is holding portfolios. In Sri Lanka, from the time of the Rt. Hon. D.S. Senanayake, we had the Executive Prime Minister. But, here Sir, this Motion has been moved in violation of Article 44(2) of Chapter VIII of the Constitution which allows the President to hold any portfolio. Although you have debated it, - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . ( ) (The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti) . , , . . . [. . 2.50] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Thank you for affording me this good opportunity. Sir, we are governed in this Parliament by the Constitution of Sri Lanka. It has been revised and approved by the whole House. Then, there are other things that govern the proceedings of the House, which we call the Standing Orders. There is also another set of regulations. That is the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act. These are all well defined statutes. My contention is, no Member in this House who understands

the contents of these three statutes would bring any Motion - a private Members Motion or otherwise - contravening any of these statues. This is very clear, for example, in Section 17 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, which states, I quote:

Evidence of proceedings in Parliament or committee not to be given without leave.

No member or officer of Parliament and no shorthand Writer employed to take minutes of evidence before the House or any committee shall give evidence elsewhere in respect of the contents of such evidence or of the contents of any manuscript or document laid before Parliament or any committee or in respect of any proceedings or examination had at the Bar or before any committee of Parliament without the special leave of Parliament first had and obtained.

When it comes to even the Consultative Committees, COPE or the Public Accounts Committee, it is very clear in the Standing Orders that you have to get the approval of the Hon. Speaker before anything is published or given out. Sir, even the stenographers or others employed by those committees have no right to take down anything and give out directly without your permission. So, your power is very sacrosanct. You are the guardian of the rights and privileges of the Members and you uphold the Constitution and the Standing Orders - you are doing it very well - and the most important one is the Parliamentary (Powers and Privileges) Act.

Sir, you have already appointed a committee to revise the Standing Orders. The proceedings are going on. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, who moved this Motion is also a Member. I think the Chief Opposition Whip - not the new Deputy Opposition Whip

- the original Opposition Whip - knows this. He is also a Member. Sir, while the revision of the Standing Orders are being discussed minutely, it is an indictment on the Hon. Speaker himself to come before this Parliament and divulge the contents of the proceedings.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) Order, please! There is a point of being raised by the Hon. John Amaratunga.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, there is no indictment on you or anybody by doing this. This is a recommendation to the Committee. We have the right to discuss. He cannot say that we cannot discuss. What is wrong with that? - [Interruption.] Why are you accusing the Hon. Speaker?

1455 1456

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You are a Member. When we are discussing that, a Member has all the right to make his proposals and propose amendments before the Committee. This is premeditated. But, this cannot be allowed because you will be contravening and discussing things against the laid down procedure, the Standing Orders, the Constitution, et cetera. That is my contention. Even in the Standing Orders it states that while the proceedings of any committee is on - you know it -you cannot give it to the newspapers, to the media and you cannot divulge information, unless of course, with the consent of the Committee and the approval obtained from the Hon. Speaker. That is very important.

. . . , . "Good Governance" . Now, Hon. Deputy Speaker, good governance that is there is not practised by the Central Bank. Today, the commercial banks are basically having a mega problem. On one side, they say that each CEO must work for 10 years; that is maximum and the

Directors must retire at the age of 70 years. The Board of Directors of the Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC had their Annual General Meeting recently. What happened there? You have people who are more than 70 years old going on in service. So far, we have not complained. But, the people who are complaining are the people of the Central Bank. But, are they complying? No. They give exemptions for some people if they are politically biased or if they can be controlled or if they can be manipulated or if they can sing hosannas for dinner. Well and good! The Central Bank permits that to take place. Otherwise, they are basically stumped at the point. Then, you have good governance that is there. You must allow people who have credibility to come to the Board of Directors of the Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC. Now, Mr. Ranjit Fernando, one the top best of bankers, had been asked to go out and then you have nominated a person who has a criminal record and had been given a suspended sentence. I am not mentioning the name simply because we basically protect their character even though they do not have one. But, see the difference. The Central Bank brings in good governance as a - ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The Central Bank also -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am talking about the AGM of the Commercial Bank that was held recently. There cannot be hundreds of directors. Only one went out and one came in. On that particular basis, you have nominated a person who had been given a sentence suspended for 10 years. Now, he comes to the Board of Directors and one of the best of bankers, Mr. Ranjit Fernando goes out. This is the good governance that the Government is trying to pursue through the Central Bank. When we questioned this at the Committee on Public Enterprises, what did the Governor say? He said, Good governance is what we want to pursue . That is why we believe in transparency. If we do not speak that in Parliament, it is a criminal offence; either we do not have the guts to speak or we do not represent the people in true spirit. Now, what you all are trying to do is to conceal that information. As soon as I got up to ask an Oral Question which had been referred to the Ministry of Finance and Planning, the Deputy Minister who does not answer the Questions in Parliament jumped up and tried to tell different things. Now, when we answer with specific facts; then they are stymied, they are silent and their stony silence shows us that the truth is being concealed.

The Hon. Dilan Perera was trying to say that Private Members' Motions must not be misused. On the other

1463 1464

side, he is trying to bring in ideas to conceal our rights. Why is that? If we, as the Members of Parliament, are unable to bring in a Private Members' Motion to Parliament, are we going to shout at the top of our voices on the main roads on this? I guess that is not the spirit. If there is a clean governance that is expected, if there is transparency that is wanted and if you really want to bring Sri Lanka into the prosperous future that is expected, then, you should open yourself into a completely different vicissitude and look at Sri Lanka in a larger picture.

ESTABLISHMENT OF INDUSTRIAL ESTATES IN PUTTALAM DISTRICT

[. . 3.22]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Speaker, before I present the Motion, that is listed under my name, to the House, I would like to place on record the sincere thanks of all the Muslim Members of this House and the staff of Parliament to the Hon. Speaker for having given approval to my proposal to commence Sittings on Friday at 1.30 p.m., enabling us to attend the obligatory Jummah prayers in the mosque. We are thankful to the Hon. Speaker, the Deputy Speaker, the Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Leader of the House, the able Chief Government Whip and also the Chief Opposition Whip, the original Whip, not the duplicate Whip.

Now, Sir, I will read out the Motion in my name appearing in todays Order Paper. This is the first Motion that I am moving in the First Session of Seventh Parliament.

Establishment of Industrial Estates in the Puttalam District,-That this parliament resolves that Industrial Estates be established at suitable locations in the Puttalam District with a view to boosting up industries in the District and to provide employment Opportunities to the youth

" ,- ."

The Puttalam District in the North Western Province occupies a historical place in the country. It is to Puttalam that Ibn Battuta from Morocco came and he even showed the path to the Adams Peak. The Puttalam

District is full of raw materials. There is the salt industry and it is one of the first places where the industry was started and the other one is in Hambantota. There is fishing, prawn culture and ceramics. Particularly, I must mention the famous Dankotuwa Porcelain factory, . , . [ ] . , . .

. . .

. [ ] , , . . .

, .... . . . . , , . , , , .

. . . . . . . . , the coir is being exported, Sir. There is a very big demand for the coir that is manufactured in the Puttalam District. You can streamline, you can develop those industries. In the North Western Province, we have the biggest Tamil village called Udappuwa where a large number of Tamil youth reside. There is a famous Kovil there. There is

1469 1470

2011 08

the fishing industry; we can even set up a fish packaging industry - in other words, a sardine factory in Udappuwa. Now, all these industries could be sited there. Puttalam is also recorded in the history as the place where King Vijaya landed, Thammennawa.

. . . , .. , . , , ; .

. 20 , ... . . , . , , .

There is a statistician, Sir, named Mr. Marcus in the Puttalam Kachcheri. He has also given us a lot of statistics regarding this, Sir. Puttalam is a very important district with so many electorates. Then, there is Anamaduwa, Chilaw, Nattandiya and Wennappuwa. 16 . , . .

He is a well-known historian, an author and a writer of reports, the late Kala Bhushana Shajahan Master. He has written a very valuable book - - on the history of the entire Puttalam. Then, there is also Kala Bhushana Alhaj M.I.M. Abdul Latheef, a writer, an author, a historian and also a senior media person from Puttalam. He has researched the area from Wanathawilluwa up to Marichchi Kaddi. The entire roadway was covered with jungles. There was no road. Historically there was a road and it is Kala Bhushana Alhaj M.I.M. Abdul Latheef who brought it to limelight by writing research articles indicating that we can open up

this road for public transport thereby giving a fillip to the development of the entire area. Our Government has done it; our Government had accomplished this task. When you want to travel from Colombo to Jaffna or Mannar, we have reduced the distance by about 100 miles. So, all these are miracles performed by the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime.

Then, Sir, there is a Member who was talking about , , in the Motion that he moved. " " . , , , . . ? . . . ? . .
