( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please!

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, you were present at that time.

( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) Hon. Deputy Speaker, there is a Ruling on this. The Hon. Minister can table the Answers in the second round.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If you want the Minutes of the meeting, I can give it to you.

( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) It is a practice that we have followed. This is nothing new.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) .

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Deputy Minister, there was a decision taken at the Party Leaders' Meeting. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, you can give the Ruling made at that Meeting. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please!

( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) Hon. Deputy Speaker, when the Question was asked, the Hon. Member was not present. It is only with this particular Member that this problem arises; not with other Members. The other day the Answer was tabled with the permission of the Hon. Speaker who was in the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What is the relevance you are trying to get through?

947 948

2011 05

( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) Mr. Deputy Speaker, in fact, a Minister has the right to refuse it.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He has the right.

( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) A Minister has the right to refuse.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please!

( )

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Deputy Speaker,-

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I wish to draw your attention to Standing Order No. 27 (1), which states, I quote:

When an oral answer to a question is required, Mr. Speaker, when the question is reached on the Order Paper, shall call upon the member in whose name the question stands and the member so called shall rise in his place and ask the question by reference to its number on the Order Paper and the reply will then be given by the Prime Minister or the Minister to whom the question is addressed.

That means, once the Hon. Member stands up, the reply has to be given by the Prime Minister or the Minister to whom it is addressed.

( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) At that time, the Hon. Member was not there.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) He was there.

( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) It is for the second round that this arrangement has been made.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, whenever you call out the Question number, you can call it out for the first, second, third or fourth time. And when the Member gets up, then you have to answer. Today, you called out the Question number for the second time.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition is very ignominiously ignoring the fact. Standing Order No. 27(1) is very clear. I will quote it again:

When an oral answer to a question is required, Mr. Speaker, when the question is reached on the Order Paper, shall call upon the member in whose name the question stands and the member so called shall rise in his place.

So, that has been done, Sir.- [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) No, no.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) No, no, wait. I am on my feet. You do not know these although you have been a former Speaker. Therefore, Sir, my contention is -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Azwer, what is your position?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, my contention is that the Question was properly put to the House but the Hon. Member was absent and in the second round, the Minister has the right to table it. Not only that, a Minister has the right even to refuse a reply, Sir. So, that right must be protected in this House. I do not know how the Hon. Leader of the Opposition is so ignorant of the Standing Orders and the practices of this House. He must go back to Royal College, study and come. - [Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) This little knowledge he gained from this side.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I think the Hon. Chief Government Whip should give him tuition, if he has not studied at Royal College. Sir, this is very clear.

949 950

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, there is a decision taken at the Party Leaders' Meeting. Therefore, as per the decision, if the Hon. Member is present even in the second round, the Minister can answer. But, at the same time any Minister has the authority to refuse to answer.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, what we have referred to is the option between answering and not answering. It does not say anything about tabling. It is a convention to table it when the Member is not present. But, as far as this is concerned, you cannot table it when the Member gets up. You did ask for the second time for the Member to get up. The Hon. Minister can either answer it or he can say "no" in which case, we can question him further or bring a Motion against him. But, as far as this is concerned, there is no provision under this to table it. When the Member gets up, the Minister has to answer it.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) . . [ ] , .

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Let the Hon. Minister answer. ( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) . ; ? . "" . [ ] . , - [ ] Sir, there is a precedence. I have tabled an Answer earlier and the Chair has allowed it. I am following the same precedence. I have tabled an answer earlier for the same Member.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the amendments that we are moving today to the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill and the connected Bills relating to the Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and the Pradeshiya Sabhas together with the new provisions that we are making to enable

handicapped voters to be eligible to exercise their votes in the polling booths is indeed a very historic effort after a very long and arduous process in the Select Committee on Electoral Reforms. As a matter of fact, I have been associated with this process for almost 15 years up to now. We have had several Select Committees, we have had long deliberations, we have had bilateral deliberations with political parties and this has finally resulted in this piece of legislation being brought in today before the House.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, there had been a variety of concerns and initially my party together with the Tamil National Alliance and various other small parties did petition the Supreme Court when this particular Bill in its original form was sought to be presented in the House. There, we were able to convince their Lordships of the Supreme Court that some of the provisions are violative of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution and therefore needed a special majority in Parliament, as well as the approval of all the Provincial Councils, before it is tabled in Parliament. Subsequently, it so happened that the Government had convinced all Provincial Councils to accept the Bill with some modifications.

There is, of course, a technical point that my learned Friend, the Hon. Sumanthiran is raising about the Northern Provincial Council not being in existence. In fact, that matter was pursued in the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court has ultimately endorsed the Bill to be passed in the form as it is. Therefore, I do not think we can be challenging the Supreme Court anymore and therefore - [Interruption.] - Yes, and I am also very glad that our veteran Parliamentarian, the Hon. R. Sampanthan is in the House today after a brief period of illness. I must say that we are quite happy and pleased to have him in the House today, when we are taking up this all-important Debate. Subsequently, this Bill finally has seen the light of day, after having a variety of discussions among all political parties, and has included a few provisions regarding which we also had certain reservations and the Government was kind enough to take into consideration certain salient objections that we raised regarding representation in the Delimitation Committees for minority members. That matter has been looked into and amendment would be moved by the Government to include both at the national level and at the district level Delimitation Committees, sufficient representation for minorities and, as a matter of fact, the provision in the Constitution relating to the Delimitation Commission has been adopted in order to include the concerns that we placed before the Government.

Be that as it may, there are of course other concerns that have been voiced, particularly while laying out specific procedures in terms of vacancies of seats and candidates, it provides significant powers to the secretaries of political parties and leaders of independent groups to make appointments to fill the vacancies, instead

987 988

[ . ]

2011 05

of voters making the choice through a by-election. This was a matter that was pursued but for various reasons that matter has not been acceded to. We too are in agreement that in order to maintain the supremacy of political parties, and the fact that people repose their faith in political parties rather than individuals in the systems that we have adopted of late, the party being given a right to nominate members when there appears to be vacancies is a welcome feature, though it could be argued that a provision of a by-election would work better. If we are going to permit local authority vacancies to be filled by by-elections, we will have to have by-elections almost throughout the entire period of the year and that would become a never-ending exercise. Therefore, it would only be prudent for us to look at this issue in this fashion.

Then, the Bill delineates a delimitation process for the purpose of demarcating wards in local authorities with far-reaching powers granted to the Minister over the process. This was a matter that the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera sought to advance here, and unfortunately he tried to drag my name apparently assuming that my Learned Friend, the Minister, is a rival in my political area and therefore hoping that I would not wish that he be put in charge of declaring the delimitation of wards. But, as a matter of fact, we are glad that a minority member is there as the Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils at the national level. Be that as it may, it is important for us to bear in mind that this entire delimitation process must be a very open process. There must be facility for the public to make representation before the National Delimitation Committee. At the district level too, there must be an open and transparent process where public and other interested parties could make representation before a final delimitation is arrived at. Since there is sought to be a very salutary feature of including multi-member constituencies in order to address the particular issue of ethnic representation at the Local Authority level, it would only be salutary that this delimitation process is made in a very transparent manner, allowing all parties and members of the public and various associations - [Interruption.] It does not happen that way.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Why not? The provision is there. Now, that leaves a doubt in the minds of certain people about a free and fair delimitation.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Throughout in the local authority process, this particular provision had been there. This is not a newly-invented provision. But, however, since you have certain fears - that is what I am saying - the process would be made transparent and the Delimitation Committee

allowed to entertain representation - [Interruption.] The thing is, a Delimitation Committee ultimately will have to give reasons as to how they have arrived at the delimitation of various areas. But, this is not going to be as easy as delimiting an electorate or electoral district because this is much more smaller unit. Then, there is also this issue pertaining to the need to address the opportunity for ethnic representation. There again, this particular issue of equal representation for ethnic minorities was taken away in order to accommodate the fears that we had in the formulation of the wards as it were. Therefore, that again has been sought to be amended and I am sure the Hon. Minister will be moving the amendments.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Minister, please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I wanted to speak a few words in Tamil, but since I have run out of time, may I say that definitely there is a concern for minor parties and smaller parties in that it is widely thought that this Bill strengthens a two-party system and limits the minor parties and independent groups being able to secure seats through the PR and would become somewhat difficult other than in areas where we have sufficient dominance as far as the wards are concerned. That is a fact we must concede. As far as the percentage of the seats available through the PR is concerned, it shifts only if the Deciding Percentage is under 30 per cent and not if it is more than 30 per cent. That is also seen as an issue of concern for us. However, we went along with the majority opinion because the two major parties were keen that this should be left as it is, though we wanted this matter be clarified further and to see whether the percentage of the PR seats be increased by a very definite arrangement.

For minor parties who cannot win in any of the wards in the local authority, the task of securing seats through PR will be somewhat challenging principally because they need to convince voters of the merits of voting for a party that may not win in their ward, but could potentially win through the PR. Then, there is also this other concern that these groups may secure 5 per cent of the total votes at the local authority, but may not be able to secure 5 per cent in every ward and therefore would lose votes in the count.

These are salient concerns we had. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, please wind up.

989 990

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Okay. I am winding up.

These were matters that we have urged and subsequently we would continue to advance these issues so that at least they will see the merit of our argument because they are supposed to be having another set of elections soon for 90 local authorities. But, that would of course be under the present system. That is the prevailing former system. This particular system, according to the Government, is to be introduced when the elections are held four years hence for the rest of the local authorities. Therefore, in between there may be certain lacunas since this Bill has been introduced post-haste with various other amendments. There was also another issue that the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha brought to our notice which is also a salient matter. - [Interruption.] Up to now, what I understood from the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena and some discussions we have had is - this delimitation process is going to take quite a while. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Are you going to have the rest of the elections under the new system?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) We will get the Hon. Minister, to state the position. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Please make that clear. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I think the Hon. Minister will make the position much more clear. Thank you very much.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next is the Hon. R. Sampanthan.

[. . 3.34]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I desire to make a few remarks in regard to these proposed Amendments. But, before I do so, Sir, I must observe that the Amendments that have been distributed in the House today have only been in English and in Sinhala. The Tamil version of the Amendments has not yet been

distributed. It would be my respectful submission that anything distributed in this House must be simultaneously in all three languages. After all, both Sinhala and Tamil are the Official Languages of this country and constitutionally enshrined. I think it is incumbent on the Chair to ensure that any amendment distributed in this House should be in all three languages because that is a fundamental requirement of the Constitution, the Standing Orders and the procedures of this House. In fact, I would even take the view that all the proceedings pertaining to this Bill, without the draft of the amendments in Tamil being distributed, would be invalid. But, I think that question of invalidity can arise only if we have a Supreme Court that is really supreme. I must lodge my very strong protest against this Debate being continued without the proposed Amendments in Tamil having been made available to the House.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Tamil version of the amendments will be made available to you shortly. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) It is not good enough, Sir, to say that it will be made available later. We are debating the Bill. When the Bill is being debated, the amendments in all three languages must be available to all the Members of the House. For you to say that it will be made available later is to tender an apology on behalf of the Government, which is unacceptable.

Having said that, Sir, I do not know whether the Government is inclined to proceed with this Debate, without the Tamil Amendment being made available. I want to ask the Government: "Is it your position that whether the Amendment is made available in Tamil or not, you will proceed with the Debate? Is that your position?" If you do not answer me, I will assume, the country will assume and the world will assume that that is your position.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Mr.Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Government gave the assurance that the Amendments in Tamil will be circulated in a short while. Amendments are necessary in order to move in the Committee Stage. Until then, the Bill is in all three languages and if, any proposal is being made for an amendment or a revision of any section, it can be done during the course of the Debate. It will be considered only at the Committee Stage. The Committee Stage can be made use of to propose even simple amendments. So, I do not think that we have deliberately done anything wrong. I accept what the Hon. R. Sampanthan is saying. It will be made available to you in the next few minutes.

991 992

2011 05

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, may I in return ask the Hon. Minister that if the amendments are relevant only at the Committee Stage, and will be considered and looked at only at the Committee Stage, why have the amendments in Sinhala and English been distributed? What was the need for that? If it is your position that the amendments are considered only at the Committee Stage, why have the amendments in Sinhala and English been distributed? What was the need for that?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) When we started the Debate, the Opposition demanded that the amendments be given immediately. Then, we distributed the English version of the amendments. The Sinhala version of amendments came a few minutes later. First, they said that the Sinhala version is not available. So, it is in the process of coming. If we do not give the amendments prior to the Committee Stage, I will give the assurance to the Hon. Member, that we will not move on to the Committee Stage. We will adjourn at that time.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I would rather not accept these verbal assurances from the Hon. Minister though I do have much respect for him because there is a constitutional provision and a certain procedure that has to be observed in this House. When it is not observed and when there is a breach of such constitutional procedure and constitutional provision, I do not think assurances from any Minister can make up for that breach. That will be my submission, Sir.

Having said that, I want to just refer to one or two matters which are relevant. There was a Consultative Committee Meeting in regard to this Bill. At that meeting were present several Members of Parliament. I too was fortunately there. That was before I went on leave. The Hon. A.L.M Athaullah, the Minister of Local Government, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena who chaired the Select Committee on Electoral Reforms and the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Minister of Economic Affairs were all present at that meeting. We raised certain questions particularly in regard to the Delimitation Committees, both at the national level and the district level. There were certain commitments made by the Ministers in unison to all the Members of Parliament present in regard to the manner in which these Delimitation Committees, both at the national level and at the district level, will be constituted.

In regard to the National Delimitation Committee, it was the view of the Members that it must be representative of all the communities that reside in the

country and I must say that that provision has been brought in, which now states, "...Minister, from among persons representing all communities, who are persons not actively engaged in politics, and one of whom shall be nominated by him to be the Chairman of the National Committee". That is all right.

In regard to the District Delimitation Committees, the assurance given by the Ministers to the Members present was that the District Delimitation Committee would be nominated by the National Delimitation Committee and we accepted that. But, I find that the position is different now. In an Amendment distributed sometime ago, it has been stated that the District Members to be appointed by the National Committee shall be in consultation with the Minister. The commitment made by the Ministers was that the National Delimitation Committee shall be entrusted with the responsibility of appointing the District Delimitation Committees. But, here, in an amendment distributed sometime ago, when I was not in Parliament, it contemplates that the Members of the National Committee shall make the appointment to the District Committee in consultation with the Minister. That was not contemplated at all in the commitment made to us by the Government.

What does the Amendment distributed today state? It states that the Minister shall appoint the District Delimitation Committee. Where is your commitment? Where is your assurance? After all, these Local Government Authorities are the real fountains of democracy. That is where democracy commences at the ground level and it goes up to the level of the National Parliament and the Executive Presidency. We wanted to ensure that the Delimitation Committees would comprise of independent persons and would be representative of all the communities who live in this country and you agreed, though there was no provision initially for the inclusion of persons of all communities in the National Committee, to make an amendment which you have done. At the district level, you initially wanted to have the District Secretary and several officials. We raised objections to that and said that they are all Government servants, who will be at your beck and call, who will not defy you, they will not be independent, they must be independent persons and then there was an agreement amongst all the Members and the Minister has announced that the appointment of the District Delimitation Committee shall be by the National Delimitation Committee. That was the amendment contemplated in the draft Amendment distributed sometime ago in this House. But the words, "in consultation with the Minister" were added which was were not in consonance with the commitment made by the Ministers to the Members of Parliament.

The Amendment today states that the Minister shall appoint the District Delimitation Committee. The National Committee has nothing to do with it. What

993 994

happened to your commitment? Where has your commitment gone? Why are you dumb? Why do you not answer me? Where is your commitment that the District Delimitation Committee will be appointed by the National Delimitation Committee? Why have that been put into the dustbin? Now, are you not trying to manipulate democracy? Are you not trying to engineer democracy? Are you not trying to subvert democracy? Are you not thinking that democracy is something which only you are entitled to and which you can manipulate in the way you want? This is why I think some Members of this House have been suggesting - [Interruption.] Yes, I do not mind, certainly. .. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) If your suggestion is agreeable, we can amend that. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) So, this is why some Members have been suggesting; this is an important Bill, and you have drafted your amendments. At the end of the Second Reading Debate, before the Committee Stage is taken up, let us sit down together, look at the Bill again with the feeling that no one is trying to get the better of the other to some conspiracy or some subterfuge, let us agree, discuss and come to an agreement in regard to the amendments at the Committee Stage and then come to the Committee Stage with the agreement of the Members of all the parties in the House and then, we can have it passed. This is why, Sir, I would suggest that at the end of the Second Reading Debate, particularly because the Tamil translation has not been made available, which is a fundamental right of every Tamil-speaking Member of this House, which cannot be denied, we adjourn the sitting of the House for the Committee Stage for some other date and that we meet in the meanwhile and discuss the matter and come to an agreement in regard to the proposed amendments and have them tabled when the House takes up the Debate for the Committee Stage on a future date.

I would like to mention one other matter, Sir. I heard the Hon. Rauff Hakeem say that every time there is a vacancy in a local authority, you cannot be having a by- election which will mean that we will be having elections somewhere all throughout the year. I see some sense in that position. But, if a council is dissolved for some reason, I do not see why a Special Commissioner should function for the entirety of the balance period. I think if a council had been dissolved, for whatever reason, a Special Commissioner can be appointed for an interim period. But, I think at the earliest possible time thereafter, after the dissolution, the voters of that local authority must be given the opportunity to elect a new local authority which can take over the responsibility of local

government in that local government area. I think that is necessary. I would not ask for a by-election in every ward for every vacancy, but when a council as such is dissolved, I do not think the administration of that council should be entrusted for the entire balance period to a Special Commissioner. I think the much healthier practice would be to hold fresh elections and give the voters an opportunity of electing a new local authority.

I would once again request the Government to kindly adjourn this Debate at the end of the Second Reading, so that we can by agreement draft the proposed amendments, which can be adopted at the Committee Stage without conflict. Thank you Sir.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is your point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, this Adjournment Motion deals with petrol prices, gas prices, other commodity prices et cetera - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, now you can move your Adjournment Motion.

INCREASING COST OF LIVING ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I move,

"The economy of the country is going through turbulent times. The picture created during elections is not what is reflected after the elections.

The Public Debt has increased and now it is projected to be SLR 1,250 Billion Debt Amortisation in 2012, Inflation is rising. Total Debt to exports ratio is dangerously increasing. Petrol prices, gas prices, other commodity prices have been increased after the elections. Furthermore, Government expenditure is increasing without a corresponding benefit to the people.

Will the Minister advise as to when the people get the reduction in cost of living, increase in salaries and reduction in Government expenditure."

So, on that score . , - [ ] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is your point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, this Adjournment Motion deals with the increase of prices of so many items. This morning, Sir, the Hon. Minister of Petroleum Industries, took - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, specify your point of Order and raise it.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, he got the permission from the Chair and explained the whole issue in the morning regarding the contents of the Adjournment Motion.

1041 1042

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not a point of Order.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) All those things have been replied by the Hon. Minister. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not relevant. Hon. Member, you can continue. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, can you kindly ensure that the dignity of this House is maintained? The Hon. Prime Minister is here; the Chief Government Whip is here. Can we have this type of jokers

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

in this House? [Interruption.] I did not mention who the joker

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

is. I said, "This type of jokers"

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! If there is anything contrary to the Standing Orders, that portion will be expunged. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) This is actually ludicrous. This happens everyday in the morning and in the evening. There is a decorum that has to be maintained in this House. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I have all the right to raise a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You go to the CMC or somewhere and do that. That will be better than coming here and wasting time in Parliament.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Hon. Member, please continue with your Adjournment Motion. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) On that particular score, Sir, the Government always says that the economy is hunky-dory, this and that, and the benefits are being accrued down to the people. But, we are yet to see that the peace dividends coming down. So, all we want to say at this particular moment is that the country is going through economic turbulent times. We have always been saying that we need a very strong economy and there is no one other than we, who have been mentioning that we need a national economy to withstand the vicissitudes that take place during many problems that are there in the world. Now, today I am happy that at least some Ministers accept that there is a world problem that affects Sri Lanka. Previously there were people who had said that even if there were tsunamis outside the world, Sri Lanka would be benefited and nothing happens to Sri Lanka. But, today they say the oil prices are impacting. Now, they say that recession in Europe is taking place. All these have an impact on Sri Lanka. So, I am moving this Adjounrment Motion in order to ensure that the Sri Lankans are basically protected from the economic crisis that we are facing at this particular moment.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Perumal Rajathurai to take the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I propose that the Hon. Perumal Rajathurai do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

Government Earmarks Five State Enterprises for Restructuring. Says COPE Approval Received For Restructuring ; Government Says No Privatization, But Sells PMFC.

I do not know. I am subject to correction. I am only going on a newspaper article. I would like to believe that this is the case. But, this is the same Government that says they are not in a privatization mode; they are even going to resurrect every dead company that is there. Then what is happening to these? Why is that you are saying so? If the Government says such a thing and they are acting directly on the contrary, then there has to be something radically wrong.

Then, I would like to move on to the CEB. , . , 5,000 . . 88 45 . . . . 40 . ? . . , " " . . , , " , " . , , .

. . . . . . . You all are basically protecting your inflation through high rupee valuation. Today exporters are reeling. You can say, on one side that there is no problem et cetera. If you really ask the exporters, they are basically shifting their base to India, they are shifting their textile base to Bangladesh, they are even contemplating bringing in Indonesian labour into this country, because Chinese are already coming in here to build the port in Hambantota. This morning, the young Minister was saying that they are building the Airport by bringing Chinese labour. When you look at the Nomads Grounds, they are building a complex there. Even for that, they are bringing in Chinese labour.

The nominal increase in debt is not a good indicator to measure the debt burden of a country. , statistically . . The accepted international practice is to measure the debt as a per cent of the countys income, that is the GDP. We should not forget the fact that the debt to GDP ratio was very high; at 105.6 per cent in 2002 under the UNP regime. Today, we must inform this House that the debt to GDP ratio has declined to 81.9 per cent in 2010. This simply means that the countrys national income has grown at a higher rate than the growth of outstanding debt during the recent years.

(a) (i) While being attached to the Sammanthurai Police Station in Ampara Division, Mr. A. M. Ismail has been reinstated in the service with effect from 25.08.1995, after he has been suspended by the Senior Superintendent, of Police of Ampara on 14.07.1994 on disciplinary matters. As the inability to report to the service according to the aforesaid order, again he has suspended from the service on 08.10.1995, after that as the report to the service cannot be observed on 26.05.1997, again he was suspended from the service on 20.03.1998. After 07 years, appeals dated 16.04.2005 and 14.07.2005 have been made by him to reinstate in service. In one of the appeal he has stated that he went abroad due to LTTE threats and in other one he has stated that he was bitten by a snake, as the reasons for the inability to report to the service. According to the above details, this

1135 1136

2011 05

officer has given up the two chances, which have been given to reinstate in service and also he has acted according to his own consent. Eventhough he has indicated that he has been bitten by a snake, through the appeal made on 14.07.2005, he did not produce any medical report regarding to it. It is observed that this person is trying to reinstate to the service by forwarding fault information as it is very clear the mismatched in the reasons he has indicated in the appeals.

(ii) Eventhough it has been indicated that a written recommendation to reinstate in service has been given to the Deputy Inspector General of Police of the Eastern Province (South) through the letter

number S/2/1/380/09 dated 05.06.2009 by the Senior Superintendent of Police of Ampara, such a recommendation has not been received by the Reserve Police Headquarters.

(b) According to the instructions given by the letter number POL/62/402/10 dated 23.08.2010 of Ministry of Defence, as well as the policy decision taken to refuse the appeals of those who have not produced appeals within the due time period after vacating the Post and those who have not in the service for more than one (01) year from the date which has been ordered to vacate the post, this officer cannot be reinstated in the service.
