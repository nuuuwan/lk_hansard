( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, you reply. Do not worry, we will say what you cannot tell. That is the stark reality faced by the country. Do not try to camouflage the economy of this country. You know that Europe is in trouble; you know that America is going into further trouble. Asia is in dire straites and do not think that Sri Lanka is not insulated

from this problem.-[Interruption.] You have lost your red tag, the Socialist tag and the Communist tag. The Cabinet portfolio is more important for you these days. That is why the downtrodden are ignored, Hon. Minister. But, it does not matter. These are times when they even forget their mother and father. So, forgetting the political party you reflect does not make a big difference.

1500-metre water depth and 24-metre of gross gas pay at 4,000-metre depth would appear to be non-commercial in its own right. Also, no suggestion of testing the well although may not have announced the confidentiality, it is usually somewhat negative on volume with all the work being finished, it is proven hydrocarbon system and two wells have found a little bit of oil.

[2.28 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Presiding Member, it gives me great pleasure to speak today in support of this Budget put forward by the Government. More than two years have passed since the conclusion of the conflict, which held back the development of this country. Since then, we have had a series of elections. The results have shown immense satisfaction in most of the country with what Government has achieved during this period, but we have also got to register that in a few places, the people have indicated that we must do better.

I believe this Budget makes clear that, as far as the North of this country is concerned as well as other places that have suffered deprivation in the past, the Government intends to pursue the policy of rapid infrastructural development without which we cannot promote equitable prosperity. For too long, more distant areas were not properly connected with the rest of the country, which inhibited connectivity, social as well as economic, to facilitate development. The massive amounts dedicated to Capital Expenditure in select Ministries for next year make clear our determination to enhance opportunities for all our people.

339 340

There is no doubt, Sir, that uneven development contributed to the resentments that burst into revolution three times in the last half century. Though in the North these resentments were also coloured by what seemed unjust policies with regard to language and education and public sector recruitment, we must also register the similarities between the motivations of youngsters from all areas who took to arms. In both cases, we needed to prevent continuing anarchy, but once terror was overcome, we had to concentrate on removing the grievances that had been expressed in such violent forms.

That social ideal was the foundation on which His Excellency the President based the Budget he presented. It is no accident that the first measure he enunciated was the provision of additional funding to develop a trilingual society through upgrading training facilities for teachers and also through new types of telecommunication.

Training and technology are key words for a society moving forward. But immediately after those symbols of a new era were mentioned, the Opposition, not I think coincidentally, retreated into its customary primitive forms of rote disruption that make clear its incapacity to learn or to modernize. I must register, however, that the Tamil National Alliance and the other Representatives of those who had suffered in the past, the old JVP, remained behind and behaved with dignity. I hope this indicates their determination to contribute, through responsible and constructive criticism rather than infantile posturing, to the new era of development.

Mr. Presiding Member, the imaginative manner in which education and training are planned is a highlight of the Budget. Whilst making clear the primary responsibility of provincial administration for social services such as health and education, the President's speech emphasized the need for more and better teachers in key subjects such as maths, science, IT and languages. He also affirmed the policy of school-based recruitment, given that the current system has failed for half a century and more to provide students in deprived areas with teachers for essential subjects. Equally importantly, His Excellency the President made clear the need for upgrading vocational training, and removing the current archaic distinction between academic training and skills. The philosophy behind this, that all of us have strengths that must be appreciated and encouraged, is another fundamental principle that will help us move forward. The application of that principle to problems that have caused conflict in the past is most welcome, as is the emphasis in this Budget on segments of society that have suffered in the past.

This approach has contributed to one of the most imaginative, long overdue measures that was mentioned. The determination to prevent the waste of money as well

as human capital that our current sentencing policy represents is most welcome. The impressive work done with former combatants has taught us the benefits of treating those who have erred through social circumstances rather than criminality as assets rather than liabilities. The provision of work and training for such individuals, instead of the deadening, if not corrupting expensive incarceration imposed on them previously, will help them as well as the society.

The Budget, Sir, makes it clear that the people of this country are an asset to be cherished and developed. The same goes for our physical environment. The plans to conserve old buildings, to develop new archaeological sites in areas previously neglected and to revitalize old crafts, all underline the faith in this country and its potential that we could not affirm for so long.

This innovative and exciting approach, however, requires skilful and committed administration. In this regard, it is vital that we also upgrade our Public Service so that we can promote effective implementation of those plans. I was pleased to see that the allocation for capacity development in the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs has been increased from Rs. 65 million to Rs.137 million. But, we need to ensure that this money is well spent and that training develops problem-solving and decision-making skills, and not just the ability to absorb financial and administrative regulations and use them as an excuse for doing nothing. The Honorable Member for Colombo, who opened the Debate, talked about slowness in the Public Service and even suggested that might be a form of sabotage. I have long learnt never to assume conspiracy where incompetence is explanation enough, but he has a point in that we really must speed up our decision-making processes and also empower the staff to understand issues expeditiously, make assessments and respond in a systematic and timely fashion. Better language skills of both comprehension and self-expression are vital for this, and our failure to demand reports and discuss them must be remedied.

Sir, we also need to raise levels of accountability and transparency, so that our administrators will not only understand the public purposes of public positions and public funding, but will also appreciate the need to plan carefully and monitor results. In that regard, I would suggest that in future we also have more information in the documents presented to Parliament when the Budget comes before us. It would, for instance, help us to understand more precisely the impact of Government policies and practices if the Budget figures give us not only the allocations of previous years but also the actual spending. We need to know which areas are performing well and which require improvement.

We also need to move towards new forms of delivery for the many services that will be provided. One of the great dangers of a caring society, which this Budget

341 342

emphatically affirms, is that it could turn into a paternalistic one which limits diversity. In that regard, I welcome His Excellency the Presidents determination not to go back to the statist policies of the 60s and 70s. I was amused in this regard that the Honourable Member from Colombo, who is the latest convert to the extreme conservatism of his leader, declared that this Government was benefiting Sinhala traders at the expense of the minorities. He has evidently forgotten the claim of his leader, in his Poujadiste, chauvinistic phase some years back, when he accused the nationalism of the Bandaranaike governments as having destroyed small Sinhalese businessmen while allowing Tamil traders to flourish. He made this claim in what seemed a justification of the racist attacks on Tamils that his Government encouraged, declaring that Tamils had not suffered so much then as Sinhalese businessmen had done because of nationalization.

Unthinking nationalization benefits no one, but neither does unthinking privatization. His Excellency the President was right then in also rejecting categorically the laissez faire excesses of the post-Senanayake -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The Hon. Professor Wijesinha is saying that the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake said that the Tamil businessmen flourished at the expense of the Sinhala businessmen. But, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake never said that.

( ) (The Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Palitha Range Bandara) , - [ ] ( ) (The Presiding Member) . [ ] . [ ] . [ ] , . [ ] ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Sir, I think the present exhibition by the Opposition suggests exactly how their misgovernment continued. The Hon. National List Member completely misunderstood what I said. I cited what the Hon. Member from Colombo said. ( ) (The Presiding Member) warn . .[ ] - - .

( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Hon. Chair, I pointed out what the Hon. Member from Colombo had said but I am sorry that the Hon. Member from the National List cited that Member by name. He obviously made a mistake in appealing for breach of Standing Orders by breaching the Standing Orders himself. But, this is typical of the way the Opposition performs. What I said was that what the Hon. Member from Colombo had said was in direct contradiction to what his leader had said and what the Member from the National List cited was what I referred to his leader having said, and had he been around and remembered in 1983 what the Party he now represents engaged in, he would be ashamed of himself, but his memory is too short.

Sir, unthinking nationalization benefits no one, neither does unthinking privatization. His Excellency was right in rejecting categorically the laissez faire excesses of the post-Senanayake UNP government, the cynical assertion that the robber barons should be allowed to flourish. The idea that capitalism on its own will always have a trickle-down effect is nonsense, which is why liberalism requires strong social interventions to ensure a level playing field. This is totally different to what is termed neo-liberalism, but is more properly associated with the neo-conservatism of the IDU into which the UNP is now being absorbed lock, stock and barrel.

Government, Sir, needs to protect as well as to facilitate, to ensure social services that will promote equality of opportunity, to provide infrastructure that will maximize fulfilment of opportunities. Maintaining a balance is not always easy, which is why at different historical stages liberalism emphasizes different priorities. Always, however, it stresses the potential of individuals, which is why governments must, as this Budget so clearly does, encourage imagination and initiative, and ensure education and training to allow these full play.

The Budget talks of measures to encourage investment and private-sector involvement in many areas, but we need in particular to develop a range of training options, in academic as well as vocational education, for administrators as well as educationists. In taking forward the many suggestions with regard to agriculture and land use, which will, I hope, include emphasis on sustainable development and eco-friendly practices, we need to make maximum use of professional and technical training. And, for better results in the Public sector, we need to work together with other countries that have already made the transition from poverty to strong economies, as His Excellency noted. Best practices in countries that have similar histories in the post-colonial period should be studied, to promote better formulation and implementation of public policies.

Sir, this Budget is presented at a time of transition, when this country is poised to take off into the prosperous pluralistic future that the conflicts of the last quarter century precluded. Those conflicts in turn sprang from the extremism of the very different social and economic perspectives that His Excellency mentioned. Now that we are back to equilibrium, we need to innovate boldly whilst ensuring essential support for those in need. The Budget provides us with the framework on which we can build, and I hope even the most hopeless Members of the Opposition will not continue to misinterpret it deliberately and will not begrudge the country the brilliant future it deserves.

Thank you.

Mr Michael Fennel, OJ, CD President Commonwealth Games Federation 2nd Floor 138 Picadilly London W17 7NR UNITED KINGDOM

Dear Mr Fennel,

As you are aware, Sri Lanka has been a member of the Commonwealth since Independence, and has been active politically, economically and socially. The United National Party, which is currently the main Opposition Party in Sri Lanka,

has over the years played a key role in promoting Sri Lankas standing within the Commonwealth during the many periods when the Party was in office.

In this background, the United National Party in the event of it being in the Government will continue to support the candidature of the City of Hambantota to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

Yours Sincerely,

Ranil Wickremasinghe Leader of the Opposition, Sri Lanka Parliament Leader of the United National Party

[4.38 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Second Reading Debate of the Budget for 2012. Before I deal with some of the matters that have been proposed as budgetary measures for next year, with your permission, let me reiterate one or two things that I have said before in every Budget Debate that I have participated in this House, which I think is important. This is the third time that I am saying these things and I wonder how many more times it will take before some Minister replies to these matters.

Yesterday, the Hon. Minister of Finance presented the Budget. It is the considered opinion of many that the portfolio of Finance cannot be held by His Excellency the President; that there is a Constitutional bar to the President holding the portfolio of Finance. This has been stated before. It can easily be established by reference to many provisions in the Constitution itself. There is no expressed bar, but it can easily be derived that the Constitution does not intend to have the Executive hold the portfolio of Finance. One particular Article - Article 151 (2) - specifically refers to a dual control in case of

385 386

[ ]

2011 22

contingencies, how monies can be drawn. It says that the Minister of Finance, with the permission of His Excellency the President, must do that. That is a dual control. It obviously envisages two persons to act in conjunction. It never envisages both these positions to be held by one and the same person. That is just one example.

In presenting the Budget, the Hon. Minister of Finance also went beyond mere tabling of facts and figures, and as is customary, detailed some of the policy measures that the Government intends taking. As a background to that, he started off by referring to 1977 as a watershed in this countrys history, and very clearly articulated his position that all ills of this country commenced from 1977. He talked about the vision that his father, his brothers, and himself together with the Bandaranaike family had for this country, but that from 1977 the clock was put back. I can see the Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne listening to my speech. I am sure he will not agree with that statement - [Interruption.] He will not agree with that statement of the Minister of Finance. I can see many senior Ministers of the 1977 Government in the front row and even in the second row who will not agree with that statement of the Minister of Finance. But, that was the position of the Minister of Finance yesterday; that all hell broke loose in 1977. Prior to that, this was a paradise. He said that in the context of the conflict that we have had between communities. I cannot figure out why he referred to 1977 as a "watershed". Perhaps 1956 may have been more appropriate, or, if he did not want to point a finger at the SLFP Government of 1956, which brought in the Official Languages Act and made Sinhala the only official language of this country, he could then very well have referred to 1948 and 1949, when the Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act was passed as a starting point of majoritarian rule in this country that gave rise to the conflict. But, for reasons known only to himself, he referred to 1977 and then quickly moved on to the Tamil youth taking arms, what he described as "terrorism" that had to be put down with a heavy hand. So, as a policy statement in a Budget Speech, this causes serious problems because the Hon. Minister of Finance is presenting a Budget, and he is telling the country that the priorities for the next year are going to be reconciliation; the priorities are going to be a trilingual language policy; the priorities are going to be rebuilding the North and the East that has been devastated by the war. But, he is setting the stage for that policy statement by not really identifying the root cause of the conflict, but to a change of government in 1977. If that is the way this issue is to be approached, I am afraid the root causes of the conflict will not be addressed. They say you must put the money where your mouth is. For all that was stated, if one looks at the figures that have been presented, one finds that the allocation for the Ministry of National Languages has been reduced by almost Rs. 100 million for next year. So, much is said in words with regard to a trilingual language policy but not supported by the rupees and cents in the

Budgetary allocation; in fact, quite the opposite. So, as an Opposition, it is our role to raise these matters as constructive criticism and say, "Well, if you say this is priority, show it in rupees and cents". That is the only way you can substantiate what you are saying. In the mini-Budget that was presented after the General Election of 2010, we raised an issue with regard to housing in the war zone, we raised the issue that over 200,000 houses had been destroyed - the Government itself says over 160,000 houses were destroyed - and we asked the question, Where is the allocation for housing? If you make the solemn promise that you will build back these houses - ( ) (The Hon. Arundika Fernando) What about the infrastructure? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, I will come to the infrastructure. I will come to that. ( ) (The Hon. Arundika Fernando) You are talking nonsense. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, I am not talking nonsense. I will reply that straightaway. There is a lot of infrastructure development that is taking place. What needs to be acknowledged, we will acknowledge. We will not run away, we will not deny what is happening. A lot of infrastructure development is taking place: roads are being built, bridges are being built and electricity is being provided, particularly in the North and the East. That needs to be acknowledged and I think that is a good thing. It must happen. I am talking about priorities. When people do not have a house to live in, is it of priority to build a concrete road and carpet it 10 feet away from their hut? What is priority for this House? What is priority for this Government? The Government acknowledges that 160,000 houses have been destroyed. People must have a roof over their heads. You acknowledge it and then you build a road next to where their houses ought to have been. If you are satisfied that that is the priority of the Government and that must be praised, that is your view. We beg to differ. We think that the basic necessities must be met first. We raised that issue in the first mini- Budget that was presented and the Acting Minister of Finance at that time, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, showed us figures and said that those were for housing and we were able to demonstrate at that Debate itself that those figures came from tsunami housing figures and nothing to do with building back houses after the war. We asked the

387 388

question even then about the 50,000 houses that had been promised by the Government of India. The Government stated then that it was the Government that negotiated and obtained the gift of 50,000 houses. After one and a half years, out of the 50,000 houses, we have exactly 50 houses that have been built; only 50 houses have been built. We know the reason also. The beneficiaries list is constantly interfered with by a Minister from the North. ( ) (An Hon. Member) There is only one Minister. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It is constantly interfered with by military. Area commanders have to approve who gets the house. ( ) (The Presiding Member) You are approaching a dangerous zone. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) What is the dangerous zone? Is it the time? How much time do I have? ( ) (The Presiding Member) No, when you refer to a Minister. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you for acknowledging that that is a dangerous zone. ( ) (The Presiding Member) I only reminded you of the Standing Orders. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Todays The Island newspaper gives an "exclusive" to some report. We do not know whether it is true or false but that report also identifies the dangers associated with those personalities. ( ) (The Hon. Arundika Fernando) Hon. Sumanthiran, the total investment in the North and the East is Rupees seven billion.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, that is acknowledged. I am only asking with regard to housing. I am not denying - [Interruption.] Even to enjoy that investment, where do they live? They have been given six poles, a few tin sheets and now for two and a half years -

( ) (The Hon. Arundika Fernando) Let time decide that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) All right. If that is the attitude, I will take that. If there is money to build roads and bridges - if there is no money, that is a different matter. You have money to build all those roads and bridges. Then, why is it that the people are compelled to live under tarpaulin sheets for years?

( ) (The Hon. Arundika Fernando) What about education, schools and health? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You have to live and sleep in a house before you go to a school. I think the Hon. Member who is asking me these questions is helping me a great deal.

( ) (The Hon. Arundika Fernando) I am not helping you. It is sense.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If you say it is sense to have roads and bridges around you without a house to live in, that shows something about the sense of this Government.

There are many good proposals in this Budget. ( ) (The Hon. Arundika Fernando) At last!

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, not "at last", I started with that. But, one needs to examine a Budget from performances, from targets, and if you look at the Central Bank Report, you will find that

389 390

[ .. ]

2011 22

the targets are changed. It is a very strange thing. You make a Budgetary allocation showing a particular target and halfway through the year, the target is changed. So, you have achieved the target. Shifting of the goalpost, they call it. You cannot kick the ball into the goal, so you move the goalpost and then shout over goal. Those are the performance indicators that you find in the Central Bank Report and, mind you, the shifting of the goalpost is also acknowledged in the Report.

If you take the Fiscal Management Report, it gives initially the statutory provisions that must be complied with the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act No. 3 of 2003. All the sections are listed and I have that Act here with me. Not even 30 per cent of what ought to be complied with has been complied with in the Fiscal Management Report that was tabled yesterday. Section 22(1) of that Act makes it imperative to give information on enterprises where the Government has shares but not one of those is disclosed in the Fiscal Management Report. How does one evaluate a Budget such as that? It can be made popular with salary increases. That is only 10 per cent eventually. The Hon. Member from Galle explained it this morning -

( ) (An Hon. Member) It is not really a salary increase. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, it is not really a salary increase on the basic salary. But, anyhow that is why I say, you can speak on the Budget and make it a popular Budget. But in this House, it is the responsibility of the Opposition - I think that is what we are doing - to tear down those veils and to show the Budget for what it really is. There are no real salary increases. The forecasts are not realistic. As to what the Hon. Minister of Finance said we want to achieve, many good things were said except what I referred to at the beginning as to the causes of the conflict. But, we will not achieve that unless we examine and are truthful to ourselves as to what has caused the ills of this country, be it social, be it the conflict between communities or the financial state of the country.

In the detailed analysis that we will go into during the Committee Stage Discussion of the Budget, I hope we will be able to examine the allocations properly and have an intelligible debate on that. But, for the moment, I thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for the time given to me to speak on the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill.

Thank you, very much. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you.
