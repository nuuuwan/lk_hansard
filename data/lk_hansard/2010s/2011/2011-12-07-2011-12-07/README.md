[12.16 p.m.] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Arumugan Thondaman - Minister of Livestock and Rural Community Development) Mr. Deputy Chairman, my Ministry attempts to address two major sectors, which are important nationally as well as of concern, internationally. The international community is concerned with the global food security situation and we, as a nation, contribute to national food security through our livestock development efforts. Similarly, our efforts to uplift the living standards of disadvantaged communities will help our nation reach the Millenium Development Goal declared by the United Nations.

The pace of human population growth coupled with economic and urban development has a considerable impact on livestock production, particularly through the growing demand for animal-derived protein. The burgeoning demand for reasonably priced and high-quality meat, eggs and dairy products has created the incentive for the rapid intensification and industrialization of animal production, thus representing economic, social and environmental implications of global dimensions.

Sir, I took office as the Minister of Livestock and Rural Community Development in April 2010, and had the challenge of meeting the changing Sri Lankan consumer demands for livestock products after the post-war situation, and also bring into the mainstream the disadvantaged community who were also very much isolated during the war days. I must sincerely state that I have inherited the acquaintance on livestock sector activities from my late grandfather, Hon. Saumyamoorthy Thondaman.

As for the development of the livestock sector, my Ministry had to give a boost for the revival of the sector at the beginning. Please permit me to highlight the most impressive events which took place during the past one year period.

The Ministry carries out three main projects to lend a hand to subsistence-level livestock farmers in the country. The dairy village programme which was started in 2004 is being continued with great success. The subsidy component under this has been increased to Rs. 35,000 per beneficiary. The concept of the dairy village programme is to enhance the performances of a farm from subsistence-level to commercial-level.

Promotion of liquid milk consumption is a basic pledge in the "Mahinda Chintana" policy document and it is supported by establishing milk sales outlets throughout the country. This will further be supported with the recently-commissioned UHT milk processing plant by

Milco (Pvt.) Limited and supplying them in economical packs. Milco (Pvt.) Limited is now in a position to process 70,000 litres of milk per eight-hour shift per UHT plant in multiple sizes and also expand production as the demand for the new product increases in the market.

Shortage of quality breeding cattle is a lingering drawback to the dairy sector development and we are in need of good quality cows to produce more and more milk to achieve self-reliance in dairy produce. As a solution to this, establishment of private breeder farms were introduced since 2006, with the aim of producing an adequate number of quality cattle for dairy farmers. So far, we have achieved excellent results for these projects and hope to accelerate these to achieve our self-sufficiency targets. In the meantime, steps have been taken to import dairy heifers to fulfil the requirement to some extent, and the first batch of 500 heifers will reach our farms in March 2012.

Sir, the tax concessions on dairy animals and other inputs for dairy already provided by the Government have had positive impacts on the dairy production, and the financial assistance for the livestock industry to reach international markets and VAT exemption on dairy machinery, proposed by His Excellency the President in the Budget Proposals for 2012 will help further accelerate the growth in the dairy sector.

Although the poultry sector performs at optimum level, the sector is very vulnerable to severe market failures, some of which are orchestrated by market actors. My Ministry, therefore, has taken steps to prevent shortages in poultry products in the market in the future. While recognizing the role of the large-scale poultry operators in the country, my Ministry has taken steps to spread the benefits of a growing poultry market to the smallholders by distributing chicks to them and also by establishing mini-hatcheries to meet the demand for chicks by the small operators. This will also support the "Divi Neguma" programme of the Government by ensuring the supply of chicks to the grass-roots level beneficiaries.

Sir, the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake questioned this morning as to how we were planning to achieve the self-sufficiency goal in the supply of milk. He also suggested valuable proposals for dairy development and I am thankful to him for that. However, I must mention here that we are very much aware of the problems he raised. We have planned to develop the farms belonging to the NLDB, with the participation of both, local and foreign investors. We will not only use these investments for the NLDB farm development but also to develop clusters of commercial dairy farms around these farms so that the benefits of State farms development is spread to the wider farming community.

Sir, I would like to mention here that the Kandakaduwa Farm, a matter which was brought up this

1091 1092

morning, has been with the armed forces over a decade. Even recently, we had a communication and as of now, we have not been handed over the farm. I think it is with the armed forces. This is exactly what the Hon. Dissanayake was suggesting. These programmes are already mentioned in the Livestock Master Plan and are in the process of being implemented.

Sir, we already have 145 private sector farms producing more than 100 litres of milk a day and our plan is to increase it by three-fold by helping the small farms to convert them into commercial farms. Sir, we have also not forgotten the human factor behind the development work. We have already provided 20 double cabs for veterinary surgeons and are in the process of providing around 600 motorcycles and another 160 double cabs to address the needs of the field officers.

The other sector my Ministry is engaged in, is the development activities in underdeveloped areas to empower the underprivileged communities living there. I am deeply thankful to His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa for providing me the necessary funds for implementing the projects. His Excellency the Presidents vision to uplift the underprivileged communities in underserved areas irrespective of race, caste, creed or religious bias, has enabled the underprivileged to enter the mainstream of the society through the direct intervention of my Ministry. My Ministry has initiated many development projects worth Rs. 540 million. The programmes and the projects of my Ministry are implemented directly by the Ministry and through the institutions assigned to my Ministry, namely, the Saumyamoorthy Thondaman Memorial Foundation and the Plantation Human Development Trust.

The underprivileged communities in underserved areas need capacity-building if they are to stand on their own feet and sustain themselves. It is towards this goal that the Saumyamoorthy Thondaman Memorial Foundation - STMF - implements the "Praja Shakti" project which aims to achieve comprehensive, complete and overall socio-economic development of the underprivileged communities. Additionally, this enables the youth to equip themselves and empower them to face the globalized world with confidence with much-needed computer literacy, internet and information technology.

Sir, I am very happy to inform you, that so far a total of 47 "Praja Shakti" centres have been established in the underserved areas of Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Kandy, Ratnapura, Galle and Kegalle Districts. The activities under the "Praja Shakti" programme will continue to be designed and implemented to enable the youth to acquire skilled capacities to uplift their social standards.

I have introduced a special initiative, the "Nawashakthi" programme, which is a youth

empowerment programme to create sustainable livelihood for self-employment opportunities. So far, it has provided credit facilities for 313 rural youth to start self-employment ventures and these ventures are progressing successfully. Mr. Deputy Chairman, the Thondaman Vocational Training Centre at Hatton is another institution functioning under the STMF, which imparts technical education to underprivileged youth in multidiscipline, so that they can earn their livelihood in a dignified and decent manner, both in Sri Lanka and overseas.

What my Ministry is endeavouring is to make the youth in underserved areas move from dependency to an independent mode of life, so that they will be equal partners with the rest of the society. The Thondaman Cultural Center at Ramboda which seeks to empower the underprivileged youth to fulfil their cultural and aesthetic needs will help the youth to unveil their hidden capabilities to the society.

The Plantation Human Development Trust - PHDT, which is a catalyst agency under my Ministry, is entrusted with the task of human and social capital development of plantation worker community. It has supported all major interventions in the plantation sector in social welfare programmes, estate infrastructure development projects, integrated rural projects, plantation reform projects and plantation development supportive programmes. The PHDT extends its activities in monitoring child development centres which support worker families, particularly the working women, to focus on their employment and also support the economy by making women free to attend economic activities.

Now, I would like to disclose the highlights in 2011. They are lined up in descending chronological order. For the first time in history, the Ministry of Livestock and Rural Community Development is headed by a Secretary from Animal Production and Health Service. I strongly believe it would be a very good catalyst for the employees to achieve their targets efficiently as the new Secretary has a thorough insight on all aspects of the livestock sector. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to His Excellency the President, for his generous support for the accession of the Secretary.

Sir, to make the enthusiastic entrepreneurs aware of novel world trends in livestock industry, an exhibition was held from 7th to 9th of July, at the BMICH premises, where we also had a grand livestock exhibition with the collaboration of all Provincial Departments of Animal Production and Health together with the Central Department of Animal Production and Health. The livestock exhibition was a good opportunity to farmers, new- comers to the sector, students and entrepreneurs to witness latest trends and developments in global livestock industry.

I am very proud to state that due to the stringent import and quarantine procedures adopted by the Department of Animal Production and Health, we have successfully managed to prevent the entry of avian influenza. The Department of Animal Production and Health will continue this and will help to keep our country free from trans-boundary animal disease.

Sir, the dairy farming in this country is considered as an under-privileged occupation and this has created a negative impact on the diary industry. The only solution that we have is to strengthen the dairy farmers economically. With effect from 1st of March, 2011, the price paid for a litre of milk was increased to Rs. 50.00. It is the minimum price a farmer can obtain if he produces milk of 4.2 per cent of fat and 8.3 per cent of solid non-fat. After this price increase, there is a reawakening in the dairy sector and this would be a good omen of future accomplishments. Last year, the fresh milk production was 247 million litres. By the year 2015, we have to produce 785 million litres of milk per year, or in other words, we have to increase the production by three-fold. This is a massive task but I strongly believe that it is an achievable painstaking task.

In rural community development programmes, I would like to highlight the following programmes which were carried out during this year: Distribution of wheelchairs to the physically-challenged people; distribution of sewing machines to the women in the area; setting up women self-help groups; carrying out medical and health awareness camps; organizing cultural and sports camps and competitions; promoting awareness on cleanliness, hygiene and communicable diseases; promoting awareness among women on pre-natal and post natal care; and setting up of dental hygiene health camps in 24 estates.

On the 29th and 30th of November this year, we celebrated the International Youth Day with the participation of 5,000 youth. The event provided them to exchange their dreams and ideas for the future. It enhanced the spirit of the youth to change the world for a better future.

There is a proverb which says A journey of a thousand miles begin with a single step. We have to go far and we have to start the journey somewhere. Our target is to achieve self-sufficiency in all livestock products by the year 2015. We have to have a good comprehensive and realistic plan for that. The Ministry of Livestock and Rural Community Development has produced a master plan, which contains a strategic plan for each subsector - dairy, poultry, goat, swine and alternative livestock species. We will adopt the master plan to achieve our targets to make our country the "Wonder of Asia".

Finally, I wish to place on record, my sincere thanks to the Secretary and staff of my Ministry, the Director-

General and the staff of the Department of Animal Production and Health, the Chairmen of Milco (Pvt) Limited, National Livestock Development Board, the LANLIB, STMF, PHDT, the Chairperson of Mahaweli Livestock Enterprise and all officials committed for the development and success of this Ministry.

Thank you.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Prime Minister, now wind up, please. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Jayaratne) .

, . . . . , , , . . . , , . .

[1.15 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Deputy Chairman, I am speaking today on the Votes of a very important Ministry, a Ministry to which this Government has given very special attention this time.

Under export development, though in the past we talked big about garment exports and though they are very important and the largest export, it is only about 30 per cent of the total value added that really accrues from it to this country whereas plantations contribute 100 per cent of the export value to our foreign exchange earnings in this country. So, under item No. 85 of the Budget Speech, His Excellency the President, who is also the Minister of Finance and Planning, has given special attention to improving the plantations. About six months ago, the Hon. Minister brought in a Motion in this House for increasing the subsidy for replanting from Rs. 200,000 to Rs. 250,000 and the Budget has proposed a further increase of Rs. 50,000, to Rs. 300,000 per hectare. But, I also see that for new plantations, it has been increased from Rs. 50,000 to Rs.150,000.

1099 1100

Today, the Government has decided to take over more than 90,000 acres of land for recultivation. It would not be replanting because those are abandoned lands where you are going to start afresh. Whether those lands would become eligible for the replanting subsidy or whether those would be eligible to be considered as new plantations is the question. It is important that those new plantations, as I suggested during the Second Reading Debate, be given to the estate workers themselves as far as possible so that they would be able to recultivate those lands. If they are going to be entitled to the subsidy you are going to provide as a replanting subsidy, then they would be able to do it without very much additional expenditure because when the subsidy is Rs. 300,000, about Rs. 200,000 is needed for replanting. Other than that, the labour cost is about Rs. 600,000. Those plantation workers themselves, with maybe a loan of about Rs. 100,000 extra for each acre, will be able to replant it by themselves. So, whether the subsidy would be available for those lands as new plantations or otherwise, has to be decided by your Government.

Further, you have also offered low interest loan schemes for this replanting process. Maybe, you would have thought that with those 90,000 acres being rehabilitated and provided with financial incentives, it would become a reality. I welcome this proposal and request the Hon. Minister that those lands be given, as far as possible, to the workers themselves who have the know-how, the aptitude and also the ability to rehabilitate those.

Sir, the plantation companies have been complaining since June that they are running at a loss, that they are finding it difficult to carry on and they are trying to burden the workers, which is very unfair. Since 1996, the trade unions have been signing collective agreements with the plantation companies and one feature of those collective agreements is that, whoever gets a wage increase or not, the plantation workers are guaranteed a wage increase every two years. You may know that every spring in Japan, there is a "spring offensive", as they call it: the trade unions there go for negotiations and get a wage increase every spring. But, in Sri Lanka, the Government does not provide such annual wage increases to the Public servants and does not even recommend it to the private sector. The workers in the private sector and the Public servants receive wage increases now and then and as and when the Government feels like doing so.

However, the trade unions in the plantations have been successful in establishing a collective agreement which ensures that they get a wage increase every two years. In 2007, there was a wage increase of 40 per cent; in 2009, it was 42 per cent, but in 2011, they were able to achieve only 27 per cent, increasing the wages from Rs. 405 to Rs. 515, whereas the workers were hoping to get an increase of 40 per cent as usual, going up to Rs. 550. But,

after granting the Rs. 515 wage, the plantation companies are going round saying that the productivity in the plantations has dropped and that they are running at a loss. The productivity in the plantations has dropped because the companies have failed to replant and carry out good agricultural practices and not because the workers are not producing the tea or rubber. The workers have increased their output over the years. I have explained so many times that in 1992, when the plantations were taken over, which were under the JEDB and the SLSPC, the 22 plantation companies had employed over 420,000 workers. Today, the companies employ only 220,000 workers but the production as a whole, has not dropped. That means, each workers productivity has almost doubled but the companies complain of low productivity. The productivity of the estates of plantation companies, the whole country knows, has dropped from 60 per cent in the past to 30 per cent today and it is the smallholders who are producing almost 70 per cent of the total production of tea in this country. So, it is unfair for the plantation companies to blame the workers. They have to improve the quality of their plantations and the yields and then make their profits without complaining that the grant of wage increase is the cause for the losses.

Today, there maybe a temporary shortfall in the cash flow of these companies because tea prices did drop due to the unrest in the Middle East. Hence, the cash flow may have dropped. Further, since June, unfortunately, soon after the wage increase was announced, the weather in the up-country has been so bad that the crops have failed and that also may have had an impact on the cash flow of those companies. Those are temporary issues. The companies were making very large profits during the end of 2009 up to 2011, for more than one year and nine months.

So, during that period, they did not say that they have too much of profits and they want to share it with the workers. Instead, they enjoyed it even without reinvesting it in the plantations themselves to increase the yield.

We have seen a recent trend where some trade unions have been persuaded to ask the workers to increase the hours that they work. The workers are objecting; they are protesting. So, I am telling them, you continue to do the work that you have been doing in the past. If there is a need for you to do more work, let there be incentives provided by the managements, so that you would be cajoled into doing more work and not be forced into doing more work. This is what should be done and not otherwise.

Recently, you have taken over lands belonging to the plantation companies to the extent of 90,000 acres. In addition to this, in 1973, when the then United Front Government took over the plantations, a large number of estates were neglected so much that those lands became fallow lands. In fact, when you enter Avissawella, you

1101 1102

enter the plantation areas. Right from Avissawella up to Nuwara Eliya, it was all plantations long ago. But, today, beyond Avissawella up to Ginigathena, you find all unutilized and unproductive lands which were plantations in the past. These lands should be re-cultivated. It is good that your Government is focusing on export of tea, rubber and coconuts as a means of earning foreign exchange. In the past, we used to earn 70 per cent of our foreign exchange from these three products but today it has dropped to smaller percentages. But, still, it is good that you are concentrating on increasing the foreign exchange earnings from exports of these primary products of Sri Lanka. As far as increasing the acreage is concerned, you say that you are going to plant rubber in Ampara and in Moneragala. Similarly, I think the lands which earlier had tea - between maybe Avissawella and Ginigathena - are ideal for rubber too. Today, rubber fetches good prices and prospects projected show that prices of rubber would remain high because of the cost of artificial rubber increasing continuously with the increase in petroleum prices. So, on a long-term basis, these lands that were abandoned after the takeover by the JEDB and SLSPC in 1973, which are idling today, can be used to produce rubber or tea.

In the past, even during the days of the British, the Sri Lankan villager was not willing to work in the plantations. That is why they brought labour from India. But, today, with your proposal to give two acres of land for cultivation, maybe even the villager would be interested in getting involved in this. But, do not do that within an estate where there are workers willing and able to work in these new plantations that you are going to develop.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, please wind up now. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) There is only one point to be made.

I also commend your idea of promoting joint ventures between the tea exporter and the tea manufacturer for increasing the input in the export of tea. This was the original concept in 1992, when mostly marketing companies were brought into the plantations. But, unfortunately, except one or two companies, others did not bother to go up the marketing chain to ensure an increased yield from our produce.

So, your incentives and your promotion for such joint ventures are very welcome. As far as the JEDB and the SLSPC are concerned, there still remains a lot of problems like payment of EPF, ETF and gratuity. We have spoken about it so many times. Some properties of the JEDB were sold in Colombo and a sum of of Rs. 160

million was received. But, that was taken over by the Treasury for their own financial needs and not provided to the JEDB for settlement of EPF and ETF contributions. I hope the Government would take action to settle that. What you have taken from the workers, you must pay them. You must settle their EPF and ETF contributions, so that those people will have some social security.

Thank you. [. . 1.32] ( ) (The Hon. Shantha Bandara) , , , , , . .

We have reached an agreement with exporters and we are formulating regulations that will come into practice from November 1, to get Rs. 1 billion per year, for five years, for a dynamic marketing strategy for Ceylon Tea,

, . .

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Plantation Industries) Can I interrupt you for a moment?

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) Yes, sure.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) We have already collected more than Rs. 1 billion. In fact, at the end of this Debate, Item No. 2 - Regulations under the Sri Lanka Tea Board Law - will be moved in the House, which would be the Regulation to charge Rs. 350 per a kilogramme of tea. We have already collected Rs. 1.1 billion.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) From whom are you trying to collect this money?

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) We can do it under the Rules and Regulations. The Regulations have to be brought only within a reasonable time but before that, I had to go before the Cabinet and get Cabinet approval. Now, we have got Cabinet approval and we are presenting the Regulations today.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) So, how are you going to find the funds? ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) The exporters have agreed to pay Rs. 350. ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) What? Who will pay Rs. 350? ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) The exporters.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) Okay. Again do you think that there is any possibility of getting our tea sold after paying Rs. 350 per kilogramme to the Government?

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) From every kilogramme of tea, which is being exported, Rs. 350 will be deducted. That money will go for a promotional advertising campaign overseas and hopefully we will be able to improve the prices.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) Hon. Minister, that would again affect the buyers.

1111 1112

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) No, actually, this is by consensus. We have reached consensus with the exporters. They have agreed with it and they are voluntarily paying this Rs. 350. Hon. Member, there is no issue. I can assure you that.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) Thank you. Anyway, I am not an exporter.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Your time is over. You have to wind up your speech now.

Hon. Minister, you will agree with me about the situation which has arisen in the tea market because of the current situation in Libya. Our prices have dropped very much and it should be your duty to have different avenues opened to make this market sustainable as well as profitable.

Most of the private company owners have really been disturbed by the activities of the unions. I think you would agree with me. Recently, there was an incident at the Demodara Estate where a boiler blasted and three people died. I visited the place myself and still remember that the union leaders actually threatened to throttle the superintendent of the estate, which is an act not called for. I think it was an accident. They paid all the money

1121 1122

due to them but the work of the whole estate came to a standstill because of union activities. So, I hope you will have some sort of control. I know it is very difficult for you but I hope that there should be some sort of control brought about in the long run.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Harin Fernando) , . . , 14,022 . , . [ ] . . , . . 6 . . . . [ ] . [ ] . -[ ] ,- [ ] . . ,- [ ] -[ ] . . , . -[ ]

Hon. Minister, I admire your great grandfather, the late Hon. Saumyamoorthy Thondaman. He was a great man. I am asking you, how many hectares are there under your Ministry and how much of animals do you give people per year? Today 11,600 acres of livestock farming land in Somawathie area, which was under you, is given to Nestle Lanka Limited for banana cultivation. Are you going to suck milk from bananas? Where are you going to export bananas? Whom are you going to satisfy by doing this? This is a corrupt activity. I am cursing this. I am the one who sponsored Nestle to come here. Mr. Sunil Wickremasinghe, Chairman of Milco (Pvt.) Limited, who is a friend of mine, knows how they came here. This is a very sad situation. I would like to give you facts and figures but I do not have enough time.

In conclusion, I would like to tell my Friend, the Hon. Minister that we have to develop the milk industry by breeding more and more animals. His Excellency the President in his Budget Speech spoke of importing 3,000 animals. For what? If you are importing animals from Pakistan or India, you should get hybrid animals. Without slaughtering animals unnecessarily, you have to develop a plan. There is no plan. This is a very sad situation that the whole agricultural sector is facing today. The officers also must take the blame, not only the politicians.

( ) (The Hon. Arumugan Thondaman) Hon. Member, can I interrupt you for a moment?

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) Hon. Minister, you are my Friend, but my time is limited.

( ) (The Hon. Arumugan Thondaman) There is an Action Plan. I will give it to you. ( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) The Hon. C.B. Rathnayake, a former Minister of Livestock Development, told me the same thing some years back. You ask the National Livestock Development Board whether they have a national plan. At that time when I questioned about it, you proudly said, Here is my plan, But, you have changed it. This is the curse of the country. That is what I am saying. I am not blaming you, Hon. Minister. This is the sad situation of the country. Where are we going to end? I am not talking as a Member of the United National Party but as a citizen of this country.

The Hon. C.B. Rathnayake, also a former Minister of Sports, spoke of corruption. What happened? He was kicked out. You see the corruption in the society. This is what I am telling. This is a very sad situation.

My good Friend, the Hon. Minister of Health is coming in. ? . [. . 4.02] .. ( ) ( .. - , ) (The Hon. A.P. Jagath Pushpakumara - Minister of Coconut Development and Janata Estate Development) ,

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You said that you give Rs. 150,000 for new planting and Rs. 300,000 for replanting. But, new planting costs more. Why do you give less for new planting?

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) The cost of replanting is very much more than new planting. And, Hon. Member, there are various other benefits that we give for new planting in addition to this Rs. 150,000. Now, the very fact that it has been increased by as much as Rs. 100,000, is a huge bonus. I do not think we should -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I understand. But, as far as new planting is concerned, the preparation itself costs more. When you are replanting, the landscape is ready; it is only a matter of planting with new plants. It is very much more expensive to do new planting.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Hon. Member, do not forget that this was not given - [Interruption.] What I am saying is, you cannot expect us to give a 100 per cent subsidy to encourage people to go in for new planting. That is up to them. But, what I am saying is, we are doing it in an organized and structured manner. We have identified 37,000 acres on RPCs that have not been cultivated. His Excellency the President went step by step to identify this extent. In the 2011 Budget, he gave the RPCs six months to cultivate uncultivated lands and instructed our Ministry to supervise that, monitor that. We did not wait till the presentation of this Budget. We sent teams to all these estates, monitored what was happening and found that within that six-month period, as a result of His Excellencys proposal only, 2,000 hectares were cultivated by the RPCs. Now, I can tell you, Hon. Member, if His Excellency the President had not announced it in the 2011 Budget, that 2,000 hectares would not have been cultivated. They also realized that they have a social responsibility and that these estates would be taken over if they remained uncultivated; if they did not fulfil the target set by the Government. So, we are happy that by a mere announcement, 2,000 hectares has already been cultivated. We gave them six months to do that. The rest of it is uncultivated land and this year when the 2012 Budget was presented, His Excellency the President announced in this House that this 37,000 acres -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is hectares.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) No, it is 37,000 acres - [Interruption.] No, it is 37,000 acres - [Interruption.] No, no. I can tell you with responsibility it is 37,000 acres. So, this 37,000 acres will be distributed amongst smallholders.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is 37,000 hectares. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) No, it is 37,000 acres. - [Interruption.] No, I can tell you, with responsibility, Hon. Member, that it is 37,000 acres. So, these 37,000 acres will be distributed amongst the smallholders. , , 37,000 . " " :

"..... , 30 02 ."

37,000 . , 37,000 . - [Interruption.] Give me just two minutes. You questioned whether it was 37,000 hectares or 37,000 acres. - [Interruption.] I also have got the same book. I will read the relevant section for you. It is under No. 81 in the Budget Speech. In Sinhala it states, I quote:

"...... 37,000 ..." . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) But, in the English version, it states 37,000 hectares of land.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) It may be a typing error in the English version. I go by the Sinhala version because His Excellency the President read the Budget Proposals in Sinhala. Obviously, whoever translated it has made a mistake. We will rectify that. This is why I brought this book so that any clarification could be made then and there.

FACILITIES FOR DISABLED PEOPLE AT PUBLIC PLACES

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Presiding Member, I move the following Adjournment Motion:

Since the Supreme Court Order SC(FR) 22/2009 dated 27th April 2011 has mandated that all parts of NEW public buildings and places hereinafter shall be designed and constructed in accordance with design requirements specified in the said regulation and no person should be discriminated against on the ground of disability and their mobility restricted in a manner which precludes or impedes them from enjoying equally their inherent right to access, safety and accommodation in day-to-day life at public buildings, public places and facilities provided therewith, this House is of the opinion that those Regulations be implemented early to comply with the said Supreme Court Order.

( ) (The Hon. Janaka Bandara) Mr. Presiding Member, I second the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer.

1209 1210

2011 07

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, Sri Lanka has the fastest ageing population in our region and soon almost 17 per cent of our population will be over 65 years of age. An estimated 20 per cent of Sri Lankas voting population - 4 million - has diverse ability, often with restricted mobility, dexterity and restricted eyesight.

Here, we talk of a wide range of people inclusive of the elderly, those convalescing from various illnesses and accidents, those living with numerous debilitating medical conditions that often go unnoticed such as arthritis, joint problems, diminishing eyesight, uncontrolled diabetes et cetera. There are also those using wheelchairs, sticks and frames, even pregnant women and - not forgetting - our heroic Ranaviru soldiers.

We often see an increasing number of people becoming unwontedly marginalized and even somewhat a prisoner in their own built environments. For some, it is the onset of old age and for others - still young and active - it is the debilitating situations that come and go - may or may not, with accidents and medical conditions. Some may even be worsened by medications or loss of opportunities or stress. In day-to-day life, still tens of thousands of people with restricted abilities often face considerable physical hazards in the man-made environment and are forced to fight an uphill battle when reaching and using essential facilities, tragically even at new public buildings and at most of the ATM machines.

These include toilet and washroom facilities even at new and existing five star hotels, entrances, doorways, steps and stairs at restaurants, cinemas, police stations, lecture halls even at universities, pharmacies in the community and private sector hospitals, local councils, ministries, departments, markets and shops and other important business establishments as well as tourist sites, walkways, parks et cetera.

When we design and construct buildings and facilities the people need to access and use in day-to-day life, still, we disregard inevitable differences in our ability levels and further restrictions the ageing, illnesses and accidents.

About ageing, we are admonished by the Holy Quran not to ill-treat our parents. You have to look after your old parents.

I quote below, Sir, Chapter S.17A. - 23, 24 and 25 of the Holy Quran, along with the translation and the footnotes of Muhammad Yusuf Ali, the eminent translator of this Holy Quran, so that the reading public and this Parliament will know where exactly Islam stands on this important subject:

1211 1212

"" .

Once more I wish to revert to the subject I was dealing with. To make matters worse, although the Court Order and the laws in force clearly state that the Certificate of Conformity cannot and should not be issued if and where compliance of essential building parts with specified design standards the laws have identified clearly, building owners who are equally responsible partners and officials responsible for their issuing, still, continuing to give a blind eye here.

Establishing facilities accessible complying with design standards and specifications laws state, is a very responsible task involving money, time and effort. From what we now witness, it is evident that the professionals

in the construction industry lack the essential practical knowledge and adequate understanding of its intricacies.

As such, owners and authorities undertaking constructions need very much expert guidance as to how best to do this and thereby prevent waste of precious resources. But yet, they still never do this and thereby waste resources.

After all, it is not merely making here and there a ramp or a room and an accessible toilet nor copying blindly a set of advice given to them.

At this point of time, I must emphasize that we have to have Accessibility Advice on this issue.

Here is such a person to whom we could turn for advice - I have with me the details of Dr. Ajith C. S. Perera. A life about to blossom with two international careers in Chemistry and in Cricket was thwarted with the fall of a wayside tree on his moving car in Colombo in 1992.

A product from the University of Colombo, he is academically and professionally well qualified from here and in England. He was also instrumental in persuading and promoting the Sri Lanka Standards Institution to establish for the first time in March 2007 a Sri Lankan standard for design in building construction taking into serious consideration the "diversity in ability" of people. Dr. Ajith C. S. Perera is a popular figure at all social functions in Colombo. The other day I met him at the National Day Celebration of the United Arab Emirates. Some details were sent to me by Shereen of that Embassy. Of course, His Excellency Mahmood Mohammed Al- Mahmood hosted us.

Sir, Dr. Ajith C.S. Perera was also the first Sri Lankan to become a professionally-qualified Cricket Umpire although he has lost his two legs so unfortunately. He was an Advanced Scorer and Training Instructor and then, even after this tragedy, an Examiner on Laws of Cricket in 1996 from England. He had played Division -1 cricket in the 70s decade representing the University of Colombo. He authored two world famous books of A-4 size on Cricket which have been recognized twice even by the world famous Wisden Cricketers Almanack. There is also another one on Accessibility. His father, Instructor Commandant, Academy, in Trincomalee, M.G.S. Perera had been the then Director of Naval Training, Founder and the first Naval Commandant of the Academy in Trincomalee. He served the Sri Lanka Navy from 1950 to 1972.

There are various organizations that look after the disabled like the Islamic Centre for the Physically Handicapped which was established in 1984 at Doolmale in Thihariya.

There are 250 students suffering from various inabilities. But, they are well looked after by a staff of 40 members. This House was started by the founder Secretary, Marhoom A.M. Fareed. The founder Chairman was Mr. Jiffry Haniffa. There was also a Chairman, Mr. M. Ashroff Hussain. They have a fine motto which sounds full of wisdom. What do they say? They say, Disability is not Inability - "-

So, Sir, like that, there are various Homes for the Aged throughout the Island. But, I would say that according to Islamic concept and even according to Buddhism and Christianity beliefs, you cannot dump your parents into an unknown Home for some others to look after. It is your duty to look after your parents. The Holy Prophet of Islam said: If you take an orphan unto you and look after that orphan, on the Day of Judgement, I will be like this with you: the Holy Prophet (Sal.) held his forefinger and middle finger together and showed to his Sahabas - Companions. That is, "I will be together with you so closely. Therefore, care for them.

Then, there is also a very encouraging report incidentally appearing in the Artscope of Daily News today. It states, I quote:

To increase the understanding of issues related to people with disabilities and to upgrade their dignity, rights and well being, every year the world celebrates the International Day of Persons with Disabilities on December 3.

To celebrate this day a street drama was presented by the Thidora Theatre which dedicated to facilitate the people with different types of disabilities.

We congratulate this group. It states further, I quote:

The play is called Seetin, Sootin and Martin. Almost 20 people with different disabilities have taken part in the play.

There are mentally and physically disabled children and adults as well. The main visually disabled actor is A.G. Luxman who performed really well. The main actress

It goes on like that and then again, in the latter part, it states, I quote:

All the disabled actors and actresses are students of Thidora Theatre. Thidora provides them a real good approach to aesthetic activities through which they improve their communication skills, thinking ability and other abilities.

They highly involve in music, dance and drama to improve their abilities.

We will be able to do all these things if we can get the said Supreme Court judgement implemented properly. Therefore, Sir, in the larger national interest, I would like to commend to this House the following that should be done:

The First one is, all key parts of new building for public use in day-to-day life in State and business sector both, toilets and wash facilities in particular, must be constructed in accordance with the design requirements and standards that are already specified in the gazetted Regulations of 17th October 2006 made under the ACT No: 28 of 1996, protecting the rights of people with disability or rather experiencing restricted ability, including the senior citizens, pregnant mothers, those with numerous debilitating conditions, heroic Ranaviru soldiers, who won the freedom for us and eradicated the terrorism from this country forever and all others using wheelchairs and external mobility aides as Dr. Ajith C.S. Perera.

The Second one is, to implementing and enforce the Supreme Court Order made under the reference SC (FR) 221/2009 and its compliance, as stated here, must be made mandatory with immediate effect. Failure to comply here, especially by all owners, as stated, must be a serious punishable offence attracting punitive repercussions.

The Third one that I am proposing is, owners and authorities undertaking constructions should obtain expert guidance from those with proven expertise as to how best to do this and thereby prevent waste of precious resources.

I know, Sir, that even in the Mahinda Chintana, it is very clearly stated about caring for the poor and the disabled. Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the able Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development, has done much for those soldiers who have been rendered lame, for those whose both legs were amputated or who have lost both arms. The UPFA Government has done well to nominate some of them to contest the Provincial Council Elections. Ex-soldiers have even been successful and they are now in the Provincial Councils. For example, Ranaviru Vikum Gunasekera, JP, All-Island, is now a Member of the Western Provincial Council. They come to our meetings and even to "Temple Trees" in wheelchairs. There is also a school established by the Defence Ministry at Malay Street for the children who have lost their parents or who are disabled due to the heroic struggle that their parents waged against the LTTE in order to save our country. They are the real heroes of our country! Therefore, Sir, this Government, on a wide-scale, is engaged in a tremendous exercise to cater to the needs of these unfortunate war victims.

Really speaking, we do not look at them as people who are disabled. The Islamic Centre for the Physically Handicapped in Doolmale, Thihariya says, They can be made useful citizens of this country. Therefore, I would kindly urge the Deputy Minister, the Hon. Lasantha Alagiyawanna, representing the Gampaha Electorate, in which the Islamic Centre for the Physically Handicapped in Doolmale, Thihariya is situated, to take serious note of this and give all possible assistance to this Home that is doing a great meritorious service.

In conclusion, I would reiterate and request every department and others concerned to comply with the Supreme Court Judgment. Thank you, Sir.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the Ministry of Social Services must take action with regard to the attack on the Editor of "Lakbima", Rajpal Abeynayake, who is hospitalized and is almost a disabled person at the moment. He is a very prominent and a very important editor, a mediaman. Also, Sir, his assailant is a human rights lawyer. So, that attack must be condemned in no uncertain terms in this House. I am very happy that the Hon. Minister of Social Services is also here and I hope he would go and see Mr. Abeynayake and take appropriate action. Even today's "Daily News" states, I quote: Editors attacker skips inquiry

The Police Spokesman, Superintendent of Police, Ajith Rohana has said that the suspect had not come to the inquiry as ordered by the Police. I consider this a serious matter, Sir. , where are those human rights activists? Where is the freedom of the media? , ? , Fort Railway Station Free Media Movement ; , . .
