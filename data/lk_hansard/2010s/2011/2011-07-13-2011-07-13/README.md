... ( ) ( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Urban Affairs) Mr. Presiding Member, please permit me to speak a few words about the late Hon. S.D.R. Jayaratne who was a senior Member of this House. He was elected to Parliament in July, 1960 and also served as the Deputy Minister and the Minister of Fisheries.

As a Member representing the Chilaw Electorate, he was popular among the people of all races, especially the Muslims. He was always ready to listen to the needs and grievances of the people. I am happy to have had his happy acquaintance on several occasions. He was a very close friend of mine and had a soft corner for me. He was always very helpful and gave me advices and I too was able to help him in whatever way he wished to develop his electorate.

He entered politics by being elected as a Member of the Madampe Village Council and thus began his service to the people. He had great qualities. He showed love and kindness to the downtrodden people and was equally loved by them.

I am happy to see his son, the Hon. Piyankara Jayaratne continuing his services and sitting with us as the Minister of Civil Aviation.

The demise of my Friend, the late Hon. S.D.R. Jayaratne, is a great loss to the nation, especially to the Muslim community. I convey my condolence to the members of his family. Thank you.

I may also add with nostalgic memories that when I was in charge of the Puttalam Electorate, I established a very warm, cordial and close relationship and friendship with the late Hon. S.D.R. Jayaratne. When I was appointed the Chairman of the Puttalam District Council, he used to send his projects. Although, sometimes he would not attend meetings, after the meeting I used to visit his ancestral home, Chithralatha and meet him and his beloved wife, the late Mrs. Hema Yapa Menike and inform him that all the projects have been passed.

I am very happy to note today that my close Colleague, the Hon. Piyankara Jayaratnes political ascendancy raises high the flag of the Jayaratne family. It is my duty to convey my condolences to Hemamali Jayaratne, Indranganee, Nilantha, Piyankara - of course I have already told - Nadeeja, Premith and also Janakee, the beloved wife of Piyankara.

I shall direct the Secretary-General of Parliament to make a Minute of the Proceedings of today and send a copy thereof to the members of the bereaved family.

Order, please! , .

"Kingsley T. Wickramaratne, Ex-Governor of the Southern Province passes away at a private hospital, in Colombo a shortwhile ago. He was a powerful minister during the Chandrika Bandaranayake regime".

This is how the "Asian Tribune" started reporting the death of the Hon. Kingsley T. Wickramaratne. "Asian Tribune" , I quote :

"He served as the minister of Internal and International Commerce and Food in the Sri Lanka Government Cabinet of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga from 1994 to August 2000. Seventeen (17) departments/Corporations, in trade,

Commerce and Food sectors of the country came within the purview of his Ministry. By virtue of this key ministerial portfolio and his expertise, he was actively involved in cabinet Committees to foster International Trade and Investment,

Industrial infrastructure and Socio-Economic Development. He was elected as a Member of Parliament for the District in 1989 and served as Parliamentarian up to August 2000."

:

He has led Trade Mission to the United Kingdom, Russia, United States, Peoples Republic of China, Iran, Egypt, Italy, New Republic of Yugoslavia, Australia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Maldives, India, Nepal, Thailand, Chile, Sweden, Germany, Portugal

and UAE. He also led Sri Lankas delegation to the SAARC commerce Ministers meeting in India in 1995-2000 and to the WTO meetings from its inception in Singapore. As advisor on international Trade he specialized on matters related to W.T.O.

( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Urban Affairs) Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is with deep respect, I rise to pay my tribute to the late Hon. Kingsley T. Wickramaratne, who was one of my Cabinet Colleagues. He was the Minister of Internal and International Commerce and Food. He served pretty well as the Minister of Trade, promoting Sri Lankas international trade. He was himself a successful businessman. By being elected to Parliament, he was able to prove his acumen in politics. He was a broadminded personality and he conducted his political life giving consideration to the needs and aspirations of all Sri Lankans regardless of race and religion. I am happy to say that he was particularly friendly with the Muslims.

He was a strong believer in democracy as he was a trained international youth leader. He became the first Sri Lankan to be elected as the Executive Vice-President of the International Junior Chamber. He also served as the Governor of the Southern Provincial Council. I am proud to have had the opportunity of associating with him and his family as a friend and I wish to say that he is a gentleman par excellence in politics.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, I do not intend to speak at length because my Colleagues have spoken much about him and I just want to make a small contribution only. He, as a Sri Lanka Freedom Party politician took a lot of time and gave strength to make the party popular and carry forward to victory at a number of elections. He also served in several positions in the party including Party Treasurer. His demise is an irreparable loss to the whole country. I join with the Members of this House to convey my deepest condolence to members of his family. Thank you.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, today I rise in this House to pay my respect to a Colleague of ours, who was in the

833 834

[ .. ]

2011 13

Government Benches, when we were in the Opposition; an amiable personality who had no malice or hatred towards anybody, the Hon. Kingsley T. Wickramaratne, a great man. When he was the Governor of the Southern Province, he invited us there - I think he stayed at the residence where the Hon. M.A. Bakeer Markar stayed as the Governor after relinquishing his office as the Speaker of this House. Sir, today I have to indulge in deviating a little to perform another duty. That is, one of our dearest Colleagues, the Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala who is called upon to attend a very important seminar in the United States of America has sent me this note to be read in this House on his behalf because he feels that it is his duty that his impressions about the late Hon. Kingsley T. Wickramaratne should be recorded. This is what he says, I quote:

" , . .

1970 . 1977 , 1989 . 1978 , 1993 , 1983 1987 . 1994 , . . . , .

. . . . . 200 , .

1997 . , , , . , . 60 , , , . , 1970 .

, , .

1933 3 2008 1 . . ."

I would also like to say, Sir, that he was the person who started a franchise shop. Although we were in the Opposition, he always invited us and said, "Come my dear, open a shop". He was such a friendly man. I used to meet him always in the company of the late Hon. M.H. Amit on whom we moved the Vote of Condolence yesterday. I know for one thing that their children were very close family friends.

He was educated at Wesley College, Colombo. He was a fellow of the British Institute of Management (UK). He was the first Sri Lankan to be admitted to the Young Presidents' Organization in USA. He was a founder member of the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing, Sri Lanka Institute of Packaging and the International Advertising Association (SL Chapter). His professional career has been as a Management and Marketing Consultant.

He has served as the Assistant Secretary of the SLFP in 1978. In 1983, he was appointed as the Treasurer. In 2001, he was elected as the Senior Vice-President of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.

His book Tomorrows Economics earned the plaudits of consumers and traders not only in this country but also abroad. It was a book that was well sought after by people who wanted to learn about trade and commerce because the late Hon. Kingsley T. Wickramaratne was an expert on it. Sir, the Hon. Kingsley T. Wickramaratne distinguished himself as a Member of Parliament serving in this House for 19 years, 4 months and 28 days. May his soul be sanctified. Thank you. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . .

This is a new angle; a new approach by the Leader of the Opposition who went to India. Thank God! At least now wisdom has dawned in him. Now, he realizes that there must be a future for this country. The foundation has already been laid by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The Leader of the Opposition is a very important office in Parliamentary democracy. He enjoys all the privileges; well and good! According to the British Parliamentary system, he is also termed as the alternate Prime Minister. That is a different matter. . . As the Leader of the Opposition he is termed as the alternate Prime Minister. Now, he says that the new approach taken by this Government is very welcome and it will solve the problem. He has told this to the leaders of India also. So, let these so-called leaders of Tamil Nadu realize this. I would only say this much.

When we talk about Mannar, there is another sad news which I would like to quote in this House:

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Presiding Member, I rise today to pay my respect to the memory of the Hon. (Dr.) Wimal Wickramasinghe

855 856

with whom I had a very close association when he was in Parliament together with me. The Hon. (Dr.) Wickramasinghe was young when he entered politics. He was a person, I should say, a daring person, sometimes irresistible. He spoke the truth, his heart out; he never would hide his feelings. Where praise is due, he would give it in abundance; where he had to take a sharp stride, he did that also deftly. I thought for sometime that Wimal was born to politics and politics wanted Wimal because he was a very sincere and honest person. When he was the Minister of Environment and Parliamentary Affairs, and the Chief Government Whip, I was called upon to perform his duties when he was away from the House. As a result, we established a very close understanding among each other.

He was born on 25th November, 1942. He was the Project Minister of Environment and the Minster of State for Policy Planning and Implementation and was the Member of Parliament for the Ratnapura District. The Hon. (Dr.) Wickramasinghe entered Parliament on 10th

February, 1984 to succeed (Dr.) Leonard Kiriella as the MP for Kiriella. He was at the time of nomination as the MP for Eheliyagoda, the Deputy Director of Economic Research and the Head of the Credit Cell, Central Bank of Ceylon. He graduated at the University of Ceylon in 1966 in Economics, got his PhD in Economics from the University of Exeter, England in 1973 and First in Laws, University of Sri Lanka in 1974.

The Hon. (Dr.) Wickramasinghe was a brilliant academic. He served as an Assistant Lecturer in Economics from 1966 to 1967. He was the Assistant Controller of Exchange from 1968 to 1969. He amassed a wealth of experience through holding all these distinguished positions in public life. He also had been the Senior Economist of the Department of Economic Research from 1973 to 1978, and the Managing Director of the Export Credit Insurance Corporation from 1978 to 1979.

As you said, Sir, he was a rare personality. Has the era of the late Hon. (Dr.) Wickramasinghe come to an end? Has the curtain fallen? We want more and more academics, intelligent people, educationists, writers, poets, philosophers, people who can speak to every mind in this country, be it in Sinhala, Tamil or English, that he would understand. Sir, you are one person who is doing a yeoman service in the context of todays politics to propagate the ideals or the development of the English Language. I think the trilingual scheme mooted by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa has caught up well in this country. This concept is systematically taken forward by Mr. Lalith Weeratunga, Secretary to His Excellency the President, and Mr. Sunimal Fernando.

Today, everybody, wants to introduce the trilingual scheme, Sinhala, Tamil and English everywhere. The

horizon, as far as English is concerned, is very much open far and wide. You may do anything in this country but English is the door to new discoveries, to civilization and to world relationship. At a time when we are talking of the global village, a pride of place should be given to the English Language which was well understood by the late Hon. (Dr.) Wimal Wickramasinghe.

The Hon. (Dr.) Wickramasinghe held the post of Visiting Lecturer in Economics at the University of Colombo, he was Head of the Trade Division in the Central Bank of Ceylon and held the post of visiting lecturer in the Training School of the Bank of Ceylon. He was also one of the Sri Lankan delegates of the Inter-Government group on tea in 1975 at the FAO in Rome; Sri Lanka AIDE at the 12th meeting of SEANZA Council of Central Bank Governors held in Seoul, Korea in 1977. He was Sri Lankas representative at a number of conferences held both at home and abroad. What a wealth of talent and knowledge this distinguished Parliamentarian amassed during his time! He had a very sharp tongue. He had the skill for oratory and debating. Names of men would not matter to him. We are sorry to record today, Sir, that such a man, such a great scholar and an economist abandoned all the attachments he had with his party - UNP - later in his life. He was disillusioned and frustrated because of certain actions of the party leadership at that time and we have lost a remarkable personality and a Member who would have represented this House for a long time to come. Alas! it was not to be so.

He served in this House in several Parliaments. He distinguished himself as a Member of Parliament and sat here exactly for 10 years, 02 months and 19 days. As you prayed while you were speaking, Mr. Presiding Member, let me also pray in this House that the House be blessed with people like the Hon. (Dr.) Wickramasinghe. Let us have more and more Wickramasinghes. Let us train them, coach them, educate them and guide them so that, they will be brilliant stars shining in this country and they will revolutionize the thoughts and the cultural pattern of this country in order to reach the golden era.

Mr. Presiding Member, once again we are called upon to pay our tribute to a distinguished Member of this House and a distinguished son of Sri Lanka. The late Hon. Arthur Hubert De Silva came from Balapitiya.

861 862

[ ... ]

2011 13

Balapitiya produced some of the great intellectuals and political giants of this country like Dr. Colvin R de Silva, and Dr. A.N.S. Kulasinghe who was one of the great engineers. We spoke about him just a while ago on the Vote of Condolence of the late Hon. (Dr.) Wimal Wickramasinghe.

Sir, as far as Dr. Kulasinghe is concerned, I have a personal feeling for him because my father, the late Mr. M.I.A. Hameed, worked under him at the Port Commission under the English Chairman, Mr. P.J.H. Hernu. Dr. Kulasinghe discovered the art of constructing roads that would not break at any cost, be it floods, tsunami or any other disaster. One of them is the old marine drive that goes from the old Parliament up to the Customs Department. He had chambers built with iron rods on the road. Cement was put in it and after that, it was tarred. Sir, up to this day, after 60 years, those roads have never been repaired and there is not even a pothole today. And, Dr. Kulasinghe wanted this new method of road building to be spread right throughout the island. But alas, as in other games, in politics also, there is jealousy and others did not allow him to carry forward. As a result of that, even today we are struggling to maintain our roads. But, we are fortunate, Sir, under the "Mahinda Chintana", massive development has taken place in the network of roads in the country. If you go from Mahiyanganaya to Pottuvil, to Kalmunai, to Akkaraipattu in the Eastern Province or from Tamankaduwa or Polonnaruwa to Trincomalee, expressways have come up all over. .

Today we are discussing all this because of the people of the calibre of Dr. Kulasinghe who was a close kinsman of the late Hon. Hubert De Silva. His elder brother, Hon. C.P. De Silva, was known as the " ". After the Sinhalese Kings and the Right Hon. D.S. Senanayake, he started the development of Minneriya and ameliorated the conditions of poor farmers; the toiling masses. He gave leadership to them. As a result, he was known as " " Hon. Member whom we are referring to as the Hon. Arthur Hubert De Silva, is his beloved brother. Sir, Hon. Arthur Hubert De Silva was elected to the Fourth Parliament on 19th March, 1960 to 23rd April, 1960 and served this House for one month and four days. He represented the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Then, in the Fifth Parliament he served from 5th August, 1960 to 17th December, 1964 representing the Sri Lanka Freedom Party again from the Polonnaruwa Electorate.

He served for four years, four months and 27 days. In all, Sir, the late Hon. Arthur Hubert De Silva distinguished himself as a Member of this House, serving well the House and through the House, the country. He sat here for four years, six months and one day. He had several relatives of great fame. Some of them are specialist doctors. That is why I called them the most remarkable and distinguished families of our era.

, , .. . . BSc. . 1960 , . . He was a specialist in roadways and also in irrigation schemes. .. . 88 - he had a colourful life- passed away. Today we pay our respect to the memory of the Hon. Arthur Hubert de Silva. May his name be remembered by the dutiful people, the loyal people of this country for years and years to come.

Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) .. .

elected as a Member of the Balangoda Urban Council, served as its Chairman and later elected to Parliament. He was the Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Irrigation in the Government of the late Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo R.D. Bandaranaike. He also served as the Chairman of the State Plantation Corporation and of the Sri Lanka Tea Board.

He was a simple man to whom the people had easy access. He had rendered yeoman service to the people of his electorate. Unfortunately, he could not continue his service as a politician as he was unseated by an election petition. However, the people of Balangoda elected his wife Mrs. Mallika Ratwatte reposing their trust and confidence in her. He was a lovable personality who loved the people. I convey my condolence to the members of his family. Thank you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) I wish to pay my tribute as well to the memory of the late Hon. Clifford Senaka Ratwatte, a distinguished son of Sri Lanka with an equally distinguished and historic family background and a much respected Member of this House.

I should now recall a pleasant incident. I recently visited their mansion in Balangoda with His Excellency the President. Mrs. Mallika Ratwatte, wife of the Hon. Clifford Ratwatte, posed a very inquisitive question to me. She asked me to tell His Excellency the President what I spoke at the meeting held in support of the late Hon. M.L.M. Aboosally in Balangoda. I could only blush. All had a hearty laugh. They were very pleasant and friendly family indeed. We always enjoyed the best of courtesies and kind hospitality of his son Kamal and

Kamals wife whenever we visited their residence, the last time being with the Hon. Speaker and my Friend, the Hon. Piyankara Jayaratne.

I shall now direct the Secretary-General of Parliament to make a Minute of the Proceedings of today and send a copy thereof to the members of the bereaved family.
