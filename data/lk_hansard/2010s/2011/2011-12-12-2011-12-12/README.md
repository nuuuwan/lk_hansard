( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, there seems to be an atmosphere of complete peace and harmony prevailing in this House today, and I think that is because we are discussing the Vote on the Ministry of National Heritage. The person who is heading that Ministry is an erudite scholar, a man of letters and a scholar of fame with a great name. He is blessed with a great moral fortitude. Even in conversation he sounds philosophical. That is the Hon. (Dr.) Jagath Balasuriya.

After the Ministers versus MPs 20-20 Cricket Match played yesterday for the first time in history, which is unique in the whole world, where Parliamentarians played a match with the Ministers of the Cabinet, there seems to be complete harmony prevailing in this House. Even the Secretary-General of Parliament was a witness to this spectacle. If we can go on and on like this, Parliament will be a much more peaceful place to represent. The match was played for the Hon. Speaker's Trophy for the first time in history. It is unique. Even His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa immediately on his arrival from Borobudur in Indonesia, straightaway came into the pavilion. Also, the Leader of the Opposition joined the President as a spectator. What a convivial atmosphere prevailed in the grounds! We always cross swords with each other in this House but MPs from both sides of the House joined to play a great match - a great game in its true sprit.

Today, Hon. Deputy Chairman, we heard two illuminating orations from the Hon. J.R.P. Sooriyapperuma and also from the Hon. Janaka Bandara, our Friend over there. Sir, I must thank them because a lot of history, civilization, was unearthed through their brilliant performance today, and I should say that they were not mere Parliamentary speeches.

Deputy Chairman, among other matters that I want to place before the House, I wish to state that there are various places of historical and archeological importance of the Muslims in this country. What straightaway comes to our mind is Beruwala. The Arabs first landed as settlers in Ceylon. They made a very vibrant community, a loyal community of this land. Sometime ago, there was a declaration almost spelling out to make this a historical and archeological important site, because the first Mosque built in Sri Lanka Masjid-ul-Abrar is situated there. I was involved with the Hon. M.A. Bakeer Markar, a past illustrious Speaker of this House, when he renovated the Masjid-ul-Abrar with the backing of Mr. Abdul Hameed Hajiar - I remember them - Mr. T.M.N. 'Duke' Hameed, Mr. Ismeth Abdullah who is in London today, Ajward Master A.W.M. Razick Marikar, who was the Chairman of the Urban Council, Beruwala, also contributed largely for the restoration of this historic Mosque.

Sir, there was a Stamp issued. You must take action to bring these historical and archeological important sites as national heritage.

Also, Sir, there is a Malay Community and a Memon Community in this country. These two communities are an integral part - very loyal and patriotic citizens. They came to Sri Lanka from Java, Batavia and Malaysia. They established the Wekanda Mosque 225 years ago. The

other day, the Ambassador for Indonesia, Djafar Hussein went and declared open a website at this historic Mosque. And, there is the Java Lane Mosque, Malay Street in Slave Island, Java Kachcheri, which is now Chavakachcheri, where the people from Java came during the Dutch period. Some of them were brought as prisoners here and others who came were from Royal and noble families later. They were great scholars. The Malays were people of valour and vigour, very clever, very determined, very bold and very strong in their outlook. So, Sir, their historic places must be protected and given national heritage status.

There is also the Dharma Kabeer Jummah Mosque in Hambantota. That is also a historically important Mosque. There are Malays and others around that place. Their forefathers were buried in the Grand Mosque and at New Moor Street in Colombo, which was looked after by the ancestors of leaders like Sir Razik Fareed and others. The previous speaker was mentioning about the Museum. This was built by Wapche Marikar, the grandfather of Sir Razik Fareed. I think many artefacts that were very recently discovered by the Muslim archaeologists must be exhibited in the Colombo Museum for posterity.

There is the Seven Virgins Hills in Maskeliya. There was an Indonesian Haj plane that crashed over there. We do not call it a historic place, but a place to remember because hundreds of Hajis were buried there. Recently, I think once again Djafar Hussein, the Ambassador for Indonesia visited that site. Then, there is a Mosque built in commemoration of these Shuhadas by M.H.M. Fazal Hadjiar and others also helped him.

Then, there was a plane that crashed at Kimbulapitiya, closer to the Katunayake Airport. Three hundred odd Hajis in that Martin Airflight were flown back to Jakarta when it fell at this place. There is a Memorial built at the Seven Virgins Hills in Maskeliya by that great man, Sir Abdul W.M. Ameer who was the Consular-General of the Dominican Republic. The Memorial is at the foot of Seven Hills in Maskeliya in memory of those Shuhadas The deceased are called in Islamic tenets as, "Shuhadas". There is a Haj Memorial Building closer to the Katunayake Airport. I think that also must come into your reckoning, Hon. Minister.

Then, you know the civilizations - civilization that arose in the banks of Euphrates and Tigris, civilization at the Nile River Valley and the Mohenjo-daro and Harappa Civilizations in the Indus Valley. The Member of Parliament, Hon. Suriyapperuma knows all these details because he waxed eloquent when he was lecturing at the All-Ceylon Muslim League Youth Front sometime ago.

Then, Sir, there is a Memon Mosque in Fourth Cross Street in Pettah, which was built in 1929. The Memon community came from Gujarat. They are also an integral part of Sri Lanka. They called this country their own land. They earned here, and they spent here. They were a

philanthropic-minded community. One of the most honoured Islamic Scholars, Lecturers, and Imams, Moulana Moulavi M.J. Kaleel-ur Rahman Hazrat - we call him Mani Moli - " - Moulana" - was also the most famous Katheebs of that Mosque.

Sir, when talking about world civilizations and archaeological sites, cities like Baghdad, Kerbala and Kufa in Iraq were completely decimated, eradicated and destroyed by the Western Zionist Powers and they are still carrying on that unceasingly. I must mention here that when the Bamiyan Statues in Afghanistan were destroyed by the Taliban, it was that famous Moulavi, Marhoom Niyas Mohamed, who took the Muslims to the streets and demonstrated against that and went round the city, condemning this vandalism.

Recently, Sir, when we were in Male for the SAARC Conference, our President was talking to Hamid Karzai, the President of Afghanistan; he said that was a great historical civilization which should never have been destroyed by this vandalism. This is still carryied on by the Zionists, Sir.

What do they do? They give the Nobel Prize and other Awards to people who are responsible for destruction. They are the number one vandals in this world, as we could call them.

Sir, I quote from chapter 3 on page 41 of the brilliant book called To the Ends of the Earth: The Hunt for the Jackal written by acclaimed British author, David Yallop:

On the 10th of April, 1948, the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin, near Jerusalem, was destroyed. Its inhabitants, 260 men, women and children, were slaughtered; some were shot, some hacked to death. The attack was a combined operation by two Jewish groups, the Irgun, whose Commander in Chief was Menachem Begin, and the Stern Gang, one of whose leaders was Yitzhak Shamir. In 1980 Begin was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1983, when Begin resigned from office, he was succeeded as Prime Minister of Israel by Yitzhak Shamir. History is written by winners.

The other surprising event with regard to the Nobel Peace Prize was this. The entire world was taken aback when US President Barack Obama - he should be called Barack Hussein Obama. He is hiding the name Hussein. Why should he? He has to take a second Oath by declaring himself as Barack Hussein Obama - was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize just 12 days after he took office as the President of the US on 20th of January, 2009. President Obama was subsequently awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. For what, may I ask in this House. The Norwegian Nobel Committee made this award to President Obama stating, I quote:

.for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples. The Committee has attached special importance to Obamas vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons.

The other day, our respected Governor of the Western Province, "Jamal-al-Lail" Seyed Alavi Mowlana, took out a massive demonstration from the Dewatagaha Mosque to the Lipton Circus against the NATO attack on Pakistan. Incidentally, the Dewatagaha Mosque should also be included in the list of National Heritage because there is a cherished history behind this ancient Shrine of Shaikh Osman Waliullah.

Then, I would like to mention as to how the NATO bombed the people in Pakistan and 26 innocent soldiers were killed. What do they mean? Is it restoring peace or "restructuring destruction" of human beings and properties in other countries? On one hand, we see a confirmed Zionist terrorist and murderer receiving the Award and on the other, even before the incumbent hardly took office, the Award goes to this mere "visionary"! That is how the West understands - or rather misunderstands - the concept of real peace.

In May, 2009, the world witnessed how our President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa - now, see the difference; mark the "difference" - demonstrably eradicated the menace of terrorism in all its forms. Menachem Begin, could you hear this? Where are you? Terrorism plagued this resplendent Island of ours for three decades. Bloodshed, murder and mayhem were the order of the day and people were killed on a daily basis, as a day-to-day business.

Eradication of terrorism was a formidable feat which no Head of State in the world had achieved, except His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka. All that horror was wiped out for good, never to emerge again in this beautiful Island. Therefore, Sir, looking at the attainment of peace in its proper perspective, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa rightfully deserves - I say in this House, from the Parliament of Sri Lanka to the world - should be awarded the Nobel Prize this year!

Sir, I must also speak in Tamil. There is a nice article.

" . - it was called the water civilization - . , "

. Therefore, you must also renovate that and have proper care for that under your Ministry. , ,

. , Sir. It is placed in Ratnapura. I think the Secretary-General of Parliament, Mr. Dhammika Kitulgoda also resided there when he was a judge. " " . One of our greatest philanthropists, Alhaj. N.D.H. Abdul Caffoor, the respected father of that illustrious Member of Parliament for Colombo-Central, Alhaj M. Falil A. Caffoor, donated that building to the United National Party. It was earlier called - Hon. (Dr.) Balasuriya, you know it - "Iceland Building". " " . . " " , , it has been considered a building of history. His Excellency the President stated in his Budget Speech that he has allocated money for that. We thank him so much for it, Sir. . : . Secretary-General . , , - - ?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Hon. Member, with regard to the MoD certificates,

what they say is that they have been issued a MoD certificate but the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence always maintains that there are no such certificates. He says that if there is such a certificate, it is a fraud. So, I have collected some of the MoD certificates that were given. I do not know whether it is a fraud or not. Today, I want to meet the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and submit those things for his investigation. The Secretary to the Ministry of Defence very categorically stated that according to the Line Ministry, only the instructions of the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development must be implemented and that too by the Forces. The Forces issue the passes and certificates. The Secretary to the Ministry of Defence says that he is not aware of this and will take serious action in this regard.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Scuba diving is allowed only 20 kilometres beyond the shore. That is all. Nobody is allowed to use scuba diving before that limit.

. ( . ) (The Hon. S. Vino) , , . . , , , . .

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) They have not issued a single permit for the Southerners to go and do the fishing in the North.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) There is a photograph. I have tabled the photograph of the Southern fishermen doing fishing in the areas that the Hon. Member just mentioned whereas the people of that

1713 1714

area are confined to the other side of the road. They cannot even go towards the beach. But, people from the South had gone and occupied the houses of those people. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Hon. Member, without our permit they cannot do anything.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) But, they are doing it. I will give you photographic evidence.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) If you give me all that evidence, it will be helpful.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) On the 21st of October, I tabled a report with photographs of the areas that the Hon. Member just mentioned. . ( . ) (The Hon. S. Vino) , , . , . , , , . , -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Hon. Member, we are going to establish six harbours. One is in Pesalai.

. ( . ) (The Hon. S. Vino) Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Hon. Minister, Miliddy also needs a harbour because that is the only -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) For that, I am negotiating with the Navy and the Ministry of Defence. The Korean Government is ready to fund for that harbour.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) If you could do that, I think that will be the one and only harbour in Miliddy where multi-day boats can be anchored.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) That is correct. I know it. There is no alternative place in that area.

. ( . ) (The Hon. S. Vino) . , . . . , . -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) We have instructed the Assistant Director not to issue any permits to outsiders and to issue only to those people who are there. So, the Assistant Director will implement it properly.
