, 2012 APPROPRIATION BILL, 2012 . [ 21] '' [ ] . . - [ 21] " " [ ] . Order read for resuming Adjourned Debate on Question - [ 21st November] "That the Bill be now read a Second time".- [ His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa] Question again proposed. [10.15 a.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Speaker, we are debating the seventh Budget presented by the Rajapaksa regime at a time when the winds of democracy are blowing across many parts of the world.

In fact, with the fall of yet another well-entrenched dictatorship in Libya, the march towards a more democratic world order seems to have gathered

momentum in most parts of the world today. The term which we hear very often used is, "emerging democracies". I would say that people in many countries all over the world are beginning to realize that democracy has many flaws and shortcomings but despite its flaws and shortcomings, the best form of governance for man in search of a more just and equitable world still left today is democracy.

However, in the latter part of the 20th Century, there was a fashionable school of thought prevalent in certain countries and in certain sections of the societies, which argued that democracy is not conducive for economic progress in developing countries and in the guise of wanting to achieve economic development, some countries moved towards oligarchy and autocracy becoming fully-fledged dictatorships as time went by with disastrous results for the countries concerned.

In fact, Sri Lanka has the honour of being Asias oldest democracy because we gave the universal franchise as early as 1931. We embraced democracy but we know that in the middle part of the 20th Century, many "tin-pot dictators" became the order of the day in many countries in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe and South America. Actually, some of these self-proclaimed saviours of the nations or these "tin-pot dictators" claim that democracy was unsuitable for development and a strong leadership was needed if they are to drive their country towards rapid prosperity. Instead, in the guise of developing the country, most of these dictators amassed incredible amounts of wealth leaving their countries virtually bankrupt and internationally isolated when their respective terms or rule came to an end.

According to Transparency International, some of these key dictators of this era like President Suharto of Indonesia and his family had robbed that country of nearly US Dollars 15 to 35 billion during this period. Again, Ferdinand Marcos and his family according to very conservative estimates had robbed US Dollars 5 to 10 billion during his period. The Zairian President Mobutu Seko, they say, would have robbed at least US Dollars 5 billion while he ruled that country. Papa Doc of Haiti and Jean Claude Duvalier, they say, robbed US Dollars 300 to 800 million. The national wealth robbed by such dictators as Gaddafi, Mubarak and their sons is yet to be known.

Fortunately, this world view is rapidly losing credibility as the winds of freedom continue to blow across the world. In the first wave of democratization in the 80s symbolized by the fall of the Berlin wall, we witnessed the downfall of many cruel and corrupt tyrannies in the Eastern Europe.

Since then, many Commonwealth countries in Asia and Africa have also chosen Parliamentary democracy as their model of governance during the last two decades, while the Arab spring saw the stunning fall of some

827 828

dictatorships or autocracies entrenched in power for several decades culminating in the demise of the Libyan dictator last month. Even countries like Rwanda in Africa, which was at one time synonymous with genocide after a civil war which estimatedly claimed one million people, is today one of the fastest growing countries in Africa and doubled their Foreign Direct Investments; thanks to unprecedented political and economic reforms.

Part of the credit for this revival of confidence in democracy, I say, must be given to countries like India and Brazil because they have now convincingly proven to the world that democracy is not an obstacle for economic development but in fact the cine quo non for progress and prosperity in the 21st Century. Despite many challenges over the years, such countries have never veered away from its vigorous commitment to the democratic process, to the democratic principles. In spite of shortcomings and flaws of democracy, as I said earlier, the massive economic development achieved by such countries must be commended for proving that there is no alternative to democracy if we are to deliver the future our people demand and to ensure the future that they truly deserve.

However, as the International Community remains hypnotized and preoccupied and perhaps even enthralled by the newly emerging democracies, some countries with long-standing democratic institutions like Sri Lanka, unfortunately are moving towards oligarchy and dictatorship and away from the principles of democracy. It may be spring for some Arab countries in North Africa, but for us in Sri Lanka with our long established democracy, it is definitely autumn, perhaps with a chilly winter ahead of us. The cornerstones of democratic rule are being systematically undermined and attacked by the very leaders who sought a mandate to strengthen democracy. Today, despite the trimmings of democracy, despite the slogans of democracy, Sri Lanka, in my personal opinion is - for want of a better term - an emerging tyranny.

This drift towards the authoritarianism is confirmed in world audits on democracy, where Sri Lanka, Asia's oldest democracy has the dubious honour of sharing the division with countries such as Papua New Guinea, Mozambique, Bosnia, Malawi and Uganda.

In fact, Sri Lanka has now come down in the democracy rankings and actually even Uganda is in a better place than we are. Sri Lanka is today 109th in the world audit of democracy. In the Press Freedom Index, we are further down at 117 and, in fact, we are only 19 points short of Zimbabwe, which is ranked at 136th and the way this Government is moving, I would not be surprised that we would - perhaps Zimbabwe might be moving better than us in one or two years' time.

There is a very good analysis of the current political situation by Professor Neil De Votta. He has written an article called "Sri Lanka: from turmoil to dynasty" which was published in the "Journal of Democracy" of April this year, where he states that the reality of this trend towards soft authoritarianism "is made specially clear by the annual country rankings the Freedom house has assembled over the last decade. Sri Lanka offers a case in point; the island went from being a commendable democracy to an illiberal democracy, and over the past five years has retrogressed further to the point of soft authoritarianism."

I would like to quote from this excellent article and I would recommend, Mr. Speaker, that you should read this full article.

This is what he says, I quote:

An illiberal democracy is a type or of political regime that maintains the trappings of democracy but whose leaders subscribe selectively (at best) to such key tenets of constitutional liberalism as the rule of law, free and fair elections, limited government, and freedom of assembly, speech, and religion. Political elites in these states undermine good governance in order to bolster and perpetuate their rule, yet, attempt to mask the attendant democratic deficit by highlighting whatever they think will make them look 'democratic'. Thus elections are held with great fanfare even as polls are rigged to favor the ruling party;

- which we saw how it was done in the recent Local Government Election when the President of this country

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

himself along with the Defence Secretary, violating even the Establishment Code, went house to house campaigning - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

2011 25

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) The article further states, I quote:

..Thus elections are held with great fanfare even as polls are rigged to favor the ruling party; threats, violence, and defections are engineered. Defections are engineered to ensure that opposition parties and candidates remain weak; and the media are allowed relative freedom as long as they go easy on critical coverage of the ruling party, its leaders and their families, and the venal and predatory practices that these elites use to amass wealth and power. The longer that such regimes stay in place, the more they disregard the rule of law and act with impunity, which in turn makes it harder for them to envision losing power. Indeed, the desire to avoid being held accountable for crimes committed while in office is a major reason why elites in illiberal regimes veer toward authoritarianism..."

- [Interruption.] Mr. Speaker, if any of these Hon. Members can read, as I told earlier, I would recommend this article to them.

Actually, Mr. Speaker, it was the last phase of the war with the LTTE, which gave the Rajapaksas regime the excuse to commence the systematic dismantling of our democratic structures and institutions. During the run-up to the final defeat of the LTTE, the regime used the weariness of a nation, battered and bruised by a brutal war for nearly 25 years and impatient to see the end to the scourge of terrorism to disregard the Governments fundamental obligations. In fact, the odious nature of LTTE terrorism was used as a basis or pretext, not only to disregard the Governments international obligations, but also to silence and control democratic dissent within the country. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) It is you who said in this House that the war cannot be won. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Speaker, if not for the fact that I, as the Foreign Minister, canvassed the countries in the European Union and got the LTTE banned on the 26th of May 2006, I do not think this war could have been won so easily. At that time - [Interruption.] Mr. Azwer was in the UNP. - [Interruption.]

Thirty months have passed since the end of the war and the Government is still trying to exploit the general feeling of goodwill gained from the war victory in order to dismantle our much-cherished democratic institutions in order to perpetuate the dreams of a Rajapaksa dynasty. The first step towards this was to rush through as an urgent Bill, the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, an outrageous power-grab, which more or less performed the last rites on some of our key independent institutions: the Judiciary, the Police, the

Election Commission, the Civil Service and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption have all come under the President and their survival now depends on the patronage of the First Family.

Like in all aspiring dictatorships, the first target has been the rule of law. The notorious DefenceSecretary,

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

the chief architect not only of pulling down walls but also of dismantling democracy in this country actually thinks that the rule of law and human rights are western values, which have no place in Chintana Sri Lanka. Actually, I have heard at a certain Embassy, that the Defence Secretary himself expounded his thoughts to a shocked audience. In fact, I would like to remind this person and those like him, who believe that an autocratic form of governance is the recipe for economic development, that no country has ever achieved economic prosperity for the people by suppressing the rule of law. All those who tried to do so have only brought economic ruin to their countries like in Zimbabwe, Burma and North Korea and finally they bring, Mr. Speaker, destruction upon themselves, as we saw in Libya, Egypt and Tunisia recently.

Actually, in Sri Lanka, we must never forget as the Council of the International Bar Association stated in a Resolution in September 2005, that the rule of law is the foundation of a civilized society and as President Barack Obama mentioned in a BBC interview, I remember in 2009, The rule of law are not simply principles of the West to be foisted on other countries, but universal principles that each country can embrace and affirm as part of their national identity.

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) Do you agree with Barack Obama? What happened to Gaddafi? - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir,I rise to a point of Order? The Hon. Member is on his feet. Under Standing Order No. 84 (ii), "the Member shall not be interrupted unless out of order". There must be a trend of thought that goes on. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) But, the Hon. Managala is capable of -

831 832

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) In fact, Mr. Speaker, also the Council of the International Bar Association in a Resolution passed in 2005, listed certain components of the rule of law, of which among them are an independent, impartial judiciary; the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair and public trial without undue delay. It described as unacceptable arbitrary arrests, indefinite detention without trial, cruel or degrading treatments or punishment and intimidation and corruption in the electoral process. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Order, please! .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Unfortunately for us in Sri Lanka today, all what has been described as unacceptable by the CIBA has now become part and parcel of our society.

( ) (An Hon. Member) What is that?

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) The most serious assault against the rule of law today in Sri Lanka, Mr. Speaker, is the encroachment of judiciary by the Executive

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

in the most unscrupulous manner.- [Interruption.] Sir, I have with me a document - an audit done by the Heritage Foundation of all the countries in the world about their judiciary, about their economies, about their press freedom et cetera. What does it say? This is about Sri Lanka. It states, "Corruption is perceived as widespread, Sri Lanka ranks 97 out of 180 countries" - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) There, the police and the judiciary are viewed as the most corrupt public institutions. This is not what I am saying, this is not what the United National Party is saying but a well-respected international organization is saying that the judiciary and the police are the most corrupt institutions in Sri Lanka.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) That is Sri Lanka's United National Party.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) In fact, the Declaration on the Rule of Law, as you know, made by the International Commission of Jurists at Athens in 1955, emphasized that the State is subject to the law and declared that Judges should be guided by the Rule of Law, protect it and enforce it without fear or favour and resist any encroachments by governments or political parties in their independence as judges.

This is a Resolution which was passed in 1955 in Athens by the International Commission of Jurists. But, what is happening in Sri Lanka today? Some of our principal judges today are unable to resist highly lucrative

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] ( ) (Mr. Speaker) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. The Hon. Member who has been in this House for a long time does not know what a Standing Order means. Sir, according to Standing Order No. 78, he cannot refer to the conduct of judges and cannot cast aspersions on judges.- [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , .

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, that is in respect of a single judge who has to be named. If you give permission to the Hon. Member, we can ask him to name the judge, if he knows - [Interruption/]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Speaker, the million-dollar question asked in Hulftsdorp today is: what was the very expensive gift which the Executive of this country gave to this judge or the judges daughter at the wedding.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

There are a lot of speculations on the type of gift which was given. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . , . ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I am not talking about a judge at all. Parliament is finally supreme. Do not give away the powers of Parliament to anyone else. You and all of us must zealously guard it. Mr. Speaker, the perception amongst the general public is that even the present leaders of the Supreme Court are loyalists of the Executive. Even the International Community has taken note of this; the International Community has taken note of it. Mr. Speaker, I would like to - [Interruption/]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . .

US Embassy to their country, what do they say? They refer to the Fundamental Rights case filed by Sarath Fonseka in 2010, challenging the legality of his detention.

I am asking you that. But, if you make a comment about a specific judge, I can understand. Now, here - [Interruption.] Let me finish. There is a general reference here. The Hon.

Mangala Samaraweera) In Sri Lanka, the economic anarchy prevalent today points to a sophisticated kleptocratic financial structure although it may not be possible to put an exact figure on the funds embezzled until there is a change of government. Land-grabbing is a favourite pastime of the regime, and prime lands, not only in Colombo but in all parts of the country, especially in the coastal belt of the Eastern Province, have been given to front organizations of the ruling class bypassing all transparent tender procedures.

Even the Colombo Stock Exchange today is seen as a centre for laundering black money, especially funds got from narcotics deals, which many VIPs are supposed to be involved in. In fact, the Prime Minister himself, recently admitted in this House that there maybe people involved in narcotic deals in this House itself, because many VIPs are supposed to be involved in it. In fact, many people in Sri Lanka are saying that it has graduated from being a kleptocracy to a narco-kleptocracy, a country which is basing its economy on drug sales.

The controversial Bill rushed through Parliament to nationalize some businesses allocated to the private sector is also seen as a Presidential Land Grab

( ) (Mr. Speaker) 45 . - ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) No, do not give me anybody elses time. Have I been allotted only 45 minutes? ( ) (Mr. Speaker) Yes, 45 minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Okay, then give me five more minutes.- [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker)

Disturb . . . - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Let me speak. The general image of the country still prevailing has certainly discouraged FDI.

Under the Rajapaksa regime, the so-called Government owned companies have been set up with most trusted friends and relatives to oversee large-scale infrastructure developments as well as to procure large scale defence items and those are not answerable to Parliament. Maga Neguma Road Construction Equipment Company (Pvt.) Limited, Lanka Logistics and Technologies Limited and Colombo Land and Development Company Limited are some of the examples. Also, you are asking for names et cetera but I will give you just one because I have very limited time. Recently the Embilipitiya Paper Corporation has been leased out to Perth Engineering Company for a 30-year period. This, according to reliable information I have received, is not a company but a sole trader registered by a VIPs relative who was in Perth until 2006. She was doing a cleaning franchise there. According to the Australian Business Register, these are the details available. The name of the entity is S.M. De Silva and P.

Gonapinuwala. Then, the ABN status has been active from 26th August, 2003 and the entity type has been mentioned as Family Partnership, like the Government. It has not been currently registered for GST and the main business location of it is WA 6053. This is just one example. How can a company, not even registered for GST, afford to pay US Dollars 400 million? Is this also yet another money laundering operation for the relatives concerned? This is the question I am asking.

A similar Bill was introduced in Zimbabwe by President Mugabe to take over farms. I have the names of the farms but I do not have time to mention them now. Many of the farms were taken over by President Mugabe himself finally.

As my time is limited, I have to conclude my speech though I was prepared for an hour. Finally, I have to say one thing. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The valuable time of the House is wasted. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Speaker, finally all I have to say is, instead of utilizing the great window of opportunity that our country got on the 19th of May 2009, by winning the peace that our people were crying out for, and ensuring that the face of terrorism never raises its ugly head ever again in our country, the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, intoxicated with power, is paving the way for yet another uprising in our country with its foolish and short-sighted policies. -[Interruption.]

In conclusion, I would like to quote something that I myself stated on the Floor of this House one year ago at a Debate on the state of Emergency, where again I was disturbed with obscene remarks. But, I say it again because I think it is more relevant than ever now. If we stubbornly continue our journey in the same old path, it will not be long before the call for separation is reignited. Unlike before, the new battle for separation will not be fought in the jungles of the Vanni but in the corridors of power in Washington, in New York, in Geneva, in Brussels and in London. The weapons they will be using will be Blackberrys and iPads and the cadre will be the erudite and educated members of the diaspora along with their lobbyists. The ammunition will be supplied by the Sri Lankan Government if they continue with their policy of triumphalist chauvinism and anti-democratic suppression. The new nations of the 21st Century, we must remember, will be born and are born, not through liberation struggles but by resolutions endorsed by the global community. We will then be a dystopia, a failed and divided nation surviving on the anti-Western bravado and very little else like Mugabe in Zimbabwe or Basheer in Sudan.

Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I again say today that the moment of reckoning is before us.

Thank you.

I just want to remind you about what you said in this august Assembly referring to Sarath Fonseka. Now, you are talking about the judiciary. I will come to that point because I have practised in the Colombo High Court for nine years. I have appeared on behalf of thousands of

youths who were produced in court under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Emergency law in this country. So, I have a lot of experience. Can you remember the six lawyers who left the country during the UNP regime? Why are you are not referring to them? Because they were killed.

There was a devaluation of the rupee by 3 per cent, which was announced by the Hon. Minister of Finance and Planning. The Government has pursued an artificial exchange rate policy over the last number of years. It has been our argument that the exchange rate should be a floating rate, which is or close to the market-determined rate for foreign exchange. But, the Government has not pursued such a policy; it has managed the exchange rate. Now, what has happened? It has devalued the rupee by 3 per cent. The issue is not about readjusting the exchange rate, but about the management of it. Why has that been done? We have been saying over and over again that the exchange rate should be a freely-determined rate. The International Monetary Fund has defended this Government on its exchange rate policy.

895 896

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) Our policy is not the same as that of the USA. We have our own policy. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Okay. I agree that you have a policy and I do not agree with the policy. I can see the weaknesses and the dangers of the policy.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) All the other countries, which have such policies, have now fallen.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Minister, there are 200 countries in the world and we keep referring to three or four of those countries.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Member, you have only one more minute.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Sir, I need a few more minutes and the Hon. Minister can reply later.

The IMF defended this Governments policy by its silence and now it is talking. We do not want the IMF to browbeat our country. We are concerned about the interests of our country. But, if the policy is wrong, - [Interruption.] The Resident Representative of the IMF has stated that as long as the objective is achieved, it does not matter how it is achieved. We do not agree with that. The objective and the method are both important.

The IMF has whitewashed many countries in the recent past. Months before, the rulers were ousted by popular revolt in the Arab Spring Revolution. They were whitewashed by the IMF. We are interested not just in the exchange rate but also in good governance. There has to be independence between the Central Bank and the Government. The Government is doing the work of the Central Bank and the Central Bank is doing the work of the Government. The Monetary Law Act has been violated and the Government needs to look into it because there is no separation of duties. The Executive, the Judiciary and the Legislature have to have a division of power. What we have now is feeding into the public system and the judiciary of this country. The judicial officers, their spouses are being taken care of. The former Chief Justice's post-retirement appointment and all these

are creating conflicts of interest in the system. It is a shame that these things are happening. We must protect the independence of the Judiciary; we must protect the independence of the Central Bank. It is only then that good governance prevails. It is needed even for the management of the economy of the country. Thank you, Sir.

[2.52 p.m.] ( ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa - Deputy Minister of Water Supply and Drainage) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Budget for 2012 presented by His Excellency the President is a practical Budget with short-term and long-term development goals. It is really a peoples Budget made with wide consultations of all sectors of the Sri Lankan society. It is a gift to the nation of His Excellency the President reaching his 66th birthday.

Sri Lankas progress had several setbacks having been ruled by the Portuguese, Dutch and British for several centuries. Economic, social and cultural advancements were never fully realized and achieved as the political leadership after 1977 reversed the progressive policies initiated in 1956. Sri Lanka staggered with divided policies and a capitalistic approach which marred the onward march of the people.

The common man and the rural farmer were ignored and neglected. There was communal unrest and the Sri Lankan society remained divided. There was a wide gap between the rich and the poor. Sri Lanka lost its unitary character, and every effort to bring together all communities to achieve a united Sri Lanka were unsuccessful.

It is in this scenario that His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, championed the takeover of leadership and he became the President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka in 2005. Ever since the President took over the reins, Sri Lanka witnessed revolutionary and progressive changes in economic, social and cultural spheres. Buddhism was given the foremost place while other religions were fostered. Sri Lankan cultural and moral values were boosted, strengthened and reintroduced. This has changed the attitude of the Sri Lankans and has enabled them to march towards

915 916

achieving economic progress, social equity and right moral values.

The rural farmers engaged in paddy production, the cinnamon peelers, the construction workers, workers in rubber and tea production, the manufacturing industries and all other sundry workers now have a place in society and their livelihood is assured by the 2012 Budget Proposals.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for any Budget to be effective and successful, it should engineer and push forward society by proposals which could achieve greater employment opportunities and participation. Development activities should be spread over in all parts of the country, North, South, East and West. The Budget should hold prime importance in Sri Lankas decision-making process.

The Budget 2012 has these ideas and concepts. This was possible due to the bold and brave steps of His Excellency the President in getting rid of the 30-year old terrorism which plagued the country and marred the unity of the people and the sovereignty of the country. Today, there is communal harmony which is a prerequisite for the development process of the country.

The development proposals of His Excellency have been realistic so far. They were not proposals confined to books which found their place on the shelves. They were really implemented. No one can deny this. Every sector of the economy is being tapped and developed for the benefit of the people and not for the benefit of any individual or interested group. This is evident in the various special programmes initiated under Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future.

Sri Lanka faced several challenges and much turbulence after the war. Interested parties were making subtle attempts to discredit the Government and the President by spreading false allegations and by mudslinging tactics. The Channel 4 saga was one such example. But, the Government withstood all the pressures brought upon it by bold refutations and by briefing the truth at all international forums including the United Nations General Assembly, Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and the 17th SAARC Summit held recently in the Maldives.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, while the western countries struggled through the recession, Sri Lanka did not experience severe shocks since our economy was stable and satisfactory. In spite of recessionary impacts, Sri Lanka was stable and able to sustain an economic growth rate of 8 per cent. This was possible as His Excellency the President strongly believed in the unique potential of our human resources and the

duty of the Government to the people to ensure full personality development.

Sir, the economic indicators reveal that Sri Lanka has achieved commendable progress in infrastructure development: in roads, ports, aviation, irrigation, electricity, water supply, telecommunications, information technology, education and the health sectors in keeping with the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future. The Maga Neguma programme has transformed the rural economy and has empowered the rural farmer and the common man. The construction of the Mattala International Airport, Hambantota Port, Norachcholai Coal Power Plant, the Southern Expressway, the Upper Kotmale Hydropower Plant, the new Colombo South Port, outer Colombo Circular Highway and the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway are some of the major projects the Government has undertaken.

This is part of the Governments programme to develop Sri Lanka as a strategically-important centre in the areas of commercial, naval, aviation, energy and knowledge in the region. These projects will provide a large number of employment opportunities to the youth and enhance their living standards. The "Divi Neguma" and "Gama Neguma" development programmes have boosted economic growth in the rural areas to have a self-reliant household economy by empowering the villagers. About 1,300,000 homegarden units and 90,000 livestock farming units are functioning under the "Divi Neguma" programme in the country. The "Gama Neguma" programme provides access to the rural community for irrigation, electricity, housing, roads and water supply schemes and a livelihood programme also.

The economic and social development projects initiated by His Excellency the President's Government have had very positive results overall. We have been able to sustain the economic growth rate for the last two years. Unemployment has been substantially reduced. The poverty rate has fallen and the per capita income is US Dollars 2800.

The service sector too has had remarkable achievements, especially in tourism under the able and distinguished leadership of the Minister of Economic Development, Hon. Basil Rajapaksa. The Visit Sri Lanka campaign and the five-year tourism strategy has enabled the tourist industry to reach new heights. Additional hotels and transit infrastructure facilities are coming up in the North, East, South, West and Central Provinces. Sri Lanka Tourism expects to touch 800,000 tourist arrivals by the end of this year.

The Budget Proposals have provided relief to several sectors. Provision has been made for the development of national unity, social integration and transformation to a trilingual society. Budgetary allocations to the tune of Rs.

917 918

2011 25

1,700 million to the Ranaviru Authority introduces a special loan scheme for the benefit of soldiers and a sum of Rs. 14,000 million meets the monthly allowance paid to all disabled soldiers. This is a virtuous deed in itself and pays tribute to the brave soldiers who liberated the country. The monthly allowance paid to the elders over 70 years has been increased with an allocation of Rs. 900 million. The Budget Proposals have made provision for the support of low income families. The Samurdhi allowance has been increased. Lactating mothers and infants will be entitled for Thriposha. A sum of Rs. 150 million has been allocated to expand educational programmes. Journalists and artistes are to be empowered by the provision of Rs. 50 million to set up a special fund through which assistance could be extended to elderly artistes, journalists and writers and Rs. 100 million has been allocated to develop traditional crafts. The Public servants have been granted a 10 per cent basic salary increase. The Budget also proposes to set up rice-exporting zones. An allocation of Rs. 200 million has been made for research, seed development and expansion services.

All these proposals and many others prove that this is a development-oriented Budget which the people appreciate. We all congratulate His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, for his thoughtful and friendly Budget, which will surely bring peace, prosperity and unity to our motherland, Sri Lanka.

Thank you.

, ESTABLISHMENT OF A FUND FOR TRANSLATION OF SINHALA AND TAMIL LITERARY WORKS ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, I move the following Adjournment Motion:

While appreciating the progressive measures taken by the Ministry of National Integration and Languages to forge national unity and also to popularize the Trilingual concept, I propose that a fund be

established in the Ministry to help literary works of Sinhala and Tamil languages to be translated both Sinhala into Tamil and Tamil into Sinhala as envisaged in the Budget Proposal No. 17 presented in Parliament by His Excellency the President.

Sir, I move this Motion in keeping with the Mahinda Chintana. " , , " .

. 2012 the Year for a Trilingual Sri Lanka .

Sir, I think His Excellency the President, in his wisdom, while forming his new Cabinet after assuming the office of Presidency, could not have done better than creating this new Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration and appointing the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, a progressive-minded personality who is well disposed towards bringing all communities together as the Minister in charge of this Ministry. He desires very much to promote Tamil and Sinhala, equally English. He is doing a marvellous job of work in this sphere. I read in the "Daily News" a story on the training of the Public servants in the Tamil language. He has inaugurated a scheme to that effect also. I highly commend it.

I propose, Sir, that you make arrangements to translate short stories and other literary works in Sinhalese into Tamil and vice versa and have an Annual Award Ceremony conducted under your Ministry. This will herald a new era in the literary world. You will be the first Minister to under take such a laudable venture!

Then, Sir, as I told you, there is a magazine called "Mallihai" which is 46 years old. '' 50 . . ,

So, Sir, it is time that we venture out in this field too and I am very happy that a person of the calibre of the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara is guiding this very important Ministry. Importantly he goes to the North, to the East and to every part of the country. He is encouraging not only literature but also languages. The other day he gave a nice reply here. Even in the matter of the National Anthem, we cannot force a community to sing that in one language.

Why should we have divisions? It has started from 1947. Let us continue throughout.

Therefore, I would only suggest that it is time now that we pay our attention to this and also encourage our literary personalities. I must tell you, Sir, that there are so many females who have come forward now to write. They are in Colombo and in the rest of the country. Tamil books are being released almost weekly and monthly in the Colombo Tamil Sangam. There are Muslim girls who are writing books, novels and poems. They have become clever novelists, I should say.

I must tell you one thing. There is social justice, natural justice prevailing in this country; we have full freedom. So much so, that even Tamil books printed in Tamil Nadu are brought here and released in the Colombo Tamil Sangam and at other venues in our country. There have been book-releasing ceremonies held even in the Haputale Electorate in Badulla, which is your and your beloved fathers electorate. There is a rich heritage in the development of Tamil language and literature in the Uva Province and in the Central Province, as much as in the East and the West of the country.

The other day our Deputy Minister, the Hon. Muthu Sivalingam told in Puttalam that when people in the Tamil areas were scared to speak in the Tamil language and carry Tamil books, it was the Muslims in the Sinhalese areas - like Thiththawelgala and Nikadalupotha, which are represented by the Minister, Hon. Salinda Dissanayake, who is seated here, and Dikwella - the hometown of our great scholars like Munidasa Cumaranatunge had fostered and developed the Tamil language. All these activities were taking place in the Sinhalese areas. The Muslims gave life to the Tamil language when there was a scarcity of books in the country in that language.

I now recall the name of Mr. Gampalaithasan - Shahul Hameed - who expired recently. We even had a commemorative meeting in Brighton Hotel at Armour Street the other day. It was organized by Tamilthenral S.M. Ali Akbar . When there were no books printed in the Tamil language, Gampalaithasan was the person who took to every street in Pettah, First Cross Street to Fifth Cross Street, Keyzer Street and Main Street. He had what you call "Pattimandram" - - and encouraged Tamils and Muslims to develop their public-speaking skills in Tamil language. This is the manner in which the Muslims enriched the Tamil language.

Then, Sir, with regard to music, Muslims have played a great role. Our dear M.M. Peer Mohamed is one of the greatest singers that Sri Lanka has produced. We had Mr. Mohideen Baig, of course. Mohideen Baig was born in Salem in India. But, here we had M.M. Peer Mohamed, A.H.M. Mohideen, Haroon Lanthra, Tony Hassan, Ishak Baig, Noor Jehan Marzook, A.J. Kareem, A.L.M. Yusuf - a well known Sri Lankan Gazal Singer - then, M.S.M. Faleel, Nizam Careem and artistes of that calibre. They have been doing a great service by popularizing Tamil

through Islamic songs through the Radio Ceylon at that time, which is now the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. That is the way the Muslims have contributed their due share in order to foster and develop the Tamil language in our country. " ! !"
