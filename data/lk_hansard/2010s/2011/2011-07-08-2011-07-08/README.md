(iii) if so, the price paid and as to when the payment was made?

(c) If not, why?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Sir, on behalf of the Minister of External Affairs, the Answer is as follows:

(a) (i) The number of Sri Lankan embassies functioning worldwide is 59 (fifty nine).

(ii) Sri Lanka Missions abroad are established to meet the following main objectives:-

The promotion, projection and protection of Sri Lankas interests abroad in accordance with the foreign policy of the Government and to inform and advise the Government on international developments in keeping with the best interests of Sri Lanka;

To strengthen Sri Lanka's bilateral and multilateral relations with the world in investment, trade, economic, cultural relations et cetera between the countries; To serve Sri Lankan expatriates living abroad with regard to their consular and other matters; external publicity

(iii) The approximate number of persons of Sri Lankan origin living in each country where a Sri Lankan Mission/Post is in Column 8 of Annex I.

Hon. Member, I can mention the number of persons against each country. Do you want me to read it or do you want me to table it?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) One of the main activities of the ambassadors and the embassies overseas would be to ensure the projection and protection of the image of Sri Lanka as well to carry out Government policies and bring in investment to Sri Lanka and the post-war situation opens up a big opportunity for this. Hon. Deputy Minister, have you equipped those embassies with sufficient resources and are you happy that they are doing sufficient marketing for Sri Lankan to bring in foreign investment to Sri Lanka? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Member, as per the information, right now we are happy and the Ministry of Economic Development as well as the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and other ministries are also attached to this. Of course, we are not satisfied with the investment brought in. We need more and more investment to be brought into the country. Right now we are satisfied with what is happening, the interest that is being taken and the service they are doing in the embassies.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Supplementary Question No. 2. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Would this be not be good enough when better is expected? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Of course, we are expecting better. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It can be debated in many aspects. You said that you have 59 embassies worldwide. But, most of those people are not paid sufficiently for entertaining investors et cetera. I have come across many such instances. Would you please look into this matter? They must be equipped sufficiently when they go to market the country. There must be sufficient funds as well as exposure to do this in style. So, instead of covering the world, I would greatly appreciate if one part is at least covered very well and that would put the image of the country in a better perspective.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Yes, we will be doing that. We will be increasing the funds that are being providing for entertainment at present.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Supplementary Question No. 3 ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, my third Supplementary Question is this. According to the Answer, one of the main objectives of the embassies is to project the image of the Government. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Of the country and of the Government. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What I am saying is, an Hon. Member spoke out of turn and said that it is necessary to take action. Recently the Government has been virulently defending the Channel 4 telecast, which all of us put together with the Government would love to see that it is false.

When Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe says that there was zero casualty, the Hon. Prof. Rajeewa Wijesinha, a Member in your Government says on HARDtalk that there were 5,000 casualties or more. What has the High Commission of Sri Lanka in the UK done about this matter? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Any war is fought on the basis of zero casualty. No war is fought without any casualty. But, the objective is to fight with zero casualty. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am talking of a Member in your Government, who has opened his mouth, either with the knowledge of the Government or without, and said on HARDtalk that there were about 5,000 casualties. What an irresponsible statement it is! ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) The objective of a war is to fight with zero casualty. But, there can be casualties when the war is going on. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Do you, as the Deputy Minister of External Affairs, accept that there were casualties?

565 566

2011 08

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) That question would have been raised on the number of casualties after the war. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We, from the Opposition are supporting the Government to say that there is no such thing. But, one of your Members has made a careless statement on HARDtalk. Was it done with the knowledge of the Government or without? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Member, the policy is to have zero casualty. If you ask the number of casualties, I do not have the answer for that right now. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) This Member was the Secretary of the Peace Secretariat. When a person once from the Peace Secretariat says such a thing, is action being taken against him? If a Member of the Opposition spoke of one casualty, there would have been a big noise. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Member, that is not relevant to this Question. I have not watched the HARDtalk programme as well. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You are the Deputy Minister of External Affairs travelling around the world. You must be able to ensure that these people who are travelling around the world and opening their mouth without any relevance are put in place. We, from the Opposition are concerned about it. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) As far as casualties are concerned, we go by zero casualty before the war. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Will that Member be arrested on arrival at the airport for making irrelevant statements and for defaming the country?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Member, this Supplementary Question is not relevant to the Question that you asked.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) That was in New York.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I am talking about the first one. It was first shown at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) It was not only for the HRC members but also there were a lot of NGOs. That is where the difference is.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) No, no. Be that as it may, it was shown in the main building of the UN Human Rights Commission. -[Interruption.] That is what I said. . That is what I said. . ?

I have told the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris always - [Interruption.] I think one year ago when the No-Confidence Motion was brought - I think I told you - that you can come out of this only if you give a political solution. If you give a decent political solution, all these problems will be secondary. I told you that. I do not blame you. I blame the Government for the wrong policies, because you have to carry, as I said last time, the bundle - . . . You have to carry his baggage. You have to carry His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksas baggage - that is the baggage of the Government - on your back. But, when you were with the Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and also with the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, it was not that difficult because Chandrika had some ideas of devolution. She was committed to it. So, you could travel freely anywhere in the world. With Ranil it was much easier because we openly committed ourselves to a political solution. But, now the situation is different. That is why I blame you. You are not fashioning the foreign policy of the Government. If you are the Foreign Minister you should fashion it; you should advise the President. You should advise the Government as to what should be done. I remember when the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar was the Foreign Minister, I was the Deputy Minister for three years. He told the then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga "I cannot travel all over the world if there are killings. If you do that, I will resign. If there is evidence you must prosecute". You remember the

famous case of Krishanthi Kumaraswami. She was raped by some army people and they were prosecuted. When they invaded Jaffna, they cleared all the civilians. They dropped leaflets. All the civilians were cleared and it was the LTTE that was left. They were pushed into the Vanni. So, as the Foreign Minister, it is your duty to tell the Government the actual position.

We are in serious trouble. I do not know whether you realize it. But, I can see it from outside. We are like Sudan four years ago. Sudan was like Sri Lanka four years ago. There was a war between the North and the South. In the South about a hundred thousand people were killed. In the South you get the Christians, in the North you get the Muslims. About a hundred thousand civilians were killed. The United Nations said to hold an internal investigation. They did not hold an investigation. The UN held one and they said in Sudan the Christians and the Muslims cannot live together. They had a referendum last February. What could the President of Sudan do? There was nothing he could do. They held a referendum in the South of Sudan and they decided to separate from the North. Are we not in a similar situation? We are in a similar situation. In fact, when Ban Ki-moon came to Oxford three months ago, the diaspora was there and the entire discussion was on Sri Lanka and a referendum for the North and the East. That was the discussion.

So, we are in deep trouble. You must tell the country the actual position. There is no point in scoring debating points. You must tell the country the actual position. You must get the help of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. You must educate the people. I do not want to enlighten the House on your answers because if I enlighten the House on the answers given by you, you will be in greater trouble. Some of your answers are incriminating the armed forces. The international agenda is very clear.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) The international agenda, Hon. Minister, is very clear. They have a plan but the unfortunate thing is, the Government is falling into that trap. Why must you fall into that trap? If you give a political solution within the next couple of months, the agenda of the international community will lose its sting. But, you are not doing it. There was the Panel of Experts' Report. There was the Tissa Vitarana Report. I saw a statement by the Hon. (Dr.) Rajith Senaratne saying that the Thirteenth Amendment must be implemented in full. So, why do you not go ahead with it and give a political solution? If you do that, I think 80 per cent of your problem will be solved. You know there is a government in exile in

607 608

America. Why have they allowed that? V. Rudrakumaran is the Prime Minister of it. They appoint MPs from all over the world. All the Tamils living in France and Germany voted for MPs. They meet once a month. Why did they form that? What is the reason? It is a standby arrangement for a future state. So, we are in deep trouble. You must educate the people about the real situation. There is no use of hiding this. The United States, the European Union, and all the super powers are in a club. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) All right. The USA and countries such as England, Russia, China are all in a club. Once you join the club, you can disagree but they are members of the same club. Now, what is happening in Libya? The Americans are bombing Libya. What is Russia doing? Russians are negotiating an exit for Gaddafi. Russia and America are members of the same club. So, do not be too sure that these big countries will support you at the relevant moment.

() .. ( ) ( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Madam Chair, I would like to begin by responding to one particular point that was made by my Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, before I address the substantive issues that are involved in this Debate.

All kinds of material are exposed before the United Nations System. The fact that the Channel 4 footage was shown in Geneva does not in any sense mean or imply that the United Nations System is accepting the authenticity or the genuineness of that material. That assumption cannot be made at all. It does not follow. The Government of Sri Lanka has pointed out in very specific terms the deficiencies and inconsistencies in the footage. Many technical considerations have been referred to. This is hardly the place to go into those technical considerations. There is now an inquiry of a kind in the United Kingdom. There are international experts, with far stronger credentials in this field, than either my learned Friend or me, going into this matter. There is now a real debate. What is this material? How was it made and under what circumstance? ( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair.

() , .

, ( )() , . Whereupon THE HON. (DR.) (MRS.) SUDHARSHINI FERNANDOPULLE left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER took the Chair.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I was responding to some points that were made by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella with regard to the Channel 4 footage. I would like to tell my Friend that there are some real doubts as to whether there is congruence between the visual track and the audio track. There are reasons to believe that there is a lack of congruence. I, myself have personally seen a version of this film where the language spoken is not Sinhala but Tamil and instructions are given in the Tamil language. With my own ears I have heard three sets of instructions given in the Tamil language: one was to the effect that the boots should be removed; the other was an instruction to blindfold and the third comment that was made was, why there should be photography at all, take those

609 610

[ ]

2011 08

cameras away. These instructions were given in the Tamil language. So, there are real issues. There are also issues connected with the background sounds. I do not claim to be an expert in this field but people who have expert knowledge of this subject are now beginning seriously to question the authenticity of this material. It is therefore very wrong to jump to the conclusion that this is genuine and the mere fact that it was shown in Geneva is certainly no indication whatsoever that a conclusion can be reached with regard to the genuineness of this material. So, the whole premise of the argument is wrong. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella was asking, Have you not lost the battle already? Why? Because the material was shown in the United Nations. All kinds of things are shown in the United Nations. There is freedom. So, the conclusion that he wanted to draw does not flow at all from the premise. I would like to make that very clear.

Then, Mr. Deputy Speaker, this is basically a Debate on Indo-Sri Lanka relations. That was the manner in which the Motion was presented to this House by the Hon. Vijitha Herath. I would like to say that the first requirement at this time is rationality. We must be cerebral. We must not be ruled by the emotions or by the heart. We owe it to our country at this critical juncture in our contemporary history to think dispassionately and calmly. That is the first requirement.

The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella spoke a great deal about the present situation of the country, the opportunities and the challenges that lie ahead. I appreciate that. The most striking characteristic of the contemporary situation, seems to me, is the magnitude of the opportunity that is available to us after three decades of pain and anguish.

The military action is over. The Hon. Vijitha Herath, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and I, we all can live in this country without any fear. We can go home at the conclusion of these proceedings without any anxiety as to our safety, which is not the case. When the Hon. Members of this House were attacked, happily no Member of this House was killed. But, innocent bystanders had to pay with their lives at that time on an occasion when Parliament was adjourned and the Members were finding their way home. So, that part of it is over and today, we are in a situation where we can derive the fullest advantage from the inherent strengths and resources of this country, in particular, the unique calibre of our human resources. We have that opportunity. What is now happening is that the friends of the LTTE are transferring their initiatives from the battlefield to the arena of international action. Let us not forget, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that although the military action is over, they are not fighting their battle with bombs and guns but they are making the fullest use of other resources, which they continue to command; in particular, the very extensive financial resources which they have accumulated over a period of more than 30 years and the very sophisticated media network that they

have built up. I tell you, Sir, that what we are now seeing is an economic onslaught against this country. The purpose of this is to prevent, to stultify the economic development of this country, to prevent tourists from coming here, to dissuade investors, to destroy the foundation of international trade by so doing to inflict an irreparable damage on the economy of this country. That is their aim and purpose. It is no longer a military campaign. It is an economic campaign. It is very important, therefore, that Hon. Members of this House, who I am certain and I do not doubt for one moment, have goodwill, who have affection for this country must not fall into a trap. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella asked the Government not to fall into a trap. The Hon. Members of this House, no doubt with the best of intention are not in any way imputing motives of an unworthy character. But, an Hon. Member of this House - not to mention a Deputy Chairman of the United National Party, the largest Opposition Party in this country - tries to draw a parallel between the situation in Sudan and Sri Lanka and talks of referenda, which may culminate in cessation. I think that is a very clear indication of a distinct danger and the Hon. Members of this House - I do not think the Hon. Members of the Government - who mistakenly making certain assumptions are unwittingly and inadvertently falling into that trap. There is no parallel at all; chalk and cheese - worlds apart! So, that would be a very unfortunate approach to this situation and that is exactly what the Members of the transnational government would like. The Hon. Kiriella referred to that.

No country on this planet has recognized or dreamt of recognizing what they are calling themselves the "transnational Government of Tamil Eelam". It is an organization without any credibility, no antecedent, no roots, no recognition or acknowledgment from anywhere. Are we going to dignify such a treacherous, illegal organization by sanctifying it through references in this House? That would be very unfortunate. That is why I say in all sincerity, without any rancour whatsoever, that this is really a matter in respect of which we need to adopt a different approach. The speech that was delivered on the Floor of this House, a few minutes ago by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella is, I think ,very unfortunate because it contains certain features that can be built upon; that can be utilized by people who wish to do real harm to this country. It contains elements which are precisely what those people would like. So, if it is a question of entrapment, then that is the real danger which, I think, we all should guard against. The Government has certainly not said or done anything to indicate that we are falling into a trap but the last speech that we heard contains very definite indications of that.

I spoke of the need for a sense of pragmatism. We have to consider the reality of the world in which we live. I am sure my distinguished Colleague, the Hon.(Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, Minister for International Monetary

611 612

Co-operation, will readily endorse what I am about to say. Look at the global economy. The real challenge today is to uplift the living conditions of our people and let them live a better life. This country - indeed no country in the world - can formulate an economic philosophy; a strategy for economic action in isolation. We live in an interconnected world. So, our own economic prosperity and well-being is dependent on this sagacity and the perception with which we structure our economic policies in a global and regional contest. Today, the economies of the West are growing by 2.5 per cent a year. The global average - I am sure the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella knows this - is 4.5 per cent. But, countries in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ring area are growing by almost 10 per cent. The economy of India is growing by approximately 8.4 per cent and economy of China is growing at a threshold, which exceeds 9 per cent. So, that is the reality of the situation. However, we have the irony that the bulk of our exports continues to be to the West. Mr. Deputy Speaker, 20 per cent of Sri Lankas exports are to the United States and 39 per cent are to the Western Europe. So, when you add our exports to the United States and to the Western Europe, it is exactly 59 per cent. Does that make sense? Should we not make far greater use of the emerging economies in this part of the world? Is that not the road to prosperity for the Sri Lankan people? It is not a question of succumbing to pressure as the Hon. Vijitha Herath suggested or it is not a question of paying homage or making obeisance to India where lies the path to our own prosperity. Not at all! Whether we like it or not, the reality of the situation is that geography and economy link the destinies of India and Sri Lanka. There is no need to be frightened of it or to be reluctant to say that. We can turn that to our advantage. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella began his speech by saying that in economic relations, countries are governed by self-interest. Of course, that is so. So, let us now serve Sri Lankas self-interest by making use of the potential that this whole region has from massive economic development in the years to come.

It is in that context that we must view our relationship with India. Just 10 days ago, Srimathi Nirupama Rao addressing the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London, which I myself addressed last year, had this comment to make. She said, Mahatma Gandhi called India Sri Lankas nearest neighbour. It is through that prism that we see our ties with this island nation. So, Srimathi Rao speaking for the Government of His Excellency (Dr.) Manmohan Singh says that Sri Lanka is our nearest neighbour; we have affection for Sri Lanka; we have special ties with Sri Lanka and it is through that prism that we see our ties with this island nation.

My distinguished predecessor in the office of Minister of Foreign Affairs, the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, in whose memory the British Secretary of State for

Defence is delivering an oration tomorrow, had this to say about the relationship between India and Sri Lanka. The late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar said that this is a multi-faceted relationship; it permeates every sector of our lives; it is therefore neither practical nor necessary to try to delineate the contours of this relationship and in the picturesque words of the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, this relationship goes so back in time that it is lost in the mists of time. That is how the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar saw the relationship between these two countries.

Now with great respect I would like to tell my Friend the Hon. Vijitha Herath that important as history is, because we cannot fully understand the present in isolation of the past, it is perhaps a mistake to delve excessively on the past. Let us rather concentrate on the present and the future. Let us look at last year, 2010. What is the economic reality with regard to Sri Lanka and India? Mr. Deputy Speaker, the position is that India today is Sri Lankas largest trading partner. India is first in terms of Foreign Direct Investment. Among all the countries that are investing in Sri Lanka, India is by far the largest. The largest number of tourists who come into this country come from India. India is the predominant source of tourism in this island. So in all three sectors, Trade, Foreign Direct Investment, and Tourism, India occupies a dominant position in relation to our country. Now, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we are all citizens of Sri Lanka, whatever party we belong to. And, we, therefore, unreservedly subscribe to the sentiment that was so powerfully articulated by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapakse in the Budget Speech which he delivered to this august Assembly on the 22nd of November, 2010. His Excellency the President stated, I quote:

"the global economy is slowly recovering with a growth rate of around 5 per cent. More encouragingly India, China and all other major countries in Asia are providing a major impetus for regional and global growth that is beneficial for us.

This is why in "Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the future" we projected Sri Lanka as a dynamic global hub. Taking advantage of Sri Lanka's strategic location, our next massive leap forward is to develop our motherland as a naval, aviation, commercial, energy and knowledge hub being a key link between the East and the West".

Now, that is the aspiration in the words of no less than the President of Sri Lanka. Now, I am sure that all of us here including my good Friend, the Chief Opposition Whip, will wish this for our motherland. This is what we want. I do not think there is any conceivable doubt about it. So, Mr. Deputy Speaker, if we are agreed about the aim and the objective, then it behoves us to reflect upon the modalities that would serve us best to accomplish that objective.

Now, I would like to explain to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, how India is going to play a vital role. It is not a question of affection for India or subservience to India or

613 614

[ () . . ]

2011 08

loyalty to India as the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella said. It is neither more nor less than enlightened self-interest. That is the foundation of all economic policy and foreign policy. What is India's role with regard to the achievement of this objective?

His Excellency the President refers to a naval, aviation, commercial, energy and knowledge hub. Now, if we are to achieve this objective, let us evaluate India's importance. Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is a fact, whether we like it or not, that 70 per cent of the container transshipment business that the Port of Colombo deals with comes from India. So, if we are going to develop Sri Lanka as a naval hub, as a commercial hub, as a shipping hub, there is no way that we can do it without factoring in the crucial importance of India.

Then, take the manufacturing sector. We are very proud of the performance of some of our companies, which have brought in very large volumes of foreign exchange. One of these companies is Colombo Dockyard. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Colombo Dockyard has contracted with an Indian company. That is Greatship (India) Limited. Look at the benefits to Sri Lanka and the large volume of foreign exchange that we have earned as a result of these contractual arrangements with the Indian company. This company known as Greatship (India) Limited has ordered 11 vessels. Eleven vessels have been ordered by an Indian company from a Sri Lankan company. We must be proud of it as Sri Lankans. This Island has produced a company of international stature that is capable of building ships which are being ordered by India and Mr. Deputy Speaker, the value of this one contract for 11 vessels is US Dollars 240 million.

Greatship (India) Limited has also commissioned a platform support vessel made in this country, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and the value of that is US Dollars 26 million. The Government of Lakshadweep has ordered two passenger ferry vessels from Colombo Dockyard. All of this amounts to more than a quarter of a billion US Dollars. So, all this outpouring of venom against India and all these suspicions, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella saying that India wants to be Shylock to squeeze the last cent out of us, that India is revelling in a situation in which we find ourselves that they are demanding a quid pro quo, all of this, in all sincerity, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is very far indeed from the truth.

Look at the tangible benefits to Sri Lanka. These are not matters that we can argue about. These are facts and figures which are incontrovertible. Look at this. I mean, this is one of so many contracts. It would be obviously tedious for me to take you through all the contracts, but here is one instance where more than a quarter of a billion US Dollars is coming from India under the aegis of these contractual relationships. Without this, how can we achieve the objective which we have all agreed is desired for this country, the objective which received inspiring

articulation in the Budget Speech of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa?

I spoke of manufacturing. Colombo Dockyard is an instance of that. But, the segment of the Sri Lankan economy which is growing fast, the most robust growth is in the services sector. About 58 per cent of the growth of Sri Lankas economy today comes from the services sector. Now, dispassionately, without emotion, without prejudice, without bias, without hatred of India, without suspicion of India - I am not holding a brief for India, I am the Sri Lankas Minister for External Affairs - look at the reality of the situation. What is Indias contribution to the development of our services sector, Mr. Deputy Speaker? You are aware that SriLankan Airlines operates nearly 100 flights a week into seven Indian cities and SriLankan Airlines, I am sure we are all proud, is one of the major airlines flying into and out of Indian cities. I do not know whether you are aware of this. Mr. Deputy Speaker, the Indian company IndiGo, that is an Indian airline company, has just placed the largest order in the history of civil aviation for passenger aircraft. No American company, no British company, no German company has placed such a large order in the whole history of civil aviation. This massive company IndiGo has contracted with SriLankan Airlines to provide services. So, are you seriously asking us to dismiss India?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Perumal Rajathurai to take

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I propose that the Hon. Perumal Rajathurai do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

, .

, , . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and HON. PERUMAL RAJATHURAI took the Chair.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Presiding Member, I consider it a privilege to have the opportunity of continuing my presentation under your distinguished Chairmanship.

I was asking my Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella about how we should envision the future of our economy

615 616

and the destiny of this Island. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella gave, I have no doubt, some sincere advice, In the same spirit, I would like to ask him whether it is his wish that we exclude India because we think that India is trying to take advantage of us. If India is trying to take advantage of us, what about all these contracts? What about Indias intimate role in the development of all these vibrant components of Sri Lankas economy, be it the manufacturing sector, the services sector or the knowledge and the technology sector? I do not know whether the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella is aware - he has children who are interested in higher education - but I think he will be very interested to know that the largest collection of PhDs under one roof is not in the United States, it is not in the United Kingdom, it is in India. It is in the State of Karnataka in Bangalore and general electric have that distinction. The largest number of PhDs anywhere in the world, under one roof, is in the City of Bangalore. Because of this inherent suspicion which is clouding his judgment, all that he has said, all that the Hon. Vijitha Herath said, is inspired by a certain attitude to India, which is basically fallacious. Is he then asking us, as those who are responsible for running the Government of this country at this time, not to factor in India? Will we gain from that? Will we lose from that? The loss to our country will be incalculable.

Then, Mr. Presiding Member, look at tourism. The Hon. Lakshaman Kiriella comes from Kandy. Kandy is benefiting immensely from tourism today. As we prepare for the Kandy Perahera, hotels in Kandy are brimming over with tourists. What is the future of tourism? And, what is Indias specific role in that sector? The Government of Sri Lanka hopes to attract two million tourists by the year 2016. Mr. Presiding Member, 25 per cent of that two million, that is 500,000 tourists, will come to us from India.

Now, according to the World Tourism Organization - these are not our figures; these are the World Tourism Organization figures - the number of outbound Indian tourists today is 11 million. The World Tourism Organization estimates that by the year 2020, that figure will i,ncrease to 50 million. As I told you earlier, that by far the largest source of tourists into Sri Lanka is India. The World Tourism Organization also states in their formal records which you can verify at any time that the Indians today are the seventh biggest spenders; seventh biggest spenders in the world when they come on holiday. So, can we realistically think of developing tourism in our country without taking fully into account the Indian dimension of that relationship? That is why I exhort all the Hon. Members, truly and sincerely, bereft of political partisanship to consider the vital interest of this country so that our people who have suffered so much can raise their heads, live in dignity and enjoy a standard of life to which they are morally and legally entitled. We cannot do

it by cutting ourselves from India, hating India, suspecting India, blaming India or charging India. That is not a sensible course of action for us to adopt if we are really dedicated to serving the cause of our people.

Now, there is one other point we should mention. Nobody must run away with the impression that Indians are coming here, filling their pockets and going away. That is what the Hon. Vijitha Herath said. Today, as Sri Lankans, we must all be legitimately and genuinely proud of the fact that this is two-way traffic; it is no longer one-way traffic. Large Sri Lankan companies like Brandix, MAS Holdings, Hayleys, Aitken Spence, Damro, John Keells are major investors into the Indian market. They are major players in India.

... ( ) ( ... - , ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne - Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs) Even Siddhalepa Group of Companies. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Yes, even Siddhalepa Group of Companies. Mr. Asoka Hettigoda is doing wonders there with innovative, young, energetic and new ideas. The whole Indian market and the increasing appetite of the Indian middle-class, which is today approximately 350 million people, is clamouring for higher quality goods and services.

How well has Damro done in plastics, Siddhalepa in herbal drugs, Aitken Spence and John Keels in hotels, Brandix and MAS Holdings in garments? They are benefiting from the huge Indian market which is expanding everyday, as we speak here, spending money, disposable income, clamouring for goods and insatiable appetite - Sri Lankan companies are now satisfying that appetite. Of course, we must serve the Sri Lankan people. But, Sri Lanka has a population of 20 million. India has more than one billion. So, is it wrong, is it illogical, is it unreasonable to exploit to the full, the potential of the markets of India in the cause of the economic prosperity of this nation?

Then, Mr. Presiding Member, this idea that India is dictating terms, these words, Loku Aiya, Chuti Nangi; are emotional, not cerebral. They are intended to evoke certain responses. Then, Adhipathya in the words of the Hon. Tissa Attanayake. Now, what is the reality of this situation? Are they really dictating terms? I can honestly say that during my visit to New Delhi, nobody in the Indian Government, from the Prime Minister of India downwards, made the slightest attempt to impose any particular view on us. I will not tell a lie, that is the truth. Nobody told us, we demand that you do

617 618

[ () . . ]

2011 08

this, we want you to do it or else. There was no threat, no duress, no caution, no undue pressure. There was nothing of that sort. Now, what are we doing?

Shivshankar Menon, the National Security Adviser of India, whom we all know - the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella knows, the Hon. John Amaratunga knows - served here as the Indian High Commissioner. What did he say in his press briefing at the conclusion of his visit just three weeks ago to Colombo? He said it is for Sri Lanka to charter course with regard to her destiny. We are there to help. But, these are Sri Lankan issues which call for Sri Lankan responses. That came from no less than Shivshankar Menon, who works very closely with the Indian Prime Minister. He sees the Indian Prime Minister at least once a week. That is what he said in Colombo at his media briefing.

We are trying to evolve a local and indigenous solution. Three days ago, a Government delegation met the Tamil National Alliance and the EPDP. So, we are moving forward. Then, the Government is considering the appointment of a Parliamentary Select Committee. It is not to waste time. It is not a delay in tactic. It makes a good deal of sense, again if one is rational. What is the rational basis for the appointment of such a committee at this time? As we talk to the Tamil parties and as we reach some agreement even of a limited form, surely, to implement that into law, to give that constitutional expression, we have to come to this august Assembly. The executive branch of the Government cannot do it. Do you want us really to go through the entire bilateral process with the Tamil parties and when that is concluded, to come to Parliament? Is that going to take more time or less time? It is that that would be a delaying tactic. So, we want these processors to be concurrent rather than successive. They must take place simultaneously. We are trying to telescope these processors into a single time frame. That will result in a very considerable saving of time and energy. It is, therefore, wrong; it is unreasonable to suggest that Government is trying to buy time as a result of it. It is not a manoeuvre. It is not a tactic. It reflects a genuine resolve to move forward as speedily as possible ensuring that the solution that emerges is just and equitable by all communities and also has the merit of sustainability.

The Hon. Vijitha Herath tried to frighten us all by referring to this statement. Now, over and over again, not only the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, but also the others have talked of , . ? Nothing whatsoever was signed. This is the fundamental misconception. I have not said this earlier. It is so obvious. But, I think the time has come to state the obvious. This is a media statement. It is not a treaty between two States. There is no grand signing with a flourish.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, your time is over. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Sir, I would like to go on. The Government will make leave because there are some things that I need to say which are important. This is a media statement. Let us first of all understand what this is, before we frighten ourselves and frighten others. This is not a . It is not a at all. But, everything has been said to the country to frighten everybody, to see a ghost in every bush. This is not serving the cause of the nation. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella exhorted me with great passion to educate our people. We must educate our people about the truth, not about fiction. This treaty, this is a figment of imagination. It is total fiction. What is a media statement? What does it consist of? The Indian Governments point of view is reflected at the Sri Lankan Governments point of view. Can we tell Indias Foreign Minister on his own soil what to say? He has every right to say what he wishes to say just as I have every right to respond in a manner that I consider appropriate. But, it is a media statement. It is not binding; it is not obligatory. It is not a treaty which is a source of rights and obligations at international law. That is not what this document is all about. It is self-evident. But, sometimes the self-evident also needs explicit statements and this is one of those occasions.

Now, Sir, all this fear about the Kankesanthurai Harbour, the Palali Airport is intended to frighten people, as if we are handing over the countrys ports and harbours to India. I said all of this on the last occasion and I deeply regret that it has made no impression whatsoever. All that the document refers to is a railway line, something as mundane as a railway line, not the port, not the airport, not the harbour, it is just a railway line.

Then, Mr. Presiding Member, everything about this document has been grossly misinterpreted. With regard to interconnectivity, progress was reviewed. What was done in the past was reviewed; nothing for the future. Now, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and the Hon. Vijitha Herath, the proposer and the mover of the Resolution spoke of - particularly the Hon. Vijitha Heath seemed alarmed at these phrases. Now, what do these phrases mean? Is there anything to be alarmed about? Early withdrawal of Emergency Regulations. That is the undoubted policy of the Government of Sri Lanka. All countries need special legal provisions during times of crisis. When I was a student at the Oxford University, Britain had draconian laws to deal with the IRA. They did. One of Britain's most conservative jurists, the late Lord Diplock, used to come to All Souls College to have dinner. His name was indelibly associated with the nomenclature of the

619 620

Diplock Courts. They were not courts at all. They were administrative tribunals. So, all countries need extraordinary legislations to meet extraordinary contingencies. They are not however a permanent part of the legal structures of a country. It is therefore, quite obvious that the Government of Sri Lanka wants to phase out the Emergency Regulations. What is wrong with that? There is nothing heretical in this; there is nothing astonishing in this. Of course, we want to scale down the Emergency and we have said so. His Excellency the President has said so.

Investigations into allegations of human rights violations. This phrase was seized upon both by the Hon. Vijitha Herath and by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella. It is not and it has never been the policy of the Government of Sri Lanka to refuse to look at allegations of human rights violations. We are not accepting international inquiries. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission was appointed by the President of Sri Lanka under the aegis of legislation applicable in this country and part of the mandate of the Commission is to look at allegations relating to human rights violations. So, what is wrong with that?

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Has the LLRC the mandate to inquire into allegations of human rights violations?

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Certainly, yes. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Forget about the LLRC. Ninety nine per cent of orders issued by the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission have never been implemented.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) May I tell the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella that what you are now saying to me here was said to me by Congress Berman in Washington. He said exactly that. He said, I do not think your LLRC has the mandate to investigate human rights violations. I said, No, I respectfully disagree with you. Then, he said, Well, I am a trained lawyer. Let me look at it myself and make up my own mind. He went through that and before the meeting was over, he told me No, this is wide enough to include that. This happened in Washington during a meeting with a Member of the United States, House of Representatives.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . rose.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama ) Maybe the message is still coming to you.- [Interruption.] Through your leader that message must be still coming. - [Interruption.]

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) It depends on what you mean by a private conversation. The Ambassador of Sri Lanka was there and there were about 10 people in the room. It was not a one-on-one conversation between the Congressman and myself. -[Interruption.] I am prepared to accept that this is Hon. Lakshman Kiriellas view. But, with all respect it is a wrong view and the American Congressman does not agree with that view. That is with regard to human rights violations.

Then, Restoration of normalcy in affected areas. What an earth is wrong with that? These are areas that have been affected by two decades of war. The infrastructure has been devastated. Irrigation systems, roads, railways, hospitals, schools, all of these have naturally been affected by the war. Now, we are committing ourselves to restoration of normalcy in affected areas. Surely, that is the obvious and inescapable duty of any government.

What is wrong with that? I cannot for the life of me understand what would be the basis of any complaint with regard to that matter. The next phase is the redress of humanitarian concerns of affected families. Surely, all of us, whatever party we belong to, are deeply committed to the accomplishment of that objective. So, what is all the fuss about? Now, that is what I would really like to know, Mr. Presiding Member. There is nothing here. It is simply a creature of our own imagination. We create something. We get frightened about what we create. We react to the ghost that we create and then we expect to frighten other people on the same footing. That is exactly what has happened with regard to this Joint Media Statement.

I would also like to tell this House about other vital areas of Indian co-operation. I dealt with the economy. But, the Government of India has also decided to help us with security, with the armed forces. They are giving more and more places in military schools to train members of the armed forces. Unless you want to tell me, "do not take that because they have ulterior motives" -

621 622

[ () . . ]

2011 08

unless you want really seriously to suggest that. They are giving us their expertise. They are one of the largest armies in the world. This expertise is available to us and we are benefiting from it.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Even during the war. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Yes, even during the war and it is continuing after the war. Look at housing. Now, do you object to this phrase, "restoration of normalcy"? One crucial element of the restoration of normalcy is housing. We all want a roof over our heads. Shelter is a basic human need. The Government of India is "donating" - I stress that word. Again I hold no brief for India. What is India doing for me? What is my obligation to India? I am a Minister of the Sri Lankan Government. But, they are building 50,000 houses and it is a donation. It is a gift.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) It has not started yet. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) No, it has started. The pilot project is on and of the remaining number of houses, for 43,000 houses, the money is given directly to the people who are going to occupy the houses and the other 7,000 will be built by contractors because the beneficiaries are not in a position to build their own houses. These are widows and people in the plantation areas.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Same as in the tsunami. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Yes, same as in the tsunami, as my distinguished Colleague points out.

So, do you want to reject all of these saying India is bad, India is evil, India is the loku aiyya who is trying to intimidate us and they will cane us? So are we going to refuse all these? Does it make any sense at all? I seriously ask this. Is it a line of thinking that is worthy of Members of the most exalted legislative assembly in this country?

Then, I want to make this complete because once and for all we must expose the truth. Otherwise, this will go on raising its head over and over and over again. What I

have said so far is mainly about Government to Government dealings. Do not forget the community; people to people contacts. I think the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella who hails from a distinguished Kandyan family and who is a devout Buddhist will be very interested in this. There is a project called Dambadiva Vandana. It is about to start and the purpose is to enable pilgrims from Sri Lanka who do not have very much money to have the benefit of visiting all the places of religious importance in India. They get on a train. They do not have hotel expenses because the nights are spent on the train. This train goes all over India giving them the opportunity of visiting these places and the cost is very moderate.

Then, in Pallekele in Kandy, His Excellency the President, I think about four months ago inaugurated an International Buddhist Conference. It was attended by scholars and vice-chancellors from eight countries, principally from Buddhist countries. His Excellency the President wanted me to deliver the keynote address on that occasion and I dealt with the Buddhist concept of accountability suggesting that the Western concept of accountability is not compatible with what is found in the Buddhist scriptures. The Sigalovada Suthra, the Maha Parinibbana Suthra and particularly the Dhamma Pada. All of that was supported by the Government of India.

The next one is the Indian Cultural Centre. Lester James Peiris and Sumitra Peiris have been very rightly honoured without any difference of opinion by this Assembly. Sumitra Peiris will be delivering a lecture within the next few days at the Indian Cultural Centre. They are doing an enormous amount of work with regard to ballet, with regard to music, with regard to the performing arts.

Just a few days ago the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama and I participated in a very moving ceremony to felicitate Pandith Amaradeva. So, this is the intensity and the depth of contact between India and Sri Lanka at the people to people level as distinguished from government to government level.

I also want to tell the Hon. Vijitha Herath who made a big point of the fisheries issue that we are not afraid of anybody. There is no question of caving in to pressure where we need to raise our voice. We shall do so without fear or favour. There is a problem with regard to fisheries. The Government of Sri Lanka certainly agrees that killing fishermen is not the answer to any problem. Therefore, there will be no violence used. However, the problem cries out for a just, reasonable and sustainable solution. We have raised this issue with the Government of India and they are responding. Instructions have been given to the Indian Coast Guard; the Hydrographer of India is also playing a role. I have had discussions with His Excellency the Indian High Commissioner in Colombo and also in Delhi. Now, the current position is that the Government of Sri Lanka has requested an early

623 624

meeting of the Joint Working Group. It is called the JWG and that is going to meet in Colombo in the first or the second week of August. So, when we need to speak out, we will. But, there is no merit in being aggressive for the sake of being aggressive. There is no point in abuse, vituperation and conspiracy theories for their own sake but where the vital interests of this country are concerned, we will certainly speak out loud and clear. We have basically said that the Tamil fishermen, particularly in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka, are beginning to build the foundations of their economic life after decades of deprivation. Is it then right and proper for the Indian fishermen to come and to take away these resources using methods like trawling which inflict very serious damage on the seabed, the ocean floor, the marine resources and fingerlings? Very large numbers of Indian vessels are coming into Sri Lankan territorial waters. We have raised that issue. It is not to score brownie points; it is not to win the plaudits of the multitude but we will intervene in the effective manner, talking to the Government of India and putting in motion, a strategy, a course of action, which will bring us the results which we desire. All of this is possible because of goodwill. Do not forget, bullet-ridden dead bodies of fishermen is a highly-charged matter. It is very emotional on both sides. It is, by its very nature, a very emotional matter. But, we were able to prevent a conflagration. It did not implode in our face. Why was that? Because of the goodwill, the friendship, the understanding between the two Governments and the honest desire to solve problems by negotiation, by talking to each other, by understanding the true nature of the problem and by devising a pragmatic remedy. So, that is the reality of the situation.

I have taken a long time, Mr. Presiding Member, I am aware of it. But, I have done so consciously and deliberately because on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka, I want to nail this canard once and for all. This keeps coming up all the time and much of what is propagated is pure and unadulterated fiction. So, we want to tell the country very much reciprocating, the spirit underpinning the remarks by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella - talk to the people; take them into your confidence; educate them and create a public opinion. You must create a public opinion on the basis of truth and not on the basis of prejudice or bias.

( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) What about the Indian Membership in the UN Security Council? What is your point of view with regard to that?

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) I have no difficulty whatsoever in answering that

question. We do support a seat for India in the Security Council. That is a right and proper thing to do. However, it is the policy of the Government of Sri Lanka that all the issues connected with the reform of the United Nations System must be taken together.

. . . . . . . , , , . . . . , , .

, , . Security Council , General Assembly , veto power . - permanent seat - . . . . So, Mr. Presiding Member - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I would like to ask you why you answered the 31 questions posed to you by the Darusman Committee? You answered 31 questions. So, after answering those questions, can you say that that Committee is illegal?

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Hon. Kiriella, that is a classic example of playing politics because either way you lose. - [Interruption.] This information was not provided to Darusman. It was provided to the Secretary-General of the UN System, His Excellency Ban Ki-moon. Sri Lanka has been a Member of the United Nations System since 1952 and we have repeatedly stated that we will continue to work with the UN System in a spirit of cordiality. There is no problem about that. We have every right and indeed every duty to communicate with the Secretary-General of the UN System. As you yourself stated, it is addressed to the Secretary-General of the UN System. Had we not provided that information, I can take any bet with you - even if that is not quite parliamentary - that the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella would get up in this House today and say, You have been foolish. You are complaining

625 626

[ () . . ]

2011 08

because you have kept those people in the dark. They produced this Report because you did not inform them of what you were doing in this country. Had they only known what work you were doing, their Report would have been of a totally different character. Therefore, you have only yourselves to blame for not giving them the information which could well have made a world of difference in the preparation of their Report. That would certainly have been the argument of my Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) He would have been the first to say that. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Yes, he would have been the first to say that - [Interruption.] Whether it is 31 questions or 25 questions or 50 questions, the principle is the same. We are responding to the Secretary-General of the UN System. There is nothing wrong with that. We are now in a position to say, Hon. Kiriella, we provided this information. We did so in a spirit of honesty and candour. Notwithstanding that, you have arrived at a conclusion which Yasushi Akashi, no less, who says that it has taken chunks of it from the International Crisis Group Report. He said it.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That would have taken from the verbatim. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Yes. The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama was there. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) That was a private comment - [Interruption.] () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, no. That was the Sri Lanka - Japan Committee meeting in Tokyo. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I have a copy with me here. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) No, no. - [Interruption.] This was a remark made by - [Interruption.]

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) How can you say that? I was present there. - [Interruption.] () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Okay. Let us not get sidetracked. That is a side issue. But, definitely if we had not provided that information, the criticism would have been made and quite rightly as the Opposition, you are entitled to say that. You would have said, You were doing all these. The problem is, you did not inform them. If you did not inform them, how do you expect them to know? If they did not know, how can you complain about a Report which excludes the material which would have liked them to take into account? So, my answer to your question is, we did the right and proper thing, the best thing in the interest of this country. We informed them. In spite of that, capriciously, arbitrarily and unreasonably they refused to take that material into account and that immeasurably strengthened Sri Lankas case before the bar, of world opinion.

So, that is my submission to this august Assembly. I thank you, Mr. Presiding Member for the indulgence that you have given me. I thank the House for the very patient hearing and hope that what I have said will serve to dispel some of the myths which have been repeatedly propagated with regard to this matter.

I thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Maithripala Sirisena) . . , . . . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , ,- [ ]

( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, it was the UNP Government that made the Indian tourists visa-free. It has nothing to do with your Government. We made them visa-free and now you say you are allowing the Indians to come to Sri Lanka. We, the UNP, are the first Government who made Indians visa-free. It has nothing to do with your Government. -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, you may speak now.

[..5.35] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Presiding Member, I thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to add and contribute to this Adjournment Debate and hope that we would be able to take it to a meaningful conclusion.

Firstly, let me start by referring to the Statement made by the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, the Minister of External Affairs. Sometimes, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris warm disposition gets a little turbulent when matters of political nature arises. But,Hon. Minister, your amiable disposition does not need to get upset about matters that are political in nature. Today, we are debating political issues in this House, and matters that you have expressed as the Minister of External Affairs need to get a fitting and tributeful reply when they are out of context. That is what we basically have to talk about at this particular moment.

When the then SLFP Government tried to arrest me for an unwanted reason, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris was the first to visit my house when he was with us in the UNP.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) - [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It may be Mangala, Chandrika or Dilan Perera. - [Interruption.] Yes, maybe. Today, he is the very person who says, what an atrocious act that was. So, these are situations that do arise. They say in politics there are no permanent friends and enemies but there should be a certain sense of decency in the way you go on. So, Hon. Minister, I am sure you will not find it amiss when we take the Minister of External Affairs's action different from the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris action and certainly there are matters that need to go on further.

The Hon. Vijitha Herath brought up a very salient point when he stated that there were certain actions that had gone well beyond the realm of acceptability. Furthermore, my Colleague and Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella ably added on to that particular point saying that certain matters that you have attributed to the Joint Declaration have gone well beyond the acceptable way.

Now, let me take out certain matters that have been mentioned. First of all, you mentioned that this is a Joint Press Statement. If it is a press statement - it is a Joint Declaration - are you saying that the Indian Minister for

631 632

External Affairs accepted that just as a part of a meaningless statement? No. It was a statement that was attributed to a joint discussion which quotes that you as the Minister of External Affairs of Sri Lanka met Dr. Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India as well as Shri Pranab Mukherjee, Finance Minister, Shri S.M Krishna, Minister of External Affairs and Shri Shivshankar Menon, National Security Adviser and Srimathi Nirupama Rao, Foreign Secretary. That certainly cannot end up with a Ministerial Statement just for the press. A Joint Declaration will go down well in history.

Today you talk of the Indo-Lanka Accord. Nobody can turn around and say that that was a statement made to the press. That was done with full responsibility. The mere fact that you are trying to exclude and disclaim responsibility will put the Government and also India into further jeopardy because any statement made in future would be looked at as a piece of junk. You, as the Minister of External Affairs have certain points. The Hon. Vijitha Herath mentioned certain facts that are there in the Statement and he asked certain pertinent questions during his speech. The Statement takes into account a devolution package building upon the Thirteenth Amendment that would contribute towards creating the necessary condition for reconciliation. Now, first of all, the Government must realize whether they are going forward. The President on certain occasions has mentioned, "Thirteen" and "Thirteen Plus". I am sure the Hon. Dilan Perera would share a view, which certainly goes along very much in more proactive terms like what we are thinking. Well, in the same way, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa who almost tried to commit suicide and was saved by an act of the President will think completely different; not "Thirteen Plus", even if you can take "Thirteen" out of the Constitution that will be good. Hon. Minister, when you make this statement, is it made on behalf of the Government or is it just a whimsical statement that is being made to the press? So, there must be some attributes.

Now, when I get up and speak here, I certainly cannot be speaking something frolic on my own. I must be speaking something reflecting my party, unless I specifically exclude it and say so. It is in the same way my Colleague, the Hon, Lakshman Kiriella spoke. When we supported the Hon. Vijitha Herath on his Motion, we very clearly took certain things that are there into account. When you talk of KKS Port, why do you not talk about the Colombo Port? When you talk of Palaly Airport, why do you not talk of the Airports at Katunayake, Weerawila and Hambantota? Those are also airports. Why are you excluding those? Why do you only look at certain areas? That is why it has been qualified by certain matters. We have always been pro-India. We have been very friendly with India. We have been doing things of which you have been accusing us. We are so linked with India that you said we acted like

one of its states. In one way you accuse the United National Party saying that we have pledged our allegiance and support India, and when we mentioned through an Adjournment Motion that there is a specific agenda, you seemed to be very perturbed. You would remember that during our term of office, we ensured that the country boosts forward; we were not living in the Stone Age. We certainly realized that India was a very close friend of ours and we treated her with respect. Even in our short tenure of office during 2001 when the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris was the Minister in charge of discussions with the LTTE, which led to the spin-off effect of the Ceasefire Agreement, we even went to the extent of talking about certain matters like giving the Indian Oil Company certain benefits in Sri Lanka. So, we have never been anti-Indian like you. You all are anti-Indian in the morning - [Interruption.] That is different. That is the JVP; this is the UNP. Where is Wimal Weerawansa who almost set himself on fire at the UN? You said you want a new UN. The Hon.( Prof.) G.L. Peiris in his own statement says under point No. 10 that both countries agreed on the need for reform of the UN Security Council. Now, Ministers act with collective responsibility. He said that there is a necessity for changing the UN Security Council System. So, we accepted that. Then Wimal Weerawansa said, We need to change Ban Ki-moon. We must bring a new Secretary-General". Two weeks ago Ban Ki-Moon's election for office came up and the Hon. Wimal Weerawana could have challenged Ban Ki-moon and said, "This monkey should have gone into the moon and I should replace the Secretary-General". But, there is not even a murmur from him. Then, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris should have said, "We are opposed to Ban-Ki moon. He is the guy who appointed the Darusman Committee. With the Darusman Committee came disrespect to Sri Lanka. So, as a result we do not want Ban Ki-moon. We recommend Wimal Weerawansa to replace the Secretary-General". A big noise is made but nothing done. So, your point Nos. 10 and No. 11 almost self-defeat the action that has been taken by your own Colleague as a Cabinet Minister. What action are you taking about that? Are you saying that that Cabinet Minister just acted whimsically or did that without anybody's blessing? No, it just cannot be the case. He is living today because of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He must be thankful to him. Otherwise, he would have been dead and gone.

The Hon. Vijitha Herath just now very pointedly asked whether the United Nations Security Council needs to have a revisit to see how they should go forward and when it expands the permanent membership, whether India should be a permanent member in that? When we were running a short tenure of office during 2001- 2004, we openly supported the view that India must hold permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council. Even now we say, if there is a way they should be go forward. There is nothing to hide. We have been very clear on that. So, on that particular score, we are very concerned about the statement that was made and

633 634

[ ]

2011 08

how far it goes, because when we signed the Indo-Lanka Accord, it had certain ramifications and those ramifications are still there even as of today.

The very statement the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris was making when I walked into the House was as to why we are getting so perturbed when this is only a statement made to the press. If the Minister of External Affairs says so, when he goes out and comes back next time, not a single guy will think twice of the statements that he makes. He, as the Minister of External Affairs, has a right, has a duty and obligation to make a statement and that should not be only by himself but with the concurrence of the other Colleagues also. So, that is why my Colleague in the Opposition, the Hon. Vijitha Herath, thought best that there should be certain clarifications with which we too certainly agree. As I said, when he makes a statement saying that there is rehabilitation of the Kankesanthurai Harbour, why has he not mentioned about the Port of Colombo when almost 90 per cent of the freight moves out of the Colombo Port, not from Kankesanthurai Harbour? Then, why has he mentioned about the Palaly Airport instead of mentioning the Katunayake Airport? So, there are direct references to those in the Joint Statement.

Then, going on further, you are talking of hospitals, railway stations and the Duraiappah Stadium in Jaffna. When you are getting help from a country, you should get that for the whole country. You do not need to be saying, "I want you to help that part of the country". That is the issue that we are raising. When we signed the Indo-Lanka Accord, it was for the entire country and not just for one part.. Therefore, instead of making direct references, he must say, "Look! India, you can help our country and we will decide where that should go". Now, is there anything wrong in that? This is what my Colleague, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, very pointedly asked. Matters that have got to be answered directly are convoluted and left aside and when those are questioned, you say that those are irrelevant. If those matters are irrelevant, why do you waste our time on such issues and make such a big noise? The irrelevance that is there in governance today is the biggest problem in this country because nobody knows where the Government is heading.

Then, Sir, look at the Joint Press Statement which also talks of the joint working group that comes on CEPA. Now, if CEPA basically had many ramifications, has it been accepted? This is the same Government that got the Minister of External Affairs two years ago to say, "Everything is over; let us go ahead". Then, two Ministers, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa and a Minister from the Jathika Hela Urumaya objected to that and it was stopped in 24 hours. When those Ministers make a noise, the Minister of External Affairs does not respond to such Ministers. We do not know whether it is shouting on one side and cooling on the other side. That is the type of approach the Government is taking forward.

Now, look at certain things that are going on. Yesterday, when the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris was speaking, he was referring to the statement made by the Hon. Tissa Attanayake as the General Secretary of the United National Party. He was asking whether that was the reflection of the party. He further wanted to know the reason as to why the General Secretary is saying something and the United National Party has still not made an official statement on that. I am asking you, Hon. Minister, have you or your Government taken a stand on this? You are talking of appointing a Parliamentary Select Committee and saying that this vexed political problem needs a solution.

When you were saying so, the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella made a statement. There were some people who got up and asked at your own group meeting whether he had got the mandate or the approval of the UPFA and whether he has been given a mandate to say that that is the minimum condition or that is the way you have got to go forward? On that very score, we, as the United National Party, made it very clear and the Government must ensure that they spell their policy forward. They have a two-thirds majority and make a big noise of that. They say that they have the Executive Presidency; they have the Government and they have power on Provincial Councils. So, they have the experience. So, come forward with your policy before you appoint a Parliamentary Select Committee.

I am informed that at the last discussion which was the 8th round of talks with the TNA, the appointment of the Parliamentary Select Committee has been delayed due to certain reasons. You say, We will discuss; we will come upwith something and there must be a time frame. When you say so, again you have the Minister, Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella saying today, We will ensure that we will appoint a Parliamentary Select Committee before too long.

So, at this moment, Mr. Presiding Member, all I want to know is whether the Government is sincere. Is it having a policy forward? Is it basically talking to India telling one thing, talking to the clergy here telling another thing, talking to the Opposition and trying to lure us into a different thing and telling the general public a completely different thing? This is the sense of hypocrisy that the Government continuously persists in maintaining.

When you are talking of certain things in this august Assembly, the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha went on "HARDtalk" three days ago and what did he say? I table* this and I would appreciate if it is included in Hansard.

635 636

* . . Document not tendered.

The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe says that we had zero casualty during the final days of the war. Then, the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha who goes on "HARDtalk" as a Member of Parliament in the present Government and was the Secretary-General of the Peace Secretariat, basically responds to the question that has been put forward by Mr. Stephen Sackur saying, There can be no zero casualty, there would have been 5,000 or less casualty. The mere fact of accepting it as 5,000 completely puts the Government in a reverse gear.

You have His Excellency the President, you have the Hon. Prime Minister, you have Ministers and you have the Secretary of Defence who always say that it is zero casualty and that is the stand that you always maintain. But, if by any chance, this was mentioned by a Member of the Opposition, what would have been the Governments approach? You would have had that MP almost arrested at the arrival and said, These are the people who go overseas and tarnish the name of the Government. Now, what are you going to do with this vociferous MP who has put the entire country into jeopardy? Where is the answer? Is there one statement against that? The Hon. Minister of External Affairs should be the first to be disproving or authorizing this.

The Deputy Minister of External Affairs answered in Parliament today corroborating what the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha said. So, the Government is in further jeopardy. Today, he said that it may not be 5,000 or less; the policy of the Government was definitely zero casualty but there could have been other excesses that took place. So, when the Deputy Minister of External Affiars says so and the Minister of External Affairs who is listening to it also does not disprove, it obviously puts the Government in a completely different picture.

Where was the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe two years and one month ago? He basically went and said, Channel 4 is saying such a thing; we will sue Channel 4 on the basis that they have been character-assassinating the country. We did ask that. We told the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe at that particular moment, Please bring it forward; and we, as the Opposition, will also support you in protecting the integrity of the country. When Channel 4 telecast this two years and four months later, there was not a murmur from the Government. Are you still thinking of taking Channel 4 to courts or not? That is in your hands. It is your bounden duty. If you do not go to court, you are accepting liability. Otherwise, if you go to court, the net result could be damaging or they will be completely exonerated. That is the call on the Government. Why is it not being done? This is the duplicity that takes place in the Government.

These are not Members of the Opposition who have quoted and we are asking you to correct that. That has

been your hobby-horse. You have been always going on that basis. Now, even here, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L Peiris during his winding up speech mentioned: "I need to ensure that the Opposition...." - I will use the words that he mentioned - "abuse", "vituperative language", "conspiracy theory", and said, "this should be nailed once and for and all". Now, what is this that you are talking of? These matters that have been mentioned and what we are arguing at this particular moment, are they matters mentioned by the Opposition or matters mentioned by you? With what you have stated, things have come about and that is the ramification effect. So, Hon. Presiding Member, at this particular moment, I would like to know as to what the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe and the Hon. Rajiva Wijesinhas actions would be.

Then, you mentioned about Mr. Yasushi Akashi who is the Special Envoy of the Japanese Government, a very respected person whom we regularly meet him when he comes to Sri Lanka. He has mentioned during the course of a speech at a Sri Lankan businessmens delegation, that he does not think that the Darusman Report is fair. It is very good and I hope that he really meant that. But, unfortunately, even before 48 hours could pass, the Japanese Government responds and says that it is Mr. Akashis personal statement and had nothing to do with the Government of Japan. Now, that puts the entire matter into a different context. Do not think that we, as the Opposition, are sleeping and do not know what is going on. The Japanese Government responds immediately by saying that this is the personal opinion of Mr. Akashi and nothing to do with the Japanese Government. Now, again, there, I would appreciate if the Government takes necessary action to clarify as to why it was only a personal statement and why the Japanese Government did not corroborate that evidence.

Going on further, Mr. Kevin Rudd, who is the Foreign Minister of Australia says that UN urged to review the Sri Lankan civil war situation and take necessary action. Now, this was the former Prime Minister of Australia, maybe another upcoming Prime Minister, owing to the political problems prevalent in Australia. When he says so, our External Minister even does not make a statement about this. Why is it? Ensure that you challenge it. When Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - I guess at that particular moment - said the right thing, he should have done the right thing by getting the Attorney-Generals Department to take Channel 4 to court. But why is he absent? Is he accepting that the statement is correct? Is he accepting that that telecast is correct? If you do not have a sense of ability to do so, please tell us. We would come along and help you to take Channel 4 to court if you give us the necessary help and evidence. Now, that is what is left. If by chance, as I told you earlier, if this statement was made by an Opposition Member, you would have taken him to task; you would have been discrediting that and playing it every minute trying to

637 638

[ ]

2011 08

show the impact on the Government. So, please remember that just because we are from the Opposition and mention this with a sense of honesty, that does not mean that it is a sense of weakness or a sense of strength. We are saying this as Sri Lankans. This is not your country; this is not our country, but it is our country together.

So, as a result, all of us have a role to play and I am sure that this needs clarification. Just because it comes from the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, it does not mean that it is dictated from heaven. You need to correct it. He is always his masters voice. With Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga from 1994-1999, he said Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was the best. Then, when he left that and joined the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, he said that there was no better person than Ranil Wickremasinghe. Then, when he gets back after a short tenure of office here back to His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, he says that there is no better person than Mahinda Rajapaksa.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) UNP recommends that there is no better person than Hon.Ranil Wickremasighe.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We mentioned that. We do not run with the hare and hunt with the hound, like people who come from out stations and think that they can be whiz-kids. You know, the little UNP was broken when their forefathers were running the place. So, we have the courage of conviction to say that and we believe that we have a leader; we have a party; we have a policy and we have a vision for Sri Lanka. Unlike the Alliance which is a heterogeneous alliance, you do not know what is your left hand is doing, you do not what your left foot is doing, you do not what your right hand is doing and you do not know how your brain is working. That is the - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) That is why 62 per cent of the country voted for us.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, sometimes the majority means that all the fools are on one side. Remember that.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) You are referring to the votes of the 62 per cent of people of the country. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Why you have a Minister, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, who said that people of Colombo ate grass. -[Interruption.] I said that sometimes the majority means that all the fools are on one side. We, as the Opposition, have been very steady in saying, this is the way forward. So, Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, you have just come here today and do not think that you can get matters out of us by just trying to say; "Yes the Government is right". That is wrong. I am telling you this is the problem. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) That is my understanding. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Your understanding is like the way you ran Mihin Air. - [Interruption.] You know how profitable it was. Now, after 9,000 million have gone through, you are saying that it is profitable? Is it - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Do you not remember what I told you once on a TV programme?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, where was the challenge? - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) From the day it was run, you had an objection. It is the policy that - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Are you telling me that the policy adopted by the His Excellency the President is completely wrong? -[Interruption.] There is no policy because what you started is continued by His Excellency the President. So, the policy is dictated by His Excellency the President. - [Interruption.] Are you telling me that the policy of His Excellency the President is wrong? - [Interruption.] Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, this is unfortunately not a part of the Debate today, otherwise I would have taken you to task. - [Interruption.] But, as you contributed -[Interruption.] I am sure, if you have something to say,

639 640

you will take part in the Debate instead of basically getting up and taking my time. - [Interruption.]

Going on further, now look at what the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, one of your National List MPs had to say. What does he say about Channel 4?

I am referring to 2011 26 " " .

:

" , . 2010 . . . - 04 2009 . "

That is why I referred to the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe's statement.

:

" . 2009 . . . . , , , , . , , . , , ."

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only one more minute.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I had half an hour. So, I am referring to a Minister who is basically saying that this is ill-prepared, to respond to the world.

Now, I am quoting the former Cricket Captain, Mr. Kumar Sangakkara. Hon. Presiding Member, I would appreciate if you permit this to be printed fully in Hansard. I am basically tabling* Mr. Kumar Sangakkaras statement to save time. Just give me three minutes, Sir. The Hon. Mohan Lal Grero is not speaking. So, I will utilize his time.

Sir, I quote from Mr. Kumar Sangakkaras statement which appeared in today's "The Island" newspaper. It states, I quote:

We have to aspire to better administration. The administration needs to adopt the same values enshrined by the team over the years: integrity, transparency, commitment and discipline.

Unless the administration is capable of becoming more professional, forward-thinking and transparent then we risk alienating the common man. Indeed, this is already happening. Loyal fans are becoming increasingly disillusioned. This is very dangerous because it is not the administrators or players that sustain the game-it is the cricket-loving public. It is their passion that powers cricket and if they turn their backs on cricket then the whole system will come crashing down.

The solution to this may be the ICC taking a stand to suspend member boards with any direct detrimental political interference and allegations of corruption and mismanagement. This will negate the ability to field representative teams or receive funding and other accompanying benefits from the ICC. But as a Sri Lankan I hope we have the strength to find the answers ourselves.

This is the former cricket captain, a highly respected cricketer - for the first time a professional cricketer. I am saying that when he makes such statements, the Sports Minister did not have the audacity to question him or at least raise the matter and say we should question him as to why he said such a thing.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member could you please wind up? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Give me just another two minutes, Sir. I am asking, is this the sense of a country that democracy has already been buried? These are matters on which he has the right to speak. We must have honoured him for being able to get a time at the Lord's to speak on a matter of Sri Lankan cricket and Sri Lankan future.

In the same way, we basically would like to ask the Government one clear matter. Now, while you were talking about the Joint Declaration which states about the withdrawal of Emergency, you answered that in a half-baked situation but when is it going to really happen? Your Emergency is basically not going to contain terrorism. You do not have democratic acts like the Colombo Municipal Council or the Kotte Municipal Council. You do not want to have such elections. You impose Emergency because you want to bring in legal cases against Mr. Sarath Fonseka, whereas in a normal condition you cannot. If you have a state of Emergency, then you can. If we make a statement in Parliament and go outside and make the same statement, then you can bring us before the CID. That is the reason why you do not want to take the Emergency away.

On the same score, today you find in the Tamil newspapers what India is asking us and we are supportive. Sri Lankans means the Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims, the Burghers, the Malays; everyone of them. We do not say that we are Sinhalese or they are Tamils. We are Sri Lankans and that is the pride we need to have to go forward. That is the way forward to Sri Lanka. They have basically mentioned that certain people have been moved to Jaffna. I am sure it will be of interest to you as well because you are now in the democratic stream and represent that area. People who have been living in IDP camps have been relocated in camps in Vadamarachchi and now they are staying in open-air camps. They have gone from a camp which they have basically been languishing.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. You are taking the time allotted to the Government. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, give me just one minute. Is this the way people in the state of IDPs are transferred to relocated camps? I am sure the Hon. Presiding Member would also like to know from the Government as to what is going on.

Another matter is with regard to people who are in custody. A person who has spoken to "Karuna Amman" was taken into custody at that time. He has been in custody for 22 years to-date, whereas "Karuna Amman" whom he spoke to is a Minister in your Government and the Vice-President of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. That is the statement that you go and sign - Indias Joint Declaration - and you tell us to accept that. This is not a mere press statement. The Indo-Lanka Accord was not a press statement. So, do not disclaim responsibility. I would be the last person to do so. When we were in Government, we pushed for the Indo-Lanka Accord. We pushed for the CEPA to the point where it is. We pushed for the Sri Lanka-India Free Trade Agreement. Those are matters that you do not need to retract just because there is pressure from the Opposition. But, there is one thing that has got to be done. The Government must realize that they must stop running with the hare and hunting with the hounds. If you want to give a political solution, you must have the courage for it. Come out without fear. Ensure saying that this is the way forward. You cannot be saying one thing to India, one thing to Japan, one thing to America and another thing to the Sri Lankan community.

In conclusion, all I could say at this particular moment is, without further distinct, make a statement by saying, "Lead the way forward".

Thank you.

I want to state to you, Hon. Minister, that you are doing a perfect job. You need not be rattled by all these because we know governance is not a matter of applying objective, unchanging rules. Governance is about adjusting to change, to accommodating to power equations, about building coalitions with fellow nations. That is governance, Sir. These are done with the sole objective of benefiting Sri Lanka. There has to be give-and-take policy and compromises, perhaps unsatisfactory in the details, but ensuring the greater good in the long term. This is why we have a Minister of External Affairs. The Sri Lankan Minister of External Affairs has to contend with two realities which restrict their freedom of manoeuvre. One is the small size of Sri Lanka and the second, the geo-political situation Sri Lanka is placed in where powerful nations have become players in the

651 652

Indian Ocean, primarily to safeguard their strategic interests. Our present Minister of External Affairs finds himself holding this post in a particularly trying time. In this context, the Hon. Vijitha Herath has raised foolish questions. He asked as to why the Hon. Minister went to India and on whose invitation he went to India. Those are foolish questions. But, what we must ask the Hon. Minister is, How were you received in India? We know that you were received with a warm welcome. So, to me, Who invited you? and Why you went? are childish questions. The question to be asked is, whether you were welcomed to India. We know that you were not only welcomed to India, but you met the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister, the Foreign Minister and the Foreign Ministry establishment there. The Hon. Minister returned with a commitment from India to safeguard and honour the sovereignty of Sri Lanka. What greater achievement can one expect from our External Affairs Minister? But, instead of acclamation, our Minister of External Affairs is facing brickbats from the JVP and the UNP who are unfamiliar with the intricacies of governance and innocent of the subtleties of international manoeuvre. Ranting and ravening does not get a small country like Sri Lanka anywhere, nor shouting slogans and repeating ideologies.

Let us stand together and face the reality. The last question that I want to address is the most important one. Last, but not least, let me finish with the question of amending the Constitution.
