There was the Tissa Vitarana Report. I saw a statement by the Hon. (Dr.) Rajith Senaratne saying that the Thirteenth Amendment must be implemented in full. So, why do you not go ahead with it and give a political solution? If you do that, I think 80 per cent of your problem will be solved. You know there is a government in exile in",

It is therefore very wrong to jump to the conclusion that this is genuine and the mere fact that it was shown in Geneva is certainly no indication whatsoever that a conclusion can be reached with regard to the genuineness of this material.

But, an Hon. Member of this House - not to mention a Deputy Chairman of the United National Party, the largest Opposition Party in this country - tries to draw a parallel between the situation in Sudan and Sri Lanka and talks of referenda, which may culminate in cessation. I think that is a very clear indication of a distinct danger and the Hon. Members of this House - I do not think the Hon. Members of the Government - who mistakenly making certain assumptions are unwittingly and inadvertently falling into that trap. There is no parallel at all; chalk and cheese - worlds apart!

That is why I say in all sincerity, without any rancour whatsoever, that this is really a matter in respect of which we need to adopt a different approach. The speech that was delivered on the Floor of this House, a few minutes ago by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella is, I think ,very unfortunate because it contains certain features that can be built upon; that can be utilized by people who wish to do real harm to this country. It contains elements which are precisely what those people would like. So, if it is a question of entrapment, then that is the real danger which, I think, we all should guard against.

The real challenge today is to uplift the living conditions of our people and let them live a better life. This country - indeed no country in the world - can formulate an economic philosophy; a strategy for economic action in isolation. We live in an interconnected world. So, our own economic prosperity and well-being is dependent on this sagacity and the perception with which we structure our economic policies in a global and regional contest. Today, the economies of the West are growing by 2.5 per cent a year. The global average - I am sure the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella knows this - is 4.5 per cent. But, countries in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ring area are growing by almost 10 per cent. The economy of India is growing by approximately 8.4 per cent and economy of China is growing at a threshold, which exceeds 9 per cent. So, that is the reality of the situation. However, we have the irony that the bulk of our exports continues to be to the West. Mr. Deputy Speaker, 20 per cent of Sri Lankas exports are to the United States and 39 per cent are to the Western Europe. So, when you add our exports to the United States and to the Western Europe, it is exactly 59 per cent. Does that make sense? Should we not make far greater use of the emerging economies in this part of the world? Is that not the road to prosperity for the Sri Lankan people? It is not a question of succumbing to pressure as the Hon. Vijitha Herath suggested or it is not a question of paying homage or making obeisance to India where lies the path to our own prosperity. Not at all! Whether we like it or not, the reality of the situation is that geography and economy link the destinies of India and Sri Lanka. There is no need to be frightened of it or to be reluctant to say that. We can turn that to our advantage. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella began his speech by saying that in economic relations, countries are governed by self-interest. Of course, that is so. So, let us now serve Sri Lankas self-interest by making use of the potential that this whole region has from massive economic development in the years to come.",

Vijitha Herath that important as history is, because we cannot fully understand the present in isolation of the past, it is perhaps a mistake to delve excessively on the past. Let us rather concentrate on the present and the future. Let us look at last year, 2010. What is the economic reality with regard to Sri Lanka and India? Mr. Deputy Speaker, the position is that India today is Sri Lankas largest trading partner. India is first in terms of Foreign Direct Investment. Among all the countries that are investing in Sri Lanka, India is by far the largest. The largest number of tourists who come into this country come from India. India is the predominant source of tourism in this island. So in all three sectors, Trade, Foreign Direct Investment, and Tourism, India occupies a dominant position in relation to our country. Now, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we are all citizens of Sri Lanka, whatever party we belong to. And, we, therefore, unreservedly subscribe to the sentiment that was so powerfully articulated by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapakse in the Budget Speech which he delivered to this august Assembly on the 22nd of November, 2010. His Excellency the President stated, I quote:",

What is the rational basis for the appointment of such a committee at this time? As we talk to the Tamil parties and as we reach some agreement even of a limited form, surely, to implement that into law, to give that constitutional expression, we have to come to this august Assembly. The executive branch of the Government cannot do it. Do you want us really to go through the entire bilateral process with the Tamil parties and when that is concluded, to come to Parliament? Is that going to take more time or less time? It is that that would be a delaying tactic. So, we want these processors to be concurrent rather than successive. They must take place simultaneously. We are trying to telescope these processors into a single time frame. That will result in a very considerable saving of time and energy. It is, therefore, wrong; it is unreasonable to suggest that Government is trying to buy time as a result of it. It is not a manoeuvre. It is not a tactic. It reflects a genuine resolve to move forward as speedily as possible ensuring that the solution that emerges is just and equitable by all communities and also has the merit of sustainability.",

There is no point in abuse, vituperation and conspiracy theories for their own sake but where the vital interests of this country are concerned, we will certainly speak out loud and clear. We have basically said that the Tamil fishermen, particularly in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka, are beginning to build the foundations of their economic life after decades of deprivation. Is it then right and proper for the Indian fishermen to come and to take away these resources using methods like trawling which inflict very serious damage on the seabed, the ocean floor, the marine resources and fingerlings? Very large numbers of Indian vessels are coming into Sri Lankan territorial waters. We have raised that issue. It is not to score brownie points; it is not to win the plaudits of the multitude but we will intervene in the effective manner, talking to the Government of India and putting in motion, a strategy, a course of action, which will bring us the results which we desire. All of this is possible because of goodwill. Do not forget, bullet-ridden dead bodies of fishermen is a highly-charged matter. It is very emotional on both sides. It is, by its very nature, a very emotional matter. But, we were able to prevent a conflagration. It did not implode in our face. Why was that? Because of the goodwill, the friendship, the understanding between the two Governments and the honest desire to solve problems by negotiation, by talking to each other, by understanding the true nature of the problem and by devising a pragmatic remedy.

That is a side issue. But, definitely if we had not provided that information, the criticism would have been made and quite rightly as the Opposition, you are entitled to say that. You would have said, You were doing all these. The problem is, you did not inform them. If you did not inform them, how do you expect them to know? If they did not know, how can you complain about a Report which excludes the material which would have liked them to take into account? So, my answer to your question is, we did the right and proper thing, the best thing in the interest of this country. We informed them. In spite of that, capriciously, arbitrarily and unreasonably they refused to take that material into account and that immeasurably strengthened Sri Lankas case before the bar, of world opinion.",

You, as the Minister of External Affairs have certain points. The Hon.

The Statement takes into account a devolution package building upon the Thirteenth Amendment that would contribute towards creating the necessary condition for reconciliation. Now, first of all, the Government must realize whether they are going forward. The President on certain occasions has mentioned, \"Thirteen\" and \"Thirteen Plus\". I am sure the Hon. Dilan Perera would share a view, which certainly goes along very much in more proactive terms like what we are thinking. Well, in the same way, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa who almost tried to commit suicide and was saved by an act of the President will think completely different; not \"Thirteen Plus\", even if you can take \"Thirteen\" out of the Constitution that will be good.

In one way you accuse the United National Party saying that we have pledged our allegiance and support India, and when we mentioned through an Adjournment Motion that there is a specific agenda, you seemed to be very perturbed. You would remember that during our term of office, we ensured that the country boosts forward; we were not living in the Stone Age. We certainly realized that India was a very close friend of ours and we treated her with respect. Even in our short tenure of office during 2001 when the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris was the Minister in charge of discussions with the LTTE, which led to the spin-off effect of the Ceasefire Agreement, we even went to the extent of talking about certain matters like giving the Indian Oil Company certain benefits in Sri Lanka. So, we have never been anti-Indian like you. You all are anti-Indian in the morning - [Interruption.] That is different. That is the JVP; this is the UNP. Where is Wimal Weerawansa who almost set himself on fire at the UN? You said you want a new UN. The Hon.( Prof.) G.L. Peiris in his own statement says under point No. 10 that both countries agreed on the need for reform of the UN Security Council. Now, Ministers act with collective responsibility. He said that there is a necessity for changing the UN Security Council System. So, we accepted that. Then Wimal Weerawansa said, We need to change Ban Ki-moon. We must bring a new Secretary-General\". Two weeks ago Ban Ki-Moon's election for office came up and the Hon. Wimal Weerawana could have challenged Ban Ki-moon and said, \"This monkey should have gone into the moon and I should replace the Secretary-General\". But, there is not even a murmur from him. Then, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris should have said, \"We are opposed to Ban-Ki moon. He is the guy who appointed the Darusman Committee. With the Darusman Committee came disrespect to Sri Lanka. So, as a result we do not want Ban Ki-moon. We recommend Wimal Weerawansa to replace the Secretary-General\". A big noise is made but nothing done. So, your point Nos. 10 and No. 11 almost self-defeat the action that has been taken by your own Colleague as a Cabinet Minister. What action are you taking about that? Are you saying that that Cabinet Minister just acted whimsically or did that without anybody's blessing? No, it just cannot be the case. He is living today because of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He must be thankful to him. Otherwise, he would have been dead and gone.",

He, as the Minister of External Affairs, has a right, has a duty and obligation to make a statement and that should not be only by himself but with the concurrence of the other Colleagues also. So, that is why my Colleague in the Opposition, the Hon. Vijitha Herath, thought best that there should be certain clarifications with which we too certainly agree. As I said, when he makes a statement saying that there is rehabilitation of the Kankesanthurai Harbour, why has he not mentioned about the Port of Colombo when almost 90 per cent of the freight moves out of the Colombo Port, not from Kankesanthurai Harbour? Then, why has he mentioned about the Palaly Airport instead of mentioning the Katunayake Airport? So, there are direct references to those in the Joint Statement.",

He has mentioned during the course of a speech at a Sri Lankan businessmens delegation, that he does not think that the Darusman Report is fair. It is very good and I hope that he really meant that. But, unfortunately, even before 48 hours could pass, the Japanese Government responds and says that it is Mr. Akashis personal statement and had nothing to do with the Government of Japan. Now, that puts the entire matter into a different context. Do not think that we, as the Opposition, are sleeping and do not know what is going on. The Japanese Government responds immediately by saying that this is the personal opinion of Mr. Akashi and nothing to do with the Japanese Government. Now, again, there, I would appreciate if the Government takes necessary action to clarify as to why it was only a personal statement and why the Japanese Government did not corroborate that evidence.",

You impose Emergency because you want to bring in legal cases against Mr. Sarath Fonseka, whereas in a normal condition you cannot. If you have a state of Emergency, then you can.

That is the statement that you go and sign - Indias Joint Declaration - and you tell us to accept that. This is not a mere press statement. The Indo-Lanka Accord was not a press statement. So, do not disclaim responsibility. I would be the last person to do so. When we were in Government, we pushed for the Indo-Lanka Accord. We pushed for the CEPA to the point where it is. We pushed for the Sri Lanka-India Free Trade Agreement. Those are matters that you do not need to retract just because there is pressure from the Opposition. But, there is one thing that has got to be done. The Government must realize that they must stop running with the hare and hunting with the hounds. If you want to give a political solution, you must have the courage for it. Come out without fear. Ensure saying that this is the way forward.

You need not be rattled by all these because we know governance is not a matter of applying objective, unchanging rules. Governance is about adjusting to change, to accommodating to power equations, about building coalitions with fellow nations. That is governance, Sir. These are done with the sole objective of benefiting Sri Lanka. There has to be give-and-take policy and compromises, perhaps unsatisfactory in the details, but ensuring the greater good in the long term. This is why we have a Minister of External Affairs. The Sri Lankan Minister of External Affairs has to contend with two realities which restrict their freedom of manoeuvre. One is the small size of Sri Lanka and the second, the geo-political situation Sri Lanka is placed in where powerful nations have become players in the",

In this context, the Hon. Vijitha Herath has raised foolish questions. He asked as to why the Hon. Minister went to India and on whose invitation he went to India. Those are foolish questions. But, what we must ask the Hon. Minister is, How were you received in India? We know that you were received with a warm welcome. So, to me, Who invited you? and Why you went? are childish questions. The question to be asked is, whether you were welcomed to India. We know that you were not only welcomed to India, but you met the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister, the Foreign Minister and the Foreign Ministry establishment there. The Hon. Minister returned with a commitment from India to safeguard and honour the sovereignty of Sri Lanka. What greater achievement can one expect from our External Affairs Minister? But, instead of acclamation, our Minister of External Affairs is facing brickbats from the JVP and the UNP who are unfamiliar with the intricacies of governance and innocent of the subtleties of international manoeuvre. Ranting and ravening does not get a small country like Sri Lanka anywhere, nor shouting slogans and repeating ideologies.",
