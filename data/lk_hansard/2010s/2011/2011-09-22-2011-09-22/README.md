I asked the officials of the American Embassy as to what was going on and what connection the Dole Food Company, the well-known US enterprise which has businesses across the world, has with this. They told me, You know, Dole is unaware of what is happening here. It is a reputed company. It will never do such things. It will never encroach on unauthorized lands, national parks and the like. What they further said was that this could be a deal between a subcontractor and corrupt politicians. I must reiterate here that the United National Party is not against investment in Sri Lanka. If lands need to be given to investors to create wealth or job opportunities in this country, we are not opposed to that. However, there are certain laws in this country that have to be abided by. It does not matter whether it be a local investor or a foreign investor. Laws are laws. So, I want to tell the Americans to look into this matter urgently and if laws are being broken by their subcontractors together with corrupt officials and politicians, to immediately stop that and get back to the way that they are supposed to do business because we can never let Sri Lanka become a banana republic. What is a banana republic? A country becomes a banana republic with poor people, when corrupt politicians and monopolistic private enterprises get together and rape its lands. They rape public resources for private and individual wealth creation. That is what is happening. So, we do not want Sri Lanka to be a banana republic.

I am quoting from Daily Mirror of 20th September, 2011. That is day before yesterday.

It states, I quote:

Economic Development Deputy Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana said yesterday. He accused the main opposition United National Party (UNP) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) of having compelled the government to change its earlier decision to sell the property outright at US$ 94.5 million or at nearly Rs. 10 billion and thus having to forego the direct receipt of foreign exchange."

He further states, I quote:

" 'But due to the stiff protests by the opposition over the outright sale of the property the government has now decided on a 99-year lease at a lesser amount, he said.' "

- - to throw mud at the Government, there are certain elements - anti-Government, anti-national, anti-peace, anti-religious and anti-social - that had broken a religious place; Ziyaram - in Anuradhapura recently. The Government must take appropriate action. The All-Ceylon Jammiyyathul Ulama led by its President, the learned, Ash-Sheik M.I.M. Rizvi Mufti and also the Sri Lanka Muslim Council Chairman - our good friend N.M. Ameen, with a delegation met Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in this regard and I am very happy that he has promptly taken steps to inquire into this incident.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Why only one minute? I have not spoken even for - ( ) (The Presiding Member) Only five minutes were allotted to you. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Give me some more time from the other speakers because most of them are not here to speak.

He has said that he will take steps. He has told the BBC - "The Island" has reported it in the first page - that appropriate action will be taken. So, the Government must be very careful of these anti-Government elements. This is happening with the election in Colombo? In order to divert the attention, bankrupt UNP politicians are making use of these types of things. I must tell you that it is the JVP and the UNP that is behind this destruction. Here, the "Vidivelli" newspaper is with me. " :

. A senior journalist in our country, Mr. Latheef Farook has issued a nice statement. He has written a letter to "The Sunday Times" of 11th September, 2011 under the caption Why this sinister hate-Muslim campaign now? He states in that, I quote:

Judging by the numerous malicious articles that appear in the print media it looks as if the Zionists have infiltrated certain section of the local media also. Muslim countries, especially those in the Middle East, look to Sri Lanka with warmth and

friendship. In response to Sri Lankas steadfast support to the Palestinian cause, some of these countries provided economic assistance and came to our rescue during difficult times especially during the recent war against the LTTE and at various

international fora, including the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council.

Out of 194, most of the countries, except perhaps may be America and Israel, will be moving to give statehood to the Palestine. So, I wish to ask in this House, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Leader of the Opposition as to why he has not spoken a single word in support of the Palestinian cause. On the contrary, for the last 30 years,

our President has espoused their cause, and today, he is meeting all the world leaders in the UN and all the countries are bringing a motion to give UN membership to Palestine. Our Government is supporting, all the Arab, African, Latin American governments are supporting this move. I want to ask the UNP Leader whether he would support this proposal. Let him go and tell the Muslims in Colombo Municipal Council area; let him tell the Muslims in Galle, Matale and Matara. But, the UNP will not do that because we know very well that they are the Zionists agents.

Furthermore, I must say that there are - " . " . , . , , - , , , . The President made a categorical statement, Not a single Muslim or another will be sent away from the Colombo City.

Then, there was also a problem about the Muslim males wearing the skull-caps when taking photographs for their national identity cards. That was also solved by this great man, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. " " first page , .

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I will be taking two minutes extra from the other speakers.

Then, Sir, today all these anti-elements are busy arousing communal discord. - ... 18.09.2011 . . , .
