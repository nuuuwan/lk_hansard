(b) A Bank Guarantee to pay the balance US$ 86 mn on or before 21st April 2011 will be given on or before the 28th February 2011.

Here, you have given the last date of the payment, before you brought it to Parliament. So, the deal is sealed. - [Interruption.] You do not take the payment and then place it before Parliament.

P. Kandiah, MP for Point Pedro, was critical of the Federal Party for refusing to support the Bill. His comments have great relevance, for it focuses on the issue, that people have many problems unrelated to ethnicity, that when unresolved, contribute to economic difficulties exacerbating the ethnic tensions.

There are differences between the Tamil-speaking people and the Sinhalese-speaking people, but on the question of the right of the tenant to his land and to his share of his produce, there are no differences between the Tamils and the Sinhalese.

CHEC SIGNED THE CONTRACT FOR HAMBANTOTA PORT PHASE II PROJECT IN SRI LANKA

CHEC has now formally signed the EPC contract on Sri Lankan Hambantota Port Development Phase II Project with Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA). The value of the contract is around $810 million, with construction duration of 36 months.

More details are given here. I quote further:

The project mainly includes four 100,000DWT container berths, one 100,000-ton oil wharf, two 30,000-ton branch line berths, harbour basin of 490,000m2 to be shared by Phase II and Phase III projects, one offshore man-made island, roads and yards of 400,000m2 and so on.

I would like to table* this MoU only because the Deputy Minister made an incorrect statement in the House either without his knowledge or he was uttering an untruth. You can determine whichever, and therefore, I would like to correct that situation by tabling this in the House.

Now, I would like to proceed with my speech talking about a few other matters. . , BOI , . , . . , . , . . , BOI . , , .

The purpose for which it was acquired being solely to serve the public purpose...... I am sorry, this is not about that, this is about the other land that was sold. There were two land cases. One was the John Keells case and the other was the Waters Edge case. The instrumental thing that I am trying to point out is that even the court was sensitive to the sale of lands. That is what I am basically bringing to the notice of this House. It states:

The purpose for which it was acquired being solely to serve a public purpose, was to serve the needs of the general public as distinct from the elites requirements or a relatively small segment of society in Sri Lanka. It further states:

The enactment of laws to allow for such land acquisition was only done because of a legislative belief that private ownership in Sri Lanka is the subject to the paramount, essential and greater need to serve the general public, a significant segment who lack even basic living amenities like running water, electricity and housing.

In this context, Parliament should be wary of ratifying a project which rests on murky land transactions.

Finally, I would like to speak a few words about investment in general. We know that it is two years since the military conflict ended. But, even though the military conflict ended two years ago, we see that foreign investment, whether it is FDI or Portfolio Investment, is basically only trickling into the country. In the year 2009, we had about US Dollars 600 million of Foreign Direct Investment. In the year 2010, we had about US Dollars 500 million of Foreign Direct Investment. This year, the number is higher and we are waiting to know the exact number but we have to disaggregate that Foreign Direct Investment from the sale of assets. We have to compare like with like; mangoes with mangoes. That is the only way we will really understand if we are actually attracting increasing numbers of Foreign Direct Investment. We know that the world presently is going into another crisis. In the first part of 2011, from January to June, Foreign Direct Investment in the world increased. In 2010, it was US Dollars 1.24 trillion but it was projected to be US Dollars 1.6 trillion. In the first six months of the year, it did well and it was about 30 per cent. But, suddenly it is falling off because of the European crisis and a new banking crisis being developed in the Western world. So, we know that we are going into a difficult environment. The first thing to have fallen off in this environment is basically the greenfield projects and in the last quarter, two-thirds of all greenfield projects in the world came to less developed countries like ours. Those have rapidly fallen off. So, we are in a difficult situation.

However, India, in the first quarter of 2010, attracted US Dollars 12.3 billion and it went up to US Dollars 17.8 billion in the same quarter of this year. South Africa went from US Dollars 600 million - something like ours - to US Dollars 2.5 billion this year in that quarter. China increased from US Dollars 10 billion to US Dollars 61 billion. Russia went from US Dollars 4 billion to 23.4 billion Dollars and Brazil, is the same. We know that Sri Lanka has got a small incremental amount of Foreign Direct Investment. We have to disaggregate it for the sale of lands to find out whether there is actually an increase. But, if you look at Portfolio Investment, you will see that there is a net outflow in investments coming in and investments going out because of sales and also of profits and dividends. There was a net outflow in 2009 of about US Dollars 160 million or Rupees 17 billion. In the year 2010, there was an outflow of nearly US Dollars 250 million or Rupees 26 billion. So, if you look at the net amount of foreign investment coming into the country, in 2009, it is about US Dollars 350 million and in 2010, it is about US Dollars 250 million and it will be interesting to see what the figure is going to be in 2011 because there is a net outflow of Portfolio Investment that is going basically out of the country.

( ) (The Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) , .

So, obviously the country has a problem. It is not only in Foreign Direct Investment but even in Portfolio Investment. If you examine what is happening in the Stock Market, Sri Lankans are buying shares. We are all for it. But, we need to understand that that is a dangerous argument because even the Appropriation Bill that has been presented to Parliament for 2012 shows that there are expenditures of about Rs. 2,200 billion while the income is about half of it. There is a big gap. That gap has to be serviced, as a Government Member said today, by attracting foreign investment. So, when we see that the Government funds are being used to purchase stocks in the share market, there is a problem because you have crowded out some foreign investment that can come into the market. The biggest problem is that Government institutions are buying shares beyond the economic value of those shares. Therefore, there is reason to believe that there may be some investigation needed. The Governor of the Central Bank today says EPF is well managed, not corrupt. I am very glad to hear that from the Governor of the Central Bank and I shall certainly frame this and keep it for the future. We need to be careful; the high prices are dangerous.

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) , . . ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) , . ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) . The high prices which are not market-driven are dangerous. Insider trading is a crime and therefore we know that the largest hedge fund manager has been sent to prison. Insider trading is a crime but if people are using EPF funds in the process of that trading, it is even a bigger crime than insider trading because EPF belongs to the common people of this country, to the average worker of the country. Insider trading in other countries have depended on their private funds. But, this is about public funds and therefore we need to be careful. We need to remember that we should

586 587

not allow this to happen. Remember this. Even in the future, those who abuse the EPF will be punished if they are found guilty because these are public funds of the country. It may look distant but we should make no mistake; not only blue-collar crime but white-collar crime will also be punished.

Thank you.

I have this book with me, titled Dossier Corea: A Portfolio on Crime. It was well-written by a famous and popular columnist, a crime writer, Firoze Sameer. The whole tragic story is documented in this book very well. This is a fastest-selling publication throughout the world. It is in the website also. You can go to it and read it.

Sir, we fully realize that there is peace. We know that we have won the whole country. The whole world knows that we have won our country. His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa has won the country and won the hearts of the whole world. See the progress that we are making!

I must thank the Hon. Shantha Bandara, MP for spotlighting these issues before the House today in order to enlighten the nation. It was only yesterday so many water supply schemes were declared opened by His Excellency the President in the North. Now, our Friends from the North say that nothing has been done over there. But, the amount of projects inaugurated in the North yesterday was amazing and that has never happened before in this countrys history. 995 , 956 , 575 , 250 , 202 . . " " first page . In today's "Daily News", there is a very impressive and an attractive photograph. Under that photograph, what does it say? It states, I quote:

President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday inaugurated the Batticaloa-Vavunathivu water supply scheme. Here the President unveils the commemorative plaque to open the pump house and administrative building. Eastern Province Governor Rear Admiral

At left, the aerial view of the pump-house is also published.

The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Minister of Water Supply and Drainage has done a gigantic task. He is providing water not only to the people in the South, but to the people of the North also. The second largest water supply project has been inaugurated in the North yesterday. Now, the Tamil MPs come here and say:

In the world scene, Colonel Muammar Al Gaddafi, the Leader of Libya had been arrested by the foreign armed forces. We do not know his fate. We, as Muslims pray to

for his safety and for the country because these counties are self-governing countries. Their sovereignty and independence must be recognized. Now, that is not happening as far as the Superpowers are concerned. Tomorrow is Friday and according to our calendar, it is a holiday for the Muslims for the week. All the Muslims in this country and all over the world will also pray for the safety of this great leader and also for the great country called Libya. It is not only

Libya, it is not only the other Arab countries like Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Afghanistan but also other countries. Nobody can come and conquer our country however much powerful they are, as if it is their own business and nobody elses business. Who gave them that right? Has God given the right to any Superpower on earth in order to conquer another country? So, we must be very cautious and aware of these things. We know there are Members of the Opposition - there is not a single UNP Member present today - who go right round the world spreading rumours about Sri Lanka. They want Sri Lanka to be subjugated by foreign powers again. As long as His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa is at the helm of affairs of this country and as long as loyal and brave people live in this country, we shall not allow such a thing to happen.

Now, the Hon. Shantha Bandara spoke about the stability. We have won all the Local Governments Elections. In Colombo too, it is a win for us. In 2002, the UNP polled 136,854 votes and in 2011, it polled only 101,920 votes. Their vote base has been eroded. In 2002, the UNP won 32 seats and now in 2011, it won only 24 seats. In 2002, the UNP has received 57.83 per cent of the vote and this time, it received only 43 per cent of the vote.

But, we are glad to note there is a silver line in everything. The "Engal Thesam" -" " - newspaper of October 15-31, 2011 reports, I quote :

" , ... . ... . ... , , ."

. But, Mr. A.J.M. Muzammil, the Mayor elect has publicly told - there is a lengthy interview in the Dinamina, I do not want to read the whole thing; I do not have time - that he appreciates the Urban Development schemes launched by Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and he says he will co-operate with him. Earlier, during the election time, the UNP said that they would build 65,000 new housing units in Colombo. When the Dinamina reporter asked Mayor Muzammil: Will you build 65,000 new housing units?, he said, Ask that from Sajith Premadasa. This is the way that party has disintegrated now. Therefore, I once again thank the Hon. Shantha Bandara for bringing this Adjournment Motion today and all what he said will be brought by me to the notice of the Minister concerned.

Thank you very much.
