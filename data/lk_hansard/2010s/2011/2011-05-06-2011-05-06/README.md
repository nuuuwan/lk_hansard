[. . 3.00]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I move the following Motion:

" . , ."

Sir, I would place the English and the Sinhalese versions of this Motion, so that it will be included in the Hansard because the people of the three communities, especially in the Eastern Province - the students, a large number of sportsmen could read and understand this.

" ."

"That this Parliament resolves that the Santhenkerny Public Playground be developed in all aspects as an International Sports Ground with a view to providing advanced facilities for the youth of Digamadulla District to improve their skills and ability in the various aspects of sports".

Now, this is a Motion, Sir, that I mentioned and spoke about when I was in Parliament last time. I was supported by the Hon. M.M.M. Musthaffa and the Hon. A.M. Abdul Majeed of Pottuvil who were in the House at that time.

Sir, this Santhenkerny Public Playground in the heart of Kalmunai had been in-existence for the benefit of

sports activities of youth of this region for a very long time. But today, Sir, this Government under the "Mahinda Chintana", - I must first of all read that in Tamil, "Mahinda Chintana"-

-Mahinda Chintana" not only deals with the economic development of this country but also the onward march of this country in every field of activity. It also has a Chapter devoted for the development of sports in the Island. The Tamil translation of the "Mahinda Chintana" at 76 states, I quote:

" , . , . , . , ."

The "Mahinda Chintana" in order to build up a developed society - both physical and mental development, states that it is a good investment for the entire country. That is what the "Mahinda Chintana" very clearly states. Then, Sir, there are other paragraphs that elaborate this subject - I do not want to read the whole thing for want of time.

Coming back to this Santhenkerny Playground, it was there for a long time, as I told you. It has to be developed because the Government is spending large sums of money for the development of sports, as I quoted from the "Mahinda Chintana". The Eastern Province is also a very important factor to be recognized in this respect. In the Eastern Province, for quite some time there had been a great keenness shown in every field of sports activity - cricket, football, volleyball, badminton and even in indoor stadium activities such as gymnastic and athletics. The Government is spending large sums of money for the development of sports in this country and also to build an international grounds in Jaffna. The President himself has declared: "As much as I would develop Hambantota, I will develop the North and East as well." Now, Sir, Hambantota, has one of the attractive and magnificent international cricket stadia at Sooriyawewa, the last that has been built in this planet. He developed that and also developed the Pallekele Stadium in Kandy. Now, in the Pallekele Stadium, Sir, there is a pavilion for Muttiah Muralitharan. They also would like to have a pavilion in the name of Lakshman Kiriella, I am told. We have no objection, because he, as the Minister of Sports at that time would have played a key role in developing the Pallekele Stadium preserving the environment eco of that area.

Now, for the Santhenkerny Ground, they require about 200 metres of area. If 200 metres ground is built, it will be good for school activities. What we need is a four-hundred metre playground that will be of international standard, like we have in Colombo - the

485 486

2011 06

Sugathadasa Stadium. Then, the youths can come up, develop their sports and they can be very fine sportsmen winning Gold, Silver and Bronze medals for Sri Lanka by competing with international sportsmen and sportswomen in Commonwealth Games and other international competitions.

Sir, I know about this person, Mr. A.M. Reyaz. He is the President of Victorious Sports Club in Kalmunai and also the Chairman of the Sports Development Committee in Kalmunai, which is affiliated and functions under the aegis of the Cricket Board in Colombo. There are 14 teams playing in this area. Mr. A.M. Reyaz is also the Treasurer of the Cricket Association in the Ampara District and also a member of the newly-created Municipal Council of Kalmunai of which the first Mayor was our Friend, the Hon. H.M.M. Harees. Today, we have as Mayor, my erstwhile friend, former Senator Alhaj S.Z.M. Mashoor Moulana, who succeeded the Hon. H.M.M. Harees. Mayor Mashoor Moulana is doing great service for the people of his birth place. I wish him well in this House.

Sir, there are several football clubs in the area. The youths in the East must be provided an opportunity to show their prowess. There are three football teams in that area: Sunny Moon, Brilliant and Lucky Star. They take part in all island premier B division games. They were also at one time national champions. There was also a " " held recently for them. The "Brilliant" team defeated a powerful football team from Negombo. See the skill of the youth in the Eastern Province! That is why this Motion of mine takes centre stage today as far as sportsmen and sportswomen of the Eastern Province are concerned.

Sir, there are another two gentlemen: Mr. M.M. Jesmin, the Chairman of the Holyfield Sports Club and Dr. S.L. Riyas, the Secretary to that Sports Club. They were pioneers from Eastern Province who came to Colombo and had an award ceremony at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall. That goes down in history. Both of them together wrote a finebook in Tamil, named,

," where details of all the cricketers of the world and all the test playing countries are documented in Tamil for the first time. Sir, I would like to table it.

I would like to quote what our veteran cricketer and a senior commentator - I also had the privilege of associating with him in the commentary box in test matches and ODIs played in Sri Lanka and elsewhere - Mr. Ranjith Fernando, former Sri Lankan Cricket Team Manager, wicket-keeper, batsman and international Cricket commentator has penned this message for this book, which was published in 2001.

I quote:

Cricket is almost a religion amongst Sri Lankans and its one thing that binds all Sri Lankan together. Reading materials on Cricket in Tamil has to grow more and more to carry the message of the game to all corners of Sri Lanka. I am very happy that Mr. S.L. Riyas together with M.M. Jesmin have embarked on such a venture. I have known these two young men for some time and know that they have a real love for the game and with efforts from people like them the game will no doubt flourish. My congratulation to them and best wishes

This is the way such a great Cricketer of Sri Lanka views the standard of cricket and other sports in the Eastern Province.

Then, Sir, - Santhenkerny Public Playground - in Kalmunai Town can be developed to be an international stadium, not only for Cricket, as I told you, for Football and Volleyball. Even they should have a good pavilion built. They should have an indoor game stadium to boost every kind of sports in this area. This venue can be developed very well. All the youths from Pulmoddai up to Pottuvil can come here. Not only that, even from Monaragala District the youths can come and converge at this playground. It is a centre place and if you improve sports in the Kalmunai region, that will be a focal point for all of the other activities - among three communities living in the three districts of the Eastern Province and also sportsmen and sportswomen and other people coming from all the way down from the Monaragala District et cetera. They also play 'A' division football. They have won so many matches. In Marathamune, there are three main sports clubs: "Gold Mine Sports Club", "Eastern Youth Sports Club" and "Olympic Sports Club". In Sainthamaruthu, there is a club called "Flying Horse Sports Club" in the home town of the Hon. H.M.M. Harees. He can tell us all these facts in detail.

Now, Sir, the late Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff, the founder of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, I am happy to state today, took a keen interest regarding Santhenkerny Ground. He laid a foundation-stone for development; he said this should be named as " " - United Ground or United Stadium. I would also like to state that three Ministers laid foundation-stones to raise Santhenkerny as an international stadium. One was the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, a good Friend of mine, who is the Minister of Higher Education. We can get his assistance and even funds from his Ministry. There was the Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff, the founder of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and also a former Minister, the Hon. A.R. Munsoor, who laid foundation-stones to give a real facelift to this ground. Therefore, Sir, I would commend this Motion before the House and the House would agree with the sentiments that I have expressed.

Before I would conclude, I hail and pay the highest tribute of this House to our National Cricket Team for winning the runners-up at the World Cup in India and

487 488

bringing laurels to us. The Captain, Kumar Sangakkara and the Vice-Captain, Mahela Jayawardene have done their best for cricket in Sri Lanka and we express our gratitude to them. Also, the name of Muttiah Muralitharan - no man or woman ever can forget his name. Not only in Sri Lanka but all over the world his name is sung and sung over and over again. This legend is hailed internationally as our greatest cricketer and also as a great patriot who loves his motherland dearly. He is number one in the ODI area and in Test Cricket in the world.

Thank you. [.. 3.14] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. H.M.M. Harees) .

Deputy Chairman of Committees, to use a cricket jargon, when I started as the "opening batsman", I did not think my other players would overtake my score and it was left to one of the foremost batsmen in this country, the Hon. J.R.P. Sooriyapperuma, to use cricket jargon again, to play as the "last man", but it was such a classic and a fluent innings to watch.

That is why I said that he always says, speaking about this country, " ". ? " . ." . . " , ." ? " , . , , , ." , , . , , . . . . . - - - , - , ", " . , ", " . , " " . . . 5, 10 . . , .

Coming back to Cricket, in Kalmunai, I should also mention that there is the Zahira College, a premier college where they were playing on matting and winning matches. There was a lady Principal called Mrs. S.H.M.M.A. Cader, who developed Cricket in that College. Then, we cannot forget the Vipulananda Central College in Karaithivu. Then, in Sainthamaruthu, there is a Central College and also the Wesley College in Kalmunai. The players of all these colleges had the potential to become national players of this country. That is why I am focusing this Motion to the Hon. Mahindananda Alugthgamage, the Minister of Sports.

497 498

2011 06

Although he is not here today, I am happy and I must also pay tribute to him because, under his patronage and guidance, Sri Lanka won the World Cup runners-up. Furthermore, he has presented the bid book to be submitted to the Commonwealth Sports Conference seeking host status of the 2018 Commonwealth Games for Sri Lanka to our worthy President Mahinda Rajapaksa at Temple Trees on 04th May 2011. We wish him good luck. In this world, if there is one President who is deeply involved and much interested in developing cricket and other sports like rugby, he is, .

- - . . . ? ! !, ! !. - . ! ! . , ...... '' (Crick-et) .... ! , .. .. . , " " *.

. . . - - .

As a distinguished old boy of Colombo Zahira College, the Hon. Abdul Majeed had the distinction of leading the first Sri Lankan National Rugby Team that toured overseas. So, his services will always be available to help this project. Then, Sir, in this country, the first Indoor Cricket was started by the late Mr. B.J.H. Bahar - the senior and junior Bahar of Zahira fame. It was later, the Hon. Gamini Dissanayake who started an indoor stadium at the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka at Maitland Crescent. I must also make mention of the Moors Sports Club. I must also pay my appreciation in this House to the Moors Sports Club of which I am a Senior Vice-President - which has been promoted to the Premier League and they will be playing top level Cricket from the next season. Therefore, all the players who are for some reason or other who left the Moors Sports Club in search of green pastures elsewhere will start to return home.

As you know, the Hon. J.R.P.Sooriyapperuma, many great students have played in the past under great teachers like Dr. T.B. Jayah and Dr. A.M.A. Azeez of Zahira College. Not only that, in playing cricket, as he said, we, the Buddhist brotherhood and the Islamic brotherhood became very close to each other and thrived well at Zahira and Ananda grounds. It was Mr. P. De S. Kularatna, the Principal of Ananda College at that time and Dr. T.B. Jayah with his classic traditional "Sonko" Malay cap used to sit together and watch matches, Zahira versus Ananda. I am also reminded of an interesting thing, which was narrated to me by my closest and dear friend, the late Mr. T.A. Jayah the worthy son of Dr. T.B. Jayah, who is now no more with us and may Allah bless his soul! He told us that at one inter-collegiate game between Ananda and Zahira, Ananda College won by one run. There was a commotion at Zahira grounds. Then, both the Principals, Mr. Kularatne and Dr. Jayah together decided to have a repeat match. What do Mr. Chairman and the other Hon. Members, particularly the Hon. Sooriyapperuma, who is seated across think about it? Finally, Zahira College won by one run! That has been the closeness between both these colleges. We always consider Ananda College as our very good opponent in the playing field. There are, of course, the other colleges like Nalanda College, St. Peters College and of course, St. Joseph College, St. Benedicts, Royal and St.Thomas' with whom Zahira had regular fixtures. At one time, as I remember, one of our cricketers, I think it was Ghouse, whacked a huge sixer that flew above the Church of St. Joseph College.

. . - - . . ... , , . - . . - board . Once again, I must read the Motion in English, because all must read this in English and should understand well what I intend from this Motion:-

"That this Parliament resolves that the Santhenkerny Public Playground be developed in all aspects as an International Sports Ground with a view to providing advanced facilities for the youth of Digamadulla District to improve their skills and ability in the various aspects of sports".

While asking to develop the Santhenkerny Public Playground, I would also ask the Minister of Sports to develop Marathamune Mashoor Moulana Playground. There is also a pavilion in my name because I gave funds, not from my pocket, but from the Decentralized Budget, and they have named it A.H.M. Azwer Pavilion. That area has produced talented footballers and other sportsmen. They have won National Championships. Therefore, develop that area too. All in all, I am very happy today, for the first time after our cricketers brought honour to country after snatching the Runners-up Cup in India and carried aloft our national flag very high in the international arena, that I am able to move the first Motion on sports in this House. We must also pay our compliment and good wishes to Tillakaratne Dilshan alias Tuan Mohammed Dilshan. We wish him well, Sir, on behalf of the entire House.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

That is relevant. The prisoners make good handicrafts and souvenir items. They could be sold to the children through the souvenir shop when they visit to see

Parliament. Of course, they will not be "imprisoned", they will be free to buy those souvenirs and go home freely.

Sir, the Hon. Minister and his predecessor, the Hon. DEW Gunasekara took the correct decision in reforming the prison system and steps have been taken to move out the prisons from very populated areas. Now, the Magazine Prison is in the heart of a town - Borella, and the city has now vastly developed. The Bogambara Prison is also like that. Even the Jaffna Prison is in the heart of the town. You wanted a lot of improvements, Sir, to be done to the Jaffna Prison and also to Batticaloa Prison. That is good. In other countries, the prison environment is farther away from the bustling towns.

Now, there is a new concept of reforming the prisoners. I happened to go almost for the last 50 years to the Mahara Prison and also to the Welikada Prison annually during the month of Ramazan to make arrangements during that period for the inmates there to observe the Ramazan Fast. We, of the All-Ceylon Muslim League always cater to their religious needs. Tharaveeh prayers are also conducted there for 30 days. There is a Buddhist Shrine and also a Church inside the Mahara Prison walls. I remember the Archbishop Cardinal Thomas Cooray used to visit there at that time. We also go there frequently. There is a real religious awakening among the prisoners. They are no more considered as a discarded lot from the society, they are a part of the society very much.

I just mentioned to the Hon.Chandrasiri Gajadeera that the Mahara Prison is sometimes stinking. Since foreigners too visit there from time to time, I think some improvements have to be made to keep the prison premises clean. There is, I know, a pilot project to improve that prison further because it is a very old building.

There is also a Malay Mosque outside the prison wall. The Malays around Mahara, Kadawatha and Ragama and from other surrounding areas come to this Mosque for Friday Prayers. They are also of great assistance to the prison authorities. Sometimes, there are certain problems faced by the community to go to the Mosque when Jummah Prayers are conducted on Fridays. I hope the Hon. Minister would step in and ease those problems. Mr. Tuan Mahmoor, our Welfare Officer knows all details. At one time, Mr. Rumy Marzook was the Commissioner-General of Prisons. Today, Major General V.R. De Silva is functioning as the Commissioner-General of Prisons and is doing a good job of work. In the Magazine Prison, Mr. Marzook cleaned up the Buddhist Shrine; also the church and the mosque. It has separate dormitories for prisoners to stay. They are all kept very clean and tidy. So, good thing have been done by Mr. Marzook and now by Mr. De Silva. I only hope there would not be any outside contacts with the inmates and no messages transmitted form the prison to outside

and from outside to the prison. All activities of prison regularization have to be done in keeping with the security of the country in mind.

I also, at this moment, recollect the names of great leaders who went to jail. Among them were the worthy father of our Chief Government Whip - who is walking out now - Mr. Philip Gunawardena, his brother and my political guru, Mr. Robert Gunawardena. They were all imprisoned not for any crime committed but, for fighting for the nation, for independence. They are all political prisoners. Shri Jawaharlal Nehru went to prison, Mahatma Gandhi went to prison and the Right Hon. D.S. Senanayake, Dr. N.M. Perera, Dr. Colvin R. de Silva, Seyed Alavi Mowlana and others of Freedom Movement too went to prison. All our liberation fighters went to prison during the Colonial era. While mentioning the name of the Right Hon. D.S. Senanayake, I am reminded of some unsavoury things spoken of him by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. .. . . - - . ? area , . grandfathers farmers . . ? .

[. . 5.07] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Presiding Member, I wish to second the Private Members Motion proposed by the Hon. Buddhika Pathirana, the young Member of Parliament from Matara, who has taken a keen interest in a social problem in our country.

The handicapped or mentally retarded children, as he said, are today called children who need special attention or special children. Today, we are moving towards a better life for these children. Normally, in the past, somebody who had a physical defect or was mentally retarded was condemned to be sidelined. They were kept away from social life. They were kept in the house, looked after, given the physical needs but they were not prepared to face a life of their own. But today, it has become necessary for us, as far as possible, to provide these children with a life of their own. When such a child grows up and does not have parents to look after him after their death, he cannot depend on other family members. He cannot become a burden to his kith and kin. So, he has to learn a trade or launch into some sort of income-generating vocation. Hence, my Colleague has proposed that vocational training opportunities should be provided to those who have defects that they cannot overcome and because of that they are different from the rest of the community. They are children of special needs. So, they have to be provided with those facilities by the State and I feel that the State has a duty to provide these facilities.

We are having vocational training centres under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Skills Development, the Vocational Training Authority, the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission and other institutions which are providing vocational training for normal persons. We also have schools for special children or schools for the deaf and blind where they are trained mainly in learning a language, learning number skills and learning methods for enhancing their knowledge for reading Braille, for speech therapy and such things but none of these institutions provides vocational training opportunities. Generally, in Sri Lanka, people go through the schooling system and they want to get into jobs. They rarely realize that a vocational training would launch them into a useful vocation that can sustain them throughout their life. Any skill that you gain takes you forward in your attempt to find a job or to launch into a vocation. So, the learning of the skill is done through the vocational training centres all over the country but none of these vocational training centres has special facilities for special children. For instance, somebody with a physical debility would not be able to do the same thing that a normal person can do. Therefore, the vocation that they can get involved in has to be first identified and those Centres should give priority to the special child and

523 524

provide facilities for those children to be trained in vocations that suit them, vocations that they can indulge in as a means of living.

The State recognizes that a child who is handicapped needs a special treatment. For a child who cannot look after himself or herself, the parents pension could always be transferred to that child and that child could receive the pension till his death, and not until that child is a major. This recognition comes from the responsibility that the State takes towards maintaining a child who has not been born normal or who has been rendered abnormal. So, under these circumstances, the State having recognized this need, I think, should also recognize the need to provide special vocational training for them.

Fortunately, the Vocational Training Authoritys Annual Report for 2008 was on my table and I was going through it. In it, I saw that only 86,000 persons were counselled in the need for vocational training in the year 2008. With a population of 20 million and nearly 600,000 sitting for the GCE O/L examination, if we have reached totally 86,000 people which include teachers, children and parents, all put together, that means we have not reached a fair share of the population that needs vocational training. Hence, I believe that counselling has to improve. Otherwise, as I said, students get out of school and expect to get jobs without any particular skill in themselves.

This is even more pronounced in the case of a handicapped child. As I said, they have special needs and their capacity is only to do certain limited vocations. Therefore special institutions providing them with training facilities is an essential thing and I feel the proposal of my Colleague, the Hon. Buddhika Pathirana, is very timely and the attention of the Government is needed in this regard. Thank you.

Sir, this been a contributory pension system. This was started at the beginning and later on, so many additions were made and some people were taken in at the age of 59 years. They contributed only for one year but continued to get the pension. This led to the deterioration of the fund at the beginning that was siphoned off from the Treasury. So, it has been depleted and we have to think about a new system and a new Bill has to be introduced to accommodate all the requests that have been made under this system.
