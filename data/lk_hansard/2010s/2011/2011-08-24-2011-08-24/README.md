Sir, the Standing Order No. 29(2) states, I quote:

"A question must not be made the pretext for a debate"

Sir, he is doing this from the day he came to this House. He violates the Standing Orders all the time. Therefore, Sir, as you stated to another Member the other day, there must be a special class held in order to educate him on how to ask questions, like in the House of Commons.

Thank you.

[3.20 p.m.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. We welcome this proposal to increase the subsidy given for replanting of tea. The Hon. Minister and the Hon. Member who spoke before me mentioned in this House that 68 per cent of the tea is being produced by smallholders. This has come about mainly because of this subsidy that has been extended to the smallholders. It has been very useful and it has helped to increase the yield in the smallholder sector. That is why the production from the smallholders is twice the quantity produced by the RPCs and the State plantations though the acreage cultivated by them is smaller than the acreage cultivated by the RPCs and the State plantation companies. The smallholders are producing as much as 2,300 kilos per hectare whereas the RPC-managed companies are producing 1,200 kilos per hectare. The reason that this RPCs are not coming up to the level of the smallholder is because they have not indulged in any replanting for the 19 years that they have been holding these estates. The plantation companies were brought in because the State found that it will not be able to invest in these plantations any further and they were sustaining losses at that time. So, to reduce the losses the Government decided to privatize the estates. At that time, the late Hon. Savumyamoorthy Thondaman, though a trade union leader, supported privatization because he felt the need for more investment in the plantations. However, the RPCs have not invested in these estates but they are only taking the profits of these estates.

Yesterday, my Colleague, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, questioned the Minister about the recent wage increase and its impact on the estates. The plantation companies are trying to make out that they are running at a loss because of this wage increase. I am glad that the Hon. Minister of Plantation Industries yesterday stood by the unions and said that the wage increase was necessary under the Collective Agreement and that was due to the workers and that nobody should grumble about it, but ways and means should be found to overcome the losses of the plantation companies. The plantation companies are complaining that the productivity in their estates is low. But, I do not accept this claim by the plantation companies because in 1992 when the RPCs took over the management of these estates, the number of workers in these 21 companies was 430,000. They have now reduced that to 220,000. However, the total production from the plantation companies has increased by 25 per cent during these 19 years. That means, 25 per cent more is produced by 50 per cent of the workers who were employed in 1992. So, the worker productivity has more than doubled whereas the production in the estates has increased by 25 per cent and they cannot complain about the workers not being productive. The productivity is lacking because the big

companies have not invested in replanting like the smallholders. We all know that the life of a tea plant to yield the maximum is about 50 years. Many of the tea plants in the estates owned by the RPCs are about 100 years old. These companies were expected to replant so that they also could have increased the yield to 2,300 kilos per hectare. If they had increased the yield to 2,300 kilos, the cost of production per kilo would have been much less than now and they would have been able to have good profits. When the estate is productive, the workers have never refused to bring out the yield. There are norms set on estates. In the upcountry, it is between 16 to 18 kilos per day per worker, but in the South where replanting has been done and there is green leaf to pluck, the production is as much as 22 to 24 kilos per day per worker and they have never grumbled to do that because the leaves are available to pluck. So, under these circumstances, the companies painting a story of their being almost compelled to increase wages and having to face losses, is untenable. The Ministry of Plantation Industries should understand this. The companies which were given a 53-year lease on the understanding that they would invest and develop these estates should come forward today to invest, improve and get profits and not just to maintain the estates and make profits.

After all, each of these estates or RPCs was sold to the present owners for a mere Rs. 100 million. Today, you cannot buy 100 acres for Rs. 100 million whereas they got as much as 6,000 to 8,000 hectares or 15,000 to 20,000 acres for a mere Rs. 100 million. The expectation of the Government then was that they would each invest up to maybe Rs. 1 billion at that time, so that the yield could have been increased and the estates could have been sustained. I am sure everyone would understand that as much as the sustainability of the estate is important, the sustenance of the workers on the estates is also important. With inflation eating into the living standards of the workers, it is necessary to increase the wages every two years as per the Collective Agreement. In 2007, there was a wage increase of 40 per cent negotiated by the trade unions. In 2009 again, the wage increase that was negotiated came up to 42 per cent. However, in 2011, we were able to obtain only a 27 per cent increase in wages.

Hence, there is no reason for the companies to complain about the increase in wages. Taking the sustenance of the people in the plantations into consideration, the poverty index was calculated in 1992, which year coincides with the privatization of the plantations and it was calculated at 22 per cent in 1992. However, 10 years later, in 2002, the poverty index in the plantations was estimated at 32 per cent. So, since the plantation companies took over the estates, the poverty in the plantations had increased by as much as 10 per cent.

However, there is another aspect that we have to look into. In 2007, the poverty index continued to be 32 per cent and in 2009, suddenly the Department of Census and Statistics announced that poverty had dropped to 9 per

741 742

cent. If the poverty index can drop from 32 per cent to 9 per cent within two years, there should have been an economic revolution in the plantation industry and in the lives of the plantation people. But, we did not see it. So, how are we to believe the statistics put out by the Department of Census and Statistics? This is the question that arises. Hence, I believe that the plantation workers are not getting their dues.

The increase in wages will definitely increase the cost of production. But, the prices of tea have been improving continuously and the price of Sri Lanka tea or Ceylon tea is unique compared to other competitive countries. The price of Ceylon tea in 2010 was US Dollars 3.25 and it has increased to US Dollars 3.48 in 2011. So, prices have increased by as much as 7 per cent in dollar terms. Unfortunately, in rupee terms, however, it has increased by only one rupee: from Rs. 370 in 2010 to Rs. 371 in 2011. Generally, the plantation industry compares the cost of production and prices in South India with that of Sri Lanka. The price of tea in the Cochin Auctions in 2011 is US Dollars 1.84 and in 2010 it was US Dollars 1.67, whereas at the Colombo Auctions, the price is US Dollars 3.48 in 2011 and US Dollars 3.25 in 2010. When you compare these two, the price of tea sold in the Colombo Auctions is almost double than that of South India, which is a comparable tea producing area.

So, under these circumstances, the companies complaining that they are unable to sustain the estates by increasing wages is not acceptable to the industry or to the workers in the industry. The companies themselves are aware that they have to replant to get a better yield because as I said, if the age of a tea plantation is over 50 years, to sustain the industry at least 2 per cent of the acreage must be replanted each year. But, the average replanting during the last 19 years of the companies taking over is in the region of 0.2 per cent which is far below the expected area that should be replanted and it is against the expectation of the Government when it gave these estates on lease to these companies. So, they too have to do their part; without only exploiting what is available on the estates, they must do replanting.

Out of the 21 companies, there are two companies which are showing large profits. One is the Malwatte Valley Plantations PLC and the other is Watawala Plantations Limited. How are they able to show a large profit? It is because they have invested in their estates during the past few years and they are getting higher yields and bigger profits and they are entitled to that. There are other companies owned by some people who only play in the share market; whether the industry is running well or the plantations are doing well is not important to them. They only watch the indices in the stock exchange and feel satisfied when their share values are going up. For them, it is another investment and not a

commitment to an industry that is important to this country. So, if we are to sustain the tea industry, it is important that these companies become more responsible and invest more to make money and not expect to just make money by exploiting what has been given to them at a throwaway price. In 1992, when these estates were given to these companies, they were sold at a mere Rs. 100 million, I was told. So, for them, today, making Rs. 200 million or in that range is quite a lucrative profit. So, they should not be complaining about giving higher wages to workers, but must do their part to improve the estates.

The Hon. Minister spoke about fallow lands within the estates.

He also said that they were doing a survey and it is between 15,000 to 20,000 hectares. Hon. Minister, it was told in this House by the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, I believe, that the extent is around 65,000 hectares and not 20,000. As the Hon. Member who spoke before me, the Hon. Ranjith De Zoysa said, the companies are not disclosing the real acreage available, unutilized or uncultivated. So, we have to do a strict survey and there is more than 65,000 hectares.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Can I make a clarification? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) We have sent teams to every estate. There were teams sent from the Ministry of Plantation Industries, all graduates, and they have gone to every estate and personally looked at the lands and it is those statistics that I brought before the House today. The 65,000 hectares that was mentioned earlier may have been also the smallholder extents and Government lands identified as being available. But, I can tell you that as far as the RPCs are concerned, there are 23 RPCs; we have now a full report and I will be presenting it to His Excellency the President in a day or two. It is approximately 15,000 to 20,000 hectares. And, I also want to tell you that - I am sorry for taking your time but I think it is important that you know this - as a result of His Excellency the President making the announcement last year when he presented the Budget that he is giving six months for these RPCs to cultivate uncultivated lands, nearly 6,000 hectares have already been cultivated. That was also a very advantageous position that we derived as a result of this announcement but certainly it is around 15,000 to 20,000 hectares.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I do welcome the fact that you have sent graduates to look into it. It maybe that they have been taken for conducted-tours in the estates and have not been shown all the fallow lands. I think that aspect also has to be looked into. Further, whatever land that is there, Hon. Minister, you said that those will be cultivated with vegetables or some other plants. I request that it should not be done that way. If it is a rubber estate, cultivate only rubber, if it is a tea estate cultivate only tea so that the whole estate remains a plantation for the future. Otherwise, people who cultivate vegetables would do it for two seasons or three seasons and then they may abandon it or convert it into a housing land. But, if it is tea or rubber, once planted, for 50 years they could take yield and they would not attempt to abandon or convert it for any other purpose. So, it is important that it should be tea or rubber and nothing else.

Further, when I spoke in this House during the debate following the Budget Speech of His Excellency the President, I mentioned this issue. The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Minister of Economic Development was in the House and he was commenting on the speech that I was making. I spoke about the subsidy at that time and said that they were paying only two and a half per cent of the total cost. I also said, I am very glad that you are here to listen to this so that you will do something about it because you are the only person in this Government who understands matters and works". "There are other Ministers too," he said. Then, I said, "No, I have not seen a single Minister except you". He further said that if the tea plantation companies do not cultivate the fallow lands that they hold now which is 65,000 hectares, he will take over them and give them to the smallholders. Sir, 65,000 hectares is going to work out to about 170,000 acres. There are enough workers in the estates who have the experience and capacity to replant them. I said, "Give these lands to those workers to replant because 80 per cent of cost for replanting goes for labour. They have it and they can put it free. Then the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa said, That is what His Excellency the President told. The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa stated in this House that these lands would be given to those estate workers who live within the estate and who can look after these plots. They can replant and they can be given an acre each. As I said earlier, the cost of replanting today is about Rs. 800,000. Out of this, the companies say, Rs. 600,000 goes as labour cost and it is only Rs. 200,000 left for inputs such as the plants and the fertilizer. Rs. 600,000 is available with the worker, the labour, he is willing to invest it free. If he can be given a loan of Rs. 100,000 per acre - that is out of the subsidy of Rs. 250,000 you are extending - that will subsidize half the cost of other goods. If he can be given a loan of Rs. 100,000, he can replant his one-acre land. He has the knowledge and the love for the plantations. His sustenance is dependent on the sustainability of the plantations.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you time is up. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Okay. So, the best thing would be to give the land to the worker in the estate. If you bring outsiders who are tea smallholders, you are also creating a social problem in the estate. Therefore, I would request the Hon. Minister to accept what the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa said, that the President wanted to give it to the plantation workers. Follow that and give these lands to the plantation workers so that they will be able to look after these estates, replant and grow the tea. Thereby, they will also be able to contribute to the economy of this country while looking after and sustaining themselves.
