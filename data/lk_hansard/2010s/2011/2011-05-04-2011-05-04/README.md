( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, I think using our arguments here will be a sense of defence for you because when we went to Court that time, that was to show that this was an ultra vires act. If by chance the Government realized that we did this in good faith and allowed us to go forward, today you would not have been in this predicament. That is the problem.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) I will tell you as to what happened. There were two petitions before the Supreme Court.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, there were five.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) Yes, more than two: mainly, one petition was filed by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake and a Buddhist Priest and another petition was filed by another leading businessman; and there were so many petitions. But unfortunately, the price of petrol was pointed out as an issue. That was what happened actually. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, because even my friend, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, appeared and vociferously fought on behalf of the State at that time. Today, luckily he is with us but at that particular moment, the insanity of the Government - ? , . . . ? . ..

I would like to speak a few words in English because of the technicality of the subject. The economic definition of "hedging" itself is a "method of reducing the risk of

loss caused by price fluctuation". It consists of the purchase or sale of equal quantities of the same or very similar commodities, simultaneously in two different markets with the expectation that a future change in price in one market will be offset by an opposite change in the other market. It is a little confusing. But basically, hedging in short is an economic instrument. It is used around the world. So, it is a technical instrument that can be used for your advantage.

Now, if you take Sri Lanka by using hedging as an instrument, what is our situation? We have three foreign banks in the international courts. We have two local banks watching the situation. The Citibank has gone for arbitration proceedings in Singapore in November last year and apparently they have been awarded payment through arbitration . The Standard Chartered Bank is in the process of litigation in London. The Deutsche Bank has also appealed to the International Centre for Investment Disputes in Singapore and litigation is going on. The total probable liability to the State would be somewhere in the region of US Dollars 300 million. The breakdown would be - Standard Chartered Bank US Dollars 103 million or Rs. 11 billion; Citibank US Dollars 94 million or Rs. 10 billion; the Deutsche Bank around US Dollars 64 million or Rs. 7 billion. Now, if you look at this, the Arbitration Panel in Singapore has directed - what we heard - the Sri Lankan Government to pay a staggering US Dollars 94 million which I think has still not been conveyed to the Hon. Minister or the Government. [Interruption.] That is right.

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation started hedging operations around February, 2007. I am bringing out an argument to say who is responsible for this and why. The hedging instrument that was carried out ran into problems in 2008. In between 2007 and 2008, for a good period of over one year, roughly about 40 hedging trades were done by the CPC with these five banks that we are speaking about. So, hedging trading went on 40 times. , , " . . ." . . They know what is happening. Forty transactions have taken place.

Now, hedging conceptually is a financial instrument, but it has to be a calculated risk when you do it and it must be undertaken with utmost financial discipline and you have to know when you should get in and get out. That is a basic thing. In the same period of time, if you take in that period of time that the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation went into a Hedging Agreement, LIOC also went into hedging agreements with certain banks and LIOC also lost money. They did not gain. In the end, they were net losers. But, LIOC paid up. They limited their exposures. They tactfully disciplined; they got out at the right time; limited their exposures and they paid what they had to pay to the banks. They honoured their debts.

Now, if things went badly wrong for the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the Central Bank, then it was definitely due to a lack of trader discipline. By saying that you know there are so many methods of hedging and that it does not work, there is no excuse because I would like to tell the Hon. Minister - he was not the Minister at that time - but as one thing, it should be emphasized that there is no foolproof technique of profiting from hedging or option trading. No matter what exotic jargon consultants may use, there is nothing even if you use a zero cost collar hedging et cetera, there are mighty tension funds and huge hedging funds that have gone bust. That is the reality. It is an economic instrument that you must know how to use. So, if this Government did not know how to use the instrument, then they should have not even gone for it. That is basically the argument.

So, in this case, the CPC and the Central Bank very well knew what they were going into. They should have had the knowledge and the background to handle it. They should have had trader discipline and there is something called "Risk Management Mechanism" which in Sinhala is called " ". Risk Management Mechanism should have been put in place. Then, this hedging should have worked perfectly. We would have known how to get out.

Now, any hedging expert will explain the mark to market techniques where intense monitoring has to be done on how your position and value fluctuates and the Central Bank and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation should have marked what is known as a "loss-taking" limit. You give a limit and say, at this point you move out we do not go below a loss below that point, then you are safe because you can afford to pay that loss. There is nothing called only making profits in business. You have to make losses. If you cannot honour the losses, then you should not be in the game.

So, the hedging structure that was developed was approved by the Central Bank, was approved and ratified by the Cabinet of Sri Lanka and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation went ahead. I will give you substantial evidence for that. In 2007, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation up to 2008, did 40 trades through the hedging contract and with oil prices rising above the 120 dollar limit, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation gained around US Dollars 50. They made a profit of US Dollars 50 million. At that time, the hedging instrument was not condemned by the Government or by the Central Bank or by the monetary authorities or by the Finance Ministry. In the latter part of 2008, oil prices began to tumble worldwide and when it hit US Dollars 90 a barrel, then the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation had an option, when oil prices were tumbling down because they had a hedging agreement, they had an option to see the mark to market losses and to quit. The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation could have easily quit. What would have happened if they quit? 2008

We would have been quits. We made US Dollars 50 million, we lost US Dollars 50 million and we could have gone home clean. Why did we not do it? Who is responsible? Now, we are stuck with US Dollars 350 million. Who is answerable for this? It is not the people of this country. You should not ask the people of this country to pay. 2008 .

, . . "Lanka Business Online" of 12th July, 2007 states, I quote:

De Mel says he is calling the central bank and the treasury for a meeting to discuss the possibility of hedging greater volumes of petroleum products and using other derivatives such as futures......

Then he further says:

I think in hedging there should be a policy by the government. I do not think it's fair for one person to be given the entire burden of decision "

This is what Ashntha de Mel has said.

So, I am asking the Treasury Secretary and the Central Bank to come and discuss the possibility and they cannot wash their hands off in this case because they are quoted in this as being part of the whole thing. So, basically, I think the Central Bank kicked its own goal in this case and messed up this and made the country pay because this is Rs. 28 billion. Rupees 28 billion is three years Samurdhi payment. That is about US Dollars 350 million. The Colombo Port Breakwater could have been done without any foreign loans. This is the magnitude of the amount of money that is going because of the mistake made on the part of the Government.

I do not know how much the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation is to blame. But, this went above the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation because the orders went from somewhere else. , . . . " " article . . But, it is relevant to this argument. - . . A person who was given a prison sentence has been appointed as a Government representative to the Board of Directors of the Commercial Bank. How can that be done? The Central bank has to approve it.

Here, I have the Banking (Amendment) Act, No. 2 of 2005. What does it say? There are many Sections in it. Under Section 16, it states, I quote:

Section 42 of the principal enactment is hereby repealed and the following new section is substituted .

Under Section 16 (2) (d), it states, I quote: that such person has not been convicted by any Court in Sri Lanka or abroad in respect of a crime committed in connection with financial management or of any offence involving moral turpitude;

So, when the Central Bank does not take concern in these situations, when they allow these kinds of activities to go on and the Government appoints somebody, who has been sentenced to prison, to the Board of Directors of the Bank, how can you expect accountability and transparency in that sector? We lost US Dollars 350 million on actions such as these. So, who takes the blame? I tell you, the Government should take the blame, not anybody else. There is no point pointing fingers at these banks.

The Hon. Minister had given an interview to "The Sunday Times" and said, We are not going to pay a cent, it is true; it is your job to defend the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the country, and he has said that there has been something going wrong.

But, let me tell you another thing. These are three major banks. Hedging is an international trade practice. If we get into a contract, we have to honour the contract. We took US Dollars 50 million off that Bank. When we make money, we honour the bank and when we lose money, we do not honour it. This is going to be more adverse than Ban Ki-moons Report. Despite the fact that the war is over, do you know that Sri Lanka does not attract enough investment and do you know why? The Deutsche Bank represents Germany, the Citibank represents USA and the Standard Chartered Bank represents the United Kingdom. Those are three big countries. Do you know what kind of report they give to their investors when their investors come in? The Embassy gives a clear report regarding the investment climate of Sri Lanka stating, We cannot recommend it. One of the reasons cited is that we have not kept our commitment on the hedging deal.

So, this is a very serious thing. This is more than politics between two parties or two sides. This is a national issue for our country. As much as Ban Ki-moons Report is harming us, this hedging contract is harming us in terms of investment. I suggest that it should not be limited to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris is coming. I think he spoke about Ban Ki-moons Report yesterday. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, there is no "Ban Ki-moons Report". I think you are mentioning about the Advisory Panels Report. ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim)I am sorry. I call it, the "Ban Ki-moons Report. But, our commitment on the part of that Hedging Agreement is that, if you do not act like gentlemen, - look at the legality of it and respond accordingly - it will hurt us as much as that Report because we have an Agreement.

Countries have gone in and lost money, but if we have an agreement, we have to honour it.

Hon. Minister, before I wind up, I would also like to ask you one thing. The Standard Chartered Bank was charged by the Central Bank for exchange control violations and a fine of Rs. 27 billion was imposed upon them.

I do not know whether you can clarify that, but there is a rumour that the Government is negotiating with the Standard Chartered Bank and that if the Standard Chartered Bank withdraws the litigation it has regarding hedging against the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, then the Government will also waive the fine that they have imposed. If that is the case, that cannot be allowed because that amounts to a kind of bribery; because, if they have violated exchange rate regulations, then they have to be charged - [Interruption.] - I know. I do not think that you can answer me at this point but this is something that has to be clarified in this House. So, what I have tried to say here is, "Do not look at it in the eyes of banks". Hedging is an economic instrument that is used around the world. Pension funds have lost money; hedge funds have lost money; governments have lost money. But, you if have a contract, you have to honour it. If the Central Bank says that they were not aware of the contents, then it is very strange because Ashantha de Mel, very clearly says that he has at all times informed the Central Bank and worked with the Central Bank. So, Hon. Minister, you have a responsibility to put this right.

Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne, please. You have 13 minutes. [. . 4.20]

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today on this Debate on the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the related oil hedge, I just want to focus - with the few

237 238

[ ]

2011 04

minutes I have - on the question of an exercise of power without responsibility. As we know, this oil hedge has been executed sometime ago and the question arises in the decision-making process whether power entrusted has been exercised properly. The magnitude of the loss on the oil hedge cannot still be determined and various newspaper reports state various figures from US Dollars 250 million to US Dollars 500 million, 800 million or whatever it is. Presently, there are both arbitration and legal cases and issues that are coming out of it and I am not going to comment on the magnitude of it or on the transaction per se but I want to make some comments basically on how the decision-making process has actually happened regarding this oil hedge.

Now, as we know, these losses are huge losses, the numbers that are being mentioned. Particularly, when we look at it in the light of the Budget and also in the light of the increase if you want, that the Finance Minister referred to on the 22nd of November in presenting the Budget, when he said "Mr. Speaker, I gave serious thought to salary-related issues of Public servants. An increase of Rs. 100 per month for salaries and pensions will cost Rs. 1.9 billion annually. As such wage increases are not easy and in this background I propose to grant a 5 per cent increase as a non-pensionable allowance to all Public servants and security forces". I repeated that just to show the magnitude of the loss. Now, as we know, when you enter into a hedge, it is basically a contingent liability that you are assuming and it appears that until it became apparent that a loss was crystallizing that neither the Petroleum Corporation or this Parliament knew exactly the magnitude of the risk that had been undertaken. We went for a zero cost collar option. The attraction of a zero cost collar option was probably the fact that there were no upfront fees, and therefore it was attractive. I think if that was the reason, it is a very, very poor reason. As you know, when you enter into an option, whether it is on the buying side or on the selling side, the price difference between the option price and the market price is what it will have to be settled for. So, if somebody is actually selling you a zero cost collar option, then in that situation obviously they are going to adjust the price so that you do not have to pay the upfront fee. So, inherently the contract that was signed was going to be disadvantageous to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and to the Government. That was going to happen obviously. And, also in this option you see that the bottom side was not protected and if the price was to fall there was an unlimited, incalculable liability that was to be expected. Therefore, it was anyway bad for the country and for the Government. We see here that some banks such as the Citibank, the Deutsche Bank, the Standard Chartered Bank, the Commercial Bank and the Peoples Bank entered into these contracts. They limited their exposures while the Government had an unlimited, undefined exposure. So, there are two sets of questions that we can ask. One set of questions relates to the Government and the other set of questions that we can ask will relate to the banks that were involved. We know that

there has been a rapid increase in the oil prices during that period. The oil prices went up dramatically; the cost to the country went up dramatically from US Dollars 789 million in the year 2002 to US Dollars 2.1 billion in the year 2006. Therefore, there was a necessity for hedging, for legitimate hedging using financial instruments, whether they were options, swaps or futures. But, none of these instruments could be used without the required expertise and the frameworks in place. So, there are two sets of questions I would like to ask: one set is whether there was negligence on the part of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, the buyer of the oil price hedge and whether adequate preparation and expertise to undertake the hedge was there. If the hedge was undertaken with the approval of the CPC Board, then we have to hold them responsible. But, if the hedge was approved because there was pressure on the CPC Board by other actors and institutional players in Government, then this House needs to be aware as to who actually put that pressure on the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation to make this decision. Was it an informed decision? The oil hedge eventually impacts every citizen of this country because of the magnitude of the loss that could incur. Who takes responsibility for this? We know that the banks also had a role in it. We know the CPC must have signed the ISDA - the International Swap Dealers Association Agreement. It is necessary to investigate whether the banks also sold a product here to people who probably did not quite understand what they were purchasing. Therefore, there is a responsibility on the banks as well in what they are actually selling. Therefore, it is important that an investigation is conducted to find out actually who is responsible because this is a loss to the general public of this country, and somebody has to be responsible. Buyer be aware, is not a very relevant principle in such complicated transactions.

Therefore, if the Government is of the view that this has been sold in bad faith or there has been a misrepresentation of information, then they must conduct an investigation and find out who is at fault. Also, I must emphasize the fact that in September, 2006 the Central Bank advised the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, basically on the desirability of hedging. A study group which involved the Central Bank was also involved in this transaction. The Peoples Bank entered into a contract with the CPC; the CPC was a buyer. So, we see the People's Bank also involved in the contract. Then, we see an advisory committee including members of the Central Bank involved with the Central Bank as the regulator. This contract is inherently bad because on all sides of the transaction, you see an involvement of some Government entity and naturally such bad governance; the Government through different agencies as buyer, seller, adviser and regulator in such a controversial transaction. Many conflicts of interest, poor management and poor governance are the results. The public who are supposed to be sovereign have to be told as to who is responsible, considering the huge economic impact. The people have delegated their power and therefore have a

239 240

moral right to full transparent disclosures to the process involved.

No disciplinary proceedings have been conducted to my knowledge and anyone in Government has not basically explained what is going to happen to the poor taxpayer's money, which he pays from everything he buys. In November 2008, the Supreme Court suspended the banks under the oil hedge contract. In January 2009, the court terminated or vacated all the interim orders earlier issued in connection with the hedging contracts. The Governments decision to breach international commercial agreements is possibly the first time it has been done by the Sri Lankan Government in May 2009.

It must be mentioned that the Permanent Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption commenced an investigation. It is nearly two years since then, Sir. But, we still have not had the outcome of any progress on that investigation. The matter needs to be investigated in depth and if the investigation reveals fraud or negligent conduct on the part of those who were responsible for the transaction, they must be named and shamed and dealt with according to the law. Not only persons who signed the contract but also those who were responsible in advising and pushing the parties concerned to sign these contracts, fiduciaries, must be held accountable for any breach of trust or negligence. It is only then that the innocent parties will be able to establish their bona fides. Above all, the doctrine of public trust demands that whether or not power was abused or misused or properly exercised, the sovereign people be given a proper explanation as to what actually transpired and the manner in which their trustees exercised their power. After all, it is the peoples sovereignty, which was supposedly exercised by their trustees in the process of this hedging contract.

Thank you. [. . 4.32] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on this Adjournment Motion. This is an important issue that the country has been facing for quite sometime now. As we know, in the latter part of 2008, the hedging agreements that have been entered into by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation came into sharp focus with the then Minister initially defending the hedging deal as it were, defending it saying that the country stood to benefit by this wagering contract. It is in fact, a wagering contract as the Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka described.

It was a contract of chance. Yet, when one looks at those figures and trends, it becomes clear that really there was no chance for the country to benefit even at the time the contracts were entered into. The chances were heavily weighted towards the banks, and therefore, it is no wonder that the banks were keen to sell those instruments - the Hon. Minister was pleased to call them "instruments" - that were very cleverly designed to have only one winner. There was no way in which the country could have benefited even by the trends if one was able to observe the price fluctuations. Even if the price went up, it was bound to come down.

There were cases filed in the Supreme Court; much has been spoken about that. I want to focus on certain subsequent events after those cases. But, it is also necessary to briefly refer to those cases because it was crystal clear when the matter came up before the Supreme Court that these contracts were entered into without due authority. There were allegations made against the officials including the then Chairman who was removed from his post by a Supreme Court order. There were allegations made in the petition that several officials were treated abroad by the banks that stood to benefit through this contract; not just free trips and stay abroad, but various other means that could demonstrate that they were bound in some way or another to do the bidding of the banks.

Prima facie, there was a case and an interim order was given suspending the operation of these contracts and the country breathed a sigh of relief. Otherwise, this huge colossal loss that was staring in the face of the country could never have been avoided because we were duty bound to honour these commercial contracts that we had entered into. Of course, that was the only way to avoid it and legitimately also, it is so. The Supreme Court exercising the powers that it has, as the custodian of the people's rights, made that interim order clearly on legal grounds that this contract was entered into without due authority - ultra vires - and could not be enforced.

But, what happened thereafter baffles everybody. Having done that, a detailed analysis was gone into with regard to the then prevailing world fuel prices. The then Secretary to the Treasury personally presented himself in court, engaged in an exercise in which all parties agreed that the price ought to be a particular price depending on the grade of petrol, diesel and so on. Provision was given for a profit margin for the CPC as well.

The Supreme Court had taken cognizance of this entire matter in the public interest. Legitimately, the Supreme Court stated that the public also must have some immediate benefit as a result of avoiding these payments on the hedging contracts because the prices were being raised on the basis of the Government's obligations to make these payments. When that did not materialize or when that could have been avoided, surely, apart from the

241 242

[ ]

2011 04

profits the CPC was making, the public also had a right to benefit from the drop in prices. That was discussed, agreed upon, a formula was adopted and a suggestion was made with regard to different price levels for different grades of fuel. But, sadly what happened was, the Executive

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

immediately took umbrage. The Executive

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

took the view, "Well, this is not the function of court. We must rule the country. It is not for the court to determine the price of fuel". Simplistically, that maybe true. But, this was no simple issue. This was a complicated international commercial contract, which had been demonstrated to be ultra vires and fraudulently entered into. Other than a court of law, there could not be a pronouncement as such and there was no other way of avoiding that contract and in fact, it was a fraudulent contract. But, the Executive

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

decided that this does not look good for the Executive,

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

"The court somehow seems to have become the champion of the people or how can we let that happen? Surely, we are the politicians, we have to go before the people. We have to demonstrate that we are the ones who are in charge - "

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Azwer.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, there is no point of Order. This is the Hon. Azwer, not a point of Order.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) This is not a court of law. This is Parliament. You must listen when a point of Order is being raised.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, being a clever lawyer, he should know that he cannot cast aspersions on the Executive.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, that is not a point of Order. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is casting aspersions and innuendos on the Executive which should be expunged or as a true lawyer, he must withdraw that. That is all. You must understand the Parliamentary practice and if you do not know, ask from the Hon. Sampanthan.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I have not referred to the conduct of His Excellency the President. - [Interruption.] Please cite one Standing Order that I have breached. - [Interruption.] That is for you to understand. If you understood, please be seated. -[Interruption.] That is why you are being told to sit down. Now sit down. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) This is not a court of law. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Now you sit down. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You sit down.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You sit down. I am on my feet. - [Interruption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Who the hell [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

are you to tell me to sit down?

243 244

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is unparliamentary language. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, do not disturb. If the Hon. Sumanthiran has spoken anything against the Standing Orders, that will be expunged. Please sit down.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) What needs to be expunged are the unparliamentary words that were used by the Hon. Member now. -[Interruption.] Sir, the Standing Orders only prevent me from discussing the conduct of the President or the conduct of a Judge. I have done neither. So, I have not breached any Standing Order. Those who are paid to do this will do this. - [Interruption.] But, please do not take any notice of that. This is what one has to expect when one person is paid in the House to do this. This will happen. So, that person has to be expunged and removed, not what I say.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I was on the issue - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please sit down. Hon. Sumanthiran, you have only one more minute.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) He has taken five minutes of my time. - [Interruption.] He could not cite even one Standing Order. The point is that, after having tried to show the public, Well, courts do not have any function in this regard; we are the ones who rule the country, now the country has to pay a huge price for this. Not only do we have to eventually pay what is due under the contracts, we have already paid colossal sums for lawyers at these arbitrations. I hope the Hon. Minister will place before the House the sums of money in Sterling Pounds that have already been paid for the arbitrator nominated by the Government and the foreign lawyers who have been engaged in this. That is, comparable sums to the sums that we anyway have to pay under the Hedging Agreement. So, all in all, the country has to bear a great cost just for the Executives notion that they should not allow the court to be seen as a saviour of the people.

Thank you very much.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is violating the Standing Orders. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I have not violated one Standing Order. - [Interruption.] No. Hon. Azwer does not seem to understand at all. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please sit down. The next speaker is the Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha. [. . 4.46]
