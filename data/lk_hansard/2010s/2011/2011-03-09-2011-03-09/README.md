( )

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, I must first thank you for taking up the Matter of Privilege raised by the TNA Member, Hon. S. Shritharan on the attack made to him while he was coming to Parliament from Kilinochchi.

I would like to point out two or three matters before I discuss the other issues: firstly, the need to have some additional protection for the TNA Members. I think they have only two security personnel attached to them and you have to take steps to ensure that the security given to them is increased. The Hon. Shritharan has been very outspoken in regard to many issues and even in Kilinochchi, he had problems both with civil officials as well as security personnel. Who did this and what the reason was, we do not know. But, nevertheless, his security and the security of some of the other TNA Members have to be looked into. I raised this issue, Mr. Speaker, because there must be a fixed date by which we know the outcome of the inquiry. Three Tamil Members of the last Parliament have already been killed; two from the TNA and one from the UNP.

( ) (An Hon. Member) It was three Members from the TNA.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Yes, three Members from the TNA and one from the UNP, being the Hon. T. Maheswaran. There has been no outcome of these investigations. They are still inquiring. I mean, you do not require so much of inquiries. I know that the TNA itself has some information regarding the killings of their Members. It is useless the police saying, We are going to inquire". There must be a cut-off date by which we know what has happened and what steps they have taken. Then, we can bring it up in the House if we are not satisfied. Otherwise, we will have another one or two more Members of this House being killed.

So, in short, where is the peace dividend that is expected? The Tamils, the Muslims and the majority of Sinhalese are still living in terror. Even though terrorism has been eradicated, political terrorism has not been eradicated. It has just raised its head.

Before I speak further on this, I would like to say that the Hon. S. Shritharan, one of our Colleagues in Parliament, is among us with a graciousness of luck. A manipulated process was trying to take his life away. About eight or nine days ago, I was proceeding to Anuradhapura to address some meetings of the United National Party and I saw that Nochchiyagama is no more a highway. It is like an irrigation scheme. So, anybody who would have premeditated any destruction may have found it the best place to do so.

So, while all this is being done, there must be a justifiable reason as to why the state of Emergency needs to be extended. So, on that particular basis, all what we want to know is, what the Governments way forward is? There must be a time for reconciliation. The blessing of the country is the composition of the social fabric. In 1948, when this country gained Independence, Rt. Hon. D.S. Senanayake saw the strength in the Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims, the Burghers and the Malays and thought it fit that this composition makes a stronghold in the Sri Lankan social fabric. But, still there are tremors. Even though terrorism has been rooted out, political terrorism is raising its head. That needs to be eradicated. You do not need the extension of the state of Emergency to do so. Terrorism has been eradicated and you can do away with the Emergency Regulations. That is what we are saying. There are 211 countries in the world. Out of them, only five or six countries are governed by Emergency Regulations and that is used only for a temporary period of time.

Going on that basis, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would like to mention the reason why this Government is extending the state of Emergency. I have with me the Gazette Notification of 3rd of March, of 2011, which basically makes a Proclamation on the extension of state of Emergency in Sri Lanka. Then, on the 18th of January, 2011, His Excellency the President, using the same Public Security Ordinance (Chapter 40), makes a

203 204

[ .. ]

2011 09

Proclamation under the Regulations postponing the elections of the Colombo Municipal Council, Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia Municipal Council, Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte Municipal Council, Moratuwa Municipal Council, Negombo Municipal Council and Gampaha Municipal Council and there are 23 such of them. This is the reason why the state of Emergency is being extended in this country. There is the international community, which we all have basically got to be part of; either we are in it or out of it. You say, We are part of it and when it comes to having international scrutiny on us, you cannot say We are sorry. We are not part of the international club. On that basis, you are trying to tell the world, Yes, we are postponing our democratic elections using Emergency Regulations.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, on one side, if you gloat about saying that you have eradicated terrorism, let us give the full benefit by saying, Yes, Emergency Regulations of this country have also been taken off , or else, restrict it to a very minute portion, which is absolutely essential and I am sure any political party that is represented in Parliament today would not oppose to such a small area being under control. But, if it is used for political survival, then, certainly that creates a problem.

With your permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would table* the Gazette Notifications of 18th January, of 2011 and 3rd March, 2011 to be included in Hansard.

It very categorically states that the Public Security Ordinance is being used to postpone elections. That is the most important aspect to show as to why such things are being done. , , .

One of the biggest problems in Sri Lanka is that neither do we learn from others' mistakes nor do we learn from our own mistakes. There is a necessity for reconciliation and I guess that it is now the right time. With regard to this particular issue, instead of pointing the finger, it is much better that you sit down and have a dialogue. We have been very co-

operative on all areas because we always believe that it is talks that bring matters to a finality. Now, that the fighting is over, it is time to engage in talks and you will be able to move forward.

Now, Hon. Deputy Speaker, the US Senate wants Sri Lanka to accept an international probe on incidents that have taken place during the war. We, as a party, have always been very vocal that there is no need for external factors to interfere into the internal affairs of our country. While we give that support to the Government, we expect them to realize that there are democratic norms to be maintained in this country; whether it is a right or a necessity, you have got to comply with certain international regulations. As I said before, you cannot be saying that you are in the international community when you want to cherry-pick what is required, and dispense with what is not required. My good Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana is a mastermind when it comes to matters relating to human rights and things like that and he has been speaking of certain norms that need to be practised in this House. If you take 10 per cent of what he says and practise them in this august Assembly, you could show the world that there is at least a trend of democracy in this country. Through that, I am sure we would have a much less hostile international community than of today.

207 208

2011 09

Sir, The Island newspaper of Friday, 4th March, 2011 states, I quote:

US Senate wants Sri Lanka accept Intl. probe

First of all, why had the Government allowed such a situation to arise? We have an embassy in the United States of America. The people there are more involved in selling tea and doing business rather than looking after the internal affairs and the external perception on Sri Lanka. We basically hold them responsible for this situation. In spite of the Ministry of External Affairs being engaged in public-relation companies like Bell Pottinger in order to have a better external image of Sri Lanka and an embassy in the US, you still have the Senate coming up with a unanimous verdict on Sri Lanka. So, Hon. Deputy Speaker, all what we want to know is, how such matters can be overcome in the future. The Senate requirement is just only one aspect of that. You know about six months ago, we lost the Labour GSP Plus concession to Sri Lanka. Now, you have the United States of America on one side and, on the other the European Union, which has 24 countries telling, You basically implement the Constitution of your country. Now, can the Government turn down that request and tell them, Go to hell? They are telling us to implement our own Constitution. We have lost the Labour GSP owing to that. Now, what is the action that the Government is taking to rectify this? You can fall into a pitfall in the night, but you do not have to fall into the same pitfall in the daytime. This Government is aimlessly trotting on a voyage of discovery, always blaming the Opposition and its Members, thinking that they can remain in the Government forever. You must understand that today there are sweeping changes taking place in the political systems of countries. It started in Egypt; then, it spread to Tunisia; it is happening today in Libya and is moving on to Sudan, Jordan and Yemen. Today, in countries like that, where there has been erosion of democracy and autocratic rules suppressing the rights of the people, people are getting together and standing up against those autocratic regimes saying it is better to be dead than to be alive in such countries. And, it would not be too long before those types of winds blow this way; those would come not as winds but as tsunamis into the political stream in this area. So, I guess it is time for national reconciliation.

Then, before I venture on to the final part of my speech, Sir, I would like to say this. Look at the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam today. They are basically having a free run with the international community because there is a Tamil diaspora, a very vocal Tamil diaspora. After all, it is a very essential component of the Sri Lankan community as well, which is operating outside. That is represented by the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam, which has forced itself to represent the diaspora. Then, you also have the Tamil Forum, on one side. In each country, they are operating under different names. But, at the end of the

day, the Government of Sri Lanka has been stony silent on the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam. That has been a concern for the Opposition as to why there is no reference to it. There is a government in exile. Why has the Sri Lankan Government not ventured out to ensure that those types of elements are completely wiped out, knocked out? You have KP being used as a remote control, thinking that his money would extricate yourselves from the problems created by the international community by trying to lure those people into negotiations. That type of short-circuited approach would not work in a national agenda. So, at this particular moment, the Government must come forward and tell us what their view on the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam is, why they are so silent and why they cannot engage with the Tamil community. You have the TNA officially representing the Tamil people. On one side, the Government invites them saying, "Come for talks", but my feeling, my hunch is that, considering the attack on the Hon. Shritharan and the events that took place thereafter, the Government, while on one side, trying to show the world that they are speaking with the principal Tamil components in this country - the TNA and the United National Party -

? Standing Orders . Standing Orders . Standing Orders . . . I never made mention of a Government. If you want to put the cap on, go ahead and do so. You help me in a more corroborative way to bring the case forward. I was only talking of the Hon. Shritharan, who is a Member of the Opposition and also a Member of the TNA. Do not forget your past; you also came from the TNA. Remember what you have done. Do you think you had done a glorious act? You had come on the vote of the TNA, crossed on to the Government for the ulterior benefits and now, you are trying to ridicule. - [Interruption.] For God's sake, you have better things to do than that, Your verdict will be known before too long. - [Interruption.]

So, at this particular moment, all we basically say is, on one side the Government is trying to tell the international community that they are speaking with the TNA. But, how do you do that? You do not have a conducive climate for that because on one side, they had been fired at. I did not say that it was the Government who did that. It can be the Government forces; it can be your own Ministers or it can be even you, who have gone before the court today. It can be anybody. I basically refrained from mentioning the Government but now that you mentioned it, putting two and two together, it maybe helpful to understand this because that maybe the ulterior motive of the Government. On one side, they try to

hoodwink India and on the other, the international community. What they are trying to do is, rule by deception. So, on that particular score, all we want to say is, ensure that these types of things are brought into open.

Let me conclude by finally mentioning this. There has to be national reconciliation and I guess the best time for it has now come . The Sri Lankan community is made up, from the day we obtained Independence, of the strength of the Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims, the Burghers and the Malays. This composition makes up a fantastic social fabric that is envied by the rest of the world community. At this particular moment, all what we want to say is, let the Government be magnanimous in its victory. Just because they have a political advantage temporarily, which is waning fast and which benefit is coming completely on to the United National Party and other political parties, attempts should not be made to stymie and stifle democracy. All they have got to do is, ensure they have discussions and come up with a peaceful, democratic system for this country. So, all I would basically say is, let us develop a Sri Lankan identity; let us ensure that all political hatred ceases. There is a necessity for everybody to agree on a national agenda and work towards the collective good of all the people.

Sir, let me conclude with these great words of Lord Buddha : Hatred ceases not with hatred, but with love. Thank you.

The Hon. Leader of the Opposition and Hon. Leader of the United National Party have made a request to the IGP to make a comprehensive investigation about the attack on Hon. Sajith Premadasa in Hambantota. We are raising these important issues because today the Opposition Members of Parliament have been harassed; Opposition Members of Parliament have been intimidated; Opposition Members of Parliament are not in a position to carry out their duty towards the people.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . [. . 5.15] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Mr. Presiding Member, thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to participate in the Debate on the extension of the state of Emergency. Before speaking on that, I want to tell you that we, the Tamil Members of the TNA from Jaffna, are very much worried about what happened to our Colleague, the Hon. S. Shritharan, on the evening of 7th March, at Nochchiyagama. When he was returning to Colombo from Kilinochchi, three people have got out of a vehicle bearing no number plate near a bend, shot at the vehicle and the glasses had broken. Next, they have shot at the tyres and one has gone flat. Then, the security officers have shot back at them. Thereafter, they have slowly driven the vehicle to some distance with a flat tyre, gone into a house and telephoned me and the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. We got in touch with the IGP, then the IGP got in touch with the Nochchiyagama Police and the Nochchiyagama Police went and rescued them. This is what happened. I do not want this to be repeated. We all are worried. Every month we go to Jaffna. Today the police say that they were motorcyclists. I think the investigation is going on the wrong track. What has happened to the vehicle which was there without a number plate? I request the Government to see that such things are not repeated.

Sir, coming on to the state of Emergency, normally Emergency is declared when there is an emergency situation prevailing in the country. Section 2(1) of Part II of the Public Security Ordinance states, I quote:

Where, in view of the existence or imminence of a state of public emergency, the President is of opinion that it is expedient so to do in the interests of public security and the preservation of public order or for the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community, the President may, by Proclamation published in the Gazette, declare that the provisions of Part II of this Ordinance shall, forthwith or on such date as may be specified in the Proclamation, come into operation throughout Sri Lanka or in such part or parts of Sri Lanka as may be so specified.

None of the conditions mentioned in Section 2(1) exists now. Emergency Regulations give wide powers to the forces and according to the earlier Emergency Regulations, a person can be kept in detention for one year. But, there was an amendment and according to that, the period of detention was reduced to three months. But, when a person is arrested under Emergency Regulations and the three months period expires, what the police do is, they keep him for another 180 days under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. So, the amendments brought to the Emergency Regulations

have not given any relief to detainees. Sir, what we need is not the Emergency, we need an efficient government and the rule of law. The rule of law is lacking everywhere; the police do not do what the Government wants them to do. What happened at Borella? About 20 thugs arrived with clubs and damaged the vehicles of the UNP Members when the Deputy Inspector-General of Police and other police officers from the Borella Police were also at the scene. Why did they not arrest those people? Is this what the police is expected to do? What was the DIG doing?

If the Government wants to develop the country, it must first settle the long-standing ethnic question. As far as we are concerned, I dare say that the Thirteenth Amendment or the Thirteenth Plus or the Thirteenth Minus is not the solution to the question. What we want is substantial devolution of power to the North and the East. Surely, the problem can be solved by sharing the power at the Centre.

Sir, we request the Government to take immediate steps to resettle the people in Mullaitivu and Valigamam North and to do away with High Security Zones. The United States Ambassador to Sri Lanka has also recently said that the Government should do away with the Emergency and the High Security Zones. About 1,200 families consisting of 6,000 persons were chased away from Sampur, which was declared a High-Security Zone. These 6,000 persons for the last five years are detained in camps. After chasing these 6,000 persons, the Government declared a land of 10,000 acres as a High Security Zone.

As a result of this, people living in four villages are unable to go to their own lands. People from Sampur, Koonithivu, Saralaikuda and Sampukani are the people who were chased away from Sampur and nobody is allowed to go and even inspect those lands. When will the Government allow these 6,000 persons chased away from Sampur to go and resettle in their own lands? It is a breach of the fundamental rights of a person if he is prevented from going and living in his own land.

The US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, Robert O. Blake has said, Sri Lanka could be hauled before a war crimes tribunal over the killing of many thousands of civilians in the final months of its separatist war with Tamil rebels. The UN has said, At least 7,000 civilians perished in the final months of fighting while international rights groups have put the toll at more than 30,000.

The Emergency Regulations have seriously affected media freedom as well. Within the last two years, 27 mediamen, including Lasantha Wickrematunge, had been killed and the Government must take responsibility for that. What happened to Ekneligoda, who was arrested in January, 2010?

255 256

2011 09

I think the Government is trying to create a leadership for Tamils with Ranga and KP. If the people support them, we have no objection. The whereabouts of those who surrendered to the army are not known. Where are they? Are they living or not? Can the Government tell us?

Then, the Government should take immediate steps to bring down the cost of living. Now, a coconut is Rs. 60, a kilo of green chillies is Rs. 600 -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Sir, give me one more minute.

We requested the Indian Government to help the refugees in the Vanni and they promised to build 50,000 houses. They supplied tractors to be given to those who were affected by the war and the Minister of External Affairs of India, Mr. S.M. Krishna, came and laid the foundation stone for the houses. What has happened to those houses now? Out of the tractors given, most have gone to the South.

If the international community and the United Nations do not accept the recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, what can the Government do?

Since the Emergency Regulations are responsible for the illegal arrests, abductions, extrajudicial killings, arrests by white vans and muzzling of media freedom, we do not need the state of Emergency to be extended every month.

Thank you. [. . 5.23]

( ) (The Presiding Member) .

. ! .

[. . 5.36] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Mr. Presiding Member, at the start of my speech I would like to reply to the statement made by the Minister, Hon. Wimal Weerawansa. He stated that the attack which took place in the evening of Monday, 7th March on the Hon. S. Sritharan is a fabricated story by the TNA, that only a tyre blasted and the rest of the things are not true. He meant something like that.

We just came from a meeting, about half an hour back. The Hon. Speaker had arranged a meeting with the IGP. We were the Members who participated as the Hon. Vinayagamoorthy was not there. The IGP confirmed the incident and he showed us all the pictures and the SPs report. We also discussed the security. So, it is a very irresponsible speech by the Hon. Minister, which has to be condemned. They must first realize that this is a place where you must tell the truth because it is going to the public and to the rest of the country. If you make a speech like that, it will definitely tarnish the image of the TNA. Therefore, we request that this incident be taken into consideration seriously as the TNA is in a vulnerable state as far as security matters are concerned.

You must be aware that in the past, we have had a lot of Tamil groups. TNA was not an armed group, but there were a lot of other armed groups and they still hold arms. Arms have not been fully recovered. I told this today to the IGP but as far as they are concerned, those have been collected. One thing that I would like to ask the House is this: now that it is declared that there is no LTTE, officially only the forces can have arms. Then, how could others have arms? There are quite a lot deaths and killings taking place in the North. At every debate on the extension of the state of Emergency, we come and discuss this and we give you the names of the people who are killed; so it is obvious. If you say that the Tamil groups do not have arms, then in that case, the entire accusation will have to be directed at the forces. Please take that into account.

The Minister, Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka also indirectly said that the LTTE leader had a panel of lawyers in Colombo and decided on certain things, especially in eliminating persons from this world. It is a very serious allegation. There was no such thing to my knowledge. We, the Hon. Members have never heard that there was a panel of lawyers involved in such acts. This is something new. Why was this never heard of earlier or published in the newspapers? There was no such thing. Can he prove this? Just because anything can be spoken in this House, can they make such accusations? Do they not feel that it hurts every Member? How are they going to have reconciliation in that case?

It is not even 15 days since the President said that anybody could go anywhere in any part of this country.

261 262

But, this incident took place on the 7th of March. We travel through the land route. We travel by our own vehicles. The Hon. S. Shritharan does not know what to do next because we do not have proper security there as well. He has also stated that he suspects it is one of the Tamil groups with arms that tried to murder him. The possibilities are also there because of the election campaign. We have reported this to the Hon. Speaker and the Hon. Speaker has ordered a full probe into the incident where the Hon. S. Shritharan came under gunfire attack in Nochchiyagama. I have also noted one more point. ( ) (The Presiding Member) With that you must end your speech. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Okay. Defeating terrorism has been the main subject. You talk about defeating terrorism and defeated terrorism in the debates on the extention of the state of Emergency. No session has been concluded without mentioning the LTTE. It is all right. But, without knowing the consequences and to tarnish the image of the diaspora - it is on the increase - you are blaming the diaspora and painting them as LTTErs. We must understand that we are getting a lot of foreign exchange, in millions of dollars. If you go to the Central Bank, you would know from which country you are getting foreign exchange, which helps the development of this country. So, before you commit yourselves by saying such things, you have to be careful.

Thank you. [. . 5.43]

Mr. Deputy Speaker, the Heritage Foundation defines economic freedom in this way: Economic freedom is a fundamental right of every human being to control his or her own labour and property. In an economically free society, individuals are free to work, produce, consume and invest in any way they please, with that freedom both protected and unconstrained by the State. In economically free societies, governments refrain from coercion or constraint of liberty beyond the extent necessary to protect and maintain liberty itself.

Sir, the rule of law is a key prerequisite for economic freedom. Here, one important principle is the generality and equality of the law, which requires that all legal rules apply equally to everyone. When societies are governed under Emergency rule - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Geetanjana Gunawardena, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) Sir, that is the very freedom this Governement has given to the Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim people who were living under the rule of the LTTE in the North and the East. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) So, what is the point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) That is the point of Order. He is misleading the House to say that the Emergency Regulations are being used for other purposes. We have won the freedom - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not a point of Order. Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, you can continue with your speech. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) When societies are governed under Emergency rule, the application of equality is violated. For instance, it is one set of rules for the goons in Kelaniya and another set of rules for the Members of the United Natonal Party. - [Interruption.]
