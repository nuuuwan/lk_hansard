Then, it comes to the Tax Appeals Commission. This is another area which I think needs a lot of rectification and correction because you are trying to be draconian in nature. You cannot administer through the tax implementation authority in the Department of Inland Revenue but you are trying to bring in legislation. This is like killing a mosquito with a hammer. That is what you

671 672

[ ]

2011 24

are trying to do. You are trying to bring undue pressure on a certain section so that you bypass the democratic process or the fundamental right process of the taxpayer. There are 21 million people in our country and there are only about 1,000 to 1,500 tax files. But, what you do is, you basically harass the people who pay the tax without going after the people who do not pay it. So, with that, now you are basically trying to create further problems for the taxpayers rather than non-taxpayers.

The other matter is the tax appeals. I am informed that they are trying to modulate on to the South African system on which I am not an expert I must confess, but I am only trying to bring forward certain ideas that have been expressed by the tax consultants. According to them, there is certainly a need for a change but that change must be in line with a realistic situation, which helps to make a proactive change rather than reactive and very draconian in nature. That is the problem that we are faced with at this particular moment. So, I think the Tax Appeals Commission needs to look at it in a completely different way and ensure that there is an assisting process. You do not give assistance to people. Nobody loves to evade taxes. There are enough tax planning systems in the country. So, you must have an interactive process. The Department of Inland Revenue itself should come out with a system which helps the taxpayers. It should not be a dog that goes and bites but a dog that barks to protect others. So, you should basically bring in this type of legislation. At the moment, it appears that the Department of Inland Revenue is harassing the taxpayers and the people. So, ensure that you change it. I think the Commissioner General of the Department of Inland Revenue is trying to do a valiant job. But, I think there must be a more collective process to run through.

I must mention another fact. There are tax components that have been sent out but they do not have supportive evidence. It is not just to say that the Department of Inland Revenue has sent out this charge. You must ensure that there is documentary proof to say, yes, this is the case. It is not enough for the Department of Inland Revenue to send the tax computation on an arbitrary figure. There must be some supportive, corroborative evidence. We know that because it has happened to some people. I am bringing in this example because I am sure that there are many others who are going to face this problem. When they see the Department of Inland Revenue, they shiver in fear thinking that it has ultimate powers and activities which are draconian in nature. So, as a result they tend to avoid such things. But, if you have a consultative process where a person says, Yes, I have made Rs. 1 million, after tax planning I can save Rs. 700,000, and then if the Department of Inland Revenue also says, Yes, either you can plan it that way or you can have an assistive service, I am sure that will be very much more productive because ultimately it is the tax compliance which is important. A big tax base and a low tax compliance is not what is expected by you as a Government. It is much better to have a small tax base

and a big tax compliance area, which infiltrates big net revenue into the economy of the country. Your revenue, today, as opposed to the GDP, is still in the range of about 14.5 to 15 per cent. But, if you analyse the revenue, you will find that 88 per cent of that is coming from indirect taxation. So, that is not the successfulness of a government because you must be able to correct the indirect taxation as well. I suggest that you reduce it to within 10 to 15 per cent rather than having it at 25 or 30 per cent, so that you will have a much higher compliance rate in this country. The reduction made from 35 to 24 per cent in the Budget was a good step. But, that is not good enough when better is expected and if you have it at 10 to 15 per cent, nobody will bother to waste time to avoid taxation.

The next matter is regarding the BOI. You are trying to have two different tax regimes and you are trying to correct that by saying, one tax regime. But, that is helpful in one aspect but certainly detrimental from the point of view of the investors.

If there are situations in this country, where there are enough investors to make a full compliance with the employment structure in this country, which is sufficient to ensure that the economic wheels keep turning in the entire country, then it does not matter. But, in a country where you have about 250,000 people coming to the employment market every year and where there is unemployment, even though you profess that you have an 8 to 10 per cent unemployment rate - the actual unemployment is at least about one and a half million - and where there is underemployment, you need to have a full employment structure that is created. So, the Sri Lankan investor per se is not sufficient enough to kick-start the economy.

Then, you have to get on to the next one, and that is, bringing foreign investors in. This is a Government that scorns upon the foreigners. But, now you are trying to lure them in. Once a damage is done, it is very hard to undo. When the investors come, they come to make money and they basically create employment. You must understand that. That is the reality. But, when you go to a place like the Board of Investment, and if they say, yes, you have got to apply here and we give the approval; then, go to the Department of Inland Revenue and get the tax structure and after that, go to the Ministry of National Heritage and Cultural Affairs and get the approval and finally, go to the Ministry of Environment, then the investor would shy away. He is competing with countries like Malaysia; he is competing with countries like Thailand; he is competing with the countries like Indonesia and also with the rejuvenated India, which is just above us. They approve investments almost in a month. We approve it in a weeks time but now we have pushed it back to almost six months to one year. So, I think we need to rectify that because that is going to be our future revenue earning stream.

673 674

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have only two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, certainly, I would conclude my speech within that two minutes. Sir, this is a sincere request that comes from a national perspective because at the end of the day, you need a country that has a strong national economy. When you have a national economy, you must have the fundamentals put in place, and the national economic policy put in place must not be amended or changed at the whims and fancies of the politicians or some pressure groups that come in. You must be able to have a perdurable policy that would be helpful. Then, the investors know that this is the way forward.

I know for a fact that many foreign investors have said that Sri Lanka has changed from direct taxation to indirect taxation and thereby reduced profit from almost 31 to 2 per cent and as a result, they say, Why the hell should we invest in this country. They go to a country where they can make money out of it. Now, this is not trying to keep the Sri Lankan investors at bay. Let the foreigners create jobs and bring in foreign exchange as well as put Sri Lanka on the map.

I sincerely look at the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Bill as a change in the right direction. Well and good! Again there is a huge gap; get that lacuna corrected. I expressed my comments on the Telecommunication Levy Bill and took up both the Tax Appeals Commission Bill and the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill together as the time is a limiting factor for me. I will look at this particular Bill in a more proactive way. We need taxation for the country. There is no question about that. You require direct taxation and indirect taxation. But, when you come to direct taxation, you require more compliance and non-compliance. That is the problem. You must be able to have laws for the sinners than the saints. I agree wholesale. But, when you are doing that, ensure that that is not draconian in nature. You must feel that the Department of Inland Revenue is the most friendliest place to go to. When you go there, you must be able to get the service that you require, not to have people who are like CID agents; a word that is extracted from you would make your tax file larger than what it was before you went to that place. That is what needs to be changed now. Once again, I compare and contrast that particular Bill with the Shangri-La company, for which land has been bought at US Dollars 75 million. I think the Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena has given me a reply to the question regarding that deal. , - 75 . 100 . .

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Hon. Member is misleading the House. He is inferring that the Government has given it on a certain basis. What is that basis? Please tell this House.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That is not a point of Order. You carry on, Hon. Member.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) If there are incentives and concessions being given, then there should be limits of authority. Even subsequent to those concessions being given within a specified period of time, it will be good if the Parliament is informed of those concessions.- [Interruption.] There are very many situations around the world of good governance, which could be followed.

695 696

[ ]

2011 24

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) It is under the Strategic Development Projects Act. You can refer to it. It is within that ambit that it is done.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) That is fine. I am asking you to make a disclosure within a specific period of time. - [Interruption.]

. . I want to make a few points on the investments that the Government is making. These investments are being made on the Stock Market, in the purchase of good companies as well as banks. As regards the purchase of banks, the Government entities have been buying more than 10 per cent of commercial banks. We know that there is a laid down rule that there can only be a 10 per cent purchase. Otherwise, with the permission of the monetary authority, there could be a maximum of a 15 per cent purchase. So, what I want to know is whether this rule is applicable only to the Government or is it applicable to everyone. If it is applicable only to the Government, then the Government should say so. If it does apply, then the Government is in violation of the rule. We know that more than Rs. 60 billion has been invested in the control of certain banks. What is the logic behind it and what is the necessity of this investment? That is not clear. We know that the Bank of Ceylon has Rs. 715 billion in assets, the People's Bank has about Rs. 550 billion and the NSB has about Rs. 400 billion. When you total all these assets, it is more than 50 per cent of the banking assets of the country. So, what is the necessity actually to purchase and take control of some of these private banks? What is the logic behind this? It is not just the EPF that is involved in these takeovers. The ETF, the Bank of Ceylon, the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation and the National Savings Bank are involved in it. We know that the Government entities collectively own more than 14 per cent of the Commercial Bank, more than 23 per cent of the HNB, 30 per cent of the Seylan Bank, 33 per cent of the DFCC and 33 per cent of the NDB. What is the intention of this? The EPF is only one of the purchasers. It owns about 5 per cent of the Commercial Bank, about 7.6 per cent of Government portion of the HNB, about 6 per cent of the Seylan Bank portion, 9 per cent of NDB and about 8.25 per cent of the Sampath Bank. So, what is the reason for this? What is the true intention? One argument is that it is to give better returns to the EPF members. That is good if the EPF members are given better returns. But, the question is much wider. The EPF portion of those investments is actually about 25 per cent. But, the problem is, the other institutions are also being involved. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot have a situation where the Government directly owns more than 50 per cent of all the banking assets and the Government indirectly trying

to own the assets of other banks by taking control of them. What is the intention of it? Certainly, it is not to give returns to the members of the Employees' Provident Fund.

Some people might think that investors could be fooled. A question is being asked : "Still, why is there a stagnation in Foreign Direct Investments coming into the country?" That is because the signals are mixed. The signals are certainly mixed here because people are coming to the conclusion that there is a creeping nationalization. There is also a conflict of interest here. When Government entities are taking over very well-run, profitable private institutions and private banks, when Government institutions to get control over them are nominating directors for those boards and are sending those names to the regulatory authority for approval, so that the authority will go into whether the individuals are fit and proper, it must be said that the process is certainly not fit and proper. The process must be fit and proper if they are to continue with what they are doing. We know that directors are being replaced by new directors. It is a creeping nationalization. Certainly, there is a negative signal to investors who would want to invest in these areas. So, that is a concern.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Can you give an example of such institution? ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) There are many such institutions. I have named them : the HNB, of which they have control over 23 per cent of shares, the Seylan Bank, the shares over which they have control for obvious reasons because the bank is in trouble and we can keep that aside, the DFCC, of which they have control over 33 per cent of shares, the NDB, of which they have control over 33 per cent of shares and now, the Commercial Bank, of which the control over shares is rising and it is at over 14 per cent. The point I am making is, -

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Those are strategic investments the Government is making.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Wait, wait.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Now, take for example Temasek.

697 698

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Yes, you can make strategic investments, but you need to be clear. If you are making long-term strategic investments for returns and those returns are going to benefit the ordinary people of this country, we would not oppose it. - [Interruption.] But, these are not only for returns. Investments are being made and control of those institutions is being taken over. That is the problem. - [Interruption.] You cannot have it both ways. - [Interruption.] Hon. Member, you cannot have it both ways. If you want to make long-term investments and get returns, we are not opposing it. But, if you are investing, appointing directors and also regulating those, you are certainly giving the wrong signal. Please take note of that. - [Interruption.] You cannot attract foreign investments that way.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) The point is well taken. But, are you saying that the Government should make strategic investments for the benefit of the people of this country and then refrain from appointing directors to ensure those are taken care of?

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) May I say this, Hon. Member. We are in the Opposition and not in the Government. - [Interruption.] But, if the Government wants our advice, we will certainly give it. There are models globally, in which Governments can invest and you used Temasek as an example. But, there are ways in which it could be done; there has to be rules on transparency. - [Interruption.] There has to be rules on conflict of interests that comes between Government operations and Government regulations. Those need to be put into place and observed. Then, people will have confidence. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Member, you were the CEO of the National Development Bank, of which the Government has proposed to take over 15 to 18 per cent. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Member, let me be clear and I will say it again. We are not opposing the Government buying shares in the Stock Market; we are not opposing the ordinary people of this country getting benefit from investing in the Stock Market because it is they who must benefit out of it. What we are saying is that, you cannot have it both ways. If you take control of the commanding heights of the economy, the private sector, by appointing directors and

having conflict of interests in the system, people are going to lose confidence. - [Interruption.] That is the reason why investment is slow. - [Interruption.] There are many contradictions and we say this in good faith, Hon. Members. There are many contradictions and we are asking you to iron those contradictions out. You cannot be disparaging of foreign investors and also welcome them. You cannot alienate the community and then do just one or two deals secretly. You need to have a consistent policy; you need to have a policy framework that works, that everybody understands and has everybody behind it. You want economic growth and prosperity, but you cannot constantly interfere with the market mechanism, depending on the judgment of the central bureaucrats. They used to be called "central planners". It cannot be done. You cannot undermine private distribution of goods and services and increase Government distribution. These are just a few examples of the mixed signals that are being given out.

Finally, I would like to thank you, Sir, for the courtesy extended.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, you may commence your speech now.

[. . 4.07] ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Presiding Member, today it is going to be a fairly boring presentation. But, I want to make some technical points on one of the supplements presented today on the Telecommunication Levy Bill. First of all, I must commend the Government for reducing the tax burden on mobile phones from 30 to 20 per cent. In fact, the tax was more than 30 per cent because there was a tax on tax, which was something like 31.3 per cent. So, now, that has come down to 20 per cent, which is a good thing. What has actually happened is that the distortionary Mobile Subscriber Levy, the Environmental Conservation Levy, NBT and all those other taxes that got added to the VAT has now been removed. So, there is a straightforward 20 per cent tax now. But, the catch is that, that 20 per cent is VAT exempt. Therefore, I am planning to present here some points that perhaps might be good to reconsider next time when this is proposed.

There are always two sides to a story. Earlier when there was the VAT on telecommunication services, the operators were able to claim the input VAT. Now, the significant change is that you cannot claim the VAT paid on inputs. Of course, you can claim only on the

703 704

telecommunication-related hardware which anyway was exempted in the previous scenario. Now, what has happened is, on all expenditure made by the telecommunication operators, whether it be on any kind of service, research or marketing and so on, you cannot claim the VAT. The impact of this, Hon. Presiding Member, has been estimated by the industry to be something like Rs. 6 billion. Now, according to the Treasury, it is something like Rs. 15.5 billion. So, I believe the impact will be somewhere in the middle. One could ask Why, what is the problem? Telecommunication companies are making money. Everybody has a mobile phone; those are ideal to be taxed. So, it is becoming like the tax on liquor and cigarettes. The telecommunication companies have now become easy targets for revenue collection for the State. So, the question is What is the problem? The problem, Sir, is the ability to invest for these companies. If you have to pay more to the Government in terms of taxes, what it really means is that there is less leftover to invest.

Now, let us analyse the situation. The industry is already very competitive; prices have fallen significantly. In fact, Sir, Sri Lanka has one of the lowest mobile tariffs in the world. But, such fierce competition has also created problems in the industry and if you take the industry as a whole, you would not disagree with me that there has been a lot of bleeding going on. To give you an example, there is a particular telecommunication company right now - I will not name the company - which is selling SIM cards for Rs. 25 and with that Rs. 25 SIM card, you get Rs. 75 of free telephone calls. Look at the desperation of this company. So, you get Rs. 75 free for Rs. 25 that you pay. Obviously, any right-thinking person will say Well, this is not sustainable and it is not sustainable. But, the desperation is such that to grab market share, you will do anything you can in this fiercely competitive environment.

So, there are two sides to this story. I will not disagree that telecommunications must be made affordable; we have made telecommunications affordable to a great extent. Like I said, I commend the work that has been done thus far. But, the other side of the coin is that, at what cost do we do this? So, here, I think there is a fine balance where the regulations become very important: regulation on market entry, regulation on the allocation on things like spectrum, frequencies, regulation on tariffs, regulation on unfair competition and so on.

So, the point is by an arbitrary change in the tax treatment for the industry, the repercussions are going to be enormous and I am very serious about this. The repercussions are not going to be felt only by the telecommunication industry but by the economy at large. The reason is that the telecommunication industry has today become a driver for the entire economy and people depend on their mobile phones.

Mobile phones have made transaction costs fall; mobile phones have made the economic functioning more efficient. Telecommunications have made production more productive. So, if you create problems in the telecommunication industry, then the domino effect will be felt by the entire country. So, what we need to consider is the principles of taxation. Those must be adhered to at all times. One of the key points is, tax policies must not be arbitrarily changed. We all know that the Tax Commission consisted of some brilliant people in this country headed by Professor W.D. Lakshman. They have done a pretty good job. But, I must be critical of this fact. The arbitrary change of the treatment of taxation to the telecommunication industry will have negative impacts. When an investor comes, he is told, This is the tax treatment that you will have to face in the industry". Several months or years down the road, suddenly this tax treatment is changed. Then, what happens? That is where the problem is. Investors must be able to have a sense of certainty. You have to be able to invest your money, not just to make profits tomorrow like in the stock exchange, but over a period of time. Therefore, they have to have a sense of stability and a sense of fairness in the way they are treated by the government with reference to taxation. What we see here is not that. As I said, I believe that this arbitrary change in tax will have a negative impact not just on the industry but beyond that.

Let us look at the fact of the matter. According to the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission, there are about 17 million subscribers as of today. But, I think it would be more appropriate to say that 17 million SIMs are in use. As you know, people now use more than one mobile phone. They have more than one SIM. So, it does not mean that 17 million people have mobile phones, but there are 17 million SIMs in use. It is a great achievement. We have 20 million people out of which 17 million SIMs are in use.

While that is true, what we need to look at is beyond voice telephony. That is broadband. It is becoming an essential utility like gas, water or electricity. Sir, in the developed world, we see what is called "Fixed Broadband". You have a cable to the home. You have television, internet and telephone, all coming through in one big tube to homes. But, that is not what we see in the developing world. What we see in the developing world, particularly in this part of the world, is mobile broadband. A thinktank that I have been associating for a long time - LIRNEasia - has been working on this area for a long period of time. I want to share with you, Hon. Presiding Member, a blog entry made by a young researcher by the name of Ayesha Zainudeen yesterday. She says, I quote:

Are Asias poor on the Internet without even knowing it?

What she says is, if you ask poor people in this part of the world, Do you use internet? they would say, Not really.

705 706

According to that research done about two years ago, only 9 per cent of the people whom she interviewed, what she calls the "Bottom of the Pyramid", said that they use the internet. But, the interesting par of that finding is, 78 per cent of that same sample use functions of the internet via the mobile. So, what matters is not that you use the internet, but you in fact use the services you have got to get through the internet. She further goes on to say, I quote:

For the last three years, LIRNEasia has been arguing the case that many people in developing markets will have . their first 'Internet experience' through a mobile. Most of our 2008-2010 research program was based on this premise.

It seems that the general discourse in the mobile research field is converging on this point, as evidence of growing mobile Internet use in these markets emerges.

So, you can see, Hon. Presiding Member, that this is very important. If we are to create greater efficiencies in the economy, there must be greater investments in services more than just mobile voice. Now, everybody has access to voice, as I said. Even the previous speaker said that even in the village, everybody pretty much has a mobile phone. But, Sir, we have to go to the next level. That is what is important. She further says, I quote:

LIRNEasias argument (which in fact CEO & Chair Rohan Samarajiva has been making from as early as 1999.) goes one step further. We dont mean that people in these markets will be opening up their mobile Web browser, typing in urls and surfing the mobile Internet.

Sir, this is a very important point. You do not expect poor people to go to their mobile web browser and type in URLs, because that will not necessarily work. Furthermore, she says, I quote:

We argue that that the 'Internet' should be considered as a meta-medium, which allows users to perform various functions that we usually consider to make up the 'conventional' Internet experience. In the most simplistic form, these functions include:...

Then, she goes on to suggest communication in multiple forms, information retrieval including search, publication, transactions and so on.

Now, very interestingly, there is a chart here, which shows that out of the people who use meta-medium Internet, 71 per cent use mobile phones for transactions and 20 per cent of them use it for remote computing. You think about transactions and remote computing made use of by a large number of poor people.

We want to develop this country. So, usually, I will talk about macroeconomic policy, taxes and all that but today, I am speaking of a micro issue as to how to improve the efficiency of peoples work and how to reduce the cost of transactions. That is important. So, here, what do we mean by transactions? It is interestingly

theuse of electronic reloading of prepaid balances and things like that. So, you do not have to walk to the grocery store to get a reload on your phone. You can do it electronically now. That is done through the internet. Then, what is remote computing? It states that it is driven by prepaid balance checking. So, all these need large investments by the operators in order to provide these services.

Then, there is another very interesting study. This was presented at a special forum organized by the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing a couple of weeks ago on the New Mod-tradi Consumer. Mod-tradi Consumer is the Modern Traditional Consumer, a new breed of consumer that we see today in our society and that was presented by The Nielsen Research Agency. According to that, 14 per cent of people in the age group of 15 to 16 use the internet. But, if you look at people in the age group of 15 to 25, 26 per cent of them use the internet regularly. So, across this country young people are using the internet, logging on to Facebook, downloading news, interacting with their friends, creating networks, making life fun and also in the process of - if they are entrepreneurial - making money also. That is helping this economy grow. Why I am passionately arguing for the removal, if at all possible at least the next time, of this arbitrary change in tax policy is because it is going to be difficult for the operators to continue to make investments that are necessary to graduate from just simple plain vanilla-type voice telephony to what we want to get to - applications, broadband, mobile internet, that kind of services.

Sir, large amounts of Foreign Direct Investments have come into this telecommunication sector. I will read out the figures related to telecommunications investment in Foreign Direct Investments, which I got yesterday from the BOI. Then, you will realize, Sir, how skewed investments have been in this country in the telecommunications field. In 2005, we had US Dollars 287 million of Foreign Direct Investments and of that, US Dollars 112 million or 39 per cent came into the telecommunications sector. In 2006, it was 44 per cent. In 2007, it was 55 per cent. In 2008, when we had the highest Foreign Direct Investments of US Dollars 889 million, US Dollars 553 million or 62 per cent came to the telecommunications sector. In 2009, it was 49 per cent and even when we had dropped to an estimated US Dollars 516 million of Foreign Direct Investment in 2010, 38 per cent or US Dollars 205 million of the entirety of our Foreign Direct Investment came to the telecommunications sector. So, I think I have been able to convince you that the bulk of the Foreign Direct Investments that have come to this country have come to this particular sector.

Now, the issue is, what will happen in fact to the actual volume of Foreign Direct Investments coming to the sector because of the laws you are going to pass today? That is the question. You are not giving the certainty that is expected by the investors by passing

707 708

2011 24

this amendment to the Bill today. You speak to anybody in the industry and they will say, "We are going to think about investing in this sector in the future". Even people who have got approvals for investments are now saying, No, we are not going to make investments because this is a ridiculous state of affairs". Today we are being told one, tomorrow we will be told another. That is not what investors require. So, if that happens, how are we going to get the required investment into the sector? How are we going to increase the availability and the penetration of broadband? How are we going to increase the access and the speed of mobile internet? How are we going to make all these dreams come true? More than anything else, how are we going to meet the objective in the "Mahinda Chintana Idiri Dekma" about creating a knowledge-hub in Sri Lanka? In order to do that you have to have a proper, well-regulated tax regime and a regulatory regime for the telecommunications industry.

Now, I want to make a few references to some relevant points.

There was a tender recently to build a National Backbone Network. That is to expand the footprint of fibre optic cables in Sri Lanka. But, there was a Cabinet decision on the 9th February, 2011, by which, suddenly the procurement process was cancelled. I have that draft Cabinet Decision with me and I would table* it to be included in Hansard.

Not only was the procurement process cancelled in the midst but also, the Cabinet recommended that the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission negotiate with Sri Lanka Telecom PLC and offer them the project. So, this kind of treatment is actually bad for investor-confidence; people want confidence, people want certainty. If a tender has been called and so much of money has been spent on preparing and bidding for it, you need not cancel it half way. That is not good governance. In fact, I would venture to say that it is bad governance. There is an irony behind it, Sir. It happened a couple of weeks ago, in February, 2011. When we heard the story that the Government was going to borrow money and build this broadband network, I wrote an article somewhere in October, 2007, more than three and a half years ago, and said, do not waste public money on telecommunication infrastructure, and proposed that what you actually need to do is to regulate shared access of available fibre optic network of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC. So, since 2007, Sri Lanka Telecom PLC has been increasing their fibre optic network even to Jaffna, Trincomale and Batticaloa from what I understand. After all this is done, the Cabinet says, Go back to the original proposal made by the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva in 2007. So, we do not have to go through this whole rigmarole, come back and say, look, why do you not do what has been proposed three and a half years ago?

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, I am sorry to disturb you. Your speech is quite interesting, but your time is up now. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I am coming to the end. There are multiple examples of this kind of cancelling tenders and so on and that is not positively viewed by the investors.

Finally, I want to take one case. I have many but because of lack of time I cannot take them up. Take the case of the purchasing of the American GE Locomotives. In 2009, the Cabinet appointed a Tender Board. The Tender Board recommended that the locomotives from a company called Electro-Motive Diesel, Incorporation be purchased. That was in 2009 and in February 2010, the Cabinet effectively cancelled it. In July 2010, the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Planning, Dr. P.B. Jayasundera, wrote to the US Ambassador saying that there was no intention of purchasing those US locomotives. In fact, I have that letter written by the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Planning to the US Ambassador here with me and I would like it to be included* in Hansard.

The funny thing, Hon. Presiding Member, is that a politically-appointed Ambassador had said that he was bringing in a group of investors from the United States. That made them get that tender. It was made possible for those new investors selling the same equipment, which, just a few months ago, had been said there was no need for, to actually get that contract.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Your time is up.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, I am going to wind up my speech now.

My point is that there is no consistency in this. The Government must take a particular stand and the investors must be given confidence so that they can make long-term decisions.

To sum up, Sir, I must say that taxes must be fair and equitable and the basic principles of governance must be adhered to. So, I urge the Government to reconsider the arbitrary change in the tax treatment of the telecommunication sector so that the industry can continue to make further investments.

Thank you.

"In the event of an inconsistency between the Sinhala and Tamil texts of this Act, the Sinhala text to prevail".

This is what is contained in Clause 3 of this amended Bill. So, now, Hon. Karu Jayasuriya wanted to insert something to this particular Clause, which is quite out of order because now you cannot amend Clause 3.

How can you amend this Clause by amending the words "Rs. five million" to "Rs. fifty million"? I think somebody has given him a dead rope. This is out of context and out of order because Clause 1 was passed and Clause 2 was passed. Then, when we came to Clause 3, you moved the amendment to Clause 3, which was very clear. You said that Clause 3 must be amended in this manner. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But, you have to amend Clause 3. [Interruption.]

729 730

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) No, no. Mr. Chairman, you put Clause 1 to the House and it was passed. Then, you put Clause 2 to the House and that was also passed.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Either he cannot read English or something is wrong.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) I think you have been confused. I think you have not been properly briefed on this. Honourable third Deputy Leader of the UNP, you have not been properly briefed on this.[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Karu Jayasuriya) Hon. Minister, you should know what to talk. I am indeed sorry that the Hon. Sarath Amunugama talked like this.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) But, the fact is that you have not referred to the proper Section. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Karu Jayasuriya) That is right. But, how dare you say about my English?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You must refer to the proper Clause.

( ) (The Hon. Karu Jayasuriya) Yes, that is what I am trying to do. - [Interruption.]

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is the procedure in this House. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) No, no. Now, there is nothing to amend. Hon. Chairman, Clause 1 has been amended in the way the Government proposed and that was affirmed. Then, there

was no amendment to Clause 2 and that was also affirmed. When we came to Clause 3 only, you wanted Clause 3 to be amended in that way, which is not in order. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) That is a mistake.

We need not beg anybody to get time allotted to us. In a circus you have clowns, stuntmen, acrobats and children. This is what happens when a clown
