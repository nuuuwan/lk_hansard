... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, Sir Francis Bacon, in his book named "Advancement of Learning" said, I quote:

It is as hard and severe a thing to be a true politician as to be truly moral.

Our beloved Hon. Minister and Member, the late Hon. Sarath Chandra Rajakaruna, was a true politician and he held very high moral standards in life. I associated with him very closely and he took me to several meetings in his district, particularly to Thihariya and other areas. He was a devout Buddhist. We know he had a liberal heart. He gave whatever he got to his brethren. He shared his wealth and other things with others also. I remember very well, Sir, visiting with him places like Malwana which is the largest Muslim village in the Gampaha District, Thihariya, Kahatowita, Nambuluwa, Kaleliya, Pasyala, Allalamulla, Ogodapola, Pugoda, Minuwangoda and Galoluwa. He would remember the names of every Muslim leader and Grama Niladhari who helped him throughout.

As the Hon. Leader of the Opposition mentioned the other day, he took me to meetings not only in his electoral district but also elsewhere in the country. He would never send me home empty-handed; he would give me baskets of fruits, particularly avocados and rambutans.

I know for one thing, Sir, that he closely associated with some of the greatest Buddhist and social leaders of this country. One such leader was Mr. H.K. Dharmadasa who died three days ago at the age of 92. I must also mention, Sir, that Mr. H.K. Dharmadasa's philanthropy was legendary for his assistance and support to all humanitarian and worthy causes and also the projects initiated for the benefit of the poor and underprivileged sections of society. I would mention here the names of two of his sons, Jayantha and Upali. Upali, particularly as the new Chairman of the Sri Lanka Cricket, is guiding his destiny for the better.

The Hon. Rajakaruna was a social worker and he would assist anybody who would extend their hands to him.

, . . . . .

, . . , " , , " .

He was fond of chewing betel. He was a village man who moved with the public very closely. He had rendered yeoman service to the country and Parliament. At this moment, Sir, I would like to convey my condolence to his beloved sister, the Governor of the Southern Province, Mrs. Kumari Balasuriya and his youngest son, Mr. Harshana Rajakaruna who is in the Western Provincial Council. The Hon. Sarath Chandra Rajakaruna was the son of Mr. Muhandiram D.P. Rajakaruna. I would also like to convey my condolence to Mrs. Mallika Rajakaruna, the Hon. Jagath Balasuriya, our genial Minister who is the brother-in-law of the Hon. Sarath Chandra Rajakaruna and the former Army Commander, General Hamilton Wanasinghe. , .

( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ! . [3.45 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I rise with a heavy heart to pay my tribute and respect to a Friend, a person whom I knew before I came to this House or became a politician. The Hon. Sarath Chandra Rajakaruna was introduced to me by a

519 520

person from Ruwanwella, Mr. V.P. Sathasivam, when I needed the support of a Minister in the Government due to certain problems the garment industry faced at that time. Not having any friends in politics then, it was the Hon. Sarath Chandra Rajakaruna who helped me without any inhibitions. As a mere industrialist at that time, the respect, the hospitality and the friendship he showed towards me was reflective of his personality. He was a politician who was very humble and down to earth; close to the people he represented, lived with them and liked them. Something he enjoyed most was agriculture. As a landed proprietor with vast extents of land he enjoyed planting every plant and every tree in his estates. He used to tell us Today, I bought so many plants of such and such a variety and within the next two or three days I will be busy with them in my estate. To that extent he enjoyed himself as an agriculturist caring for his estates and his lands.

Similarly, he was a person with a lot of compassion. He cared for his people. He helped all his constituents. He assisted the children of his constituents to find employment, to rise in those employments and to shine in life.

I must say one more thing, Sir. The hospitality of the late Hon. Sarath Chandra Rajakaruna was exemplary. He and his wife used to entertain anybody coming to their house with a very warm heart. At anytime you go, he would say, " " and they used to entertain whoever entered their home and they did so with great humility. When we left his home, he always came up to the gate, and up to the vehicle and sent us off. A noble family from a walauwa background behaving in this manner while he was a Minister is something that you do not see among politicians or generally among nobility. Therefore, Sir, I pay my tribute and convey my condolences to his family. We miss him a lot. We all miss him and it is a big loss to our country.

Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) ... . . [. . 3.50] ... ( . . . ) (The Hon. J.R.P. Sooriyapperuma) , , . ,

[4.12 p.m.] ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Chair, I join the Leader of the House in expressing my condolence on the death of the Hon. (Mrs.) Mallika de Mel. We have known her not only as a politician and as a Member of this House, but many of us who have known her, friends and acquaintances, have also enjoyed her hospitality. Politics was not something that was new to Mallika de Mel. Her father, Mr. Leo Fernando represented the Buttala Constituency in the State Council. So, from 1932, she had a background of politics.

When Ronnie de Mel entered the Public Service, he became aware of how the Public Service was run and then he came into politics. I would not be wrong in describing it as a partnership. Ronnie de Mel was a strategist. He made strategy, and as a Minister, he held key ministries. The tactics at constituency level was what Mallika de Mel specialized in. As one of the speakers of the House of Representatives of the Congress, Mr. Tip ONeill said: "All politics is local". So, whatever politics that was national or global, the politics that pertained to finance, to development, to law and order was what Ronnie de Mel handled. All that was local was what Mallika de Mel handled and she was a real expert. I think there are a large number of people, especially in the Devinuwara Electorate who got their first taste of employment; thanks to the intervention of (Mrs.) Mallika de Mel. They made their way up in life because she was able, using her position as the Private Secretary to the Minister of Finance and that is still one of the most powerful positions, to ensure that the electorate was well looked after. Devinuwara is a small electorate. But, it is thickly populated and it was the heart of the turmoil of this country on two occasions; she realized this and attended to it I think that speaks much of her political ability.

Once I was going past Devinuwara passing their house, a well-designed house, I must say, and there were a large number of people. I told to my colleague who was in my car, " ?" and he said, " , , ." . So, the constituents knew where they had to go to ensure that all their needs were fulfilled. It is in this way that finally Mallika de Mel came to this House. She knew her politics and came into the politics. As someone said, Mr. Ronnie de Mel knew what was good for the country, but Mallika de Mel knew what was good for the electorate and that was what finally ensured that they were both in politics.

To many of us who have known her in politics, she was a good campaigner, she would spend her time. Whatever the problems she had, she was available. Even when she had to undergo some medical treatment and found that she should not have been walking, you could see her going around and meeting the people. I mean, politics seems to have been, in her blood. But we also saw the other side of her as an individual; a person who would call and find out about you. Whenever you were there, she was a brilliant hostess. She ensured that you had a cup of tea and finally that you had a meal before you left the house. That was what (Mrs.) Mallika de Mel was. She was a person who as a politician had the respect of the people whom she served. There is no one who would say a bad word about her, no one who would cast any aspersions on her and no one who would doubt her integrity. She was above all that and I know she enjoyed politics.

527 528

She was very, very combative in nature and as far as she was concerned, I think she looked at politics from the grass-roots level. But, she knew what the final end was. So, it is sad that she passed away rather unexpectedly and she is no longer with us. I would like to, on behalf of the UNP, - which party she had helped a lot from 1977 onwards as a Minister and I had the privilege and pleasure of having worked with her - express our condolences to her bereaved family. May she attain Nibbana!

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order please! I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by both sides of the House on the death of the Hon. (Mrs.) Mallika de Mel, ex-Member of Parliament. I should like to add a few personal sentiments. I came to know (Mrs.) Mallika de Mel when we formed the Private SecretariesAssociation of the Cabinet of Ministers and when her husband was away at Geekiyanakanda drafting the Budget, she devoted much more time for the welfare of this Association. So, we met several times in the Ministry and also at their residence at Charles Drive, Colpetty.

I shall direct the Secretary-General of Parliament to make a Minute of the Proceedings of the Meeting today and send a copy thereof to the members of the bereaved family.

Order, please! Now we will take up the Vote of Condolence on the Hon. K.W. Kuruppuarachchi, ex- Member of Parliament.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Who agreed upon that? I have not been informed of any such agreement.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Hon. Deputy Speaker, we want to ensure that the Votes of Condolence are over today and I spoke to the Hon. John Amaratunga. We had been magnanimous enough to give 45 minutes to the Opposition and 15 minutes to the Government. But, in view of the fact that another Government Member has to make a speech for five minutes, I think you should accommodate us with another five minutes.
