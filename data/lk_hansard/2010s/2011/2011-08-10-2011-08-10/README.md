QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE REDUCTION OF NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT IN JAFFNA ELECTORAL DISTRICT . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I raise as a matter of urgent public importance, the question relating to the number of

Members of Parliament entitled to be elected to the Jaffna Electoral District.

The total number of Members of Parliament elected to the territory covered by the present Jaffna Electoral District in 1977 under the first-past-the-post system was 11. The total number of Members of Parliament elected to the Jaffna Electoral District under the proportional representation system at the last General Election was nine. It would appear that this number is to further decline and become six.

This reduction is attributed to the decline in the total number of voters currently registered within the Jaffna Electoral District.

It cannot be denied that this decline has not been caused voluntarily. It has been due to various circumstances that were the result of the war that prevailed for around three decades and the violent and abnormal situation that prevailed within the Jaffna Electoral District throughout that period. As a consequence of the war, the Jaffna Peninsula, the main population base of the Jaffna Electoral District, was depopulated almost entirely around 1995 and 1996, from which it has not yet fully recovered. People were also compelled to move to areas outside the Jaffna Electoral District as a result of aerial bombing, artillery and rocket launcher fire, combat between the Sri Lankan - almost entirely Sinhala - armed forces and Tamil rebels, as it became utterly unsafe for them to remain in their original residences within the Jaffna Electoral District. Extreme difficulties in regard to food, medical attention, safe shelter, livelihood opportunities and scarcity of other essentials also compelled people to vacate and move out of their original residences within the Jaffna Electoral District.

In the situation prevalent, registration of voters has not been as regular and methodical as at normal times; many voters were not in possession of their National Identity Cards, and consequently their names have been omitted from the voters registers. Peoples attention was more focused on other matters of urgent and immediate concern, such as ensuring their personal safety rather than registering themselves as voters.

A large number of these people took up residence in other parts of the country, have resided with host families in other districts in the North, some have gone to India and some others have gone to other parts of the world. These people have the desire and also the right to return to their original places of residence and be registered as voters within the Jaffna Electoral District. Many of them are unable to do so on account of the existence of a large number of High Security Zones, Restricted Areas controlled by the military and the people being denied the right to resettle in such areas; the excessive presence of the military even in civilian residential areas, several civilian properties are being occupied by the armed

217 218

[ .. ]

2011 10

forces, a suspension of the rule of law and the imposition of a State of Emergency rendering civilian life vulnerable and unsafe, the presence of para-military groups with the blessings of the Government who violate the law brazenly and the overweening culture of impunity still prevails.

A situation of normalcy is yet to return to the Jaffna Electoral District that would enable the displaced people to return to their original places of residence with confidence in regard to their safety and security. The people are also being compelled and are also being compulsorily kept out of their places of habitat and residence by the continued existence of High Security Zones and Restricted Areas.

The vast majority of voters within the Jaffna Electoral District are Tamils. A substantial reduction of their representation in Parliament is tantamount not merely to a denial of their franchise but also to an erosion of their sovereignty.

The Tamil people in the North and East of Sri Lanka have consistently urged paradigm changes in the structure of governance as the only means to achieve genuine reconciliation between the different peoples and ensure that the country does not return to the path of violence with all its evil consequences.

Reduction of the representation of the Jaffna Electoral District would in reality mean, the reduction of effective Tamil representation in Parliament and the denial of equal treatment and political justice to the Tamil people.

The abnormal situation that has prevailed and is yet prevalent within the Jaffna Electoral District, should not be ignored and disregarded. Legal provisions pertaining to representation in Parliament meant to be applicable in normal situations should not be applied to situations which are abnormal and in which people are prevented from returning to their residence and being registered as voters. Such a step would in fact distort the true objective of the said legal provisions intended to guarantee the right to equality in representation in Parliament. This constitutes a perversion which will result in grave injustice to an already deprived and disenchanted people.

It is within the part of the State to preserve the status quo ante, until a situation of normalcy returns to the Jaffna Electoral District and a decision is arrived at in regard to representation from the Jaffna Electoral District to Parliament in normal times.

The Sri Lankan State has thus far disrespected and disregarded the democratic verdicts of the Tamil people. A hasty determination in regard to representation to Parliament from the Jaffna Electoral District can only be interpreted as a deliberate move on the part of the Sri Lankan State to further emasculate the democratic and political freedom of the Tamil people.

Before I conclude, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I may just refer to this one stark and significant fact. The first Parliament after Independence in 1947 had 101 Members: 95 elected and six nominated. Out of those 95 Members, a total of seven Tamil Members were elected from the constituencies comprising the Jaffna Electoral District. The said total of 95 Members in the Sri Lankan Parliament were elected by the people. Sixty four years later, from 1947 to 2011, the representation for the same territory comprising the Jaffna Electoral District is to be reduced from seven to six. After 64 years, the representation in this House from the Jaffna District, which was seven in 1947 will come down to six in 2011. This is a graphic demonstration of how the political strength of the Tamil people is being diluted, and unless reversed, will raise serious questions in regard to this countrys political future.

In the circumstances above defined, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we call upon the Government to take necessary steps to preserve the status quo ante and to prevent a grave injustice.

I thank you. .. ( )

Hence, Mannar basin being a virgin field, Sri Lanka would need to pay more attention on marketing and attracting good investors.

More than fiscal incentives, maintaining credibility, transparency and accountability will be crucial in attracting reputed investors.

A well-structured institutional arrangement should exist for policy formulation, management, regulation, and supervision of oil exploration, development and production.

[4.12 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for giving me this opportunity to partake in this Debate with regard to the Order that has been placed before this House under the Strategic Development Projects Act, No. 14 of 2008.

The proposition of the Government seems to be that nothing is shrouded in secrecy, the tax exemptions that are sought to be granted are laid before this House and therefore there is transparency with regard to the beneficiaries and in this case the oil exploration companies that have been given the task to perform oil exploration in the Mannar Basin and that there is a clear disclosure to this Parliament and to the public as to the strategic importance of these projects and in inviting these contractors to come and invest in oil exploration projects.

This Act, that is, the Strategic Development Projects Act, only enables the Minister to make orders with regard to exemption from applicability of certain taxation provisions. Once a project has been identified as a strategic development project, then Cabinet approval is given and then the Hon. Minister can place before this House his proposals with regard to these exemptions. But, these Acts do not say anything with regard to the choice of the contractor, as to how bids are to be received, as to how the tenders are to be evaluated and how the prospective bidders are chosen. The other provisions of law that apply to projects with regard to the choice of contractors will apply, but unfortunately in this instance, with regard to the Mannar Basin, the choice of contractors who have been granted these different blocks that have been given for oil exploration, as I said before, has been shrouded in secrecy. There have been no bids; there have been no tenders called. Initially the TGS-NOPEC was given the task of doing a survey at their own cost and then to sell that data to prospective oil exploration companies to recover their investment.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer to take the Chair?

. ( ) ( () . - ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Sumedha G. Jayasena - Minister of Parliamentary Affairs) I propose that the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

, ... .

, , ... . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER took the Chair.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, now you can proceed. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir. And, then, any further profit was to be shared with the Government of Sri Lanka. This Agreement with the TGS-NOPEC was signed in the year 2002. But, that was not what happened. Although the contract provides that subsequent to selling the data to prospective oil exploration companies, any further profit was to be shared with the Government of Sri Lanka, that was not honoured. They did the survey, sold the data to two oil exploration companies at a cost of US Dollars two million each and then, in a strange twist of events, the then Minister of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development decided to buy that data back from the TGS-NOPEC for a sum of US Dollars 10 million. So, the country lost US Dollars 10 million for nothing even though in 2002 under the previous regime, a careful contract had been signed whereby any further profits by the TGS-NOPEC was to be shared with Sri Lanka. But, for some reason, that did not come to pass. Even for Sri Lanka to obtain that data from the TGS-NOPEC, a sum of US Dollars 10 million had to be paid and not only that, that data is not used as of date and the Government is spending further sums annually to store that data in Perth, Australia because they cannot keep it here. There is no facility in Sri Lanka to store that data. So, having bought that data from the TGS-NOPEC for such a sum as high as US Dollars 10 million, to date we are paying further sums to store it in Australia.

Thereafter, two blocks were decided to be offered to two foreign States, not companies, but to two foreign States. Now, this is again in violation of the rules and laws. As I said earlier, there must be a tender procedure. That is the general rule. The Strategic Development Projects Act does not exempt any particular lease procedures from that general rule and these two blocks were given to two competing States in the region, perhaps to keep a balance: one to India and the other to China. Nothing whatsoever was gained from the nomination or gifts to these two States and until December, 2007 no exploration was done. The Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat then started putting out roadshows for marketing these other blocks to foreign companies and several million rupees were spent on those roadshows. These were held in London, in Houston and in Kuala Lumpur.

A formal bid notice was issued and the bids were closed on 31st January, 2008. Although what was told was that there were several bids, in fact, that was kept in the dark, no guidelines were issued and only three bids were received. That is very strange because in the public realm, the Minister was quoted that 200 oil companies were

interested. But, in fact bids were received only from three companies. This is the background in which these different blocks in the Mannar Basin are being awarded to companies for the purpose of oil exploration and today we are debating the exemption from tax to those companies.

So, as I said, Sir, at the outset, I am not challenging the fact that in inviting foreign companies to perform an operation such as oil exploration, that you have to attract them with good tax structures and that these exemptions are necessary. I am placing before this House this question as to how these three companies or one out of these three came to be chosen. I am placing before this House the question as to how two States were gifted different blocks ostensibly for oil exploration because no oil exploration has been done there and we really do not know what they are doing from those strategic positions. So, these are the questions that we raise when this Order made by the Minister in terms of the Strategic Development Projects Act, No. 14 of 2008 is placed before this House. I wish some answers are given at this Debate itself with regard to these serious questions that are being raised.

There were other concerns raised by some other speakers this afternoon with regard to a sale of land and the desirability vis-a-vis a sale and a lease. Before I sit down, I want to raise a somewhat different issue but again with regard to land. Now, here we are discussing the Mannar Basin for oil exploration. That is in the Northern Province, in the District of Mannar. Now, we have been confronted with the Circular No. 2011/04 issued by the Lands Commissioner General's Department, which makes a distinction between lands that are situated in the North and East of the country and the rest of the country. We all know that the Northern and the Eastern Provinces although are said to be equal to the other provinces, are not as equal as the other provinces, and this is yet another reminder of the inequality that is made part of the system. Now, in terms of this Circular, alienation of all State lands is suspended forthwith. There is a totally different set of rules that are being brought in, the justification being that since people have been displaced and are coming back, there maybe different land claims and to resolve those claims, a new system is being put into place. But, this has been done in a totally arbitrary manner. Committees have been established with regard to checking titles, resolving disputes of land ownership and in those committees, you find military personnel being appointed. I can understand such a situation when there is some kind of conflict raging. The Governments claim is that the conflict or the violence or the fighting has been brought to an end - and which is true - more than two years ago. After the conclusion of that war, if there are disputes with regard to land ownership - and there will be - particularly, when people have been displaced and come back to reclaim their land, systems must be established. But, those are civilian

259 260

functions. Those are not functions that the military personnel need to get involved in and we take serious exception to this Circular that has come about, which is only applicable to the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, not to the other provinces; the entirety of the Northern Province and the entirety of the Eastern Province where military officers are being given the power to determine or resolve civil disputes with regard to land. We know that for both these provinces, the Governors who have been appointed are retired military personnel. The Government which continuously says that civil administration is being restored and assures and reassures us of that, continues in this vein and now, a further reversal is this new circular that has been issued. I urge the Government to withdraw this Circular. There have been studies by the United Nations bodies - the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees - in 2002 and 2003 during the time of the Ceasefire Agreement, when detailed provisions were suggested as to how one can determine or resolve such disputes and I urge the Government to look at those provisions without resorting to military means all over again with regard to potential civil disputes.

I am bringing this to the notice of the Government with the hope that some sense will prevail. I see only two Cabinet Ministers in the House, the Hon. Minister (Senior) is resting. [Interruption.] Nevertheless, I hope the message will be taken. I hope the Hon. Minister (Senior) who is very conversant with land issues, particularly in the Ampara District, will take this message to the Government. His district is also affected being part of the Eastern Province.

So, Sir, in winding up, I hope the concerns that I have raised with regard to the granting of the rights for oil exploration, the choice of the companies, the decision to gift blocks of lands to two States and also with regard to the other concern that I have raised in respect of land alienation and land dispute resolution in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, will be explained in this House, Thank you very much.
