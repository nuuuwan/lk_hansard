( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) , ( ) 8 , 25 . . ( ) . 2011 12 .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) That is not a point of Order. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No, no. You sit down. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) . . ?

.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , that is not a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) Why?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You cannot raise that as a point of Order. The Standing Orders are very clear on that. ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) If you go through the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, Hon. Deputy Speaker - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I am very sorry. You cannot raise a point of Order under the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act. - [Interruption.] You cannot raise such a point under the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act.

( )

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) He is raising a Question of Privilege, Hon. Deputy Speaker.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The manner in which a Question of Privilege should be raised is stipulated.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) A Question of breach of Privilege can be raised at any time.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) If it is a breach of Privilege, then it can be raised.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Privilege is not only what is in the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, which is limited, but it encompasses other immunities and powers in the House of Commons because that is in the Act. If an Hon. Member sees any breach or an offence of any of the matters mentioned in the House of Commons or in the Privileges Act, you have to hear him out and then only you can give a Ruling.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Member has to give prior notice to the Hon. Speaker.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, all what I am saying is that you have to hear him out before you give a Ruling. You cannot give a Ruling without hearing an Hon. Member.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) If there is such a breach of Privilege, you have to give prior notice to the Hon. Speaker.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) You do not require prior notice. - [Interruption.]

937 938

2011 26

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Speaker, may I clear this? ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) , -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , . , .

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) , -

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) With regard to the matter he is raising, I would like to draw your attention to Standing Order No. 24 (6), where you do not require notice for a motion relating to a matter of Privilege.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) , - ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) That is the procedure. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) No, that is irrelevant, Hon. Leader of the Opposition. It states, " " What he is referring to is not a question or a proposal. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Can I refer to one matter, Hon. Deputy Speaker?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Sir, there are two issues: one is, I am talking about the Standing Orders and the procedure. Then, the Hon. Member is talking of the substance. I do not know the substance. I cannot agree on that. But, all I am saying is this. Standing Order No. 24 states, I quote:

"Unless the Standing Orders otherwise direct, notice shall be given of any motion which it is proposed to make with the exception of the following:- ..."

Then, Standing Order 24(6) states, I quote:

"A motion relating to a matter of privilege" ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What you are referring to is not relevant to what the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara is raising. That is the issue.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) If a matter is being raised under that, you still have to give a ruling whether this is in order or not. What I am only saying is, do not subvert the procedure.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . , , ?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) procedure.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Okay.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I am referring to Standing Order No. 24(6). After that, he can raise what he wants and you may rule it out if it is not in order. - [Interruption.] That I do not know. I do not know what he has raised. I am only talking of the right to raise it.- [Interruption.]

939 940

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please!

( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Yes, Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena, what is your point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is your point of Order, the Hon. Azwer?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, my point of Order is this: the Standing Order is very clear and no one is entitled to question the Order given by the Chair. The Chair has already given an Order. I am surprised that the Hon. Leader of the Opposition does not know the procedure adopted in the House of Commons. Even in the House of Commons, to raise a privilege question, you have to see the Hon. Speker and that practice has been followed right along. And, Sir, more than anything else, you have given a Ruling from the Chair. You have the right of the Speaker. I am very surprised that the Hon. Leader of the Opposition does not know the basic principles. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer, order, please!

( ) (The Presiding Member) I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by both sides of the House on the death of the Hon. (Mrs.) Somakumari Tennakoon, ex-Member of Parliament. I had occasion to meet her for the first time at the DDC Meeting in Puttalam when I was in charge of the Puttalam Electorate, together with the late M.I.B.Hafi, who was a colleague of her's in the Wayamba Provincial Council. We met on common grounds to solve the problems concerning the people of the Puttalam and Kurunegala Districts. I also used to visit Laksala frequently when she was appointed as its Chairman, together with my foreign friends and relatives to purchase handicrafts. She also showed a keen interest in developing the Jana Kala Kendraya near Diyawanna Oya. She was indeed a graceful lady and always wore a smile on her face.

.

We will now take up the Vote of Condolence on the Hon. R.M. Dharmadasa Banda.
