To win the economic war, we have to build the local economy. To build the local economy, we have to get the participation of the local economic actors - local industries, small and medium industries and local companies. But, in this case, they are only giving the opportunity to the foreigners, not to the locals. In that case, we are not going to win the economic war.

We are an island of prosperity in an ocean of poverty. But, the reality is the other way round. We are in an ocean of prosperity in an island of poverty. That is the difference. The Hon.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Pension Fund is a pooled fund that can be used by the Government for just normal expenditure in any way.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) How is that? Where is that provision?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If you do not know- ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) No, show me the provision.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I do not need to teach you.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) You cannot make a bare statement -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am making a very direct accusation on the Government as a person knowing what is there.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) You cannot do that unless you show under which provision it comes.

993 994

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) A common Consolidated Fund can be used for anything. [Interruption.] Hon. Minister, I had respect for you. You go to the Ministry of Finance and Planning and learn your ABCs without shouting. I am not here to teach you the ABCs of finance. I am basically saying that a Consolidated Fund can be used for anything. A Pensions Fund gets into a Consolidated Fund unlike the EPF which is a specific fund. That is the difference. You do not understand that. You are trying to shift from a specific fund to a general fund. That was there in the letter to the IMF dated 9th July, 2010 signed by the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama and Mr. Ajith Nivad Cabral.

, . ; . [ ] ( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! Hon. Member, I am also very much concerned about cricket, but let us play the game with a straight bat and come back to the subject.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Hon. Presiding Member is telling me to play the cricket with a straight bat and I will do so. ( ) (The Presiding Member) And, come back to the subject. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I want the crooked doctors to be brought to book. That is the issue. ( ) (The Presiding Member) My worry is whether this is coming under the Regulations that we are discussing. Why do you not move another Motion? I would advise you to do so. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) According to Article 148, Parliament has control over all finances. But, you have monies that are being used by these quack doctors. They are using our money which we should control. Upul Tharanga is one of our star batsmen. He could not go to England because of one of these quack doctors. Parliament allocates money to these quack doctors and ruins our cricket. So, these are the issues that I want to bring to your notice.

( ) (An Hon. Member) The countrys image - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, it is a question of the countrys image.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Who paid for his medical expenses?

1003 1004

2011 07

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, we are informed that it has been paid from the Presidents Fund. I mean, this lavish display of funds, are they not our money? That is what we are concerned about. ( ) (The Presiding Member) No, no. Payment by the Presidents Fund is one thing and medication is a separate thing. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, certainly. That is why I say that you should go after these quack doctors. The Government did a good job. The Hon. Maithripala Sirisena must be congratulated for taking that decision. You should go after these quack doctors. Though there is Executive patronage, that does not mean that you have to protect that person. What I am basically saying is that it is the image of the cricketers, the image of our country that is affected. It has gone all over the world that there is a cricketer charged on doping. So, that is a hell of a charge. Do you not think so? Anyway, I just thought that I should mention this.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I can give you five minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) There you are! Mr. Presiding Member, you can see the solidarity in our party.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Are you giving him extra five runs?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Five minutes.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Okay, you are giving him extra five runs.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, all I can basically say is, ensure that these things are done.
