( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Anoma Gamage) .

Hon. Minister, my first Supplementary Question is - the Hon. Minister of Finance stated that he will be implementing a loan scheme with an 8 per cent interest for the livestock sector - whether it is applicable to the poultry sector also because it was stated that it is applicable only for the livestock sector, mainly for the dairy farmers?

( ) (The Hon. Arumugan Thondaman) Yes, it is applicable.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Anoma Gamage) Then, I want to know whether the Government is planning to import eggs and chicken continuously.

( ) (The Hon. Arumugan Thondaman) Import of eggs and chicken does not come under me. You will have to ask that from the Minister of Co-operatives and Internal Trade.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Anoma Gamage) But, you have to see that it is not done.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, the Hon. Minister has given the answer.

( ) (The Hon. Arumugan Thondaman) There is a group trying to carry out a mafia with the poultry industry. But, as of now -we had a shortage - it is coming under control.

( ) (The Hon. Arumugan Thondaman) My part is only to see how we can increase the production locally. We are taking action on that. With regard to the importing of chicken, eggs and all that, you ask from the Minister of Co-operatives and Internal Trade. On our part, we import day-old chicks and we are trying to increase the number of day-old chicks produced in this country, by which we will get over the present problem.

( ) (The Hon. Arumugan Thondaman) This is not an issue which has cropped up yesterday or the day before yesterday. It has been coming down for some time. So, what we are trying to do is to rectify it. Now, we are getting back the hatcheries into operation. We are going to open up a new hatchery in Batticaloa also.

. [ . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) No, it says, ..the value of which does not exceed rupees five

[ ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Rupees five? - [Interruption.] That is a very serious one. Anyway, all of these will be amended because we have looked at them.

. [ . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) So, what will be the amount?

[ ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) It is Rupees 5,000. Rupees 5,000 is the amount but there have been a printing mistakes in both the Sinhala and English copies. So, I will try to correct them during the Committee Stage.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, in this countrys history of dispute resolution, we have recourse to courts for cases. Then, we have the arbitration proceedings and we have also introduced the procedure of going before the Mediation Boards. This was introduced in 1988 but it came into operation somewhere in 1999. When I started this Debate, I explained in Sinhala that we have a history of almost 20 years of experience in the Mediation Board system. In 2009, two years ago, almost 124,000 cases had gone before the

1009 1010

2011 21

Mediation Boards and a recent survey has indicated that almost 60 per cent of the cases that go before the Mediation Boards get resolved. Therefore, this is a very good system.

This morning, in my Ministry, the officials of the British High Commission and the officials of the Asia Foundation were present in having prepared a trainers' manual and a trainee manual for the Members of the Mediation Board and they have been presented to us. It was done after a careful study of the functioning of the Mediation Boards in this country and I would dare say that the Mediation Board system is a success story of our nation. For the last 20 years, when you look at the way in which we have functioned and the amount of cases that have gone before them, the surveys also indicate the satisfactory levels, and the users of the Mediation Board process have also indicated to us the success levels and you can see that this is indeed a success story in our country.

[ ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Minister, the system of Conciliation Boards which prevailed in 1950s had been abolished and it was reintroduced in 1988.

[ ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Thank you, very much. In fact, this replaced that. The Presidents Counsel, my Colleague, the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe reminded me about the Conciliation Boards. As you know, this came into being after the Conciliation Boards were done away with. Now, we find that our system has been taken as a model for countries like China, Nepal and they have begun to study the system of Mediation Boards in our country and have decided to adopt our model to try and introduce this alternate dispute resolution mechanism. This is a new discipline in many universities as well. Dispute resolution and meditation has become a very specialized field of study and having looked at the functioning of our Mediation Boards, the Ministry decided to engage the Asia Foundation under the auspices of the British High Commission to prepare a trainers' manual as well as a trainee manual and we would use that in order to train both the officials of the Mediation Board as well as our trainers. In fact, we conduct a five-day training programme for mediators the moment the Members of the Mediation Board are selected. The selection process is done after a Gazette Notification. There again, we find that there are certain recommendations that have been made to improve the system further, and maybe during the course of the year they will be implemented.

This morning I met the former Supreme Court Judge, Hector Yapa, the Chairman of the Mediation Boards Commission.

In fact, we discussed this matter in the morning when these manuals were presented. I told him our Ministry will take steps to introduce further amendments to improve the standard quality and service delivery of the Mediation Boards in this country, and hopefully towards the latter part of the year, having discussed this matter with the necessary stakeholders, I would like to introduce further amendments. In the meantime, we have also recognized certain shortcomings in diversity among mediators and mediator trainers. We have responded with plans to overcome these challenges. These plans have not been rigorously applied as yet while the Ministry of Justice has clearly recognized gender and ethnic diversity as important issues. There is also a need to consider diversity in terms of expertise and profession among the mediators as well as engaging youth in this programme.

As a matter of fact, we are also now looking at the possibility of introducing the Mediation Board mechanism into our university systems. As you see, we find many disputes arising within the universities. Therefore, the young and radical university population in our country often get on to the streets for protesting about various administrative problems. We would like to see whether we could try and introduce this system within the university area so that this could be an alternate dispute resolution mechanism that could bring some relief in those areas. [ ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Member, your have only two more minutes. [ ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I know I have to wind up. Please give me one or two minutes just to say a few words in Tamil as well, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees because what I am going to say is relevant to your area, the Northern Province.

I would also like to thank the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Minister of Justice, for bringing in a very meaningful amendment.

After a case is filed in the District Court, - the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, as a legal practitioner knows very well about this - you can appeal to the Court of Appeal and to the Supreme Court, and for you to get the

fruits of the judgment, it will take a minimum of 10 years. So, earlier if the debt, demand or damage was less than Rs. 25,000 then, you could go to the Mediation Board. But, now, this amendment has become meaningful, especially with the vision of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, that laws should be accessible to the common man. When it is less than Rs. 250,000, you would see the workload in the court dropping. If it is a case of less than Rs. 250,000 and if you retain somebody like the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, it will cost you more than Rs. 250,000.

So, I would like to say, when the debt, demand or damage is less than Rs. 250,000, most counsels advise not to go to courts. Therefore, with this amendment, the poor man would be able to find a solution to his problems. In addition, the Mediation Boards have proved to be a success where 50 per cent of the disputes have been sorted out. We saw earlier, due to parate execution people losing their houses overnight when courts used the Debt Recovery Act and passed a resolution. But, thanks to the vision of His Excellency the President, for debts less than Rupees five million, you do not have to go by parate execution and thereby, again safeguarding the common man of this country. Further, alternative dispute resolution has proved to be successful. Even with regard to commercial litigation, you can see the Arbitration Act coming into being. Therefore, once again I welcome this amendment and I believe that the poor man of this country will benefit by this amendment because earlier it was only with regard to Rs. 25,000. One could say it is only a certification but when you go to a court, it is confrontational and adversarial. Therefore, when parties discuss at a Mediation Board, I am sure they would be able to reach an amicable settlement without going into the facts. You go into litigation to find out who is right and who is wrong but here, it is a conducive environment for parties to discuss and reach an amicable settlement. Once again, I am thankful for this opportunity given to me to speak on this Bill.

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Mr. Presiding Member, I think this amendment brought in relation to the Mediation Boards Act is timely, important and appropriate. As the Hon. Minister stated, the Mediation Boards Act was introduced as far back as in 1988 but we must not forget the fact that this conciliation procedure was a part of our legal system, which had been ingrained even during the colonial period. Earlier, we had one Act called the Conciliation Board Act, which is something similar to this Mediation Boards Act. But, apparently and unfortunately, we failed in our efforts under the Conciliation Board Act and after some time, that was abolished by the legislature. I also

1029 1030

[ . ]

2011 21

must not forget to state to this august Assembly that the Conciliation Board failed basically due to interference by politicians. Especially when appointments were made as Members to the Conciliation Board, there were a lot of political interferences and pressure. When people who are involved in politics are appointed as Members to the Conciliation Board, people lose faith in that system. That was the main reason why it was abolished. Again, when there was a serious congestion in our courthouses. Under the normal laws of the country, the legislature thought that it was high time to make another effort to bring in a conciliation procedure. As a result, in 1988 this Mediation Boards Act was introduced and enacted. Certain statistics were mentioned by the Hon. Minister. Overall, there is no doubt. We can be satisfied with the performance of the Mediation Boards functioning in every part of the country. But, I must insist the fact that in the recent past, there were certain elements raising their ugly heads in relation to the appointment of members to the Mediation Boards. Sometimes politics is involved in Mediation Boards in certain areas. If it happens, again people will lose confidence. Therefore, it is the foremost responsibility cast upon the Ministry to ensure that all these appointments are made on an apolitical basis without any interference or influence. Otherwise, we might again and again fail in this system and people might lose their confidence in the system. Therefore, I urge the Government to ensure that everything is done on an apolitical basis because it is a part of the judicial process.

. . Question proposed. ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL THEATRE FOR PERFORMING ARTS ( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I move,

"In view of the importance of the performing arts for education as well as national integration, this House do stand adjourned to urge the establishment of a National Theatre that would:

a) establish a theatre group able to perform in all three national languages;

b) introduce high level training in performance and production, including the capacity to develop productions for touring islandwide;

c) encourage productions that use other art forms, in particular music and dance, to promote wider understanding of pluralistic cultural traditions;

d) develop links with the broadcasting media to ensure wider dissemination of productions and

e) act as a flagship for provincial and other troupes while providing opportunities to showcase local talent."

Sir, I am very pleased to be able to speak on this Adjournment Motion today which I first suggested a few months ago. The main reason for advancing this is that it is based on a principle -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer to take the Chair?

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) I propose that the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to. , ... .

, , ... . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER took the Chair.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you can continue. ( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Sir, the main reason for proposing this Motion is that it is based on a principle that has proved extremely effective in helping to build up nations that are in situations like our own. The main purpose of this Motion is to encourage the Ministry of Cultural Affairs to set up a national theatre that will act as a catalyst not only for artistic purposes but also for the purpose of nation building by bringing together many people from all over this country to work together. As you know, the arts is an extremely good instrument of building up discipline and socialization and it is a pity that we have not got anything of the sort. If you look at several countries near our own, for instance, India and China have done a lot of investment in the arts and this has not only produced very disciplined young people but created a sense of togetherness since people come from all over the country to work together. This is not something that Sri Lanka has spent much attention on over the last few decades and it shows, because there are a few areas in which our young people can work together, can feel a spirit of competition, can try to do their best to reach standards of excellence in which they will have to co-operate with each other.

There have been some attempts at this in the past. For instance, the National Youth Services Council developed a dance troupe that tries to showcase a lot of excellent items from all over the county together. Certainly, this idea has been at the basis of a lot of work done. For instance, if we look at the programme for the Independence Day festival which will take place on the 4th of February in Kataragama, the young people of the entire Uva Province will come together to perform in a range of artistic activities that will showcase a lot of the different styles of art practised by the many citizens of this multicultural nation.

In a sense, we should not be happy with only festival events, but there should be a long sustained programme of training. I am very happy that long after I put this Motion as a suggestion, the Ministry of Culture and the Arts has moved in a more active way towards the

1057 1058

2011 21

promotion of multiculturalism. The cultural centres that they plan all over the country should be a showcase for this purpose and very recently they have written to all district secretaries stressing the need for multiculturalism. I hope that this will lead to all Public servants being aware of the need for this. But, this particular Motion, Sir, dwells on the subject of a national theatre and this is something that I think is particularly important because theatre is something that brings together many art forms and which also encourages communication in a very direct fashion. Even though I think we can be very optimistic about the effects of things like dance, of things like the plastic arts, of the visual arts, of paintings and of sculpture in encouraging self expression; there is something very, very special about the spoken word. There is something very special about groups of people getting together for getting themselves in an attempt to work together to put on an artistic production. It is extremely important that communication and skills in developing contacts with other people are developed amongst the youngsters of this country who come from such diverse backgrounds and a national theatre will certainly help in that respect. It will also be a spur to one of the fundamental principles of the "Mahinda Chintana" that this country has endorsed so resoundingly over the last few years and that is the principle of multilingualism.

Theatre alone, amongst the arts, will ensure the encouragement of learning other languages. There have been attempts, most notably in the University of Colombo to have bilingual and trilingual productions. But, these again are events that happened as one-offs. What is important is a group of young people working together in a sustained fashion to understand each other; to speak each others languages; to be sympathetic and understanding about the different nuances that will be expressed in the different languages, and that is why I think theatre is so particularly important.

Another aspect of this Motion that I have advanced - I hope it will be possible for the Hon. Minister of Culture and the Arts to take this up - is that such a theatre group should also engage in high-level training for both performance and production and develop productions for touring islandwide. Although in the past we have had a great tradition of drama by amateurs, when we read the records of the work done by such people, most recently the extremely interesting account by Henry Jayasena of his many years of work in theatre all over the country, we realized how difficult it was for artistes to work at the widest possible levels and that is an area in which most countries have a subsidized national theatre that will not only work in the capital but will move towards the provinces.

I have also suggested that such a theatre does not concentrate only on what you might call "pure theatre", that adduces other art forms, in particular, music and dance that will promote understanding of wider cultural traditions.

This of course is something that again this country has seen in a magnificent fashion in some of the greatest productions of theatre as with the seminal place of Prof. Sarathchandra where many arts forms are used together. But, that tradition seems to be fading and we need a little input from the State in order to develop that whole system of a holistic approach to theatre. That is why I hope that that element too will be encouraged. I think we also need to develop links with the broadcasting media because although at the moment we have a flourishing teledrama industry, it really does not act in the course of high art and of art that can engage in the understanding that a national theatre could do.

Finally, I think a national theatre of this sort could actually help with highlighting and foregrounding regional talent. After I drafted this Motion, I saw the enormous impact that can be had by the theatre, the Performing Arts Centre, that is being built for us with the assistance of the Chinese Government and the way it has developed so rapidly over the very short period, the last six months, to turn into a really beautiful building, which means that it will be an appropriate place to house such a national theatre and correspondingly such a beautiful building deserves a national theatre and should not be left on its own. I think the Hon. Minister of Culture and the Arts has inherited a very fortunate portfolio at the right time, in that, he will have this theatre to inaugurate over the next year. I hope that it will be seen not only as a building to have particular events occasionally, but that it will also be seen as an essential part of the nation building process. For this reason, Sir, I welcome this opportunity to highlight the need for such a theatre and the need to work towards the nation building in which many other countries have used arts so effectively.

Thank you.
