517 518

(2nd Start)

(i) performance indicators for judges and magistrates that encourage swift decisions and discourage applications for and agreements to dates that delay justice ;

(ii) an enlightened sentencing policy to reduce congestion in prisons and inappropriate penalties for young persons ;

(iii) mechanisms for arbitration and conciliation that reduce recourse to confrontation through judicial action; and

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) - [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . , - [ ] ( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) May I ask the first supplementary Question?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yes.

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) I am sorry the Hon. Minister concerned is not here but the work that has been done, I think is very impressive. What steps are being taken to implement the reports that have already come in and also to share them with other relevant Ministries because from the time these Ministries were set up, I think there has been a diversity of responsibilities? In particular, the report, I believe, on children had a lot of very important recommendations. Has that been shared with other Ministries and also with the new Human Rights Commission? Will action be taken to work on implementing them very quickly in view of the great injustices committed to children under the prevailing old systems?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . . , '' '' , . ( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Thank you. My second Supplementary Question relates to the sentencing policies which, as the Hon. Minister says, are being reformed very quickly at the moment and I know that the former Minister of Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms also did a lot of work in that respect. However, institutionalizing such reforms is taking some time. So, could I know whether steps have already been taken to acquaint the judges and the magistrates with these new policies? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , . . ( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Thank you, Whip. Earlier, when we discussed it with the former Minister, not much had been going on in this area. But, I am glad that at least reforms have been started.

My third Supplementary Question deals with reforms pertaining to women. I noticed that there is only one committee on Family Law. So, what steps will be taken to move towards reform of very ancient British Legislation, like the Vagrants Ordinance, according to which a lot of abuse is taking place?

( ) (An Hon. Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . , that there was a rock there, which was eight metres in height? The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, you were the former Minister of Port Development. You and I both argued about this but, now of course, justice has overridden the reality. What is to be done? There is a port which has no ships coming in. Are you telling me that today you can have a different approach? You have the Port of Colombo that is under-utilized and the same situation prevails with the Port of Galle and the Port of Trincomalee, one of the best natural ports in the world. So, on that score, there should not be over-duplication of national assets in this country. There is a necessity and there is an equitable return that has got to be obtained. Today, you have the Indian container transshipment that has come about. They are competing fiercely. As you know, almost 79 per cent of the container transshipment of Sri Lanka is of Indian origin. So, what will happen if the Indian ports get together and ensure that they stop the shipments coming to Colombo? Because all what they have got to do is, just capture the mother vessels that are coming here.

Another matter is, a Dubai Terminal has been started in Cochin, which is absolutely detrimental to our shipping policy. I am happy that you are a knowledgeable Minister even though we may share two different political views at this particular moment. So, ensure that you reawaken the Government from the slumber because they do not have the business acumen in running the economy. They will talk of the GDP increase; they will talk of the downward trend of inflation but at the end of the day, they do not realize that money is not percolating down to the people. That is the stark reality. The increase in the per capita income does not necessarily mean that you have given an equal opportunity to everybody.

Hon. Minister, I will come back to the subject. You said that you will respond to me. I hope you will give a justifiable, a justice-oriented response to my question.

Who are they to tell us not to increase salaries? - [Interruption.] You all have signed.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, before moving on to the subject matter, I thought I should thank the voters who had placed their faith in our party and the governing UPFA and for returning us victorious in many local authorities. I must also say that the Commissioner of Elections, within the powers vested in him, conducted a very fair and free election. In that process, there may have been a few incidents here and there, but overall, we witnessed an election where the free will of the people was expressed. Once again, I would like to thank all those voters who placed their faith in the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress when it contested separately for many councils and also when we contested together with the governing UPFA, for having returned our members and having installed us in power in those councils, where we have managed to capture power.

Having said that, Sir, I thought it is somewhat appropriate for me to deal with the subject of port development and the criticism the Opposition is levelling against the Government, particularly when it comes to the construction of the Hambantota Port. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, in his address today, pointedly asked me as to whether I could justify this enormous expenditure on port development, particularly on the Hambantota Port, especially from the point of view of a former Minister of Port Development in this country. I would like to tell him very humbly that during the UNP regime, where I held that portfolio, a similar request was made by your own Members from that area: by the Hon. Ananda Kularatne, by his bete noire, the Hon. Sajith Premadasa, and various others. The then Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, did ask me to do a feasibility study and we did. But then, it was quite difficult for us to go ahead because there was a delay in obtaining funds.

Then, His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa, having been elected with an overwhelming

591 592

[ ]

2011 23

mandate repeatedly from the entire nation, had to show his indebtedness to his own constituency. Your own people in that same constituency wanted you to develop that port and you could not do it. Now that his Excellency the President has constructed it, you are trying to criticize him. How fair is this whole issue? I heard the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe calling it the "biggest swimming pool" in the country. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake also directed questions as to whether there were ships calling at the Hambantota Port.

The Hon. Ravi Karunanayaka knows the concept of a greenfield port. A greenfield port is a port constructed where a port never existed. So, that type of port will take time to develop, but in that vision, you have to take into account the need for development of infrastructure in a country. It is estimated that the entire South-East Asian and the South Asian regions right now need at least 85 terminals because of the growth in the Asian region. The Hon. Member will admit that port development in this country is 20 years behind schedule and to be very fair by His Excellency the President, not only did he construct the Hambantota Port, but is also simultaneously developing the Colombo South Port with the terminals being developed there. The terminals will be unique in the entire South Asian region, which will take in the next generation vessels that has 18,000 TEUs in one vessel.

So, that is the type of development this regime is implementing and you have to supplement - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Colombo South Port development needs to be done. You basically said that the feasibility study was to develop a deep sea port in Hambantota with dry docks and for deep-sea bunkering, not to dig it inland and make a port. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, if we are to build a breakwater in the Hambantota area, the cost would have been very high. - [Interruption.] That is why they decided to bring it inland and construct the port in that fashion. Initially, that is supposed to be an industrial port and a Request for Proposals have been called. - [Interruption.] At a next phase, you can always open it out to the sea - the draft is very deep in the Southern area - when funds are available, when the port becomes operational and when it becomes a transshipment hub. It is understood and all shipping experts agree - it is on the main maritime lane in the South - that it is the most feasible project that has been implemented. If you take the Indian subcontinent, the traffic on the Western Indian coast is being serviced by Dubai and that on the Eastern Indian coast is being serviced by Singapore, and Sri Lanka is in a unique position where we can service both sides of the

Indian coast, the West and the East, equally without any trouble. We can also take into account the deviation time of vessels calling at ports. Vallarpadam Port in Kerala, which India has developed, is charging almost US Dollars 12,000 as port levy from ships that call there whereas we are only charging US Dollars 4,000 in Colombo. They are now taking on Colombo and they will have to bring their cost down. Almost two-thirds of their cost had to be brought down in order to compete with Colombo. That being the situation.- [Interruption.] Yes. But, the Hambantota Port was opened only last year. So, do not be in a hurry. Wait for Hambantota Port to develop. Once it develops, that would be the cheapest port in the entire region because that is closer to the maritime lane. Everybody knows that. The UNP Government at that time tried to build it. They could not access the funds. Now, you are criticizing His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa for having implemented that mega project. I am telling you, I, being the Minister of Port Development and Shipping at that time, did try, but we could not get the funds; we could not access it at the rate we were expecting.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Do not utter an untruth, Hon. Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, we did. It is not an untruth.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What was the deterrent?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The then Prime Minister knows it. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) During the Presidential Election, you went to Hambantota and said that type of thing could not be done.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No. - [Interruption.] Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, you must not hide facts. - [Interruption.] You are the owner of a mega logistics transport company and recently, you invested in many a number of vehicles; a news item which appeared in the newspapers stated so. Why are you investing, if the investment climate is not improving? - [Interruption.] It is improving. That is why you are

593 594

investing. - [Interruption.] You called all the advertising agencies and published in the business pages of all the newspapers - you were there in the photographs - that you have imported a massive number of vehicles. - [Interruption.] You are investing because the investment climate is good and now, you are criticizing the infrastructure development in this country. You cannot put your foot in the mouth when you speak in the House. Particularly, look at your own conduct. Your own conduct shows that you are quite happy with the economy. You must admit it and you must also pay credit to His Excellency the President. Fighting a very ferocious terrorist organization in the entire world, simultaneously, he did not stop investment in infrastructure in the country. The development of the Colombo South Port was not stopped, the construction of the Hambantota Port was not stopped and also the construction of the Oluvil Port continued. All along the shores of this country, ports were developed while we were fighting the LTTE. Give credit to a Government which had done that. At that time, credit at low cost was not even available. Sometimes we had to borrow at commercial rates because that seemed to be wise. We are 20 years behind in our port development strategy. Having developed the ports, you are now asking Where are the ships? Why is this being developed?, without understanding that this is a greenfield port. You have to have a marketing plan. Request for Proposals have been called for cement terminals, LP gas terminals and fertilizer terminals, which will have to be built for ships to start calling in. Then, bunkering facilities have to be there. Our bunkering costs compared to Singapore, of course, is a little high, but when larger ships start calling in, since we are on the main maritime route, our costs will come down. This is a fact. When the terminals are built and when we are able to refine oil in those areas, we will be able to supply bunkers at a competitive rate. That is a fact. That is why today even India is admitting that the Colombo Port is three times cheaper than places like Vellarpadam in Kerala, because we have developed it into a hub position. The same hub status will come to us when the Hambantota Port is fully operational. It is in the very initial stages and that will happen.

You are basking in geopolitical rivalry and bringing in issues as to why we did borrow from China and various other things, which are immaterial to our Government, because we have a foreign policy which can handle all these big powers with an even-handed approach. We have not had any difficulty in looking at the concerns of all our friends and have addressed this issue. But then, nobody should tell us you should not develop, because all experts in the shipping and maritime industry agree that we are 20 years behind in our port development activities. It is during His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksas period as the President and also as the Minister of Ports and Highways that this golden era of port development had taken place in this country.

Having said that, I must also say that it is important for us to bear in mind that in the proposals of His Excellency the President, it is hoped that the port and port-related industries sector will contribute at least 40 per cent to the GDP of Sri Lanka by the year 2014. That is such a high benchmark that we have kept for port and port-related activities. Together with that, we hope to see two mega ports, both Colombo and Hambantota, being fully operational. It would become a major pivot for the Sri Lankan economy. This will be done of course with the support of the private sector. We have always said that this strategy of involving the private sector in developing our port-related activities is already on steam. Request for Proposals have been called for and all these port- related activities will be boosted in the near future - bunkering, cement, fertilizer, sugar, LP Gas and Ro-ro handling about the transshipment of vessels will also be implemented in these two mega ports that this country has got.

Together with the Trincomalee Port, the Oluvil Port is now becoming operational. I am particularly proud and happy as the Minister, who at that time initiated this project with Danish assistance. His Excellency the President has gone ahead despite concerns that certain people were expressing about developing a port in Oluvil. He had faith in the vision, which we had in the past and has gone ahead. We hope to invite His Excellency the President to open the Port of Oluvil very soon.

Having said that, Mr. Deputy Chairman, we also must bear in mind that there is a proposal to have minimal involvement of the customs in the Magampura Port where we will allow investors to value add, pack, assemble with all duty-free and tax free facilities so that this will become a logistical hub to promote exports through value addition in our country and there would be no need to pay anything other than the port charges for the exports within the port. But, if anyone is interested to get into the local market from there, could do so after adhering to the normal procedures and paying the necessary taxes and duties.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, you will have to wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, I will wind up by saying that the entire port development strategy by His Excellency the President is indeed very timely, efficient and far-thinking, and it is accepted by many maritime experts, as a golden period in the port development history of Sri Lanka.

Thank you.

MILITARY INTERVENTION IN LIBYA BY WESTERN ALLIANCE

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I move the following Adjournment Motion that is in my name:

"The Military attack presently carried on in the Libyan Jamahiriya has caused great consternation and bewilderment throughout the world.

The indiscriminate bombings by the Western Alliance have already caused loss of human lives and destruction to places of worship and other buildings.

The military intervention in Libya by the joined forces of America, the UK and France has raised a huge uproar throughout the world. This is an act of blatant violation of the UN Charter. Some of these countries responsible for death of over one and a half million civilians in Iraq and in Afghanistan were also accomplices on the crimes against the Palestinian people. They stand by and watch as the Zionist Israelis massacre innocent Palestinians. This has been continuing for over five decades. The international media opines that the military intervention in Libya is directed both to secure access to oil resources and to bring strong military presence in this region which would be a potential danger to the Arab and Muslim World in the future.

The conscience of the world community is highly disturbed by this deliberate violation of human rights and the violation of the United Nations Charter on Non-interference on the internal affairs of other countries.

This Parliament therefore appeals to all people and Governments to cry an immediate halt to the attack carried on by the Western Alliance on Libya and also recognize the honour, dignity and the free will of the people of the Libyan Jamahiriya to decide their future course of action by themselves." Sir, the Almighty God has not abdicated his almighty power and given that power to any nation to invade another country and carry on aggression in that country. Now, this is being done by the so-called superpowers. The whole world is crying out: "Stop it, stop it!" They want this to be stopped. Now, what is happening in Libya? It is rather sad. It is a challenge to the right-thinking people of the world, the common sense and the conscience of the people and it is an affront to world peace and justice.

Sir, in a country, if somebody wants to change the ruler, the administration or the government, it is purely the business of the people of that country to do so. There was this war - LTTE terrorism - in our country for the last 30 years completely endangering our lives and almost threatened the annihilation of the nation. Now, suppose, if some so-called super powers came to Prabhakarans

609 610

place and said, Stop the war and if our President did not heed to such request, what would be the fate of this country? Now, this is the real threat that people all over are facing.

You look back at Egypt 60 years ago, there was the King Farouk. He was overthrown via a military coup by the Free Officers Movement of Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1952. Later, they both were Presidents at various times. Now, that is the will of the people; the people rose up and deposed the King of that country. The Shah of Iran, Muhammed Reza Phalavi too suffered the same fate in 1979.

What is happening in Libya today is the continuity of imperialism, which malady has spread over the globe after the collapse of colonialism. The oilfields offer grand incentives for the imperialist forces to move in under the guise of protecting the masses of that country. Evidently, vested interest in usurping the Black Gold which are awaiting to be reaped. Western interests are foremost when it comes to establish so-called democracy in specific Middle-Eastern countries.

We see the fate of the poor Palestinians who are massacred by Israel, day in and day out. Where is justice there? It is really double standard in weighing justice. If you apply the same yardstick that the Western powers are applying in Libya today, who is the power that will bomb Israel? These are questions the people must ask. The world must rise up. No more can the people sleep.

, , . . ? , - colonial powers - ; .. . , .. . .

What is so sensitive about establishing democracy in Libya? There is hardly a whimper from the West as far as those autocracies are concerned.

Now, there is a new disease that is spreading in the ranks of the United National Party. , . , , . , . , . , , ,

. The UNP is always an enemy of anyone who is a friend of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. . . . ; . Muammar al-Gaddafi, King Abdul-Aziz of Saudi Arabia and all the others including Hosni Mubarak, Dr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa of Qatar, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan of UAE, Sheikh Salman bin Khalifa of Bahrain, Sheikh Salim al-Sabah of Kuwait, Sultan bin Qaboos of Oman are all friends of our President; no doubt, they are all friends of Sri Lanka. These friendships are based on the concept of the "Mahinda Chintana - Nawa Dekma". That is the clear foreign policy that this Government is following now. Whether it be the West or the East, we are friends of all. During the war, America up to Japan, India, Pakistan, all these countries helped us at the crucial stages.

Yesterday, His Excellency the President commissioned the Norachcholai Coal Power Plant. There was a time we were without oil. We were to be sunk in darkness. At that time Iran helped us. We cannot forget this timely help. After all, we are human beings. That is the majestic quality of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. These friends therefore, automatically turn out to be enemies of UNP. That is why they are against Hosni Mubarak and Muammar al-Gaddafi. If the people of Libya wanted a change in leadership, they could do on their own will. Now, this "Mahinda Chintana" has been tested thrice over in the country. People gave their mandate after mandate at several elections : Presidential Election, Parliamentary Election, Local Government Election, and now, quite recently in the Pradeshiya Sabha Election. People are voting for His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa into power in accordance with this "Mahinda Chintana". I always carry a copy of this document wherever I go. If somebody would dare come and say you are staying too long in that position and therefore get out, as self-respecting people could we do it? Nonsense!

? . . .

. ? ? , , , . . . - [ ] , . . Now, I would like to ask what the Opposition is doing to assert its defiance against such atrocities in Libya and other places in the Middle East. There are also UNP people who desist imperialism at grass-roots level. . ? Where are the free media people now? When there is a fall

611 612

of a leaf, they jump into the compound of the Fort Railway Station. The Fort Railway Station and the Lipton Circus are ghost-ridden with such UNP stalwarts and the free media is silent today. But, I must emphasize here, Sir, the Muslim Media Forum led by Mr. N.M. Ameen, a well-known senior journalist had issued a very fine statement containing imperialist aggression on Libya. It states, I quote: Sri Lanka Muslim Media Forum vehemently condemns the brutal attack on Libya by the US-NATO forces. It is reported that hundreds of innocent people have been killed... by American bombing. It further states, I quote:

.....and even hospitals have been bombed. It is no doubt that this illegal military operation is intent upon establishing US/Western hegemony in North Africa. Libya has the largest oil reserves in Africa. It is evident that the armed insurgency in Libya was directly supported by foreign powers to topple Ghaddafi regime and take control of Libyan oil reserve. US and NATO military advisors and special forces were already on the ground. The operation was planned to coincide with the protest movement in neighbouring Arab countries. Public opinion was led to believe that the protest movement had spread spontaneously from Tunisia and Egypt to Libya. An invasion of Libya under a humanitarian mandate would serve the same corporate interest as the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq. The underlying objective is to take possession of Libyas oil reserves, destabilize the National Oil Corporation.(NOC) and eventually privatize the countrys oil industry, namely transfer the control and ownership of Libyas oil well into foreign hands. The heads of state and heads of government of NATO countries are the architects of war and destruction in Iraq and Afghanistan. In an utterly twisted logic, they are heralded as the voices of reason, as the representatives of the international community. We call upon all peace-loving people of the world to stand united against this heinous crime against humanity by the so-called super powers under the pretext of safeguarding human rights. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! The Hon. Azwer, you have almost taken 15 minutes. Do you want to continue or leave time for other speakers?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sure, Sir. One thing is that the UNP has abdicated and they have left the House in toto when we are discussing the situation in Libya. Our Foreign Minister wants 12 minutes. We will be giving him time.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Now you have to wind up your speech. You have taken 15 minutes.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I will wind my speech up now. I am the mover of this Motion

Therefore, Sir, the All Ceylon Jammiyethul Ulema has issued a very fine statement and also the President of the Ulama Katchchi, Alhaj Moulavi Mubarak Abdul Majeed has also issued a statement. This is not purely a Muslim affair. But, we and the Moulavis, are expected to pray for world peace, for the salvation of humanity. Therefore, today we are appealing to all the Mosques to have prayers so that their aggressor will be defeated.

Sir, people think they are mighty Lords. That era has gone. There have been Firauns in the history of Islam and the world. They vanished from the phase of the Earth in no time because of their vanity. This is what the Holy Quran says, Sir. Sura 14, Verse 42 states, I quote:

I have in my hand the translation of that Verse in Sura 14 of the Holy Quran by Alama Usuf Ali. I quote: Think not that Allah Doth not heed the deeds Of those who do wrong. He but giveth them respite Against a Day when The eyes will fixedly stare In horror

This is very important for every human being. How Allah Subahana-wa-thaala punishes the aggressors, the wrongdoers. This is what will happen to the super powers, be it America, France, Germany, Great Britain or whatever. Libya has helped Sri Lanka a lot. They established the LANLIB. The company was formed in 1976 to the close relationship the Great Libyan Head of the State, Colonel Muammer Gaddafi had with the late Prime Minister, Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka. When he visited Sri Lanka for the Non-Aligned Conference they helped us for commencing several courses like FARMIS - Federation of Muslims Assemblies. They have been helping us. They are a friendly nation. So, why should we despise them over the dictates of somebody from somewhere else? We are Sri Lankans, a proud nation, be it Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burghers, Malays, Bohras, Yemenis or Up-Country Tamils. Our Leader is such a glowing example to the whole world to stand up against terrorism, aggression, wrongdoing from whichever quarters it comes. He had the guts; he had the courage to say, No, I will not stop the war and he won the war. We, in this Parliament today call upon all Parliaments and free-

613 614

thinking people of the world, we cry a halt and our Parliament cries an immediate halt to the senseless bombing of the Libyan people causing havoc and destruction, loss of lives and destruction of mosques and holy places. Thank you, Sir. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you. The Hon. (Ven.) Ellawala Medhananda Thero, to second the Motion.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am pleased to speak a few words on this all-important Motion that has been moved by the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. What is happening today in Libya is nothing but an imperialist aggression. We totally condemn what is going on there. Though they appear to have hidden behind the so-called Security Council sanction, it appears that there are some countries which have a conscience. Take for instance, what Russia has said. Take the attitude of the Chinese and even the displeasure that has been expressed by the silence of our great neighbour, India. The whole attitude appears to be to destabilize and retard the growth that is taking place in the Asian Continent. Together with that, they appear to be targeting certain regimes for reasons best known to them whilst sparing others.

In my opinion, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and his revolution, which had lasted for more than 40 years to date, has brought about a vast socio-economic development in that country. I have been a witness to the development in that country. I have been a frequent visitor to Tripoli and other places. I have been a guest of Colonel Gaddafi several times along with many Left friends and many others in this Government as well as the United National Party. We have witnessed a unique socio-economic development strategy that has been implemented by Colonel Gaddafi and his regime. Libya has a unique Constitution. It has a different system which the imperialist nations would not understand and would not want to understand. Today, all this aggression is aimed at protecting an illegitimate country called "Israel". All those countries which are a military threat to the existence of Israel have been targeted in such a manner. What happened to Iraq? What is happening in Syria today ?You would have seen the way in which they continued to foster the Mubarak Regime in Egypt. All these have a history and there is a history behind the Camp David Accord. If you look at all these, the ultimate agenda is to protect Israel. The Zionist ideology of Israelis is the master plan behind all these activities.

Today, by trying to hide behind this so-called concept of saving the civilians, they are killing the civilians. Thousands of innocent lives have been lost. Technology such as laser-guided missiles have been used by Americans to indiscriminately attack the civilian targets. Therefore, I join my Colleagues in condemning this barbarous action.

617 618

It appears that the waning popularity of the Sarkozy Regime wants to prop itself up by trying to show that they are getting the Western nations to come together; sponsoring this whole resolution and having taken the lead. Today, each of them wants to disown the leadership role. It appears that they are at some serious confusion. Finally, what is going to happen is that, this is going to seriously impact on the economy of the entire world. Ultimately, they are not going to achieve the objectives that they are supposed to be aiming at, which is the so-called protection of innocent civilians. Interference in a sovereign country and then using the UN Charter for their own parochial purposes should be condemned. Therefore, we would like to say here, that we see the attitude and the anger displayed against the UN Secretary-General when he visited the Arab Leagues Head Office in Egypt.

He was stoned. Having succeeded in their so-called revolution in Egypt, the common sentiments of the Egyptians on the streets today have been displayed by the anger shown against Ban Ki-moon when he visited Cairo to get the Arab Leagues sanction. So, this shows, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, that this whole idea is simply to fester their own nests and also promote their own agendas in protecting the Zionist regime of Israel and nothing but that. Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you very much. The next speaker is the Hon. J. Sri Ranga. - [Pause.] Not here. Then, the next speaker is the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara. You have four minutes.

( () - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana - Minister of Scientific Affairs) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees. The revolutionary events taking place in the Middle East are welcome by all democratic forces throughout the world. We saw, beginning with Tunisia and extending thereafter to Egypt, a wave of democratic movements fighting for greater human rights and the establishment of true democracy in these countries. This has been extending across Bahrain, Yemen and a number of countries which have had dictatorial regimes and have been supportive of the policies of the American empire in the Middle East.

Now, while people have been expressing their revolutionary fervour and threatening these Governments, there has arisen the need to counter this whole process and the argument that there is a right to protect the United Nations machinery has been brought into play by the US Empire to intervene in the case of Libya. We would like to point out here that the power was given by the UN Security Council only to protect civilians, to take whatever actions necessary in terms of preventing harm

to civilians. But, what is actually being done now is not to protect civilians but to attack them in the interest of toppling the regime of Muammar Gaddafi. So, we have here an attempt to stop the tide of the mass revolutionary fervour in the Middle East and target it against the enemies of the American Empire. What is being done here is in contrast to what is happening in Bahrain, where the regimes there are getting the support of other pro-American governments to suppress the revolution of the people. But, that is being ignored. We hope that this will not pave the way for a future attack on Iran in the guise of the right to protect. So, while we welcome the revolutionary uprising of the truly democratic forces in the Middle East, we condemn the role of the US Empire in trying to stifle the democratic movement of the people of the Arab world and divert it in their own interests to safeguard their oil interests as well as the dictatorships that are serving their cause there.

( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am grateful to you for giving me this opportunity of expressing the views of the Government on the Motion that has been moved by my Colleague, the Hon. Alhaj. A.H.M. Azwer.

I would like to begin by saying that the ties between Sri Lanka and Libya are very close and this is the main reason why we feel strongly and deeply for the people of Libya in their present crisis. We have great empathy for them as they deal with some very difficult situations and it is our devout wish that this distressing situation will come to an end as soon as possible.

621 622

There are a few specific points, which I would like to make with regard to the attitude of the Government of Sri Lanka, to this situation. The basis of the action currently being taken by the Coalition in respect of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is, Resolution 1973 adopted by the Security Council of the United Nations on the 17th of March, 2011 under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. But, I would like to make the point with emphasis that this is not open-ended authority; the authority conferred by the terms of Resolution 1973 is restricted and it has to be curtailed by reference to objective and scope. We have to bear in mind at all times, the main reason why this Resolution was adopted; what was the objective, what was the purpose it was aimed at. The fundamental purpose was the protection of life, the lives of civilians in Libya. That was the reason for this Resolution being adopted by the United Nations Security Council. Anything that goes beyond that purpose and objective is contrary to the spirit and substance of the Resolution that was adopted by the Security Council. Action is legitimate only so long as it is directly referable to the purpose underlying the Resolution. That is the rationale. If there is any attempt by means, direct or insidious, to travel beyond the scope of that purpose, then such action is necessarily unwarranted and not in keeping with the principles governing the United Nations system.

We would also like to emphasize in that connection that, therefore the legitimacy, the justifiability of the action that is taken has to be judged by reference to this basic criteria. Is the action making life easier for the people of Libya? Is their condition being alleviated? Is it being improved or on the contrary, is it being made worse? It is for this reason, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, that the Government of Sri Lanka does not support air strikes. We think that air strikes will simply increase the suffering of the people of Libya. Air strikes therefore, in the opinion of the Government of Sri Lanka, is not a solution to the problem.

There are one or two further observations that I would like to make. This has to do with the financial measures, which have been mandated by the United Nations Security Council. Now, here again, we have to bear in mind that these financial measures must not be applied in such a manner as to hurt the people of Libya. These measures may negatively impact on trade relationships between the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and neighbouring countries and the beneficiaries of some of these trade relationships are the people of Libya. So, if these financial measures are applied in such a manner as to deprive the people of Libya of resources, if the financial

measures are going to exacerbate an already complicated situation, then those financial measures are counterproductive. They will not serve the purpose for which they were intended. I think that too is a consideration that needs to be borne in mind.

The other important point to make is that in the midst of all the violence - the violence per se is distressing - we have to bear in mind that a political track has to be found. It is indeed refreshing to note that the Secretary-General of the United Nations has appointed a Special Envoy to deal with the situation on his behalf. Similarly, the African Union has appointed a high-level panel. So, there are opportunities; there are avenues that are available for political dialogue and consultation. And, it is a matter of profound regret that these diplomatic initiatives, which are potentially possible and which ought to be pursued with all vigour have not been pursued with the kind of interest that we would like. So, I would like to point out that this is an aspect of the situation that we need to bear in mind and the political initiatives are crucial at this time.

So, to sum up, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the position of the Government of Sri Lanka is that this problem has to be solved as early as possible. It is a solution that must be peaceful. It is also a solution that must be entirely in accordance with the wishes of the people of Libya and all measures that are conducive to the accomplishment of those objectives will have the unqualified support of the Government of Sri Lanka.

Therefore, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would once again reiterate with all the emphasis at my command, that Sri Lanka desires nothing but the best for the people of Libya. We are very clear that the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Libya must be fully respected. It is our fervent hope that stability and peace will be restored in Libya as early as possible.

I thank you. , . . Question put, and agreed to. . . 5.38, 2011 24 . . 1.00 .
