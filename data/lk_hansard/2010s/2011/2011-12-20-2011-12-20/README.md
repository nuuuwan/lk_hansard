asked the Minister of Plantation Industries:

(a) Will he state-

(i) whether a programme of giving subsidies to small-scale rubber estate owners with a view to developing the rubber cultivation, is being implemented; and

(ii) if so, the subsidies given to the estate owners under that programme?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) , . Hon. Minister, you answered "yes" to (a) (i). What are the areas or districts in the North and the East that come under the scheme of granting subsidies? The other day you spelt out certain new areas.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Yes. There are the traditional areas like Kegalle, Ratnapura, Galle, Matara and some areas in Hambantota. In addition, there are non-traditional areas that we have gone into such as Moneragala.

His Excellency the President has suggested in the Budget for 2012 that we look at rubber cultivation in the Ampara District, mainly in Maha Oya and Padiyathalawa, where we have identified nearly 10,000 hectares suitable for rubber cultivation.

In addition, one year ago, I instructed the Rubber Research Institute to carry out experiments in the North to see whether the land is suitable for rubber cultivation and the report that they have presented to me after one year of experiments has established that certain parts in the North, especially Vavuniya South and certain parts in Mullaitivu, are conducive for rubber cultivation. So, we are now discussing with the Ministry of Economic Development, the possibility of expanding it to those areas. If we are successful in going into those new areas, we would be able to achieve our objective of increasing significantly the rubber cultivation in this country so that the value-added industries which have been established in this country do not have to, in future, import the latex or the resource from outside the country and they can be given the full supply they require from within this country and further expansion of these value-added industries could also be put into place so that employment generation as well as income generation could be achieved.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Minister, my second question is, could you tell us when you would be starting re-planting or new plantations in the North?

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) We are having discussions with the Ministry of Economic Development at the moment and hopefully, by next year, since new planting will be given that extra subsidy of Rs.150,000 by His Excellency the President, we would be able to start it. We are now in a position to identify the smallholders in those areas. Actually, there is a lot of interest already shown by the people in those areas to grow rubber because the prices are quite high at the moment and that is an additional income they can get in addition to whatever they are doing in the areas of agriculture at present. There is plenty of land, from what I believe. We will be working very closely with the Ministry of Economic Development to put that strategy in place.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) My third Supplementary Question is, are you adopting new methods of making latex rubber?

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Are you referring to centrifuged latex rubber? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Yes. Has that been introduced to all areas? ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Well, the value-added industries are the ones which -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) , , -

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) That, Hon. Member, we have been doing perennially. The Rubber Research Institute conducts continuous research in improving productivity and decreasing the cost of production so that a higher income can be enjoyed by the smallholders.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Thank you for your comprehensive reply, Hon. Minister.

[1.23 p.m.]

... ( ) ( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Urban Affairs) Mr. Deputy Chairman, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak a few words on the performance of the Secretariat for Senior Ministers as the Minister of Urban Affairs.

I fully endorse and appreciate the observations made by the Hon. DEW Gunasekara and the suggestions made by the Hon. John Amaratunga. Therefore, I will not touch on what the Hon. John Amaratunga stated on the concept of Senior Ministers. The Hon. John Amaratunga with his Colleagues of the UNP came before the Select Committee to Discuss the Heads of Expenditure of Ministries Selected from the Budget Estimates of the Year 2012 and we explained the work that we were doing. They were very much satisfied with our explanation and wanted to know further about the duties that we are performing and we agreed to make a presentation in due course.

Sir, it has been estimated that the urban population will reach 45 per cent by 2015. The countrys urban areas exhibit problems such as slum and squatter settlements, degraded environment, low standards of infrastructure and services and overloaded physical infrastructure. These problems have been looked into and they will be sorted out very soon.

In the small and medium-sized - secondary - towns outside the Greater Colombo, slum and shanty settlements are less of a problem. Instead, lack of basic infrastructure for economic development is considered a major challenge. Improvement and expansion of water supply, sanitation, stormwater drainage and solid waste collection and disposal are considered the priority investment areas by urban and local governments. Improvement of roads, transportation and development of bus terminals are also given high priority.

Sri Lankas urban society suffers less from high incidence of poverty. However, a significant proportion of urban households still live below the Poverty Index.

His Excellency the President, in his Budget Proposals for 2011, has proposed the establishment of one million home-based economic units covering home gardening, livestock, fisheries and cottage industries to support the home-based economy under the "Divi Neguma" Programme. This Programme has been considered as a nationally-important programme and in the Budget Proposals for 2012, the target has been increased from one million home-based economic units to 2.5 million economic units.

The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Minister of Economic Development provides leadership and strategic guidance to execute this programme islandwide covering all districts. I have been appointed as the Chair of the "Divi Neguma" Subcommittee on Cottage Industries with the active participation of the Hon. Douglas Devananda, Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development and four other industrial cluster Ministries. Under this programme, we have conducted seven technology showcase and awareness programmes in Colombo, Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Gampaha, Kegalle, Monaragala and Puttalam. There are over 2,000 to 3,000 participants in each district who have expressed their interest to join the Cottage Industry Programme. Following this, need assessments have been conducted and technology training, raw material and basis tools and marketing facilities including buy-back arrangements are being supported with the active involvement of the five industrial cluster Ministries, institutions and the Ministry of Economic Development.

Many participants have expressed their interest to establish cottage industries while some others who have already been in the business have expressed their interest to expand their operations. The need assessment revealed that the cottage industrialists are in need of credit and financial assistance to establish, expand and sustain their operations. Therefore, I have made arrangements with the Governor of the Central Bank to help find the required financial assistance. I thank Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal, the Governor of the Central Bank for extending support and cooperation to take this Governments flagship programme forward. This programme is an important pillar of the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future which focuses more on an inclusive economic development covering lagging regions and rural production villages. The theme of the "Divi Neguma" Programmes is, A self-reliant household: A Wonderful Motherland.

I had a meeting with the bankers to discuss the modalities and mechanisms of supporting the "Divi Neguma" flagship programme of the Government. We all have collective responsibility of supporting micro and small cottage industries that have been screened for viability. I have requested the bankers to give their full support to make this flagship programme a success. I am confident that this programme is a great opportunity for

2958 2959

[ ]

2011 20

bankers to support the cottage industrialists and thereby help job creation and income generation at the household and village level to achieve equitable and inclusive sustainable development. Mr. Deputy Chairman, I also have had discussions with the exporters to promote marketing of products of the participants of this programme. I am very positive that the exporters will help us in making this home-based industry programme a success.

As a Senior Minister, I have been assigned the responsibility of chairing two Cabinet subcommittees. One is the Cabinet Subcommittee on Supply and Distribution of Petroleum Products. This Committee meets very often and we have taken important decisions on the emerging issues. The other is the Cabinet Subcommittee on Power and Energy. We have submitted our decisions on these areas to the Cabinet of Ministers for approval and implementation. I am very happy to hold this position as a Senior Minister and whatever shortcomings the Hon. John Amaratunga stated in his speech would be taken into consideration, so that more and more of our time and action can be made use of. Thank you.

, . We must make some structural changes especially in the public sector institutions. So, are we going to make these changes that are necessary? I think it is a political decision, because if you look at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the Ceylon Electricity Board, you would see that these are institutions driven by public sector money. These institutions are there to serve the public. They are not profit-making institutions. So, at least they should be well managed. , , . . . ; . , .

21 . We are undertaking a functional review of 21 ministries and public institutions. . , , . . .

, . , , . Mr. Presiding Member, I think we have a very good Public Service. There maybe shortcomings but most of the Public servants in this country want to contribute positively towards the well-being of the country and the economic targets of the Government. Therefore, it is very important that we motivate the Public servants, conduct good training programmes for them and keep them in line with international trends and events that are now occurring in the world.

. . , . I believe the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and other non-governmental institutions will make a very positive contribution towards reforms in the public sector.

, 06/2006 . , . . . 40 . His Excellency the President has given our Ministry a sum of Rs. 40 million for pre-training programmes of public sector employees who have been selected for the Public Service. I think that is a very good initiative. 30, 40 . .

, , . . 30, 40 Ceylon Civil Service . . , - - . If we can achieve this objective of training our Public servants, re-focusing and re-orienting them towards specific targets towards uplifting their productivity, then I think a lot of money can be saved and secondly, our economic targets can also be achieved.
