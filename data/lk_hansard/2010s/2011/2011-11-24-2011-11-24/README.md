( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) It comes under your Ministry.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, it comes under my Ministry, but my Ministry does not - [Interruption.] No. It is only for purposes of

framing regulations to be brought before Parliament. But, as the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and all lawyers know, it is run by a body which consists of ex officio members.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) That is the Council.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) You have no say in that.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I do not interfere with the conduct of the Council of Legal Education. - [Interruption.] No, no. All of us know that. This is totally irrelevant. This is about its financial management.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Why can you not give the answer? There is something suspicious.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) There is nothing suspicious. The Question is about raising the fee, whether we should not raise the fee and all that. It is very unfortunate because I might go into other details, which will be too embarrassing to the Hon. Member who had asked the Question. So, I do not want to go into it.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Can you not envisage the cost for 2012 without knowing the cost for 2011?

The wealth of a country is its people, land and resources, the level of its technology and its culture.

.

The economic problem is to harness and manage these resources. That must be done to ensure that goods and services rendered by all people of Sri Lanka are sufficient to provide at all times - in sickness, in health, in youth and in age - a modest standard of life. , .

Sallie Mae is set up for that. But, it is means-tested. Not that everybody gets it. So, if you are rich, you pay US Dollars 100, and if

you are moderately wealthy, you pay US Dollars 60 and so on. So, that is what we have been advocating.

Colombo to be taken by storm by Colombo night races and electric peacock festival

The inaugural Colombo Night Races and the second Electric Peacock Festival will take place this December, taking entertainment in Colombo to another level.

Following the qualifying race the night before, the first ever Colombo Night Races are ready to set the streets of Colombo ablaze with an event that this city has never seen. The crme de la crme of Sri Lankas racing scene will be competing.

: I quote:

A night motor race in Colombo was a dream of most motor sports fans in Sri Lanka and it has finally come to fruition with Carlton Sports and Tharunyata Hetak, conducted jointly by the two governing bodies, Sri Lanka Automobile Sports Association and the Federation of Motorcycle Sports in Sri Lanka along with all member racing clubs, and Red Cherry Entertainment joining to organize the event.

You must understand what is happening in the marketplace. In any country, what is primarily needed is to ensure that there is investor confidence. We have to look at the three markets. Look at the equity market. I showed you what is happening to the Colombo Stock Market. It is crashing. Even today it is nose-diving. Then, you must consider the forex market. What is happening to the foreign exchange market? There is so much pressure on the rupee. Actually, the rupee is fighting to stay at 1.14 and the Central Bank is pouring money into the foreign exchange market to keep the rupee at 1.14 which is not going to be possible in the long term. The last market is the debt market.

. , , . . 7.2 8.5 . - [ ] No, the debt markets are frozen. Hon. Minister, I think you know that the one-year Treasury Bill rate increased by 92 basis points in one day. , . , , ? ? So, what I am trying to say is, there are forces that are working against each other. One group wants to do a particular thing whereas another group wants to disrupt that and it is not among us, it is inside the Government. Otherwise, why should the Treasury intervene into the foreign exchange rates market?

I teach monetary policy. I know what I am talking about. In monetary policy - [Interruption.] In a market economy, it is the job of the Central Bank, it is not of the Treasury. The Treasury has a fiscal policy and the Central Bank has a monetary policy.

, , depreciation . . . . , -[ ] Never have we had such a huge trade deficit. I do not know whether you are aware of that. But, it is going to be closer to US Dollars 9 billion; US Dollars 9 billion!

Already it is US Dollars 6 billion. How can we bridge the gap? From January to September, the trade deficit is US Dollars 6 billion and I say it with absolute responsibility. Therefore, you have to do something and it has to be done, not by the Secretary to the Treasury, not by the Hon. Minister of Finance in Parliament, but on a gradual basis, by the Governor of the Central Bank. .

. . -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) . ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) . [Interruption.] No, I cannot. I am tired. .

The last point that I am going to make is an important one. You must take cognizance of this. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, now please wind up your speech.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I will wind up after making the last point of my speech.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) You are taking the time given to the other Hon. Members of the Opposition.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) After making the last point, I will conclude my speech. This is something that you have to think about very carefully. We were told that we had US Dollars 8 billion as reserves. In fact, that is not true. Currently, it has fallen to about US Dollars 6.8 billion. It is roughly in that range. Now, out of that US Dollars 6.8 billion, we have roughly US Dollars 1.5 billion as IMF deposits. So, it is not ours. Our reserves are down to US Dollars 5.3 billion. Out of the US Dollars 5.3 billion, we have foreign bondholders of about US Dollars 2 billion. So, that means we are down to about US Dollars 2.8 billion in reserves and as you know, the Central Bank has not issued the amounts that they have sold in the market since September; that is about three months ago. So, we do not know as to what exactly is happening and these are

707 708

2011 24

calculations done by analysts. I think they sold about US Dollars 600 million in September. So, if we continue to go on like this, we will lose our reserves and already the foreigners, the debt holders and the markets are panicking. You see that the interest rates are rising; the exchange rate is falling and the stock market is nose-diving. So, you must take cognizance of what I am saying. This has nothing to do with politics. This is the reality. If we continue to go on like this, we are going to face a serious problem. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up your speech. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) So, in national interest, I respectfully request you to consider a proper, a more balanced and a credible approach, going forward. Thank you very much.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) You have taken eight minutes more. So, I will have to reduce that time from the time given to the Hon. Members of your side. The next speaker is the Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran.

His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa,His in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, presented the 65th Budget of independent Sri Lanka and the seventh of this Government on Monday, the 21st, mainly focusing on socio-economic infrastructure development and relief to the poor. He, in his first term of office, stood firmly to

eradicate terrorism from the country and against all odds, he succeeded in achieving it. His second term of office is dedicated to improve the economy of the country and make Sri Lanka a trading hub and the "Wonder of Asia." I am sure the President would achieve this goal during his second term of office and the Budget which has been presented to this House a few days ago is in line with his vision.

On the same day the Budget was presented, the Central Bank announced that Sri Lankas GDP growth for 2012 would be around 9 per cent, which I believe, is a very positive sign. It appears that the economic policies under the "Mahinda Chintana" are paying dividends to the country. Upon reflecting on the Proposals of this Budget, I feel that it is a constructive effort, not only of uplifting the rural socio-economic conditions of Sri Lanka, but also of our industrial sector and exports in a considerable way.

I should stress the various large-scale projects designed to uplift the socio-economic conditions of Sri Lanka, especially in the rural regions. The effort to bring in the backyard economic units to the mainstream by supporting and uplifting low income families through Divi Neguma programme led by the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, is a major effort in this regard. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer to take the Chair? ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Tissa Karalliyadde - Minister of Child Development and Womens Affairs) I propose that the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to. , ... .

, , ... . Whereupon THE HON. UDITH LOKUBANDARA left the Chair, and THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) According to the data of the Ministry of Economic Development, over 1.4 million households called, home economic units are taking part in this Divi Neguma programme. More than 1.3 million homegarden units and

731 732

[ ]

2011 24

94,011 livestock farming units are already functioning under this Programme. Among the backyard economic activities of Divi Neguma Programme, are agriculture, fisheries, livestock and small family enterprises.

The tourism sector has shown an impressive growth after eradication of terrorism in the country. During the first nine months of this year, tourist arrivals have increased by about 35 per cent, that is, to 598,000, while earnings from tourism have increased by 48 per cent, to US Dollars 580 million, compared to the corresponding period of last year.

A key contribution of the 65th Budget is the rupee devaluation which will increase our export competitiveness and drive the economy towards achieving the Governments target of US Dollar 20 billion export earnings by 2020. If I may quote His Excellency the Presidents own words for the reason behind this move, he says:

Firstly, as our country has experienced the strengthening of the exchange rate, in the backdrop of those countries that are competing with our country, as well as our neighbouring countries have depreciated their exchange rates significantly.

Together with the wide ranging tax concessions for various private-sector undertakings announced in this Budget, the devaluation of the rupee will give a further boost to our export manufacturing sector. But, I should stress that we should not depend only on cost competitiveness to sustain our export growth. We should also strive to build a brand name of ours in the international market by developing unique selling propositions. Cost competitive strategies like the latest rupee devaluation should be used as a stepping stone towards ultimately gaining unique selling propositions by Sri Lankan exporters.

In the Budget Speech of 2012, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, very rightly identified the emerging export trends for our country. I welcome the proposal which specifically mentions the entering into trade and investment agreements with economies in Africa, Asia and South America, which will encourage Sri Lankan exporters to explore these new emerging markets. This is a very progressive and dynamic approach in this Budget.

I am pleased to state that external trade continued to expand further during the first eight months of this year. The year-on-year earnings from exports grew by 28.6 per cent, to US Dollars 6.9 billion. The export performance was driven by industrial products and agricultural products by 35.9 per cent and 13.6 per cent respectively, and petroleum products which grew by 166.3 per cent, and ships and boats by 117 per cent led the industrial-sector earnings between January to August. Textiles and garments contributed 39.5 per cent of the total export earnings and have increased by 27.4 per cent. Other top

gainers in the industrial sector are rubber-finished products, food, beverages and tobacco, non-metallic mineral products, leather products and wooden products.

Textiles and garments contributed 39.5 per cent to the total export earnings and have increased by 27.4 per cent, despite the withdrawal of GSP Plus facility showing the high quality of our garment products. The value of Sri Lankas export products and services to the EU is Euro 1.7 billion, about 29 per cent of Sri Lankas total exports. Textile and garment sector takes 55 per cent of the value of Sri Lankas exports to the EU amounting to more than Euro 1 billon. I welcome the investment incentives for value-added exports as well as for certain import replacement industries.

"Mahinda Chintana" has always given a special focus to develop the domestic industrial potential and this Budget provides strong incentives to make this a reality. This seventh Budget of our Government has granted incentives for investments at all levels. It is not only the large enterprises, which invest Rs. 300 million to Rs. 2.5 billion will get tax holidays of six to twelve years, but small and medium-scale enterprises which invest Rs. 50 million to Rs. 300 million will also get tax holidays between four to six years.

I must mention here very categorically, Mr. Presiding Member and Hon. Members, that this Budget for 2012 is the most SME-friendly Budget that this country has seen in recent times. His Excellency the President has rightly recognized the valuable contribution of the SME sector to Sri Lankas economy, which is bridging the growth disparities across provinces. Not only does the Budget propose tax holidays between four to six years for small and medium-scale new enterprises, but also a tax deduction on the initial start-up costs faced by new entrepreneurs before the commencement of an enterprise. I fully endorse the proposal that the SMEs with a quarterly turnover of less than Rs. 500 million be exempted from paying Economic Service Charge up to Rs.100 million, and raising the ESC threshold from Rs. 25 million to Rs.50 million, which is a further increase from Rs. 7.5 million granted by the 2011 Budget.

I also stress the fact that we need to provide our SMEs with better access to banking and finance. Towards this end, I appreciate the innovative proposal brought forward and hope that the Bank of Ceylon, the Peoples Bank and the Regional Development Bank will each set up a special SME Bank branch in all districts in 2012, and also the invitation be extended to all other banking and financial institutions to do the same. This will be encouraged by the reduction of income tax rate from 28 to 24 per cent for such banking activities.

The incentives of Rs. 300 million to Rs. 2.5 million given for large industries are especially welcome by my Ministry as it will complement our efforts in developing industrial zones across the country. I, particularly

733 734

welcome the proposal to develop manufacturing of pharmaceuticals in Sri Lanka as a Strategic Import Replacement Enterprise by granting tax holidays for investment in pharmaceutical production. My Ministry has identified pharmaceutical-manufacturing as a key industrial sector in the Ministrys five-year plan and I am pleased to inform you that we have already begun preliminary work on developing the countrys first pharmaceutical manufacturing zone. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce this week began mapping out the first step of developing the 48-acre plot of land for this purpose.

As the Minister of Industry and Commerce, I appreciate the decision to continue with the Cess on primary exports so that value-added industrial exports can be promoted, including tea and rubber. I also extend my support to the proposal for granting incentives for joint ventures between tea producers and export companies by reducing their tax from 12 per cent so that our tea exports will be value-added and Ceylon tea can continue to make its mark on the world stage. Also, the proposal to increase the subsidy given to tea smallholders for replanting from Rs. 250,000 to Rs. 300,000 and for new planting from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 150,000 is an important step. The proposal to introduce a concessionary loan scheme at 8 per cent interest repayable in seven years to assist plantation companies to plant and replant is a further encouragement to increase our foreign exchange earnings from export crops.

The proposal to further advance the export of other crops like cinnamon, pepper and other spices is also encouraging. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, your time is up. ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Please give me two minutes, I will conclude. By this proposal it is intended to enhance the allocation made to the Department of Export Agriculture by a further Rs.150 million to provide cultivation aid to promote intercropping of cinnamon, pepper, cardamoms and cocoa.

Sir, I should stress that during the pre-Budget consultation held on 21st October, 2011, at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the need to develop the cinnamon sector was a highly-discussed topic. I am proud to announce that in October this year, my Ministry, together with the EDB, was able to launch the "Pure Ceylon Cinnamon" brand to the international market at a global event held in Germany.

In my view, the proposals made relating to the encouragement of research and development are some of the most valuable and progressive contributions of this Budget. The reduced tax rates for individuals and companies undertaking research and development, allowing a triple deduction for research and development undertaken by enterprises through Government research institutions and allowing SMEs to obtain Government research facilities at a nominal fee, are all very important proposals that will, no doubt, promote the manufacturing of high quality innovative products that can compete on the global stage.

Finally, I am pleased to state that this Budget is a very forward-looking instrument focused on development not only for industry and commerce but also for all sectors of the country, while ensuring adequate support for disadvantaged groups in our society.

Mr. Presiding Member, I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere gratitude to His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, for rendering support and assistance in resettling the Internally Displaced Persons expelled in 1990. Such cross-cutting efforts will, no doubt, result in achieving the positive outcomes envisaged in the "Mahinda Chintana" vision for Sri Lankas rapid and inclusive development.

Thank you.

[4.29 p.m.]

. . . ( ) ( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Urban Affairs) Mr. Presiding Member, permit me in the first instance, to congratulate the President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, for presenting a very realistic and development-oriented Budget amidst multi-furious impediments including a global economic recession. At a time when both local as well as international elements that are sympathetic to LTTE terrorism are active with their conspiracies against our country, the President has successfully overcome those challenges. Besides those challenges, all of us must appreciate that in preparing the Budget, he has taken pains to consult all relevant sectors as well as trade unions.

Sir, President Rajapaksa should be lauded for taking care to include elements to strengthen the national economy and to ensure that everybody gets something. The significant feature of this Budget is that it places no burden at all on the people. Instead, relief measures have been proposed in the Budget and the President has thereby demonstrated his deep concern for the life and welfare of the people. The President has established a tradition of granting an increased pay packet to Public servants and pensioners through every Budget he has been presenting. A 10 per cent increase in salary is appreciable considering the large allocation needed for development programmes. Humanitarian elements are

evident very much in the increased payment given to some of the beneficiaries as well as in the grant of a dole to both parents of the ranavirus.

As the service of the army, the police service too has been appreciated and a payment of Rs. 100,000 has been proposed for every police officer at the birth of his third child. That is very encouraging for the build-up of a sound future generation.

Sir, a long-standing grievance of the Samurdhi officers has also been addressed by absorbing them into the government service and granting them the demanded rights.

If not for these relief measures, the President could have presented a surplus Budget. But, the President is concerned about the living conditions of the people, while building up a strong economy so that the country can be a proud nation and stand up solid amidst the other countries in the world. He, in his endeavor to build a self-reliant economy, has laid a strong foundation for it to withstand any global recession and other economic upheavals such as the collapse of banking institutions and business establishments in European countries, pushing European leaders to hold urgent conferences to contain the problem. One such timely measure in our country was the recent action to take back 37 business establishments that were running at a loss, in order to make them profitable ventures.

Fortunately, the affairs of the economic development of our country are in the safe hands of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, the Minister of Economic Development. His vigour and dedication to contribute to the nations journey towards the Wonder of Asia are laudable. He had embarked on multi-pronged economic development programmes including Divi Neguma which was announced by the President in his last year's Budget to raise the economic and living standards of families, as well as various assistance programmes for the self-employed and to the small business ventures, which have been innovative. Under the Divi Neguma, programme, 10 lakhs of household units have been encouraged to develop homegardens and the result has been encouraging. All the Ministries connected with rural development have embraced this programme. Fruit and vegetable production has increased considerably and as a result, prices of most of the necessary food items have dropped substantially. This has also helped to retain inflation of food at around 3 per cent.

The Government has now embarked on its second phase to add up 10 lakhs of homegardens. It is an innovative programme to set up "Divi Neguma Enterprise Villages", each consisting of about 200 families. It will also consist of a small livestock farm, storage facilities for dairy products, meat and vegetables and an organic fertilizer-processing centre, a small rice-mill and a food

745 746

processing centre, a "Divi Naguma Bank" branch and access to the nearest township is also under consideration.

Mr. Presiding Member, I also wish to applaud the State policy on education aimed at transforming the future generation into a society strong enough to meet the challenges of the future, which will be more complicated with advanced science and technology.

The programme of upgrading 1,000 schools as super grade schools with improved facilities is a right step taken to provide equal access to education. It is also notable that money has been allocated for pre-school education and religious school education. It is a part of the policy that the education system cannot create failures and all children should have access to skill development. The President has taken note that there are around 165,000 children who fail at the GCE Ordinary Level Examination. A sum of Rs. 8,617 million has been allocated for vocational education and this is a clear indication that education has been modified to suit the demands of the time. All these have been achieved while providing necessary allocations to various mega development programmes, welfare programmes as well as relief measures for the people. This is done despite the extremely trying circumstances and adversities created by forces beyond our control, who are posing many challenges.

On one hand, the Government has been compelled to continue to battle with the post-conflict situation in the North and the East. People are being resettled, landmines have been cleared and combatants are being rehabilitated and socialized and are back with the society. The entire area is given a new lease of life with new development programmes such as improved roads, bridges, State offices as well as facilities to ensure people to resume normalcy of life.

It is also notable that at a time the rich and powerful countries are shaken by serious economic crisis, President Mahinda Rajapaksa has, as he aimed through his "Mahinda Chintana", placed the country on a development process to make it the "Wonder of Asia." His plan has paid dividends as already seen by the achievements in relation to the economy of the country. The economy of the country has recorded an increase from 6 to 8 per cent. The rate of unemployment has come down from 8 to 4 per cent. The Budget deficit has come down from over 10 to 6 per cent. Foreign reserve level has gone up from one and a half months of imports to five and a half months of imports. The global competitiveness index has improved from 79 position to 52 position. The poverty has come down from 22 to 8 per cent. According to the Central Bank, our per capita income has crossed the US Dollar 2,300 mark.

Above all, I wish to refer to the UNDPs Human Development Report of 2011 in which Sri Lanka has been placed first in terms of human development in South Asia. These achievements are good signs that the country is journeying fast on the right track, while giving priority to several macro-development programmes, including infrastructure.

There are economic imperatives such as defence, education and health, and infrastructure improvements such as roads, water supply and drainage and power supply which are essential to the life and which demand substantial allocations in the Budget.

I wish to mention the action taken to protect water resources, particularly in view of pollution of drinking water and discharge of waste materials into the water resources. As population increases and clean water is becoming scarce, it is essential that in order to protect peoples health, appropriate measures be introduced.

We can be satisfied that the main focus of this Budget has been strengthening the national economy against any possible impact of the global economic crisis as well as food crisis, while at the same time, making the country to move forward to become the Wonder of Asia. I know that the Opposition has been very critical of this Budget. However, they should appreciate the various measures that have been taken to provide relief to the poor as well as the development programmes of the Government.

Sir, in conclusion, I wish to express my thanks to you for providing the opportunity to make my observations on the Budget and I invite the Opposition to play a historic role in strengthening the economy by supporting this Budget.

Thank you.
