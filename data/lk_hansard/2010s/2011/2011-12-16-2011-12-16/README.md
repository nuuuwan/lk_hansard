( ) (The Chairman) What is the point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I am sorry, Sir, for interrupting. Being unmindful of the fact that today is Friday, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition has thought it fit to ask the House to do away with the lunch interval. But, Sir, it is a religious rite that we, Muslims, have been following. You have already acknowledged it. Sir, I only want to announce that we and the Muslim staff will be going to the Mosque. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Chairman) point of Order . . [ ] Order, please! , .

... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. A.R.M. Abdul Cader - Deputy Minister of Environment) Sir, it gives me great pleasure to present the report titled Progress Report 2011 and Action Plan 2012 at the Committee Stage of the Budget 2012 on activities relating to the Ministry of Environment. It describes the services rendered to conserve and safeguard the environment and natural resources of Sri Lanka during the last year by the Ministry and the establishments under it.

The attention of the world has been drawn to the natural disasters faced by all the countries. The main factor behind those has been identified as global warming. In the race to achieve industrial development, the countries tried only to overcome one another and hence, did not give due attention to environmental concerns. The result of that was the over-exploitation of natural resources and the pollution of air, water and soil, which have, in turn, caused the breakdown of the essential processes of the earth.

The world started paying attention only when hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives due to calamities such as hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, droughts and earth slips. It is the duty of the Ministry of Environment to address the issues in international fora and more importantly, to ensure that the usage of natural resources be maintained in a manner that would make sure their availability for the future generations by their management, conservation and restoration. The activities of the Ministry of Environment are based on policies aiming at conserving and preserving the environment locally and globally for the present and future generations. As mentioned in the "Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future", the Ministry of Environment has started to formulate policies, strategies and programmes in respect of environment protection and management and implement such policies and programmes through a strategic approach.

While socio-economic development is of utmost importance, it is equally necessary that we protect our natural resources, safeguard the environment and are prudent in the use of the assets that nature has bestowed upon our land. This requires emphasis on sustainable development by the judicious use of resources today, which will protect and even enhance those for the future. With this commitment, the National Action Plan for the "Haritha Lanka" Programme was launched by the Ministry in the year 2009. Recognizing the gaps in the implementation process of this programme, the Ministry

has taken initiatives to revisit it in order to ensure sustainable development of the country.

The Deyata Sevana National Tree Planting Programme was launched in the year 2010 by planting 1,100,000 trees islandwide with a view to extend the nations salutation and gratitude to His Excellency the President for bringing freedom for the whole nation after a 30-year war. That national programme highlights the commitment towards the Green Country theme outlined in the "Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future" policy of the Government. Inadequate forest cover on the hilltops of the country poses a threat to the economy because Sri Lanka has an agricultural economy, while a considerable portion of electricity comes as hydroelectricity. Although Sri Lanka is fortunate to have rain from the monsoons, dry weather is due to inadequate tree cover in the hilly areas. Necessary steps have been taken to restore the vegetation cover on degraded hilly areas by applying suitable technical methods.

I hope that the Ministry of Environment, together with the institutions functioning under it, would continue to enhance its work to facilitate sustainable development of the country for the benefit of the present and future generations.

Because I strongly believed that I could do some service through that. I worked as a District Minister also. President J.R. Jayewardenes regime did not give us even Rupees one lakh for development activities. But, I pushed, co-ordinated, got the officers to work and we got the first integrated World Bank project to the Kurunegala District. I got good experience on co-ordination and management through that. There are mentality- differences among our officers. The officers in the coconut cultivation and the officers in the cashew cultivation were not willing to work together. I had to push them; I had to put them in one basket. I gave them a target and I worked also. Before criticizing the Government servants, you should know what your subject is, you should know what your target and your vision and mission are. There is no vision and mission in this Government. That is a sad situation prevailing in this country.

They want to work hard. They want to live through hard work, self-leadership and self-motivation. Though you are supporting them, what is the policy of the Government regarding those lands? Are you going to be a traitor to your own people? I am not trying to inspire racialism or anything but I am talking about facts. So, I am telling you, if they want to put up houses, support them as the late Presidents, J.R. Jayewardene and Ranasinghe Premadasa, did. Our policy is to live in harmony through understanding.

I am now going to talk about Trincomalee.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Presiding Member, I totally agree with the Hon. Janaka Wakkumbura when he says that there is an excess of teachers in the urban schools on one hand, and there is a dearth of teachers in rural schools, on the other. I think this discrepancy must be done away with. The students studying in the rural schools have become helpless as a result.

I know the Minister, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane took great pains after he became the Minister of Education. He constituted a full committee: the National Committee Formulating a New Education Act for General Education in Sri Lanka : Contents, Issues and Proposals. Its final Report is in my hand and all the other Members of this House have also received copies of it. I think all stratas of educationists, university professors, principals, ordinary teachers and Parliament Members participated in the deliberations. This is a very comprehensive Report for anybody to follow in the future formulation of a good education policy. Even the transfer of teachers, excess of teachers and dearth of teachers are all discussed in detail.

Sir, even in Colombo, when you say urban areas, there are very many schools that have less teachers and less

facilities. There was also a conference recently convened by the Governor of Western Province, Seyed Alavi Mowlana in which all these details were discussed. There is this bi-monthly " " in my hand. That gives a correct perspective of the whole picture. " " That is one of those requests by " ". There are schools in Colombo, particularly Muslim schools - the Hon. Minister knows it very well - without much facilities. In certain schools, there are enough teachers and in other schools, there are no teachers, particularly, Science and Moulavi teachers. After this Government came into power, after 20 years of absence, His Excellency the President took the initiative and nearly 200 teachers were appointed, and there is another one hundred odd Moulavi teachers to be appointed. I would kindly request the Hon. Minister to take action to appoint these Moulavi teachers soon because there is agitation in the country about the appointment of the remaining teachers. They are asking for the remaining Moulavi teachers since they are immediately required to be appointed in schools throughout the island.

At the same time, the All-Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference had a conference recently and discussed about the teachers and about the new 1,000 schools development. I am glad to inform the Hon. Minister that the Muslim community has fallen in line with the proposals of the Hon. Minister and that the All-Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference has also agreed with it. I must mention that schools in Colombo like T.B. Jayah, Al-Iqbal, Al-Hijra, Al Nasser, Al-Hikma, Hamza, Sir Razik Fareed, Fathima, Khairiya, Muslim Ladies, Hameed al-Husseini, Darus Salaam and several other schools in Colombo of that category are suffering due to shortage of teachers. I would only hope that this will soon be attended to.

There is only one other matter, Sir. In the Eastern Province, somehow or other, there seems to be some problem in teacher transfers. If I may say, the administrators and parents are at loggerheads. Even yesterday and the day before, the Tamil newspapers carried stories about the agitations. They were going in demonstration regarding transfer of teachers. There had been problems, but I do not want to go into detail because there is little time for the Hon. Minister to reply. I only hope that he would take all these into consideration - even summon the Governors of the Northern and Eastern Provinces - and put a stop to this controversy. Even the other day, His Excellency the President expressed the opinion that teachers should be recruited from the same area and from the same district. Therefore, this problem of excess teachers and teachers to be transferred to outstations - far away places - will not apply.

I thank you, Sir.
