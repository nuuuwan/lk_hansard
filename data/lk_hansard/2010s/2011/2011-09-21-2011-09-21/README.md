Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, look at the Commercial Bank. What happened there? On the 30th of March, 2011, Director Ranjith Fernando was removed from the Commercial Bank. He was an independent director. What happened subsequently? In fact, it is a very interesting sequence of events. The AGM was held and Director Ranjith Fernando was removed. But, they did not appoint anybody else. Soon after the AGM was over, they called a special General Meeting and appointed Mr. Lakshman Hulugalle as a director. Mr. Lakshman Hulugalle - I do not know him personally. It really does not matter to me who he is. What matters to me is the principle, what the Government is saying about good governance and what the Government is in fact implementing and doing. What happened then? Is Mr. Lakshman Hulugalle fit and proper to be a director? This

question has been asked not only by me but by very senior people in the financial market.

Let me tell you the reason why the Government has appointed Mr. Lakshman Hulugalle on the Board of the Commercial Bank. They said, Look, the EPF has 9 per cent shares of this Bank and the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation - SLIC - has 10 per cent shares of this Bank, which accounts to almost 20 per cent. " Therefore, they said, Well, there must be somebody to represent the interest of the EPF in the Commercial Bank. It is a hell of a "how do you do", because I have with me the Investment Policy Statement and Standards of Professional Conduct of the Employees Provident Fund. . 2.6.2.2. . I quote:

The Fund cannot invest in stocks of the banking and financial sector since the Monetary Board regulates both EPF and banks and financial institutions.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, thank you very much. I hope the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva will not take offence for the question posed by the Deputy Minister of Finance. We all know you make very well-informed contributions. Unfortunately, today you went on certain personal tirades and got diverted from the subject matter that you had to discuss.

761 762

2011 21

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I only spoke about the subject - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, you had your say. Let us give way to the Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I am not going to pull you into any more debates. Let me go on to dealing with the subject.

Mr. Presiding Member, today, we are debating some very important amendments to a few pieces of legislation that had been of some recent origin. One is the Prevention of Money Laundering Act which was brought in 2006 and the one that preceded that: Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act in 2005. Some amendments are being proposed. Together with that, we are bringing in another piece of legislation to replace the existing Finance Companies Act, which has been in operation for almost 23 years. As a matter of fact, I think the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva quite frankly paid a compliment to the Government for having brought this Act since he observed and conceded that there are very worthy and important features that are seen as a lacuna in the previous Act. In fact, some of those concerns he expressed about the malpractices that are now replete in the conduct of finance companies and the businesses connected with it would be solved by this particular new Finance Business Bill, which embodies some very progressive and well-thought out suggestions that have all been incorporated in order to meet with the exigencies of situations when certain surreptitious and corrupt elements have really destroyed this segment of the conduct of finance companies and their businesses.

As a matter of fact, I feel that it is in fact a very good move to totally repeal or replace the Finance Companies Act, which did not empower the Central Bank properly to take action against various malpractices in this sector. Therefore, these issues have been identified properly and they have now brought in this new Finance Business Act of which, I believe, many features have been already discussed. But, I must say there was one particular difficulty that the prosecution faced in having to prove cases before a court of law because there have had been three aspects of the business that had to be proved: firstly, the fact that money was accepted as deposits and thereafter the payment of interest thereon. The third limb was to prove the lending an investment of monies that were accepted as deposits. This third limb was a very difficult area where the prosecution found it extremely difficult to establish how these monies were deposited,

and where are the monies for which reason were they invested in different types of businesses. There were different methods that have been employed by the management of these companies to hide the manner in which they had deposited. For instance, if the money was supposed to have not been deposited, then, no action could have been taken. The case could not have been proved because all three limbs had to be satisfied. So, there were various such things that had to be identified. Now, all these issues have been clarified. So, the mere taking of deposit and not paying the interest thereon could be an offence in itself and that makes it quite easy for the Central Bank, particularly the Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions, to be more proactive in trying to deal with the complaints from the public in this sector.

Similarly, when you look at the other two pieces of legislation, the Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Bill and the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Bill, these are two pieces of legislation, as a matter of fact, which I would call "Post-9/11 Reforms" that have come into place in various jurisdictions. So, Sri Lanka is no exception. After the bombing at the World Trade Centre in New York, the worlds superpowers had to realize the dangers of terrorist financing and also the way in which money can flow through different channels for various types of illegal activities that would assist terrorism circumventing various laws in local jurisdictions all over the world. Therefore, my humble suggestion would be that it might be time for us to consider a comprehensive one piece of legislation to cover all these different areas. As a matter of fact, a comprehensive Proceeds of Crime Act embodying all these different pieces of legislation would be a better way to deal with this issue which, I believe, we must discuss in the future.

For instance, in the past, when we confronted massive scams like the VAT scam in this country, I was the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee which went into the issue of the VAT fraud which took place in the Department of Inland Revenue and in having to prosecute the offenders, finally we had to seek refuge under the Penal Code and the existing provisions of the Penal Code and also to look at other Acts like the Offences Against the Public Property Act. But, then, when these proceeds are invested in different people's names, relatives and other friends, it is very difficult for you to be identifying where these proceeds have gone and to bring all those people to court and also to confiscate and forfeit their properties. So, this indeed is a very good move for us to have brought in these amendments to these two Bills which are of recent origin.

I am sure some of the important features of these would now enable us to comply with our international obligations where we have become signatory to various conventions and protocols, where we have to comply

763 764

with the recommendations therein and as a matter of fact, my Ministry is supervising another piece of legislation which is connected to the legislation called the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, No. 25 of 2002 which preceded the enactment of these two pieces of legislation. There has been reference to this particular legislation which is being administered by my Ministry where the local and international co-operation is enhanced by the enactment of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, where we could deal with different agencies in different countries in order to combat the criminal activity in raising funds for illegal activity and also towards money laundering in different jurisdictions. We have to carefully trace the trail of the source of the funding and then how it ends up in the hands of terrorists in a different jurisdiction. There have been a variety of recommendations that have been made by special committees that have been going through these matters.

Now, the Secretary of my Ministry is the central authority under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, where we are empowered to provide legal assistance when it comes to location and examination of witnesses, obtaining and servicing a document and evidence, facilitating the personal appearance of witnesses including those in custody. As a matter of fact, even convicted prisoners from our own prison system could be requested to be transferred to a foreign jurisdiction in order to testify in a case involving money laundering or terrorist financing. There are provisions provided for these matters and, as a matter of fact, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act does not require Commonwealth countries to have any specific treaty for the purpose of accessing the assistance that may be required from us but, of course, other countries would need agreements or treaties and a Specification Order issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs published in the gazette, would be necessary for us to allow any other nation which may not have a specific treaty with us on this issue, other than the Commonwealth countries, to seek our assistance. We also have provided for certain exceptions where an Act, when it is not an offence if committed in Sri Lanka, we are not bound to act even if a request is made and a prosecution of punishment of an offence of a political character, we are not obliged to provide assistance. So, it is concerning any military offence that might be an offence under the Military Act of a different jurisdiction.

Mr. Presiding Member, how many minutes more have I got?

( ) (The Presiding Member) You have already knocked at the dot.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I will wind up. I will not say much except to say that the passage of these pieces of legislation today is quite historic and is very timely and, as a matter of fact, the Finance Business Act is a long overdue one. If it had been in place three or four years ago, we may have been able to prosecute and take some effective action. These years have lapsed but yet, the Central Bank has taken this time period in order to have a very comprehensive and well- thought out piece of legislation to deal with this extraordinary situation that we have had to deal with, particularly, the large number of depositors who have been left in the lurch by various surreptitious and corrupt practices of finance companies. So, a lot of wisdom has gone into this Act and no other than the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva complimented the Government for having brought this piece of legislation. I am sure this will go on to solve and restore the confidence of the public in the finance company system in the country with the enactment of this piece of legislation.

Thank you very much. [. . 4.53 ] ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) , , . , . . 4061.3 . 60.7 . 1643.7. 24 . 985.4 14.7 . . . . 14 . 64 . ,

( - , ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Mr. Presiding Member, an amendment made to the Sri Lanka Export Development Act, No. 40 of 1979, increasing the cess on export of raw rubber by Gazette

783 784

Extraordinary No. 1712/23 dated 1st July, 2011, has been tabled today for ratification by this House. The objective of the Government imposing cess is to discourage export of products in primary form and increase export earnings of the country by exporting such products in value added form.

In recent times, the prices of natural rubber have been in the upward trend in the international market. The price of a kilogram of rubber which was around Rs. 348 in January 2010, has increased to Rs. 611 in January, 2011. While there is an increasing trend in the export of natural rubber, the Government has given priority to the promotion of exporting finished rubber products as a policy. Considering the increase in the price of natural rubber in the international market, the cess on export of raw rubber has been increased from Rs. 8 to Rs.12 per kilogram or 2 per cent of the FOB price, whichever is higher. In fact, the Sri Lanka Association of Manufacturers and Exporters of Rubber Products has in a letter addressed to me recently urged to revise the cess on export of natural rubber to Rs. 24 per kilogram.

Rubber manufacturing is a major component of Sri Lankas economy. As the worlds seventh largest natural rubber producing country, we offer many types and grades of rubber such as RRS, pale crepe, sole crepe, technically specified rubber and specialty rubber. Our rubber products are exported to sophisticated markets such as Europe and the USA and do not have any problem in adhering to international standards.

Mr. Presiding Member, I am pleased to mention that the rubber industry is well-established and well-equipped with facilities for testing, quality control, research and development. Sri Lanka also has an abundance of highly trained chemists, technologists, engineers, technicians, technologically advanced manufacturing processes and sophisticated equipment which collectively enable Sri Lanka to offer high quality products at competitive prices.

Despite our tremendous potential to manufacture high quality finished products targeting the end users, a considerable portion of our rubber is still exported in raw form. The shortage faced by the industry has compelled the importation of raw rubber. Sri Lanka imported raw rubber to the value of US Dollars 101 million in 2010 and to the value of US Dollars 105 million form January to July this year.

Last year, Sri Lanka exported rubber in raw form to the value of US Dollars 170 million and rubber finished products to the value of US Dollars 567 million. Therefore, clearly, local raw rubber channelled to the industry will save valuable foreign exchange.

The cess imposed on rubber exports will serve as a measure to channel more resources to the value added industry by discouraging exports in raw, unprocessed

forms. It will also support the objectives of developing the local value added industry as stipulated in the "Mahinda Chintana", the policy document which presents the vision for the future of our country.

A multitude of benefits will be generated within the local economy if the value added industry is developed. It will serve to increase employment opportunities, improve technical competence, increase the demand for local raw materials and supporting services, and in general, it will also serve to achieve our development objectives. Measures have been initiated by the Government to plough back the funds generated through the cess for the development of the rubber industry. Steps have been taken to increase the replanting subsidy by Rs. 50,000 and for new plantation by Rs. 25,000. Steps have also been taken to increase the subsidy for intercropping of rubber and tea. These moves are expected to increase the productivity of the rubber industry and increase latex production.

In 2010, local rubber production increased by 12 per cent, to 153 million kilograms. In the same year, replanting of rubber was carried out in 1,493 hectares, and 1,537 hectares were newly brought under rubber cultivation with Government assistance. It is also envisaged to expand rubber cultivation to non-traditional areas and the income generated from the cess will be utilized to carry out these activities.

Export earnings from rubber products registered a value of US Dollars 567 million in 2010, which is a 47 per cent increase over 2009. Export earnings from rubber products also increased by a striking 81 per cent up to US Dollars 494.3 million during the period January to July this year in comparison to the performance during the corresponding period last year. The main advantage enjoyed by our producers is the ability to source quality raw materials locally.

Rubber and rubber products are also the third largest contributor to the countrys export earnings. Therefore, the Export Development Board has identified this sector as a key area for development with a view to enhancing foreign exchange earnings of the country. The strategic plan prepared by the EDB aims to make the rubber industry a US Dollar one billion industry by 2015.

The demand for natural rubber products has also been expanding due to the rise in oil prices, which in turn has increased the price of synthetic rubber.

Natural rubber is also an environment-friendly product, which is preferred by environment-conscious developed countries.

Taking these positive factors into consideration, the EDB has planned several programmes to reposition Sri Lanka as a capable supplier of quality rubber products and systematically penetrate selected markets.

Sir, our exports are growing steadily. The total value of exports has increased from US Dollars 7.1 billion in 2009 to US Dollars 8.3 billion in 2010. The target set is US Dollars 15 billion in 2015 and US Dollars 20 billion in 2020.

Recently, I have launched the Sri Lanka Expo 2012 which is scheduled for March 2012, and I am confident that this mega show will contribute towards achieving the set export targets. I am sure that the efforts made by the EDB along with the efforts made by other stakeholders of the rubber industry will enable us to make this a US Dollar one billion industry by 2015.

I am pleased to state that my Ministry, through the successful implementation of its activities and plans, expects to contribute more to the economic and social development of Sri Lanka in its journey towards becoming the Wonder of Asia.

Thank you. [. . 5.52] ( )

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the history of Rome spans 2,800 years from the existence of a city that grew from a small Italian village in the 9th Century BC into the centre of a vast civilization that dominated the Mediterranean region for centuries. Also, Sir, Rome grew substantially after the war as one of the driving forces behind the "Italian Economic Miracle" of post-war reconstruction and modernization. It became a fashionable city in the 1950s and early 1960s which were the years of "la dolce vita" (the sweet life).

What we are endeavouring today is to give sweet life in a sweet Colombo, and in other urban areas.

Popular classic films such as Ben Hur, Quo Vadis, Roman Holiday and La dolce vita were filmed in the citys iconic Cinecitta Studios. That was the history and that was the civilization of Rome. It is always said that all roads lead to Rome. Today, all roads lead to Hambantota, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Colombo and Galle.

( ) (An Hon. Member) ?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Yes. Hambantota is part of this. ? ? . Simply because .

, ? . . , . . . ? I am very much surprised about the display of the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne today. I thought he is an intelligent man. I am sorry to say that he has fallen into the abysmal depth of life in Colombo. This is what has gone wrong when you join with the people of the calibre of the present UNPers. He showed intelligence until today. Today, the people will not hesitate to tag him as foolish.
