First, I would like to commend the Minister and the Deputy Minister for having made the six changes that are being proposed to the Food Act. The changes are most appropriate, particularly in relation to the application of standards. The reference is made here to the Sri Lanka Standards Bureau . . Sri Lanka Standards Bureau . Sri Lanka Standards Institution . . So, it should be corrected.

The Sri Lanka Standards Institution establishes the standards and the fact here is that with regard to food items also, the Sri Lanka Standards Institution should proceed to establish standards for all items as far as possible. It is a good move and once that is done, it is the Ministry of Health that has to implement those standards and see that those standards are conformed with. So, I am very glad that this amendment has been brought in because this is filling a vacuum that existed in the past and I would like to commend the Ministry of Health for doing this. With regard to the implementation of standards, it is important that the Sri Lanka Standards Institution should be actively involved in directing the Ministry of Health and giving the necessary laboratory backup. That too can be done in terms of what is being proposed here.

I would also like to commend the reference to packaging materials. The standards for food packaging materials must ensure that no harm is done to the consumer. As we know in trying to sell food items, there is more money sometimes being spent on the packaging than on the food itself. We have to make sure that the packaging is done properly and it must be done in a way that it will not endanger the health of the consumer.

The other important issue that is coming up is the shelf life of imports. This Regulation, I think, is very appropriate because, especially as there is a significant number of food items that are imported, we have to make sure that these food items when they get on to the shelves of the retail stores, have a minimum shelf life of 60 per cent. It is very important that this Regulation is not only framed but is implemented. I would request that there should be a proper checking and implementing mechanism established by the Ministry of Health to make sure that this very good Regulation is actually put into effect.

The question of deoxidants I think is also very appropriate, because in Sri Lanka today there is an increase in coronary heart disease. The importance of

deoxidants to diminish that is something that has to be recognized. I am glad that this Regulation published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1617/16 of 1st of September, 2009 does so and encourages the use of these deoxidants.

The other is the melamine content in milk and milk products. We are well aware that in checking for the quality of milk, what is done is to assess the nitrogen level. Nitrogen is a reflection of the protein content of milk, a major nutritional factor in milk. We know in China how melamine was substituted with the intention of getting a higher reading with regard to the nitrogen content, and that has now been banned in China. The Codex Alimentarius Commission has stressed the importance of eliminating that danger and I am glad that the Ministry of Health has taken action to make sure that anything containing melamine will not get into the food of our people.

The question of formaldehyde use is, as we know, an illegal act but it is widely practised in the country and I am glad that Regulations are being framed to tighten the conditions for its detection and for taking action against the use of formaldehyde to preserve fish in particular.

So, while commending these Regulations which are being moved by the Minister of Health, I would like to take this occasion to refer to the Food Act, No. 26 of 1980 and stress that one area in particular needs to be addressed, and that is the problem of advertising. It is not taken up in these Regulations but maybe in the course of time the Ministry of Health will look into this. We know that in large-scale, there are erroneous advertisements in connection with various food items and these food items are being sold under completely false claims and the consumers are being fooled. Actually, some of these claims are even harmful. This type of advertising is very clearly banned in terms of the Food Act, No. 26 of 1980. For instance, Section 3 (1) of the Food Act states, I quote:

No person shall label, package, treat, process, sell or advertise any food in a manner that is false, misleading, deceptive or likely to create an erroneous impression regarding its character, value, quality, composition, merit or safety.

This is a very clearly worded, very appropriate Section and I hope that there will be stern action taken. If you look at the newspapers, if you look at the various media, the type of false advertising that goes on misleading the public, misleading the consumer has to be stopped and I appeal to the Ministry of Health to take suitable action in that regard.

I again stress the importance of standards and I commend the direction in which the Ministry of Health is moving and hope that stern action will be taken with regard to that as well.

Thank you.

I move,

"This House resolves to appreciate the services rendered by the Urban Development Authority for the excellent performance during the past two year period in making the City of Colombo one of the beautiful Cities in South East Asia, with the able direction provided by Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Secretary, Ministry of Defence and well implemented by Mr. Omar Kamil, Special Commissioner of Colombo.

Their joint efforts to improve the quality of life of the people living in underserved settlement in the City under the guidance and direction of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa is praiseworthy. Improvements to Galle Road from Bambalapitiya Junction to Kollupitiya Junction is the first step towards our march to make Sri Lanka the Wonder of Asia, as declared by His Excellency the President of Republic.

The work that had been undertaken and executed by the Colombo Municipal Council jointly with the Secretary, Ministry of Defence within this short period should be a model to other local bodies and this House resolves to request all other Municipal Councils and Urban Councils in Sri Lanka to introduce such beautification and development programmes in their respective administrative areas.

Madam Presiding Member, the Colombo Municipal Council is one of the ancient administrative councils in the whole of Asia. It was once called the Garden City of Asia. The Colombo Municipal Council in the past two years have been involved in the beautification of the City of Colombo and had introduced an accelerated programme to bring about a visible change in the city. - [Interruption.] , . ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) In this connection, the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and the Chairman of the UDA, Mr. Janaka Kurukulasuriya, have extended their fullest support to improve the city together with the assistance of the police and the armed forces. Here is another fine example that after the war was won, after 30

627 628

years, those war heroes are involving themselves sacrificing much more time and energy in order to give a better quality of life not only to the people of Colombo but also to the entire country. This is a great example shown by our Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. As a result, tremendous improvement is taking place in the city centre from Fort to Bambalapitiya along the Galle Road and a visible change has taken place in the Vihara Mahadevi Park and the Independence Square. Sidewalks have been improved and roads have been rehabilitated. - [Interruption.] , . High walls have been removed and the garden city concept has been re-established. Madam, when you go to Malaysia you can see the beauty of that Garden City. The concept of a "Green City" has been introduced to the City of Colombo by the Government of Mahinda Rajapaksa. Extra size hoardings and unauthorized hoardings which marred the beauty of the city have also been brought down. Posters on walls along the roads have now been banned and in this regard the CMC has installed 250 bill boards throughout the city. New street name boards in the city have also brought about a change and this too has helped in enhancing the city beautification.

Roundabouts, street lights, traffic lights, resurfacing of the roads, reduced traffic congestion and attractive atmosphere is now visible in all parts of the city. It is like reading the ancient history of Greek dotted with such beautiful foot paths and roads. The Galle Road, the Bloemendhal Road which is now being carpeted, Sir James Peiris Mawatha, Kumaran Ratnam Mawatha, Union Place and Panchikawatte Road are among the roads that have been rehabilitated.

City beautification programme is on; it is an on-going process. There will be more new features in the weeks to come. That is the position today.

Madam Presiding Member, then there was a committee appointed by the present administrator guided by Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa who won the war in Sri Lanka. Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa will also pave the way for us to win the election on the 8th of October, 2011 by his city beautification programme. - [Interruption.]

? . ; . . . . . We believe that working as a team we will be able to make Colombo a cleaner, healthier and a more beautiful city that is visible to everyone.

Then, there is a very illustrative article written by veteran journalist Wijitha Nakkawita in "The Nation" of Sunday, 11th September, 2011, where Mr. Omar Kamil

says, I quote:

"I am happy to have been instrumental in this task and the citizens of Colombo will appreciate what we have achieved."

At a time when Mr. Omar Kamil is about to say goodbye to the Municipality, I stand up in this House and pay our tribute to the selfless services rendered by him to bring about a renaissance to the Capital City and ably guided by the UDA. We must also place our appreciation on record to the UDA Chairman, Mr. Janaka Kurukulasuriya and the Director-General Mr. Nanda.

Then, Madam, Presiding Member, I want to tell you this : Colombo has a new look. We have had so many Mayors from the Sellamuttus, Rudras, Greros, great V.A. Sugathadasas, Vincent Pereras, M.H. Mohameds, Jabir A. Caders, Kumaran Ratnams definitely but not John Pulle.

Then, I must tell you, convinced of the great work that has been carried on in the Capital City in the past by seven Mayors, they have now joined hands with President Mahinda Rajapaksa in order to see a new administration under the United People's Freedom Alliance established on the 8th of October.

Now, see these colourful personalities who are working to beautify the City of Colombo : the Hon. M.H. Mohamed, the first Muslim Mayor of Colombo, the Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie who is a senior Minister who came to SLFP much before all of us, then Hussain Mohamed, Omar Kamil, Uvais Mohamed Imtiyaz -that is your - he is also helping us and he is with us today. Also, there is Mr. Prasanna Gunawardena with the UPFA. Mr. K. Ganeshalingam is no more, but his beloved wife Yamuna is contesting under the UPFA ticket. There is also Jihan Hameed to help President Mahinda Rajapaksa to build a strong city.

Then, Deputy Mayors Mohamed Maharoof and Azad Sally are also with us. At this moment, I am inclined to quote from " ." Now, listen to this; if you have ears, listen to what Colombo looked like then. There is a beautiful stanza in Sinhala, which states:

? . . . . . . , , " " . . . . . , , .

Improvements have been made for a shopping mall at the former Dutch Hospital building at Colombo Fort, Independence Square surrounding developments, redevelopment of the Racecourse Ground and Grandstand, then Beira Lake Restoration Project - . . There is the construction of linear parks and model parks, Beddagana Biodiversity Park and Bird Sanctuary, Parliament Ground improvements. ? - - ground .

Then, there is the bubble at Beira Lake, Waters Edge improvements, Viharamahadevi Park improvements, and dedicating pavements for pedestrians. They are all given a wonderful facelift. Even outside Colombo, a lot of developments are undertaken such as the Hambantota Beach Park improvements, Matara Beach Park improvements, Matara town beautification programme and development around Lake Gregory. Millions and millions of money have been spent on these development programmes. That is why we call this country "The Miracle of Asia". The more we progress, the more money is being spent in order to develop, redevelop, enhance the prestige of not only the capital cities, but also all the other cities.

The other day, Sir, the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, the Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie and myself went to Kalmunai. Now, Kalmunai is also a Municipal Council area for which elections are being held.
