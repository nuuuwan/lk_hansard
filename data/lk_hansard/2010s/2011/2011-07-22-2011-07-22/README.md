( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Sir, I asked whether the Minister can make a statement on that. I did not ask that under Standing Order No. 23(2). I made a request. If the Government turns it down, I have no problem with it because by the time I take it up again, the rest of the money will be sold. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) All what I am trying to say is, you raised a question under Standing Order No. 23(2) about elections in the local authorities, especially relating to the Northern Province. After reading the question, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition did mention something about borrowing. If you come in the correct way the Government will respond.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Chief Government Whip, after the Hon. Leader of the House replied to my question, I thanked him and then I asked him whether it was possible to take that matter up because it was a separate one. We generally make requests from the Government. All you have to say is "yes" or "no". If it is "no", it is alright. If it is "yes", you have to tell why you were doing it. Obviously, you are worried and for some reason, you do not want to disclose it. It is all right. We have other ways of taking it up. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Thank you. , .

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Presiding Member, when we talk of the late Minister, Hon. Harold Herat, we always refer to him as a gentleman politician; a politician who regarded politics as a gentlemans vocation. I knew the Hon. Harold Herat very well even before he came to Parliament. As he was a member of the legal fraternity practised in Chilaw and Puttalam, he happened to be a very good friend of my brother who was also a lawyer. Through him I came to know the Hon. Harold Herat very closely. Moreover, there was a relationship between the Hon. Harold Herat and the Member of Parliament, the Hon. Paris Perera. However, the Hon. Harold Herat became the President of the Bar Association of Marawila and thereafter, he practised for a considerable period of time. The late President J.R Jayewardene was very keen that he entered politics. He was hand-picked as a candidate to contest the Nattandiya Electorate. I think the Hon. Milroy Fernando knows it personally. Really, he succeeded the late Speaker, Sir Albert F. Peries, who represented the Nattandiya Electorate. As was mentioned earlier, the Hon. Harold Herat was educated at Joseph Vaz College, St. Josephs College, Maris Stella College and finally at the Law College. He was also the Secretary of the Chilaw-Negombo Planters' Association at that time because he was one of the respected planters who owned a large extent of coconut lands in that area. Even today, I think some of his lands are still there. With the land reforms, some lands went to the Government. Whatever extent that was left is now owned by his wife and children.

He was a sportsman in addition to his politics. He was a keen tennis player who took a very great interest and the Marawila Sports Club survived because of him. He was the live wire behind that club. Whenever he had the opportunity he went and played with his fellowmen in that area.

The Hon. Harold Herat was the State Minister for Finance, Deputy State Minister for Plantation, Deputy Minister of Janatha Estates Development, Minister of Justice and Minister of Foreign Affairs. I had a very close association with him during the time I was his Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was a very fine Minister to work with; no conflicts, no problems and no disputes. He always delegated duties to the Deputy Minister and he carried on. He was loved by the diplomatic community at that time since he was an educated person, a gentleman, a socialite and a man who was conversant with the English language. I remember he had very close links, relations and friendships with all the diplomats during that period. Hence, the Government was able to carry their messages to the diplomatic community through him in all international affairs. At that time, respective leaders of our party, the Government and the

1321 1322

[ ]

2011 22

Presidents invariably nominated the Hon. Harold Herat to lead the delegations to the international fora. He did maintain a very high standard and he did what was required for the welfare and benefit of the country. As was read out, a number of delegations were led by him as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and during his period when he was the Minister of Coconut Industries, research on coconut was intensively done in the Philippines and he was able to bring home many of those important research activities in the field of plantation. Therefore, I must say that he was one of the pillars of the United National Party who was responsible for giving popularity to the Party in all forms and in all parts of the country.

I must also mention that his beloved wife was an actress at that time who very ably assisted the Hon. Harold Herat in his political affairs and ensured his victory at all elections.

She is a very dynamic and active lady. One of her favourite sports was the womens cricket, which she cultivated to a very great extent. She devoted her time, energy and resources to develop the womens cricket teams, to take them abroad and to find them an opportunity of participating in international matches. It was a very well-known fact. The Hon. Harold Herats three children are well educated and well-off in life holding very high positions in all quarters.

Therefore, Sir, I am very sorry about the demise of the late Deshabandu Harold Herat. It is something that all of us have to face, but nevertheless, it would be very difficult to find a man of that calibre in the political arena and I convey my sympathies to the members of his bereaved family.

Finally, I would also like to say that we, the United National Party, are extremely sorry that we have lost a very strong and able Member in our Parliament.

Thank you. [. . 3.50 ]

, , , , , . . [. . 4.21] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Presiding Member, let me start by quoting from "Letters to Young Men" written by Jean Baptiste Lacordaire, edited by Count de Montalembert. It states:

"Real excellence and humility are not incompatible one with the other. On the contrary they are twin sisters".

The Hon. Harold Herat was such a person; a genial, kind, humane and caring gentleman. The Hon. Harold Herat lived in a spacious mansion in Marawila, which I used to visit on my way to Puttalam very frequently when I was in charge of the Puttalam Electorate in that Parliament. He commenced his legal practice in Chilaw and Marawila. Even as a junior in the profession, when he walked into the court, he was the cynosure of all eyes. His mien, his demeanour, his refined gracefulness and personality caused a fleeting moment of silence when he entered.

It has been said that the law is a jealous mistress. As his initial interest in politics became more intense, within a short time he broke the shackles of this jealous mistress. He won the Parliamentary seat for Nattandiya and held it for more than a score of years.

He met Gwen and it was "love at first sight", as it goes. Together, they made a lovely couple and three wonderful children - Shamara, Awanka and Parveen.

He was one of a rare breed who was naturally friendly and friendliness had a certain magnetism in him. He never frowned at others. Unpleasant circumstances made him silent and thoughtful. His speech was measured, thinking on his feet and his voice was soft and mellow. His mind was like milk and he was sweet. If I give a name to honey and milk put together, that was Harold.

He could raise the decibel count especially in wide open spaces at election time when his voice would be heard clearly to the farther boundaries. And, this was the reason that all whom he met in politics to whatever political party they belonged, exuded friendliness. He paid little attention to security at that time. Even at the height of the JVP, we used to go with him right round the

Puttalam Electorate in the Puttalam District visiting many villages whether it be a farming village or a fishing village. If somebody advised him, Do not go, it is dangerous he would smile and say, Do not worry, no one would harm me. That was his reply. No one born on this land would dare to harm him. He was such a good man, a saintly man. Most of the evenings he used to visit the Marawila Club with his two sets of tennis and often return after dusk, without any security.

He was the President of the Marawila Sports Club for five consecutive years. He held the highest positions in the Government. His first appointment was as the Minister of Coconut Industries. That subject was closed to his heart and mind. He was the owner of perhaps the highest yielding coconut property in Sri Lanka. Later, he was the Minister of Justice; Minister of State for Finance; Minister of Foreign Affairs - a series of responsible portfolios. His speeches were listened to, whether in Parliament or as the guest speaker in a gamut of countries worldwide and in the United Nations, attentively and their contents noted appreciatively.

He also spoke very well in Sinhala. He was a very clever, adept Sinhala speaker. He was very calm and quiet. There were moments of disturbances - I would not call enemies - political contenders came at him charging. He discharged them with a soft smile.

He was very close, I must say, to the Muslims of Puttalam, particularly, the Kottaramulla area. There, he improved a school called Hijira Vidyalaya. I remember, when I used to go with him for any Milad-un-Nabi celebrations or any prize-givings, he loved partaking in watalappam. At one moment, he remarked: This is a part of the culture of Muslim people in this country. There was also a friend of mine, a scholar from India, who was at that moment promptly answered: " , . . There is a vast reservoir of knowledge in the books on Islamic literature, history, civilization, culture and arts. Please give those books to the Minister". That was Mr. S.K. Shahul Hameed of Kayalpatnam, who served as my Co-ordinating Secretary when I was the Minister of Muslim Affairs.

The Hon. Harold Herat retired from politics, gracefully, and so is remembered with affection by all, whose lives he touched in numerous ways during his political career. An index of cordiality, the sincerity of friendship members of all political parties had for the Hon. Harold Herat and the esteem in which he was held was that members of all parties in the region were the organizers and prime movers in the invitation to participate in the ceremony, when the new public library dedicated to him was opened and his statue was unveiled on his second death anniversary.

Indeed, the momentum is rapidly moving for each of us to be Sri Lankans first and Sri Lankans last and that precisely has been the Hon. Harold Herats life story. As

1331 1332

His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa told us in this Parliament: this is our Mother Country, everyone should love our Mother Country, and, first I am a Sri Lankan; second I am a Sri Lankan; third I am a Sri Lankan. That was the avowed belief of that great man, the Hon. Harold Herat. He cared for all whom he touched with kindness and gentleness, sans creed, sans caste, sans ethnicity, caring not for human divisions. On that day, members of all political parties bonded themselves together to affectionately honour his life and service to humanity.

Of the many and varied facets of the distinguishing qualities and notable traits, many would remember the richness of his moral values, his nobility of thought and deed, his steadfast loyalty to honesty and integrity, his inflexible principles of excellence and strength and more, which, to the Hon. Harold Herat was natural and a way of life; and so, he was a living example to the young and the not-so young. He never sacrificed principle for profit nor convictions for convenience.

Despite the inevitable stresses, strains and tension of the constant pressures and problems of the bonds, the Hon. Harold Herat managed time, whether day or night, to honour his appointments and he was sharp on time to attend any meetings or functions.

He had an amazing incline to switch off his political life and switch on to his family life, which was exemplary. As I told you, he was a loving and caring husband, a lovable father of three children.

Mention was also made about his beloved and darling wife.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have to wind up at 4.30 p.m. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) She herself has been in the forefront in promoting cricket among women cricketers. She also has written three books on cricket. She is a voracious reader and a very talented writer. She was the only woman who wrote two books in English on cricket, one was Tomorrows Cricketer and the other one was Turf Heroes. She was also in the ICC. She promoted cricket and took teams abroad. It was so with the other members of that family.

I would quote one incident, Sir. The Hon. Harold Herat visited Brunei and met His Majesty Abdul Rahman Bolkiah. After that he used to say that we must have a very close friendship with Malaysia, Indonesia, Malaysian Straits and Indonesian Archipelago.

The "World View of The Island" of 20th July, 2011 states, I quote:

"Muslim-Majority Malaysia and Vatican Establish Diplomatic Relations"

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have to wind up now. Your time is up. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) This was the aim and objective of the Hon. Harold Herat. May his soul be sanctified!

Thank you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by both sides of the House on the death of the Hon. Harold Herat, ex-Member of Parliament. I shall direct the Secretary-General of Parliament to make a Minute of the Proceedings of todays Meeting and send a copy thereof to the members of the bereaved family.

Thank you.

Last week one of the most finest bus depots was declared open by His Excellency the President in Galle.

Tomorrow you will see the results of the Local Authorities Election in the Jaffna Peninsula and in other areas. People are stunned to see the tremendous development - not only in the Northern area, but also in other areas - that is being initiated through "Mahinda Chintana". There are Vel celebrations being held in Tamil Kovils. The Adi Vel will take place in Colombo. That will come along wending its way through Temple Trees. The Leader of the Nation will welcome the Vel Chariot at Temple Trees. This is not happening in India or in any part of the world.

Today, in Colombo you will see a revival of the Tamil culture and literature. This afternoon, while I am speaking here, the Thirukkural Vizha will commence at the Colombo Tamil Sangam in Wellawatta. This is the most impressive scenario that we find all over Colombo at the moment. People are very happy. I would also ask the Hon. Minister of Transport to make available bus services as much as possible during the Vel Vizha, because this time lakhs of people are going to flock the streets of Colombo. At the same time, there is also the Udappu Thirupathi Amman Kovil Vizha. I will ask the Hon. Minister to increase the bus service from Puttalam to that area. He was also very helpful in organizing express - special - train services for the Keeriyankalli Mosque in Puttalam, the Ketchimale Mosque in Beruwala and also

the Akuressa-Poruwa Godapitiya Mosque, where the last bomb of the Tigers went off killing certain people and injuring Ministers like the Hon. Mahinda Wijesekera. That was the last bomb of the LTTE. , the Minister had visited that place for the Meelad-un-Nabi celebrations. . CID . , . . . CID . There is another request, Sir.

. Sir, advancement in transport is rapidly changing the landscape of many countries. Metro rails and tube rails are being built in many countries in the world. I think it is time that we also introduce the system of metro and tube trains so that it will be very helpful to build a modern transport system in Sri Lanka.

I must say that the newspapers which are fast sold are the Lake House papers including the "Thinakaran". It has a "Yarl" edition also. There were 20,000 newspapers printed recently. As a result of printing "Thinakaran", and "Yarl Thinakaran" there was a profit of Rs. 359,000 for the Lake House. I must pay my compliments to Mr. Bandula Padmakumara, the Chairman; Mr. T. Senthilvelavar, the Editor of the "Sunday Yarl Thinakaran" and also senior editors like Shuhaib Cassim, who write to help the development programmes in this country. You do not like Jaffna to be developed.- [Interruption.] This is the problem.

Siripala Rajapaksha, Editor of Hansard, has served in this Parliament for 28 years. He is the 21st Editor of Hansard and was the Editor for the last four years. He will be retiring on the 28th of July, 2011. This is the last day of Sitting before his retirement. So, we will pay our compliments to him on behalf of the Government, all the Hon. Members including you, Sir, for all the good work done during his tenure of service. He is also fortunate, like his predecessors, to have a very conscientious and talented staff in the Hansard Department. I wish him good luck in his retirement.

Thank you very much.
