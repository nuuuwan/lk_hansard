QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

DETERIORATION IN DIPLOMATIC POSTINGS ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Speaker, I am extremely thankful to you for providing this opportunity for raising a very important issue under Standing Order No. 23(2). Sir, it has been noted that during the last several years severe consternation and frustration has been caused in the ranks of the Sri Lanka Foreign Service due to the actions of the Government in appointing outsiders - non-career diplomats- to diplomatic postings. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) What is the point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the appointment of Ambassadors and Ministers is a prerogative of His Excellency the President as clearly stated in the Constitution. He is questioning the prerogative of the Executive of this country. This question cannot be allowed, Sir, because he is questioning the prerogative of the President. It cannot be questioned in the House unless he brings a substantive Motion. He is not the Leader of the Opposition also, Sir. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) , cricket commentator ? .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) More particularly, many of these appointments have been given to military personnel giving the impression that Sri Lanka is a military State. Furthermore, several other appointments have been given to raw youngsters who have no academic or other qualifications but happen to be friends or relatives of very influential persons. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . . .

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) . [ ]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) It was agreed earlier that in making appointments to Foreign Missions, a ratio of 60 to 40 per cent will be maintained between the foreign service officers on one hand and non-service personnel on the other. This ratio as of today has been observed in the breach.

This has resulted in a totally unprofessional Foreign Service unable to meet several challenges that Sri Lanka is facing presently in the international sphere such as the Darusman Report and calls from various foreign agencies and even countries to answer several charges that had been made against Sri Lanka .

The situation has become so bad in the foreign service that several senior officers have left the service and joined foreign organizations such as universities and so on depriving Sri Lanka of their knowledge and experience.

The normal procedure for recruitment and appointment to the Foreign Service has been through an open competitive examination. It appears that this procedure has also been now overlooked.

Consequently our Government is not fully in control of our foreign affairs to secure our national interest and Sri Lankas foreign policy has ended up in a failure.

This is evidenced by the fact that Sri Lanka lost benefits of the General System of Preferences - GSP - which resulted in a closure of several garment industries with the Foreign Ministry helplessly looking on.

No attempt was made to educate the foreign countries about the steps taken to eliminate terrorism and the post-war issues, especially rebuilding of the North and East and rehabilitating the people who had been entrapped by terrorism. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Our failure has also resulted in the Darusman Report with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs again helplessly looking on while the rest of the world has made an issue of it to the total disadvantage of Sri Lanka.

These failures on the part of the Government have resulted in our losing support both politically and economically of the West and more importantly, we have distanced ourselves from our closest neighbour, India.

In short, this Government has meddled and muddled with our foreign policy.

Therefore, Sir, will the Hon. Minister who is present here explain to this House what the Government proposes to do in order to arrest the deteriorating position and frustration of career diplomats? Thank you Sir.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . () . . .

() .. ( )

( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Speaker, I am truly amazed at the question that has been put to me by the Chief Opposition Whip, the Hon. John Amaratunga, and the brief statement that he made preceding the question which he posed. I would like to respond point by point to the issues that are involved in the statement that he made as well as the questions that he posed to me.

Let us take first the charge that Sri Lankas interests have been jeopardized by the appointment of former military personnel. Let us look at the performance of some of these persons. Let us look at their track record. I propose to start with Shavendra Silva. Shavendra Silva did yeoman service to this nation. In New York, he took on courageously, fearlessly and effectively the

International Non-Governmental Organizations who were trying their best to tarnish the image of Sri Lanka. Shavendra Silva exposed all the deficiencies and shortcomings in the arguments of the INGOs. He analysed the footage and he made undoubtedly a very convincing, indeed compelling, case for Sri Lanka. I think, above the level of partisan strife and discord, we have to appreciate the services of an honest and capable officer, who to the best of his ability is serving the interests of his motherland. His opponents had nothing to say in response to his argument. The Hon. John Amaratunga can check this for himself. Their only response was to ask Shavendra Silva why he did not express his views to the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. Shavendra Silva in a particularly effective reply said that he had given evidence before the LLRC not once but twice. He added that he gave that evidence not spontaneously or voluntarily, but in response to an order by the LLRC that Shavendra Silva should appear before it and tell the Commission what he knew. I think every objective and right-thinking person in this country will applaud what Shavendra Silva did on that occasion for Sri Lanka.

Let us then also look at the performance of Wasantha Karannagoda who recently assumed office as our Ambassador in Japan. I would like to tell my Friend, the Hon. John Amaratunga that there are certain attributes and qualities that we look for in persons who represent this country abroad. In the case of Shavendra Silva, he was particularly articulate. He presented his arguments in a methodical and systematic way. Military people can do other things as well. It is a great mistake to assume - [Interruption.] Please, I did not interrupt you. -[Interruption.] No, no. I want to be heard out. I have the right to say what I have to say in response to the questions that you asked. So, Shavendra Silva demonstrated to the full those inherent capabilities that he had outside the sphere of military action in the battlefield.

Wasantha Karannagoda has also demonstrated very convincingly some important attributes. Wasantha Karannagoda was sent to Tokyo soon after a natural calamity in Japan. I refer to the tsunami and the earthquake disaster. We have had in this country during the last six weeks, three very important representatives of the Government of Japan. I refer to the Deputy Foreign Minister of Japan, another Senior Representative of the Foreign Office in Japan and the Senior Vice-Minister of the Cabinet Office of Japan. They told us that they regard Wasantha Karannagoda as a national hero. I am not saying this. This was stated to me and also to His Excellency the President of Sri Lanka by high-ranking representatives of the Government of Japan. When he went there, he breathed life and vigour into the effort that was being made by the Government of Japan to give relief to the people who were affected by these natural calamities. In particular, he visited the Buddhist Temples. He motivated the Sri Lankans there. He coordinated these efforts. Sri Lanka sent to Japan a team of people who had

383 384

hands-on experience of dealing with these disasters. This was empirical experience which they had gathered in our own country in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster. Wasantha Karannagoda's achievement was to coordinate this effort to the fullest satisfaction of the Government of Japan. So, he demonstrated his capability to motivate people, to energize them, to galvanize them into action and he did that in an exemplary manner.

Just this week, Thisara Samarasinghe, who, like Wasantha Karannagoda, had served as the Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy, assumed duties as our High Commissioner in Australia. I think any fair-minded person will concede that he did a magnificent job organizing what has come to be known as the "Galle Dialogue" and the 60th Anniversary Celebrations of the Sri Lanka Navy where more than forty countries participated. This was a massive organizational effort and he succeeded it in a way that has won the admiration, not only of the Government of Sri Lanka, but of all the governments that were represented there. On both those occasions I delivered keynote addresses at the invitation of the Ministry of Defence. I know the warm feelings that all those delegates at high levels from foreign governments had, the warmth, the appreciation that was showered lavishly on Thisara Samarasinghe. He has begun his work there. He phoned me yesterday as well as today, and he is combating, in what I consider to be a very effective manner, the propaganda of the merchants of terror in the country to which he has been accredited. I think it is grossly unfair to try to attack these persons.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) There is no attack. There is a position of military attach in every embassy. Why can you not give that position to them? That is my argument.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) No, in this case they are performing yeomen service for this country as heads of missions and heads of missions they will be; heads of missions they will remain.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Then, you cancel the diplomatic -

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) No, I will come to that later. In the case of these persons it is not our intention to relegate them to the position of military attaches. They are doing this country proud as heads of missions and we have every reason for satisfaction with their performance.

Then, another criticism by the Hon. John Amaratunga has to do with the Darusman Report. He regards that that is a failure. He says the Government of Sri Lanka has not succeeded in informing the mind of the international community with regard to the Darusman Report. Nothing, Mr. Speaker, could be further from the truth. Let us now consider what Yasushi Akashi had said about the Darusman Report only ten days ago. Yasushi Akashi is a Special Adviser to the Foreign Ministry of the Government of Japan. He is a special representative of the imperial Government of Japan to Sri Lanka. He is a highly-respected figure in Japan and internationally. He was also the first Japanese to join the United Nations System.

Akashi, addressing the 16th Joint Commission Meeting of the Japan-Sri Lanka Business Association, just 10 days ago, which was also attended by my distinguished Colleague, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, said that the Darusman Report was totally improper in his view. He said he has studied it painstakingly, that was the word that was used by Yasushi Akashi, and said that he had found material in that report which was taken straight out of other documents such as material prepared by the International Crisis Group. He said the wordings were the same. He said it has been done without acknowledgment and material culled from other sources is passed off as the independent work of what has come to be known as the Darusman Panel. This is not what I am saying on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka. This is the view that has been expressed about the quality of the Darusman Report by someone whose stature is established all over the world. During the meeting of the Human Rights Council in Geneva last month, there was a certain assumption with regard to the Darusman Report. Together with four of my Ministerial Colleagues, I attended the Non-aligned Conference in Bali, Indonesia and on that occasion we had the opportunity of interacting with as many as 22 delegations representing non-aligned countries. They were agreed on one matter. Whatever differences of opinion they may have had with regard to other issues, they were agreed on one matter; that the Darusman Report should not be submitted to the Human Rights Council in Geneva, it is not a fit and proper document for substantive discussion by the Human Rights Council, it is not an official United Nations document and as such it would be of travesty of the procedure of the Human Rights Council to have this matter taken up for discussion in Geneva by the Human Rights Council. This was undoubtedly the consensus of non-aligned countries who met in Bali, Indonesia a couple of months ago. The United Nations Secretary-General, His Excellency Ban Ki-moon has stated that this is not his report, it is a report that has been submitted to him by an advisory panel that he had appointed. It is not his report. It does not have the imprimatur of any legitimate organ of the United Nations System. That is undoubtedly the correct position.

I would like to tell my Friend, the Hon. John Amaratunga that these things do not happen coincidentally, they are not fortuitous. These results have been obtained through painstaking effort by the Government of Sri Lanka, which has gone to great lengths to inform the international community about the reality surrounding the Darusman Report and these are the fruits of those endeavours. The explicit, the emphatic opinion of Yasushi Akasi going very far indeed, the stand taken by the non-aligned countries with regard to the status of the Darusman Report and what the UN System has itself said about the Darusman Report so far, these are all the direct consequence of persevering and fruitful efforts which have been made by the Government of Sri Lanka with regard to this matter.

Then, the Hon. John Amaratunga made, what I consider to be a preposterous statement, that no attempt was made to educate the foreign countries about the steps taken to eliminate terrorism and the post-war issues, especially the rebuilding of the North and the East and rehabilitating the people who have been entrapped by terrorism. That is a total falsification of the truth. Now, Mr. Speaker, this is a total falsification of the ground reality. Alistair Burt the British Minister for South Asian Affairs of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had a conversation with me over the phone a couple of weeks ago. During that telephone conversation, he told me that he appreciated the very complete information that had been placed at the disposal of the British Government by the Government of Sri Lanka with regard to all the activities that is taking place in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. Not only did the Honourable Alistair Burt make that remark to me in the course of the telephone conversation, he said that clearly in a statement that was issued out of his office and he reiterated that position on the Floor of the House of Commons. So, it is the Opposition that is propagating this myth, not Yasushi Akashi, not Alistair Burt, not Ban Ki-moon and not the Non Aligned Movement. They recognize the reality of the situation. These are irresponsible statements by elements within this country. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) What about the Darusman Report? () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Speaker, not only Alistair Burt, but as far as the rebuilding of the North and the East is concerned, the Joint Media statement issued at the end of my official visit to India between the 15th and the 17th of May makes explicit reference to the enormous progress which has been made in the North of Sri Lanka with regard to the very matters which are referred to by the Hon. John Amaratunga. That is, India recognizes that these achievements have taken place.

Then, there are Parliamentary delegations which have visited this country, Mr. Speaker. We have had Parliamentary Delegations from the European Union, from Germany, from Australia among other countries. All those Parliamentary Delegations have paid high tribute to the work which has been done so far with regard to rehabilitation and reconstruction in the Northern Province. These are tributes paid to the quality of that work by foreign delegations. Of course they have said that there is more to be done. That is obviously the case. You cannot rectify overnight a situation which has developed over several decades. But they paid high tribute to the quality and the scope of the work which has been done so far.

The Hon. John Amaratunga - I was very surprised at this - referred to GSP Plus. Mr. Speaker, on the Floor of this House, I have tabled a letter written by his own leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe to Benita Ferrero Waldner, who was at that time the equivalent of the Foreign Minister of the European Union. Her former designation was Commissioner for External Relations and Neighbourhood Policy. About four days before my official meeting with her in my capacity as Sri Lankas Minister of International Trade, there was a letter sent under the signature of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe telling Benita Ferrero Waldner that Sri Lanka was in breach of her obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as Sri Lanka was not in compliance and did not qualify for the extension of GSP Plus facilities. This was a letter which was given to me by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghes own side. Because of the internal situation, this letter that was written to the Foreign Minister of the European Union was placed in my hands and I tabled it on the Floor of this House. Not only that, I tabled on the Floor of this House an interview that was given to The Hindu newspaper by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe where he openly, unabashedly, shamelessly calls upon the UN and the West to intervene directly in this country. This is unique behaviour, Mr. Speaker. I say this not in anger but with deep sadness. I am firmly convinced that no Leader of the Opposition anywhere in the world would behave as he has done. Here was a letter - [Interruption.] The Leader of the Opposition in this country asks the Foreign Minister of the European Union not to extend GSP Plus benefits because Sri Lanka does not satisfy conditions in his view. [Interruption.]

Then, he goes to India and says openly that the West must intervene in this country. The Hon. John Amaratunga has the effrontery - I use the word effrontery - having done all of this, not he himself, after all this has happened, he has the effrontery to place at the door of the Government culpability with regard to matters connected with GSP Plus.

387 388

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) It is a shame!

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Speaker, he has made the complaint - [Interruption.] You must be fair, Hon. John Amaratunga. Only two days ago -

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Under the Ceasefire Agreement -

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena returned recently from Malaysia and Singapore. Do you know that 48 hours ago, somebody very high in the LTTE hierarchy, somebody very closely linked to the LTTE was arrested in Malaysia. That happened 48 hours ago. Now, there have been many people arrested in the European countries during the last two months. Several countries in Europe have sent missions here, Mr. Speaker, to cooperate with us in gathering information. All of this has happened largely and we have to give due credit to former military personnel who have done very valuable work with regard to these matters.

Then, the Hon. John Amaratunga complained about the appointment of what he regarded as outsiders. Mr. Speaker, the present position is that in the Sri Lanka Foreign Service, the total cadre is 237. We are carrying at the moment 97 vacancies. So, 97 out of 237 positions are vacant at present. Of course, we want to fill those vacancies.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Order, please! 2.00 . ?

( ) (Hon. Members) Aye.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Speaker, a statement which has been made on the face of it is damaging and it is my duty, on behalf of the Government, to set the record straight. Now, with regard to the large number of vacancies that we are carrying at present, we have held an open competitive examination in February 2011. The results have not yet been released. It is an examination held by the Department of Examination and a large number of candidates have sat for the examination. It is totally wrong to say, as the Hon. John Amaratunga did, that young people have been appointed without qualifications. A group of young trainees, there were 20 young trainees who were appointed and 19 out of them are degree holders. Now, Mr. Speaker, all career officers who can be considered for appointment as Heads of Missions have been accommodated with the exception of three people and their cases are being gone into and we will be making those appointments shortly.

Then, Mr. Speaker, the Hon. John Amaratunga said that senior people are leaving the Foreign Service and joining foreign universities. I am sorry to say, Mr. Speaker, that statement is entirely false. I wish to state categorically, Mr. Speaker, that statement is absolutely false. The true position is that there were two senior officers who asked for leave for two years. Two senior Sri Lanka Foreign Service officers, Mrs. Grace A. Asirwatham and Mrs. Aruni Wijewardana have been selected respectively as Deputy Director-General of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons at The Hague and Aruni Wijewardana wanted to accept the position of Director at the Monterey Institute of International Studies of the United States of America. They have been seconded. I went to Cabinet at their request and I got the Cabinet approval. These are important and prestigious positions. Their career prospects will be enriched and it is our duty to allow them this kind of exposure. I went to Cabinet and got the Cabinet approval to give them no-pay leave without loss of seniority for which they were particularly anxious. They told me in person that they do not want to lose their seniority and that is because they wish to come back to the service of which they are proud. So, that is an absolute falsehood, I am sorry to say, Mr. Speaker.

Then, there is one other matter I wish to refer to. The Hon. John Amaratunga has referred to our relations with India. He has said that we have distanced ourselves from our closest neighbour, India. I would like to ask, what is the policy of his Party with regard to India? The Hon. Tissa Attanayake, General Secretary of the United National Party, in a television interview used the word Adhipathya in relation to India. I know the Hon. Tissa Attanayake. He is a cautious man. I do not for one moment believe that the Hon. Tissa Attanayake would have made that statement about India without clearance by the party hierarchy.

389 390

2011 07

Is it then the position of the United National Party that they subscribe to this view, that there has been Adipathya - overlordship - over Sri Lanka by India? We know that the United National Party has expressed a completely different view to the Government of India. I think that is duplicity. They must have the courage of their conviction. If they feel that there is Adipathya on the part of India with regard to Sri Lanka, they must have the courage to say so openly, not to say one thing through the General Secretary of the Party and something completely different to the Government of India. So, that is the position with regard to India.

Mr. Speaker, in summary then, the statement by the Hon. John Amaratunga is a dismal combination of wrong interpretations, mis-statements of facts and downright falsehoods. My position as the countrys Foreign Minister, on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka is that in spite of everything that is being done by his party to reverse the progress that is being made and to tarnish Sri Lankas image abroad, the Government will persevere in its efforts to consolidate our achievements with regard to the foreign policy which are already quite considerable.

I thank you, Mr. Speaker. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am sorry some precious

393 394

2011 07

time has been taken. I have given notice of the following Adjournment Motion.

I move:

Whereas Sri Lanka from shortly after it attained Independence in 1947 has been in the crucible of ethnic violence which occurred in 1956, in 1958, in 1961, in 1977, in 1980 and in 1983, wherein the Tamil people numerically in a minority were the victims.

And Whereas the principal cause for such violence has been the consistent demand of the Tamil people for just and equal treatment as citizens of Sri Lanka and the fundamental right to live in security and dignity fulfilling their legitimate political, social, economic and cultural aspirations.

And Whereas this demand has since 1956, been consistently endorsed by the Tamil people residing preponderantly in the Northern and Eastern Provinces through their democratic verdicts, at every election to Parliament and at all the other elections at the provincial, district and local authority levels.

And Whereas it has been the dismal failure of successive governments to recognize and respect these democratic verdicts of the Tamil people and the persistent demand of the Tamil people for just and equal treatment as Sri Lankan citizens that has been the root cause for such ethnic violence to be unleashed against the Tamil people.

And Whereas the political agitation of the Tamil people for just and equal treatment as Sri Lankan citizens has from the time of Independence, until about the mid 1970s been perfectly peaceful and non-violent.

And Whereas the continuous violence unleashed against the Tamil people and the failure to politically accommodate the legitimate political and other aspirations of the Tamil people and the repeal of the Constitution under which the country attained Independence and the enactment of a new Constitution without the consensus of the Tamil people led to the demand of the right to self-determination and Tamil youth taking to an armed struggle which lasted for almost three decades.

And Whereas this armed struggle led to unbridled violence, inflecting immense harm on the civilian population in the country of all ethnicities and the assassination of both domestic and regional leaders and the legitimacy of the struggle of the Tamil people for justice and equality as Sri Lankan citizens being blurred by this spectre of unbridled violence.

And Whereas this armed struggle has been defeated and has come to an end in May, 2009.

And Whereas more than two years have elapsed since the end of the armed conflict.

And Whereas the Tamil people have expressed their willingness to live as equal citizens within the united and undivided Sri Lanka.

And Whereas several processes had been commenced to address the core issue of the conflict and evolve an acceptable political solution to the long festering conflict.

And Whereas this task yet remains to be fulfilled.

It is the objective of this Motion to invite the attention of this House, the Government and the country to the imperative need to address the core issues of the conflict and to evolve an acceptable political solution that will bring about genuine reconciliation and harmony amongst the different communities and peoples who inhabit Sri Lanka. Indeed the only way to ensure permanent peace is to evolve an acceptable political

solution that will address such genuine reconciliation and harmony amongst the different communities and peoples inhabiting Sri Lanka.

And Whereas since the letting of violence in 1956 and its continuance thereafter, a large number of Sri Lankan Tamils have fled from Sri Lanka and become migrants or sought refuge in other countries, all over the world.

And Whereas it is necessary to arrest this trend and enable the Sri Lankan Tamil people to continue to live in Sri Lanka, the country to which they belong as indeed they are legitimately entitled to.

And Whereas this is achievable only if there is an acceptable political solution that ensures their security, restores their dignity and enables them by having access to powers of governance to fulfil their legitimate political, social, economic and cultural aspirations.

And Whereas throughout the armed conflict particularly during the final years and final stages of the armed conflict very large numbers of Tamil civilians were killed or maimed, several hundreds of thousands of Tamil civilians were displaced, their houses and other assets destroyed and they were rendered destitute and, who have not been able to recommence their lives with basic facilities.

And Whereas there is no structured programme of action to address the urgent needs of this large mass of people to enable these people to rebuild their lives without having to fend for themselves which in their present position they cannot do.

And Whereas there are several actions by the State and its Agencies and others with political influence, pertaining to land, to places of religious worship, to cultural places, to development activities, and to other areas of importance to the affected Tamil people, in territories which they have historically inhabited, which have an adverse impact on them, politically, economically, socially and culturally and which unless remedied could in the long-term cause much harm to the future well-being of these people.

And Whereas it is the duty of the Government to take appropriate action to address all these issues.

It is urged that urgent steps be taken

(i) To expeditiously evolve an acceptable political solution that addresses the core causes of the conflict.

(ii) That a structured programme be implemented urgently to enable the displaced and affected people to meaningfully rebuild and recommence their lives

(iii) That immediate action be taken to reverse, rectify and redress the several actions that have adverse political, economic, social and cultural consequences to the Tamil people."

Having moved my Motion, Sir, before I commence to say a few words in support of that Motion, I want to make it abundantly clear that this Motion is not being moved by me in any spirit of confrontation. But, this conflict in this country has gone on from shortly after the country attained Independence. The conflict has been with us for more than six decades.

And during this time there have been stages when all people in this country have suffered as a result of this conflict, the Sinhalese people, the Muslim people, the Tamil people and all others who lived in this country. But, throughout this entire period of the conflict, the Tamil people have suffered and they have suffered the most. I do not think they can continue to suffer and the consequences of the conflict has been that a very large

395 396

number of Tamil people who hold this country very dear and who could have rendered much service to this country over the decades since the 1950s have left this country and became migrants abroad or sought refuge abroad. This happens to be a continuing trend which must not continue. It is not in the interest of the Tamil people and it is not in the interest of this country, but it tends to continue and therefore, Sir, it is absolutely fundamental that there must be a just and peaceful resolution of this conflict that will enable all the people in this country to live in dignity and security and be in a position to fulfil their political, social, economic and cultural aspirations.

Very many people, Sir, from different parts of the world, from the international community, from powerful countries which are close to Sri Lanka, from powerful institutions and organizations, have expressed views in regard to the nature of our political solution. But, I do not propose in the course of my speech today in this august Assembly, to refer to any one of the statements made by such persons.

I propose, Sir, to place before this House what His Excellency the President himself has stated in regard to what he considers to be the contours of a political solution and the nature of the solution that we must have because His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa is today the President of this country. He will be the President of this country for the next six years. And, for the first time since the late President J.R. Jayewardene, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa enjoys a two-thirds majority in this House. That enables him to act meaningfully in regard to the resolution of the conflict by being able to implement the required Constitutional amendments to bring about such peaceful resolution of the conflict.

Therefore, Sir, rather than quote other persons from other countries however important they may be, I propose to place my entire submission on statements which had been made by His Excellency the President and I want to urge this House and the country to follow the essence of the statements that had been made by the His Excellency the President and to work with commitment towards achievement of a political solution.

I want to appeal to all the Hon. Members in this House, irrespective of party affiliation, whether they belong to the Government or the Opposition, whether they belong to the UNP, the JVP or any other party, that the time has come in the interest of this country, even more than the Tamil people, considering all the international developments that we have seen occurring in recent times, for us to seriously address this question without any prevarication or procrastination continuously. His Excellency the President, Sir, at the Presidential Secretariat on the 11th of July 2006, addressed the All

Party Representative Committee and the Panel of Experts which is a multi-ethnic committee of experts he appointed to aid the APRC in regard to the evolution of a just and acceptable solution. His Excellency the President made a very thoughtful speech on that occasion and I am prepared to categorically state on behalf of the TNA that we are prepared to work for a solution within the contours of this policy enunciated by His Excellency the President on that occasion. To put this matter completely beyond doubt, I want to state that, Sir, on the Floor of this House.

In fact, His Excellency the President made a structured speech and he dealt with what he said under different headings. This is what he said under the caption unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty:

The unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of our country must be preserved. This cannot be open to bargain. Our approach has been widely endorsed by the international community, notably India and the co-chairs have clearly stated and have clearly ruled out any form of division of this country. Our objective must be to develop a just settlement within an undivided Sri Lanka. Each party represented here has its own solutions to the national question. We will discuss and synthesize these different approaches and develop our own Sri Lankan model. We must explore past attempts from the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact onwards. We must draw appropriate lessons from the experience of other countries. I will not impose a solution on the country. But, you will through your developments, through your deliberations provide a solution to the national question.

These were the words of His Excellency the President under the heading Unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty.

Further, the President in his speech under the heading, "Devolution for the people by the people" said: People in their own localities must take charge of their destiny and control their politico-economic environment. Central decision-making that allocates disproportionate resources has been an issue for a considerable time. In addition, it is axiomatic that devolution also needs to address issues relating to identity as well as security and socio-economic advancement without over-reliance on the Centre. In this regard, it is also important to address the question of regional minorities". These were the words of His Excellency the President in regard to the quality and the quantity of the devolution proposals that he had in mind.

Then, under the heading, "Some Concluding Thoughts," this is what His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa said: "Any solution must be seen as one that stretches to the maximum possible devolution without sacrificing the sovereignty of the country. Given the ground situation, given the background to the conflict,

397 398

it therefore behoves on particularly the majority community to be proactive in striving for peace and there must be a demonstration of a well-stretched hand of accommodation. Any solution must therefore address these expectations as well. The role of the All Party Representative Committee, as well as the Panel of Experts is to fashion creative options and satisfy the minimum expectations that I had enumerated earlier as well as provide a comprehensive approach to the resolution of the national question". In conclusion Sir, the President wished the All Party Representative Committee and the Panel of Experts well and urged that they formulate a political solution that would be in keeping with the needs of this country.

Now, Sir, this was the statement made by the the President on a very solemn occasion when he appointed the All Party Representative Committee and the Panel of Experts before they began deliberations on their tasks. As the Head of State, he addressed them and defined what in his assessment would have been the contours of any political solution.

These are not words to be taken lightly. These are words uttered by a person elected as the Executive President of this country and entrusted with the responsibility of dealing with the grave issues facing the country, including the national question.

I would next refer, Sir, to another historic speech that His Excellency the President made when he addressed this august Assembly on 19th May, 2009 after the war had come to an end. When he announced to this august Assembly that the war had come to an end, and reading his speech I get the impression - unfortunately I was not here on that day - that he spoke with a great deal of feeling for the country and for all the people who inhabited the country; in fact with a great deal of feeling for the Tamil people who, he said, had been the victims of violence for a long period of time and he also talked about a political solution. He also talked about what should be the future. I am reading, Sir, from the Hansard of 19th May, 2009 which records in full the speech made by His Excellency on that occasion in all three languages. I quote:

"Hon. Speaker, it is necessary that we give to these people.."

- the Tamil people.

"..the democratic freedom that is the right of people in all other parts of our country. Similarly, it is necessary that the political solutions they need should be brought closer to them faster than any country or government in the world would bring."

He goes on, Sir:

"Therefore, it is necessary that we find a solution that is our very own, of our own nation. It should be a solution acceptable to all sections of the people."

The President further states:

"I believe that the solution that we who respect and value the qualities of Mettha (Loving kindness), Karuna (Compassion), Muditha (Rejoicing in others joy) and Upeksha (Equanimity) based on the philosophy of Buddhism can present, can bring both relief and an example to the world. Similarly, I seek the support of all political parties for that solution.

He not merely talked about a political solution, he talked about a political solution that will be guided by the tenets of Buddhism. The people of this country being substantially Buddhists, I do not think anyone would be in disagreement with me if I say that Lord Buddha would have certainly wanted a just resolution of this conflict in such a manner that all the people who live in this country, irrespective of their ethnicity or religion, would be able to live with self-respect and dignity fulfilling their legitimate aspirations.

I consider this speech, Sir, yet another speech delivered on a very important occasion when His Excellency the President came to Parliament on the 19th of May when the war had ended. He wanted to be sure that the war had ended once and for all and finally, he talked of a political solution in keeping with the tenets of Buddhism because he knew, he realized and he accepted that only such a solution could bring an end to this conflict and enable this country to live in peace and prosperity.

The third statement I wish to place on record, Sir, is a statement made by His Excellency the President yet on a very important occasion when he met with the most-senior and powerful international civil servant on the 23rd of May, 2009. Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of UN, had come to Sri Lanka shortly after the war came to an end and he had a meeting with His Excellency the President where I am sure, they discussed the war and also discussed the future of Sri Lanka. The Joint Statement released by the Government of Sri Lanka and the UN Secretary-General states that President Rajapaksa and the Secretary-General agreed "that addressing the aspirations and grievances of all communities and working towards a lasting political solution was fundamental to ensuring long-term socio-economic development. The Secretary-General welcomed the assurance of the President of Sri Lanka contained in his statement made in Parliament on 19th May, 2009 that a national solution acceptable to all sections of people will be evolved. President Rajapaksa expressed his firm resolve to proceed with the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment as well as to begin a broader dialogue with all parties including the Tamil parties in the new circumstances to further enhance this process and bring about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka".

That is what the President wanted to do when he met the Secretary-General of the United Nations hardly 10 days after the war came to an end; not even 10 days, just four or five days. This is the statement he came up with: that he wants to enhance the political process, have

399 400

discussions with all the political parties including the Tamil parties and come up with a solution that will bring about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka.

I have not the slightest doubt, Sir, that these were the true intentions of His Excellency the President; that these continue to be his true intentions and these are the reasons why we are emboldened to engage in this process because we feel very strongly that the President of this country, having committed himself in this way, will keep his commitments and if he will keep these commitments we want to help him to fulfil those commitments. That is our position, Sir.

There was also another paragraph in this statement which I might read. That is the last paragraph in that statement. It states that "Sri Lanka reiterated its strongest commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights in keeping with the international human rights standards and Sri Lankas international obligations; the Secretary-General underlined the importance of an accountability process for addressing violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law and the Government will take measures to address those grievances". That was the ultimate paragraph of the Joint Statement made by the President of Sri Lanka and the Secretary-General of the UN when he visited Sri Lanka just a few days after the war had come to an end.

So, this is why I said, Sir, at the beginning of my speech that I will not refer to statements made by various people from the international community in regard to what should be a political solution, but that we will go by what the President himself has said. I do not want to burden this House with the number of interviews that he has given to people on different occasions. I have chosen three statements he has made: one to the All Party Representatives Committee and the Panel of Experts at their inaugural meeting when he appointed them and entrusted them with this task; one he made to this august Assembly from where you are seated, Mr. Speaker, when he addressed this House on the day on which the war came to an end - on the 19th of May, 2009; and the other one is the Joint Statement that he made a few days later, on the 23rd of May 2009, when the highest international Civil Servant, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring that the international system is preserved and the country had its due place, visited our country and talked to the President about the future of this country in relation to what happened in the past. I have placed that Joint Statement before the House.

So, that is the position. It is a position which everybody must remember. I think we have come to a stage when we cannot take extreme positions any longer. The interests of the country and the interests of the people who live in this country demand that we adopt a moderate

position and that we make every sincere effort to evolve an acceptable solution within the framework of a united country.

Having stated, Sir, His Excellencys position as contained in these three statements that I have read, I want to briefly state to this House what in my assessment is the Tamil position. On this question, as demonstrated by various events that have occurred in the past - not only in the distant past but also in the recent past - I do not want anyone to take offence at what I might have to say. I might have to place some facts with candor before the House to enable everyone to understand the position. This is not indicative of any hostility or any confrontation, but a need for us to be able to understand each other on the basis of truth.

There is, Sir, a widely held view amongst the Tamil people in this country that the war was conducted with a view to subduing, subjugating and suppressing the Tamil people. This view holds the position that while the war was conducted, to destroy the LTTE which was waging an armed struggle against the Sri Lankan State in the name of the Tamil people, at the same time yet another objective of the war was suppressing and subjugating the Tamil people and thereby negating the need for a political solution. This is a question to which an answer should be forthcoming and it can come only from the Government. The answer should be in the form of credible and tangible action that demonstrates the Governments commitment to a just and acceptable political solution. There can be no other answer to this grave question, Mr. Speaker. It cannot come in the form of words; it must come in the form of an action that demonstrates the Governments commitment to an acceptable and just political solution.

The Tamil people have complained that from after Independence they were subjected to discrimination, deprivation, inequality, injustice and exclusion and that the democratic verdicts of the Tamil people for a change in the structure of governance was not duly recognized; that governance was not with their free will and consent and that the fundamental and human rights of the Tamil people were being violated with impunity. This commenced shortly after Independence and has continued ever since the Tamil people have lived in this country for as long as any other people. They have preponderantly lived in the Northern and Eastern parts of the country, they have their own civilization, culture, customs, language and by religion are largely Hindus or Christians. They have thus lived together as a people while being willing wholeheartedly to be a part of the Sri Lankan polity, they treasure their rich Tamil identity and wish to preserve it. The Sinhala people themselves have their own rich identity and wish to preserve it.

Since Independence, the Tamil people have begun to realize that they were not treated as equal citizens. The Tamil people were driven to feel that they were second-class citizens who would not be treated as equal citizens

401 402

by the State or even given necessary protection by the State when they were victims of wanton violence by those who wanted to subjugate them. They were discriminated against in the fields of education, employment, economic opportunity and utilization of resources in the districts which they historically inhabited and denied their basic fundamental human rights such as even the right to life. They were denied equal protection under the law.

Since the 1956 Elections, the Federal Party was overwhelmingly returned in the North and the East at every General Election: in March 1960; in July 1960; in 1965 and then in 1970. The Tamil people voted overwhelmingly for the sharing of powers and governance and for regional autonomy in the North and the East. The Federal Party in its Election Manifesto in 1970, renounced a separate state and called upon the Tamil people to vote against any candidate who contested on a separatist ticket - all such candidates were defeated. But, the democratic verdicts of the Tamil people were not recognized in any effective way. The Sinhala people were able to decide on their governance; they were able to exercise their sovereignty. The Tamil people, by reason of their being numerically a minority in the whole country, were not able to have a say in their governance in keeping with their democratic wishes even in the areas in which they were a majority.

They were denied their sovereignty. They were being governed without their consent and against their will. The Tamil political leadership made every effort through peaceful and non-violent means to bring about a change in the structure of governance. The Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact of 1957; the Satyagraha - a peaceful non-violent civil disobedience campaign in 1961, by which civil administration in the North and the East was crippled for several months and in which tens of thousands of Tamil civilians; men, women, youth and children participated, the Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact of 1956; the National Government of 1965 - 1970, when we were a part of the national Government and the contribution of the Federal Party at the Constitutional proceedings of 1970 - 1972 for a reasonable accommodation of Tamil aspirations, which was denied when it was sought to replace the Constitution under which the country attained Independence and which provided certain fundamental safeguards for the minority people with the new Republican Constitution and the consequent walkout of the Federal Party from the Constituent Assembly are amongst the milestones along that path.

The enactment of the 1972 Constitution and the provisions contained therein relating particularly to the structure of governance, religion and language breached the compact under which the country was granted Independence in terms of the Soulbury Constitution. It was the enactment of the 1972 Constitution and the entrenchment of the unitary character of the State, which was not contained in the earlier Constitution, and which

was in distinct contravention of the Tamil proposition for a system of Government that incorporated arrangements for the sharing of powers of governance; the removal of the safeguards provided in the earlier Constitution for the protection of the rights of minority people; the language and religion of the majority community being accorded supremacy and the various acts of discrimination and deprivation and the violence unleashed against the Tamil people that led to the demand for a separate state; that led to the demand for self-determination and total sovereignty in 1976.

The 1977 General Election was contested by the Tamil United Liberation Front on the basis of this demand and all Tamil Members of Parliament elected from the North and the East, barring one, were from the TULF. The TULF, particularly under international advice - in fact I do not mind saying that the late Prime Minister of India Shrimathi Indira Gandhi was one of the persons who advised the late Hon. Amirthalingam very strongly not to persist on any demand for a separate state, but to seek autonomy and power-sharing arrangements because India would not be able to back a demand for a separate state, but India would support a demand for autonomy and the power-sharing arrangements and it was such advice which made the TULF willing to make a compromise on the demand for a separate state. My leader, the late Hon. Amirthalingam, who was the leader of the TULF and Leader of the Opposition in Parliament stated this fact both in Parliament and outside shortly after the inauguration of the 1977 Parliament. So, Mr. Speaker, this is the position as far as the Tamil people are concerned.

I do not think one should disregard this position because the Tamil people are once again, as during the time of Mr. S.J.V Chelvanayakam, demanding a solution within the framework of a united country, an undivided country. We are prepared to discuss this matter with the Government and come to an arrangement with the Government. I do not think this opportunity must be missed because it is an opportunity that should not missed.

As the President himself has said in one of his speeches recently, you do not have to wait very long to reap what you sow. You will have to do it in your own lifetime. I recall the President said this in the course of one of his recent speeches. So, we must not assume that everything in this country will be hunky-dory, and that we can carry on endlessly, not bothered about this grave question. I think the time has come for this grave question to be addressed. I want to say this, Sir. If the LTTE was regarded as an impediment of the Tamil side to the evolution of a political solution, the LTTE is not here any longer. It is absolutely fundamental that the forces of nationalist brinkmanship should no longer influence the political agenda on the other side. We are strongly of the view that this is a continuing phenomenon, this must be quickly arrested and contained and it is only the

403 404

Government which has the power and the authority to do so. I have not the slightest doubt that the vast majority of people in the country - Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims - are amenable to an honourable, acceptable and peaceful political solution.

Sri Lanka achieved its Independence without a shot being fired. None of the peoples in Sri Lanka opposed Independence. All peoples in Sri Lanka extended their cooperation to achieve Independence. Why did the country over a course of 60 years have to degenerate to the present position? We did not achieve Independence by militarily vanquishing our colonial rulers. We did not achieve Independence through non-violence and civil disobedience campaigns such as the Satyagraha Campaign waged under the leadership of the late Mahatma Gandhi in India. We achieved Independence because we, the peoples who inhabited Sri Lanka - though diverse and from different historical backgrounds - were united, and because the international system and international laws would no longer condone colonial rule. People under colonial rule were entitled under international law to the right to external self-determination. The United Nations was the guardian of the international system and international law under which we became entitled to receive Independence. The United Nations is the guardian of the international system, the international laws, of international conventions and practices. Such a custodian is necessary to preserve the international system and ensure compliance with international laws and international conventions and practices.

I am sorry to state that - I am not being offensive but I am stating a fact - today this country misuses the strength of its Independence to exclude a section of the people based on ethnicity from the benefits of that Independence and to reduce them to the level of inferior citizens. These are people who did not oppose Independence. They supported Independence. We call high officials of the United Nations, "terrorists". We threaten to arrest them. We vilify the Secretary-General of the UN, because the UN wants us to comply with commitments that we have made.

This is not going to help our country. I think the people who are engaged in such efforts must rethink their strategy and realize, Mr. Speaker, that this cannot go on. I will at this point, Mr. Speaker - since I do not want to take all the time given to my Party - refer to a few matters in regard to items No. (ii) and No. (iii) of my Motion. In regard to No.(ii), I will not speak at length because I think there are other Members who may be more aware of the situation in regard to housing, livelihood, occupation, food and other urgent necessities of the people who have been displaced and today are

living in very difficult conditions in some parts of the North and the East, most particularly the Vanni.

Before I conclude, Mr. Speaker, I would like to refer to some incidents that have taken place recently in my own District, Trincomalee, ever since the war came to an end, which are clearly indicative of an agenda that has been implemented by certain persons with political influence. They may be persons with political authority. I am not saying that this is being done by the President; certainly not, but these actions are happening and they continue to happen. There can be no question about it. My Colleagues will refer to other matters in other areas where such things are continuing to take place. There have been, Sir, destruction and desecration of the relics of an ancient Lord Shiva (Sivan) Temple at Agasthyar Sthapanam in the Village of Kanguvelli within the Mutur Divisional Secretarys Division in Trincomalee District. There have been trespass and forcible cultivation of paddy lands owned and cultivated by Tamil and Muslim farmers at Paddukadu, Kanguvelli in Mutur DS Division, in the Trincomalee District. There has been trespass and forcible cultivation of Kanguveli Tank bed in Mutur DS Division in Trincomalee District. I sent a letter to the President in regard to this matter on the 29th of May, 2010. To save time, Sir, - I am tabling* that letter and I earnestly request you to include that in Hansard at the end of my speech.

There has been an effort, Sir, to desecrate the Seven Hot Wells at Kanniya and the Pilliyar Temple situated in close proximity. The Seven Hot Wells in Kanniya have a history. Lord Ravana came here to Sri Lanka several centuries ago. He saw the beautiful Koneswaran Temple and he was so impressed by the Temple that he wanted to take the Siva Lingam for worship by his mother and cut the rock at a certain place. That cut can still be seen when one goes to the Koneswaran Temple. It is still called the Ravanan Vettu or the Ravanas Cut. Lord Shiva was so enraged, as history goes, that with his big toe he shifted the rock and Ravana got trapped by the rock. His mother who was in India and to whom he wanted to take Shiva Lingam thought that he had died and she herself died. Then, Ravana pleaded with Lord Shiva and asked for pardon. Lord Shiva pardoned him and released him. Ravana wanted to perform his mothers 31st day rites close to the Koneswaran Temple. He went to a place called Kanniya and dug with his spear in seven different places. There were seven springs that sprouted, each spring with a different temperature of hot water and he performed the 31st day ceremony for his mother at that site. That is the history of the Seven Hot Wells.

Tamils and Hindus, not merely from Trincomalee, from even other places come there and perform their 31st day rites for several centuries. I, from the time I was a little boy, have been there several times to perform these rites. Now, that whole place is being disturbed unfortunately by a monk from a close-by temple who wants to exploit the seven hot wells for economic purposes. The seven hot wells provide excellent opportunity for economic exploitation and he is disturbing that area. I have written to the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa, Senior Adviser to the President, in regard to that matter on the 20th of July 2009. I am tabling* a copy of that letter and I would request that that be included in Hansard at the end of my speech.

There is a proposal to allocate some land in the Kuchchaveli DS Division for tourist purposes. Fifty one blocks of land were identified earlier. Now, the plans have been changed and a new plan has been drawn. This is now being handled by the Tourist Board. All the land is to be given to the persons of the majority community. There has been no public advertisement and no one has been informed of the fact that such land was available. Privately and secretly persons are being chosen and they are going to be given the land. Each block of land is said to be eight acres in extent. One perch of land in that area is worth Rs. 100,000 and the eight acres would be worth Rs. 128 million. It will be given for almost nothing. I have written a letter to the President in regard to this matter on the 16th of May 2010. I am tabling* that letter and I would kindly request you to include that in Hansard at the end of my speech. I have no time, Sir, to deal with the contents of these letters in detail.

This is something which surprises me a great deal. There was a proposal to construct a saltern called the Raigam Saltern at Periyakarachchai in Kuchchaveli Divisional Secretarys Division. I spoke to the President personally about it. When I spoke to the President, the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa, Minister of Economic Development, was also there. They both told me that this project will not be commenced and it will never take place. But, it has taken place. The saltern has been opened. Two thousand families of Tamils and Muslims who were doing prawn farming on this Periyakarachchai land and over 500 other families who benefited from subsidiary employment related to prawn farming have been pushed out and some person from outside has come there and has started a saltern. This is extremely unfair. This is 95 per cent a Tamil-speaking AGA Division. But, contrary to the wishes of the people and totally disregarding their wishes and their economic future, this is being done. I wrote to the President again in regard to this matter, Sir, on the 29th May 2010. I am tabling* that letter. I would earnestly request that it be included in Hansard at the end of my speech.

The most recent of things, Sir, is that there is a move to hand over over 3,000 acres of land as a sacred area for the Thiriyaya Buddhist Vihara. That Vihara has been there for a long time. It has been there throughout the war and when that area was not even under the control of the army, the Vihara continued. When I go to Thiriyaya, I go to the Vihara. I go and pay my respects at that Vihara. Last time I went to the Vihara with the former Government Agent. Suddenly as a bolt from the blue - I have with me the tracing of that matter - there is a proposal to demarcate it. The exact extent that will be handed over as a sacred area in Thiriyaya would be 3,069 acres, 2 roods and 15 perches of land.

I want to bring this to the notice of the Government and tell the Government to stop this matter. I will be writing to the President shortly in this regard. Similarly, in a place called Sembimalai in Kuchchaveli DS Division, again land has been identified to be declared as a sacred area or as Pooja Bhumi to Sitthiyakiri Purana Rajamaha Vihara. I do not know why all these actions have been taken. If there are Buddhist people living there who want land, there can be no problem in regard to that and they can be given land but there are no Buddhist people living there who want land. But, steps have been taken because these steps have been promoted by certain interested parties who want to ensure that they are able to have their own way. I want to refer, Sir, before I conclude shortly, to the Sampur High Security Zone, which has still not been dismantled and a large number of families, 1,486 families, are still living in various refugee camps two years after the war. These people own a total extent of 2,795 acres of land in this area. This is their private land; land they hold on deeds and land they hold on LD or permits. So, how can they be deprived of these lands? It cannot be done. It is immoral. It is illegal but these people are being kept out and they are not being allowed to go back. I want to discuss this matter with the President shortly. I have already discussed it with him and the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa several times. In fact, I invited the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa to go with me to this area and see for himself the position and come to a decision but nothing has happened. In fact, the President, Sir, in the course of his speech delivered at the 55th Anniversary celebration of the SLFP on 4th September, 2006, declared that our armed forces have captured Sampur for the welfare and benefit of the people living there. This was what the President said: "Our armed forces have captured Sampur for the welfare and benefit of the people living there". But, people cannot go. People cannot do their farming. People cannot do their animal husbandry. People cannot do their fishing. This must change, Sir.

Then, Sir, awful things are happening. I find my good Friend, the Hon. Minister of Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities, here. Sometime recently, about 10 days ago, someone called me in the morning and wanted me to raise this in Parliament. In an ancient Tamil village called Puthukkudiyiruppu, there are 30 houses to be constructed

407 408

* . * . * Produced at end of speech.

for the people. I have no problem with regard to that. This is predominantly a Tamil area, predominantly a Tamil-speaking Divisional Secretary's Division. The foundation stone was laid recently. Twenty four houses are for the majority community, four for Muslims and two for Tamils in a majority Tamil-speaking area. Roads are being cut as they like through our paddy fields, through our residential lands from Thambalagamam to Surangal, all over from Sampur to Kuchchaveli. Roads were cut as someone pleases through our paddy fields through our residential lands. Our private lands are being taken over and no compensation is paid. Recently a road has been cut from Thambalagamam to Surangal through the rich paddy fields of the people in Thambalagamam.

Thennamarvadi, Sir, is the northern most village in my district. People have not yet been resettled. Nothing has been done to enable them to resettle. They have come from Mullaitivu. They were displaced in December, 1984; they were driven out in December, 1984. They have come back; they have returned. They want to resettle but they cannot. They cannot even go to the village. The area is overgrown with shrub jungle. There are no roads, no houses, some of their paddy lands have been encroached upon by others who are forcibly cultivating them, no electricity, no irrigation facilities and from December their rations have been stopped. How can these people settle there? How can they live there? These people lived as refugees from 1984 until 2009 in Mullaitivu. They were driven out of Tennamarawadiya. Now, they all have come back and tried to settle. They have not been able to settle. Most of them are going back to Mullaitivu and trying to do something there to eke out an existence.

These are matters, Sir, in regard to which the Government must engage with the Member of Parliament of the area, the person elected by the people. When you go there and talk to our people, you go there as their masters or as their superiors. Here we are, elected by our people. We are answerable to them. They can ask questions which we must answer. We must ensure that their interests are looked after. You go there with a couple of officials, some senior army officials, military officials and police officials and just give them a lecture and come back while people are suffering. This cannot go on, Sir. Around 500 families from this village are suffering for the last two years and in fact I do not want to go and meet them. There are 452 families comprising of 1,635 people, 800 males and 835 females who have not been looked after, nothing provided. How long can this go on, Sir? This must stop.

At a place called Echchilampattai, the army is occupying the lands of 51 families and the people cannot return to those lands. People have tried their very best to get back the lands. Why is the army occupying those lands? The army has plenty of other lands to occupy. Those are the lands which these people owned. They are

unable to occupy them now. In a place called Gopalapuram, there is a hotel which belongs to a man called S. Shivakumar. I happened to know his father well. That hotel is being run by the navy. The navy has taken over the hotel and they are running it. That man is kept out. He constructed the hotel in the hope that he can start a business and make some money. But, he is being kept out and the hotel is being run by the navy. The land that was used as a cemetery by the people of the village is also being occupied by the navy.

So, these are the problems we are having. Our people cannot go on like this. There must be an end to all these things. Under Item No. (iii) in my Adjournment Motion, we have referred to this matter and there are a whole lot of other matters that my Colleagues will talk about. If there is to be reconciliation in this country, if there is to be harmony in this country, if we are to put all our past issues behind us and look towards the future, all these things must be remedied, they must be rectified, they must be redressed. There can be no question about it. But, you are paying very little attention to these things. In fact, in regard to the Sivan Temple I talked about, I have got the pictures of that Temple here with me, the pictures of the destroyed idols. I do not want to trouble you by asking you to include this in the Hansard. But, please include my letters to the President and to the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa in the Hansard.

What is happening in some of the areas is scandalous, to say the least, it is absolutely diabolical and deliberate. These acts are being done by some persons with Government influence, with political influence. In fact, recently, the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara has sent me a letter he wrote to the President saying that the incident in Jaffna has happened as a result of some persons of the armed forces not wanting a rapprochement between the Government and the TNA. He has not tabled, he said, the letter he sent to the President. If you want rapprochement, if you want reconciliation, if you want harmony, if you want peace in this country, these questions must be addressed. Let us meet him, let us meet you. Please discuss with us. Let us go to our different districts and talk to our Government Agents or whoever. In Trincomalee, we have an army officer as the Government Agent. We have a navy officer as the Governor of the Eastern Province. We have an army officer as the Governor of the Northern Province. Where else do you have an army officer as a Governor? Why is it only in our areas? The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa is smiling. - [Interruption.] Sir, after the 1987 Indo-Lanka Accord, when they wanted to appoint a Governor for the North-East, I recommended my friend, Mr. Shelton Nadarajah as the Governor for the North-East. Mr. Amirthalingam agreed with me and we were quite willing to appoint Shelton Nadarajah as the Governor of the North-East. - [Interruption.] Keep your mouth shut. You are talking nonsense. This is the position, Mr. Speaker. I will not - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Order, please! . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I will not take your time, Sir. I must thank you for all your indulgence and I would earnestly request that my four letters be included in the Hansard at the end of my speech. I have tabled them. Some of my other Colleagues will speak after me and they will refer to the other matters. We appeal to the Government - not merely in regard to a political solution - to please work with commitment in regard to that. We will give you our cooperation. In regard to matters of immediate concern for our people, high security zones, demilitarization, housing, livelihood, all that type of things and these deliberate, diabolical actions by some people with influence, they must be stopped. If they are not stopped, we will start civil disobedience campaigns in those areas. I will lead that campaign. I will take my people there. We will defy the Government. I want to make that perfectly clear to you.

Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.

[.. 4.10]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Presiding Member, those who are listening to this Debate in this House today may think that the Tamil people of the North and the East are a privileged lot because the Government and the main Opposition party are competing with each other as to who can grant a better political solution; as to who can grant more devolution of power. But, if one were to look at the history of this country, whenever the government in power sought to settle this issue from as early as 1956, the party that was

in the Opposition at that time blocked it; up to 2000 that was resorted to. So, I am glad that today the position of the United National Party has been very clearly spelt out in this House by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella. They have consistently said this and today in this House at this Debate he has seconded this Motion and confirmed that whatever solution that is arrived at between the Government and the Tamil National Alliance as the principal Tamil political party, the UNP will support it. I hope that commitment remains. I also hope that all those words that were spoken by the Hon. Leader of the House as to how much they want to grant devolution of power, how much eager and anxious they are to settle this issue will be realized because the proof of the pudding is actually in the eating and we waited for over 60 years to eat that pudding. It is being held out time and again. It is being stated sanctimoniously that we are equal citizens of this country while in fact that does not seem to be so.

The Hon. Sampanthan laid out various examples of events that had occurred in the last two years. The only response that one gets from the Government Benches is all that you have said is not accurate. That is all. They are not able to meet any one of those because all of those are factual and I have a list of many more examples of what is happening in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces of this country and particularly what has taken place in the last two years after the war ended. The Hon. Sampanthan mentioned the desecration of religious places. Now, how can one justify this? Is anyone from the Government Benches able to say that these things have not happened? No, they cannot. If one goes to those places, if one sees those places, one may realize that all those have happened well after the war ended. The temple that he referred to, Akasthiya Sthapanam was destroyed in November, 2009. There is another example of another Hindu Temple in the same district, which he did not mention and that is close to Ilangaithurai Mugathuvaram, in a place called Kunjithapathamalai, a Balamurugan Temple and several months after the conclusion of the war that has been razed to the ground, and a Buddhist temple has now been built there. Now, this is a fact. How can the Government with a straight face tell us that you are serious about reconciliation when these things happen under your watch?

Count the number of statues of Lord Buddhas that have sprung up between Omanthai and Elephant Pass after the conclusion of the war. Not that we have opposed to religious symbols, not that we have opposed to Buddhas Statues, but how many Buddhists live there? Why have these things happened? I will table* a set of documents listing out district by district various events that have occurred in the last two years, that are all contrary to the spirit of reconciliation.

431 432

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

We are doing this with responsibility. We are placing it before this House so that the Government takes notice of this fact, so that the Government, at least after today cannot say, "Oh! we did not know that these things have happened". At least from today they are responsible to reverse these trends and as was stated, if these trends are not reversed it is impossible to have reconciliation. I do not need to say that.

After the conclusion of the war, the first time the word reconciliation was mentioned in this House by the Hon. Minister of External Affairs I think on the 5th of May, 2010, when he announced that a Commission would be appointed on the lines of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. We welcomed it. We welcomed it because he said it would be a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. So, when the Government itself took the initiative to say that reconciliation between communities was necessary, the Government was admitting that there was an estrangement between communities.

How has that estrangement taken place? One needs to look at the history to find out how this estrangement took place. The Hon. Leader of the House went on telling about what the LTTE did. What happened before the LTTE came into being? This Motion itself identifies the years when violence was let against the Tamil people. In 1956, was there an LTTE in 1956? In 1958, was there an LTTE in 1958? In 1961, was there an LTTE in 1961 when innocent, unarmed Tamil people were subjected to violence in this country? Then, what about 1977, 1980 and 1981? Even in July, 1983, Prabhakaran was in a prison in Chennai. So, one has to look at the history carefully. It is convenient to put everything on the head of the LTTE to the extent that he says, A political solution was not possible because of the LTTE. Why was it not possible before the time of the LTTE or even during the time of the LTTE? The Government itself claims that the LTTE has been decimated. Well, two years have passed since then and when you do not want to do something, you still resurrect the LTTE. When this Debate is taking place and the need for a political solution is being debated, immediately the LTTE is being brought into equation when you yourself say that the LTTE is no more. When you do not have the political will to grant a political solution, even the dead LTTE is resurrected two years thereafter. That is the sad story of this country. That is the sad story and the perspective of the Government in power. We have very clearly stated that we are willing to work with the Government in finding an acceptable political solution, a political solution that will be acceptable to all communities. I am glad that the Hon. Leader of the House conceded that the talks the Government is having with the TNA had not proceeded very well. But, we have not left the process, you must appreciate that, because we hold the view that through negotiations and through discussions a solution must be

found and we will stay in that process until there is a glimmer of hope. But, if there is no hope at all, if that process is being used to achieve some other ends, if there is any other process started to divert attention from other things that are happening, then we will not be a part of that. We will only be a party to any genuine effort and reconciliation.

Today we have stated very clearly in this House that we are willing to go along that path. All that we are asking from the Government is to have a genuine commitment to join hands with us and find a political solution. In doing that, the things that are happening on the ground are of utmost importance. There are nameboards that are being changed from Tamil to Sinhala. That is not done in the spirit of reconciliation. In the document that I have tabled and requested to be added after my speech, there is an example of changing names of two streets as Mahinda Rajapaksa Mawatha in Kilinochchi, and Aluth Mawatha in Kilinochchi. Now, why are these things happening? The Hon. Prime Minister is smiling. Is that in the spirit of reconciliation that you change those nameboards and write them only in Sinhala in predominantly Tamil areas? My Colleague, the Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan mentioned the other day what happened to a village in the Vavuniya District. A village name has been changed. Kokkachchaankulam is a Tamil village in the Vavuniya District and today it is being renamed as Kalabwasewa and 165 Sinhala families have been taken and settled there. Now, is that in the spirit of reconciliation? If you are serious about reconciliation, all of these incidents that I am tabling in this House not only must be stopped but also be reversed.

The Hon. Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs is here. Therefore, I will raise another issue as well. Hon. Minister, you will recall that several months ago, the issue of the recruitment of SLAS officials was raised by the Hon. Suresh Premachandran and you gave an answer in this House and said that that is true, that Tamils have not been recruited but there will be a separate recruitment for them. So far that has not happened. But, 145 more have been recruited -

... ( ) ( ... - , ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne - Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs) Hon. Member, now there is a gazette notification inviting applications.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) What I am saying is, so far that has not happened and 145 more have been recruited.

433 434

[ .. ]

2011 07

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) That examination will be held exclusively in the Tamil medium. It has already been gazetted.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) When? Because after you gave us that undertaking, 145 more were recruited and those are all of the majority community.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) They are the people who passed the examination.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is right.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) They are the people who passed the examination. None of the Tamil medium candidates have passed the examination. That is why we decided to have a separate examination for the Tamil medium candidates.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is very strange. That is very strange that none of the Tamil medium candidates have passed the examination. When 445 Sinhala medium candidates passed the examination, none of the Tamil medium candidates have passed! Is that not very strange? Anyhow, 145 of these Sinhala medium officials have been taken to Jaffna and they are now being trained to take over matters there. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) You are totally distorting things. They were not taken only for Jaffna. They were taken for all-island; that is for the whole country.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am not distorting. I know that recruitment is for all-island. So, what is this long delay?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Very unfortunately, not a single Tamil candidate has passed the examination. We realized the defect there. Therefore, in order to correct the situation, we called for fresh applications and the examination will be held by next month.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am only bringing this to your notice since you gave an undertaking in this House several months ago -[Interruption.] Well, it has still not materialized. Today, you say that applications have been called. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne)

. . rose.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will take your word; I will take your word. - [Interruption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Hon, Member, you should be a little more responsible when you make such utterances. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) So far, they have not been recruited. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Now, what we have done is, we have called for applications by a gazette notification and an examination will be held subsequently. Likewise, these steps have to be taken. Otherwise we cannot recruit people overnight. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) All right. So, I will take your word today again and we hope that that will be remedied.

But, what is happening on the ground with regard to military taking over lands? I have given a whole list of several thousands of acres that have been taken over by the military - the navy. I have given the names of places too and people have been prohibited from going and resettling in those places in the Districts of Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Vavuniya, Batticaloa, Trincomalee and Ampara. Furthermore, in several villages in the District of Ampara, Tamil families have not been allowed to resettle. There are persons who come in expensive vehicles belonging to the majority community, who stand on those lands and prevent those people from coming back to those places. All of that has been documented and it is being tabled so that the Government can take remedial action.

435 436

Now, this Local Government election is an important milestone. The commitment of the Government, that is so easily forthcoming in words today in this House that democracy has been restored and all of that, is to be tested at this election. We have already had a situation where the army barged into a meeting where five Members of this House were present and broke up the meeting, assaulting several persons. The matter was raised by our Party Leader and the Hon. Prime Minister on that day gave an assurance to this House that investigations are on and the assailants would be apprehended. Today is the completion of two weeks of that incident but not a single person has been apprehended. So, is that your commitment to democracy?

The identity of the persons are known because no less a person than the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence has stated this in "The Island" newspaper. Defence Secretary Rajapaksa has said that he had personally investigated the incident immediately after hearing of it. He says that a group of soldiers under the command of an officer visited the community hall where the TNA was having a public meeting. Of course there has been an argument between the army and a section of the gathering including MPs and some Ministerial Security personnel and the argument led to one of the MSD personnel being slapped.

Now, that is his version. I am not on his version. I am on the point that he knows that it was the army that went. He knows that it was led by an officer. While that is the case, the police have filed information in the magistrates court saying "unidentified persons broke in at the meeting." Unidentified persons in army uniforms broke in at the meeting. Is it not astounding that you have 30 - 50 persons in army uniforms, carrying T56 on their shoulders, with poles in their hands, speaking in Sinhala and walking around Jaffna and who are not part of the army? These are the unidentified persons.

This is easily a test of what you are saying. Match your words with your deeds. That is all we are saying. For 60 years you have competed with the United National Party in wanting to devolve power to the Tamils. You are so anxious to do it. This reminds me of an incident. When I appeared before a senior judge he told me that both sides were saying, I will mark this document, the other side said, No, I will mark this document, the judge told us whenever both sides threaten to mark a document, invariably it is never marked. So, that is the history of this country. Both the main political parties are competing, they are so anxious, they want to grant a political settlement. What we gave is far greater than what you gave and so on and so forth. You have fun. You have your own debate while we remain in the same place without power in the status of second-class citizens, because we have no voice. Even Members of Parliament who are assaulted by military officers in broad daylight cannot have justice. The Hon. Prime Minister gave an

undertaking to this House two weeks ago but to-date no one has been arrested. So, this again is a reminder to the Government. On a day when you say we will do this; we will redress all these inequities; we will wipe away all this injustice; we will treat you as equal citizens. All these are very good words, solemn assurances. One is yet to see it in practice.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is also up.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am tabling this document that I referred to in my speech, titled "The situation in the North and East of the country" that deals with every district, that runs into 38 pages, to be added at the end of my speech in the Hansard.

Thank you very much.

The Hon. Sampanthan stated that the Tamil community has been treated as a minority race and neglected since 1956. Though it was stated that the Tamils have not been given their fundamental human rights, they were appointed as Government Ministers, Chief Justice, Secretaries of Ministries, Lecturers and Professors in Universities and maintained their political, economical and cultural rights. Further Government aids have also been given to them. As Sri Lankan citizens, legal, economical, educational and health privileges have been provided to the Tamil community as given to all the other communities. A small fraction is involved in severe crimes to achieve their goals. Even before the humanitarian rescue operation, Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims were living comfortably with foreign employment. The Tamils affected by terrorism have also gone abroad. Now, as Sri Lanka has come back to normalcy and peace is maintained, hundreds of Tamil people are returning to their motherland. Approximately 300,000 people who have been affected were provided with houses, electricity, water, schools, agricultural equipment and funds are being allocated to renovate their religious centres, and to commence small industrial activities. There is a small number who are eligible for such assistance.

The hardcore terrorists have been rehabilitated and even provided with Public Sector employment. The Tamil community who have been living in Sri Lanka for a long time is living in all parts of Sri Lanka not only in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. A greater number of Tamil people are living in other parts of the Island than in the North and the East. The total population of Sri Lankan Tamils in the Northern Province is 957,247. This is from the census of 2001. In Jaffna, the population is 790,385. In Mannar, the Sri Lankan Tamil population is 54,474. In Vavuniya, it is 54,179. In Mullaitivu, it is 58,209. The total population of Sri Lankan Tamils in the Eastern Province is 389,289. In Batticaloa, it is 233,713. In Trincomalee it is 77,826. In Ampara, it is 87,760. Therefore, the total Tamil population in the North and the East is 1,346,546. In other areas of Sri Lanka, the population of Sri Lankan Tamils is 540,318. The Indian Tamil population in Sri Lanka is 818,656. Therefore, in other areas, apart from the North and the East, the total Sri Lankan and Indian Tamil population is 1,358,974. Therefore, apart from the North and the East, there are 12,428 Tamils living in other areas of Sri Lanka.

Due to terrorist activities in the past, a large number of Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim people were killed. people A large number of Sinhala people have disappeared; a large number have been widowed.

A major part of the Government funds, foreign funds, housing, roads, schools and other facilities are provided to the Tamils and Muslims living in the North and the East than to the other areas of the country. They are being gradually made to live a comfortable life.

According to the present activities, the Tamils will become a prosperous community in the near future. If the Tamil politicians act in a more humanitarian manner, beyond their political power, all the five communities in Sri Lanka will become a developed nation in the world. Without conceding to personal interests, let us consider the plight of all communities; discuss issues and endeavour to arrive at political solutions.

It is observed that some other countries in the world have betrayed the Tamil community to reach their expectations to divide the country into two. They are attempting to divide Sri Lanka, especially to break India into portions and to convert its states into independent states. The great scholar Krishna Menon has once stated that the Harbour of Trincomalee has to be protected to maintain the unitary status of India.

We must think as to why the late Mr. Rajiv Gandhi and the Indian Government opposed the attempt of late President J.R. Jayewardene to handover the oil tanks at Trincomalee to America. Sri Lanka should totally commit to secure India to maintain its present unitary status. That is our protection too. Let us cordially, friendly and honestly discuss this matter considering the general public.

We must not forget that in the middle part of the 20th century when the world was equally balanced in power, Patrice Lumumba was killed along with many other leaders in the Asian countries. A very powerful and large country, Russia, which was belonging to Europe and Asia, was divided into parts and separated. No one is exactly aware as to how it happened. According to the current trend of the world, I believe that we should keep abreast of the movements of India and China.

Although Sri Lanka ended the 30-year conflict through humanitarian operations, the view of the developed countries was that the LTTE organization could never be defeated. Therefore, they try to insult us by forwarding false information such as the Darusman Report, Channel 4 telecast, foreign Parliamentary discussions and so on.

During this short period the economic growth rate of Sri Lanka has increased to 8 per cent. It is clear that various strategies are being used to break it down.

Therefore, we question whether it is proper for the educated and intelligent people to break the economic and social development of the country by false and foolish ideas such as the story of arsenic in fertilizer, the oil crisis, the attack on the Katunayake Police, attack on the politicians in Jaffna, crisis of university lecturers, protest to elders' pension scheme and unavailability of freedom of expression.

There were invasions in Sri Lanka not only after 1956 but also before that. The kingship in Sri Lanka ended with an Indian king.

In 104 AD, Pulasti captured one part of the country. In 205 AD Panayamara, Piliyarama, Datiya, Peetiya and Elara captured power by assassinating each other. In 436 AD, Thirithara and Dathiya reigned Sri Lanka. In 479 AD Prince Mugalan brought an army from India and fought. In 661 AD, Prince Mona chased the Tamil people away from Sri Lanka.

Pottakutta, the commander of King Agrabodhi who reigned in 1673 AD was a Tamil citizen. He built Buddhist Pirivenas and religious centres. Accordingly, it is understood that Tamil people were chased away on some occasions and on other occasions worked with them in a friendly manner.

The situation existed throughout the world in history. Greek, Roman, French, English, Portuguese and Spanish kings captured Asia and Africa by force. King Parakramabahu the Great, captured some parts of India and Burma and made Sri Lanka an empire.

I am delighted to say that His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, a politician with a noble sense of humanity, has understood the economic, social, racial and

439 440

religious problems of the people and acts according to the "Mahinda Chintana" programme to solve them.

Today political conversations are in progress. I very respectfully request you to cooperate in settling the Tamil problem reasonably and satisfactorily.

[. . 6.12] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Deputy Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity soon after the Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees. Actually, I wanted to speak about something else first but since the Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees just spoke here and said that everything is being attended to in the North and the East, I would like to quote from a document called Joint Humanitarian and Early Recovery Update. According to this document presently the people in the North and the East who have just been dumped back in their villages are suffering immensely. The poverty figures are very reflective of the kind of life that they are living there today. According to

469 470

[ ]

2011 07

this document, poverty is in the region of 65 per cent among the returnees and 15 per cent of them are even below half the poverty line. That means, there is an income required to just go above the poverty line. As much as 15 per cent of the people are living - .... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is your point of Order? .... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) I would like to know whether the Hon. Member can tell us what that report he is referring to is, and who has published that document? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I will table* it.

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) No, Hon. Deputy Speaker, he is quoting some figures from a report. So, we must know what he is referring to.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I will give you that. It is the report of the OCHA. .... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) What does OCHA stand for? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You do not know that? .... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) We do not know. So, tell us. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) That is, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) You see, this is the problem. Somebody may have given this report which nobody knows about. You come here and give this information in Parliament, which is totally misleading. - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) These are all authentic documents and the United Nations is part of the process of collecting these information. - [Interruption.] Sixty five per cent of the people who have returned to their homes are living below the poverty line and 15 per cent of them are even below half the poverty line. - [Interruption.] .... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) Sir, he says that more than 15 per cent of the people are below the poverty line. That is completely wrong. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) If you have the figures, please come out with those figures to counter my argument. - [Interruption.] Please do not disturb me.- [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, are you tabling that document?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes, Sir.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) So, if there is anything contrary to the Standing Orders, those portions will be expunged.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, these figures are figures I believe in, and I am submitting this document in this House. I am not telling untruths. I stand by these documents. So, there is nothing to be expunged. I am not saying anything controversial; I am only quoting figures. So, I do not think there is any reason to expunge anything, Sir. [Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) Those are devils quotes! - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Come on! Do not become the devils advocate here, please.- [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you continue with your speech. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, it is an internationally accepted thing that if people are living, spending more than 65 per cent of their income for food, they are in desperate poverty. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please. The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

, [ ] .

, , [ ] . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Then, there is a table in the same document which I tabled for inclusion in the Hansard, which states that in the Jaffna District - 24 per cent of the people; in the Kilinochchi District - 27 per cent; in Mullaitivu - 38 per cent; in Mannar District - 21 per cent; in Vavuniya District - 31 per cent; in Trincomalee District - 33 per cent; in Batticaloa District - 28 per cent of the people and in Ampara District, about which the Hon. P. Piyasena spoke so much, 40 per cent of the people are in desperate poverty.

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) It is absolutely wrong! You are talking nonsense.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You can bring the correct figures and counter me. Do not just disturb. - [Interruption.] What is the reason for this? - [Interruption.] These people have been just dumped. - [Interruption.] I am talking about the returnees. -[Interruption.] Those who have returned to their homes after the war. - [Interruption.] What is the reason? There is a - [Interruption.]

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

Many families have not been able to re-establish their livelihoods.- [Interruption.] They are unable to interact with the market. They have remained in the areas of extreme vulnerability where they have been unable to restart their livelihoods.- [Interruption.] Fishermen are often the worst-affected partly due to the high cost of providing startup assistance. They do not have boats or traditional crafts to engage in their fishing activities. Even if you take people who are engaged in agriculture, they have no facilities or funds to invest in storage, in marketing or even in growing their crops.- [Interruption.] So, with lack of livelihood opportunities they have to live under poverty. - [Interruption.]

473 474

2011 07

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) It is wrong. Do not mislead the House.-[Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You have been speaking about housing. You claimed that you have resettled almost everyone. To what extent have you resettled people? If you take the Vavuniya District, you have provided 1,203 houses for returnees, which is only 12 per cent. - [Interruption.] The gap is 9,038 which is 88 per cent of the requirement. In the Mullaitivu District, you have provided 4,625 houses for them, which is 20 per cent of the requirement and the balance is 19,261 which comprises 80 per cent, which is the gap. In the Kilinochchi District, again, the total number of houses provided is 10,360 - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! A point of Order is being raised by the Hon. Azwer. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I think he is quoting from a devils report. This is all wrong. Sir, He cannot mislead the House because all the figures are wrong. We are doing a lot of work.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, that is not a point of Order.- [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You are disturbing everybody. - [Interruption.] Sir, he should at least listen to you and not disturb the House.-[Interruption.] In the Kilinochchi District, 10,360 houses have been provided which is only 28 per cent of the requirement. The gap is 27,306 which is 72 per cent. Further, if you take the Mannar District, 5,457 houses have been built out of the total requirement of 14,922, which is only 27 per cent and the gap is 73 per cent. So, even after two years after the war, with all these things that you are saying -

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) Have you visited the North? You have never gone to North.

( )

( - ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran - Deputy Minister of Resettlement) You do not know the situation there. - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I do not have to go to the North. - [Interruption.] Do you talk about Nuwara Eliya only after going to Nuwara Eliya? - [Interruption.] We are in a world of knowledge. - [Interruption.] Statistics are not given by going and counting one by one.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Statistics are given by people by studying. There are people who are there to collect information and they put forward the statistics. It is up to you to decide - [Interruption.] I am sure the Minister in charge of this subject knows exactly what is happening.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Yogarajan, you have only two more minutes.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Today, all the Tamil-speaking MPs are getting so agitated because they are being given a task to defend this Government as the TNA is bringing out the real status of the people who have been affected by the war. So, they are feeling shy and they have to protect it because those who are in the Government have to protect their posts as Deputy Ministers and somebody who is aspiring to be a Deputy Minister some day is also shouting so much. Sir, I actually wanted to say something else today, but with all these disturbances I have been unable to speak on the main matter that I wanted to talk about.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) What happened to the money that was given to you to build the houses for the estate workers?

475 476

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I am not in charge of building houses.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . . ? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You go and see. Those are built there - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Where?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Wherever it has to be built.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Yogarajan, you may wind up now.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, Sir. You give me two minutes because he disturbed me.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I am sorry that there are other Members who have to speak.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Give me the two minutes that you took away from me. - [Interruption.] Hope you build. One day if you build, we will be glad. We are not going to be - [Interruption.] - India offered you 50,000 houses. Have you facilitated the building of those 50,000 houses? They have still not started off.

There was an Opinion Poll in the Daily Mirroron the current Indian interest in Sri Lanka and the answers given in that are: "(a) is an interference that must not be tolerated, (b) is a positive intervention that will prove helpful." What do the people say? They say (a). Seventy five per cent of people have said that it is an interference that must not be tolerated. But, however, I am sure this Government will accept that the role played by India in our issues is fair and reasonable. I will read from two articles which appeared in the Daily Mirror of yesterday, 06th July, 2011. [Interruption.]

It states, I quote:

The Indian government cannot remain insensitive to the sentiments expressed by the Tamil Nadu government, about the Tamil Nadu people

and political issues affecting the Tamil-speaking people in Sri Lanka...

This was stated by the Indian Foreign Secretary, Mrs. Nirupama Rao.

I further quote:

That is something you have to understand. It will always be there and I think you cannot dismiss those concerns. As far as the Indian government is concerned, Tamil Nadu is an integral part of India. We cannot be insensitive to what the Tamil Nadu people say. I am being frank and honest on this and we are in touch with the Tamil Nadu government to tell it about what we are doing in Sri Lanka, and about the discussions with the Sri Lankan government, about helping the war-affected people. How best to help them rebuild their lives and rehabilitate them. About the development assistance and the infrastructure work that is being done.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. R. Yogarajan please wind up. Your time is over. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Please give me one more minute. Then, she states, India hopes talks with TNA would succeed. What is their stand on the issue? Why do they speak for the issues of Sri Lanka?

It further states, I quote:

India is a friend and a partner of Sri Lanka and as such will like Sri Lanka to take the necessary steps to bring about lasting peace to the once war-torn country and thus enable the minorities to resume their normal lives and attain their full potential by contributing to the countrys development. There is a dialogue between Tamil political parties and the Sri Lankan Government ...

They wish that this would succeed and these are the sentiments expressed by the Indian Foreign Secretary. It shows that India is interested in Sri Lanka because the Tamil people here need to have a fair and reasonable political settlement. Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. You have 10 minutes.

[. . 6.28] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today, we were fortunate in witnessing a grand sight. The Hon. R. Sampanthan, as senior and matured as he is, as the years

477 478

2011 07

roll by, has waved the white flag which is a welcome sign of the change of attitude and mind of, I may take, the Tamil-speaking people of this country. Sir, I know the Hon. R. Sampanthan from his father's time, the late respected Hon. N.R. Rajavarothiam. He is one person who came to this House from the Federal Party after the avalanche in 1956. We wish him well because he was not in the pink of health in the recent past and he was hospitalized in India. I used to convey our sympathies to your party Members at that time. Today, Sir, you played a historic role, I should say, because this game of divide and rule, this game of destruction, this game of misleading the people, this game of murdering, killing and destruction cannot be allowed to go on forever.

As I said, you today stood up like a sentinel, like a man of wisdom in this House. History would record that the role you played in Parliament today would pave the way for complete redemption and well-being of the Tamil and Muslim communities in this country. Sir, it must be borne in mind that the Tamil people alone cannot co-operate with the Government; the co-operation and understanding of the Muslim community as well who are living as majority in the Digamadulla District also must be there. Sir, in fact, the Hon. R. Sampanthan gathering all the experience in the past, dirty experience and disruptive experience, has told us that there is a new avenue open and if you walk along that path, there is salvation for the entire country, for the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burghers, Malayalees, Malays, upcountry Tamils and even the Keralites. That is the message we want. That is the message we would like you to give to your other lieutenants; to your followers.

The note struck by the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran is sour after taking the glass of milk from you. He has not understood you well. This is the problem with your party today. Come and join hands with us. I know the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah from the time he staged the Sathyagraha in this country. I was with my good friend, Senator S.E.Z. Mashoor Moulana who is the Mayor of Kalmunai today. Sir, there should be a change of mind. Hon. R. Sampanthan, you have seen the good and the bad; the good and the evil; the angel and the devil in this country. You are capable of dividing and seeing well who the devil is and who the angel is. I tell you, the devils are around you and you struck a very good encouraging note today in Parliament. I look at you today, after your speech, as if the Messiah has come to the Tamil People. My memory goes back to the time of Thanthai S.J.V. Chelvanayakam, the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam, the Hon. Rasamanickckam, the Hon. V.N. Navaratnam, the Hon. M. Sivasithamparam and the Hon. (Dr.) E.M.V. Naganathan. The part you played today, I believe, is genuine and sincere but if we can break all the obstacles that would come in your way from the inner circle of your party, I tell you, you will stand one day as one of the most respected heroes of this country. What is required for us is peace.

Look at how our President is developing the North. You must appreciate that. I am really surprised about the Hon. R. Yogarajan. I think he has never seen the soil of Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu. He must have gone there long ago with the Hon. Savumiamoorthy Thondaman when he went for the Vaddukoddai Conference. I do not know whether you were taken with him. At that time, there was so much of regard for you. But, what was he talking? He was talking nonsense and misleading the House. Do not do that. The Hon. R. Sampanthans children and the future generations must live in this country happily, peacefully, without bloodshed and we too, the Muslims. What has happened to you? You are not normal. You are abnormal, I will tell you. You want disruption in this country. You want the economy to be destroyed. No, we will not allow you. Even if a hundred thousand Yogaranjans emerge from the earth, we will not allow that as long as His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa rules this country. See what our Minister of Economic Development, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa is doing. Can you not see? Come with me, I will show you.

I think he gave 5,000 tractors the other day. He builds houses, hospitals and constructs roads. Not only that, the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa builds swimming pools there and encourages sports. What a lot of things are happening? It has never happened in history. Hon. Sampanthan, you will vouch that the Sinhalese leaders have gone to the North in order to develop that area to the highest level. We have problems in the South. The Muslims are asking, What are you doing for us? Everything is diverted there. This is a problem. - [Interruption.] The Sangupiddy Bridge .

? . -

[Interruption.] Mr. G.G Ponnambalam dreamt about it in 1947 when he was the Minister of Industries in the first Cabinet of the Right Honourable D.S. Senanayake. You would realize that wisdom has dawned in you only today. We wish you well and pray for you.

Sir, a tragedy has struck today. Mr. Karthikesu Sivathambi was one of the colourful figures of the North. He came from Jaffna to Zahira College in Colombo. He became a great philosopher, a writer, an author and a builder of bridges of peace in this country. He is no more today. Therefore, Sir, today in this House, with your permission, I take the opportunity to convey our condolences on the death of one of the great men of this country. He was a literate and an intellectual of the highest calibre. He educated himself in Zahira College together with the late Mr. A.M.A. Azees who was also from the North. He created the Tamil Mandram for the first time and who helped him? Mr. Sivaprakasam, Mr. Sivathambi, Mr. R. Sivagurunathan, the late editor; Mr. Balasingham and a host of others; Muslims came from Galhinna - Mr. S.M. Haniffa, Mr. S.M. Kamaldeen and all those intelligent people from the South.

What is happening today? The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa struck the correct note.

Sampanthan, you will agree, like the good old days of the Sinhalese Kingdom,- , 500 . . . " " 28.06.2011 " - " . . What does he say? "In the North, they have killed the leaders. Now, there is a calculated move by the Government to kill the leaders of the South. Shame! Do you believe this? I am asking the Tamil Members although you are not from the majority community, is it not a shame? You are not of that type. Hon. Sampanthan, you have proved yourself a hero; you have proved yourself a real patriot. You want to live in this country and make your people happy. Can you do that with people like the Hon. Yogarajan who is here to betray the nation. ? " , . " , .

According to all norms of international law, he must be banished from Parliament. He cannot live in this country. . , , . . .... , , . [ ] , - [ ] . , Hon. Yogarajan. , , . . . .

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I will finish in half a minute, Sir. Dominic Jeeva is one of the celebrated writers of the Northern Province. He edited the Mallikai for the last 40 years. There had been a birth anniversary celebration of 85 years. He was driven away. The Tigers did not allow him to publish his most important monthly magazine which is hailed in India too. He came to Colombo Kathiresan Veedhi and he has been printing Mallikai for the last 44 years uninterruptedly. We wished him well for his 85th birth anniversary that was celebrated recently in Tamil Sangam. There are villas in Colombo and Wellawatte.

. . Everyday, we have Tamil festivals in Colombo. I will tell you that Colombo is a centre of the development of Tamil and Muslim culture and civilization which you will not find in Tamil Nadu or anywhere else. Thank you very much, Sir, for your patience.
