. Romila Thapar is Emerita Professor of Ancient Indian History in Jawaharlal Nehru University. . I quote:

865 866

"He was one those rare historians for whom history was what E.H. Carr described as a dialogue between the past and the present. His mind scanned the world around him and sought connections and contexts, as is characteristic of the best of historians.

But his curiosity did not stop at explaining the past. He was sensitive to the present and more so to its inequities and concerned about where our kinds of societies were heading."

:

Leslies magisterial work was on what Max Weber has called monastic landlordism. In Robe and Plough, Leslie extended the meaning of the term by relating it to the socio-economic context that was its crucible.

This he did by creatively using Marxist methods of analysis, without in any way reducing the argument to a mechanical causation. It became an intensive study of the political relationship of the Sangha and royal

authority as well as the economic base of the authority of monastic establishments. , .

. , . , . [2.54 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Speaker, the late Member of Parliament, the Hon. (Prof.) Leslie Goonewardene whose Vote of Condolence this House is called upon to pass today, is a great scholar of very high calibre and one of the few Sri Lankan historians well-known to the outside world. To the Sinhala readers, he was better known as Ranaweera Goonewardene through his many writings of which Anuradhapura Yugaya- History of the Anuradhapura Period, co-edited with Prof. Amaradasa Liyanagamage, is the most well known. His brilliance as a lecturer was shown when he was asked to lecture in Sinhala on modern India. Even though he had specialized in ancient Indian and Sri Lankan history, he lectured with distinction on the subject with an interesting marxist tinge which was well liked by the students. He was a scholar who had a unique and sharp mind to dissect and interpret the ancient history of Sri Lanka in an interesting and stimulating manner.

In addition to Sinhala and English, he had a solid grasp of Pali and Sanskrit languages and a working knowledge in Latin, Greek and French. He was an authority on the ancient history of Sri Lanka. He even went to the extent of challenging some of the views of Prof. Senarath Paranavithana at that time, the leading archaeologist cum historian on ancient Sri Lanka in the 20th century. The Hon. Leslie Goonewardene rose through the ranks from being an assistant lecturer in History at the University of Peradeniya to become Professor of History, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and finally its Vice-Chancellor. Nonetheless, he brought a new perspective to look at the history of ethnicity in Sri Lanka and forwarded his argument based on a critical study and interpretation of original sources in a well- researched and professional manner, thereby earning the respect even of his critics.

He wrote and lectured extensively on varied subjects in both Sinhala and English. In addition to his expertise on the history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, he was interested and researched on Sri Lankas ancient science and technology. His contribution to the study of historiography in Sri Lanka is also noteworthy. He contributed and edited Ithihasaye Athithaya - A History

of Historiography, the only work published so far in Sinhala on that subject. Even after his retirement and until he became ill about more than a year ago, he was actively engaged in research and publication. His last publication was on periodization in Sri Lankan history. In addition to enriching the academic life in Sri Lanka, he travelled extensively, held leading positions in international academic organizations and participated in many international seminars and conferences around the world.

The Hon. Leslie Goonewardene did not confine himself to academic life alone. He was sincerely interested in the well-being of the people of Sri Lanka and became involved in progressive politics as well. He joined the Communist Party of Sri Lanka during his undergraduate days at the University of Peradeniya in the late 1950s and became active in its politics. He was deeply concerned about the Sri Lankas ethnic problem and promoted ethnic harmony through his talks and writings. As a result, he was appointed as the Minister of Science and Technology and later as adviser to the President. During his short tenure as Minister, he took a keen interest in taking modern technology to the villages. He should be given credit for promoting the idea of transferring technology to micro and medium-scale industries in the rural sector which was later developed into - as the the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana just said - the Vidatha programme of the Ministry of Science and Technology.

The Hon. Leslie Goonewardene was always ready to help anyone interested in serious academic work and to his credit he has nurtured a group of serious and dedicated academics at the University of Peradeniya, who would carry the torch of knowledge that he passed on to them for the future. He was keenly interested about China and encouraged others to pursue research and publish the history of China and its relations with Sri Lanka.

Incidentally, Sir, I should recall here that yesterday the Sri Lanka-China Parliamentary Friendship Association was formed under your distinguished Chairmanship with the largest number of Members of Parliament participating. We convey our warmest felicitation to Her Excellency Yang Xiuping, Ambassador for the People's Republic of China for her gracious presence.

Undoubtedly, Sir, the Hon. Leslie Goonewardene was one of those rare breed of distinguished intellectuals Sri Lanka had ever produced. He will be greatly missed by his friends and colleagues in particular and the academic community in general.

Sir, I am also deeply grateful to Mr. Mahinda Werake for this source of information. I would pay my condolences to his beloved wife, Mrs. Viranjani Goonewardene and son, Dr. Asela Goonewardene.

Devoid of any political bias, the late Professor, Minister and the Member of Parliament, always fought for a united, prosperous and cultured Sri Lanka. As far as his valued lifestyle is concerned, I have no doubt that if he had lived today, he would join hands with His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa to take this country forward.

Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by both sides of the House on the death of the Hon. Dhanapala Weerasekera, ex-Member of Parliament.

I may also be permitted to add my personal references. I came to know the Hon. Dhanapala Weerasekera quite well when we were undertaking social service work at Ruanwella, Karawanella, Dehiowita, Talduwa, Ampe and Kannatota areas together with our good Friend, the former Minister of State for Transport, the Hon. U.L.M. Farook, at that time. The Hon. Weerasekera added colour to the Thunkorale together with persons of the calibre of Edmund Samarakkody, Soma Wickramanayake, H.G. Somabandu, and our present Minister, the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne. He was an enlightened leader, I should say. He, as an orchid culturist, had established very close contacts with one of the most distinguished leaders of this country, Sir Razik Fareed, the Leader of the All-Ceylon Moors' Association, who was also known as the "King of Orchids."

I shall now direct the Secretary-General of Parliament to make a Minute of the Proceedings of today and send a copy thereof to the members of the bereaved family.

Now, we will take up the Vote of Condolence on the late Hon. Augustheenu Fonseka. Before that, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale to the Chair?

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Felix Perera - Minister of Social Services) I propose that the Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

... , . , ... , () . Whereupon THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER left the Chair and THE HON. (MRS.) THALATHA ATUKORALE took the Chair.

I came into contact with him when I was introduced to him by the late M.I.B. Hafi, Provincial Councillor, when I was in charge of the Puttalam Electorate together with the leaders of that district like the Hon. Festus Perera, the Hon. (Mrs.) Larine Perera, the Hon. S.D.R. Jayaratne and the present Minister the Hon. Milroy Fernando. We interacted with each other on several subjects in giving assistance to the people of that area. When he shifted his political alignment, I came to know him very well, and joined him and travelled to several parts of the country addressing meetings. His well-oriented oratory captured the hearts of the audience and people thronged in large numbers to listen to him. He inspired the people whenever and wherever he delivered those fiery speeches.
