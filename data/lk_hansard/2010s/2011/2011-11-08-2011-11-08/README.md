( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Hon. Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the Minister of External Affairs I answer Question No. 5.

(a) (i) The Ministry of External Affairs does not have a specific vote or financial provisions to undertake image-building activities abroad. However, on requests made by individual missions, the Ministry allocates funds on a case by case basis on their merits and justifications for image-building purposes. Funds for such promotional events have been allocated out of the annual budgetary provisions given to the Ministry. Besides such allocations, the Ministry encourages specialized Sri Lankan agencies such as the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau - SLTPB -, Export Development Board - EDB -, Sri Lanka Tea Board - SLTB - , Board of Investment - BOI -, National Gem and Jewellery Authority, business chambers and the corporate sector to assist missions abroad in the form of funding, expertise and material with regard to promoting Sri Lankas image and commercial interests abroad.

(ii) The total budgetary provisions allocated in the manner outlined in (a) (i) by the Ministry of External Affairs to the Sri Lanka Missions abroad for image-building activities carried out in their respective countries of accreditation for the period 1st January to 15th October, 2011 is Rs. 9,701,720.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) Is there no procedure followed when you call for tenders?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) We have not called for tenders. ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) You can find anyone and give it? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) When our Missions and institutions abroad ask funds for advertising, we allocate it on a case by case basis.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) You spend Rs. 9 million out of peoples money and there is no procedure at all.

Gold Trading Operations at Central Bank of Sri Lanka

As per the current Reserves Management Guideline of Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), it is allowed to maintain 3 to 20 percentages of the Foreign Reserves in gold. As in other foreign reserves assets CBSL is actively engaged in gold trading to make profits depending on the world market prices. Selection of authorized institutions (counterparty) to trade in gold is done based on the financial soundness, past track records and credit ratings of those institutions to see whether counterparties are in a position to perform their financial obligations. The criteria to select counterparties, has been set out in the counterparty selection guideline, which is a Foreign Reserves Management Committee and Monetary Board approved document.

Central Bank is involved in gold transactions since late 1970s and commenced trading activities in gold in early 1990s. Gold is traded in the international markets, similar to other currencies such as Euro, Sterling Pound transactions. Therefore, dealings staff assigned for gold

trading, buy and sell gold depending on market prices with strict adherence to the Reserves Management Guidelines.

Confiscated Gold

Over the years, CBSL purchased confiscated gold from Sri Lanka Customs after having it analyzed by the Government Analyst. All such confiscated gold (mostly in the form of jewelry, coins, bars, etc.) as well as items such as bars and coins that were remaining from the retail sale outlets after their closure were sent for refining in three batches as given in the table below. Each batch was refined into London Good Delivery bars of 0.999 fineness (i.e. investment gold), and was added to the CBSLs investment gold as stated below. After the deregulation of gold imports in 1999, Sri Lanka Customs does not sell confiscated gold to the Central Bank.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, you mentioned in the morning that it was not appropriate for me to have taken up a point of Order on a legal interpretation that was there. But, now

846 847

2011 08

that it has been tabled in Parliament, the Hon. Prime Minister has deemed fit to change the name of the intended Bill as well. Now, there is a person who is affected - Mr. Nihal Sri Ameresekere has gone to the High Court and filed a case. The case number is: 52/2011/CO. He has been one of the persons who took Hilton Hotel to court. At this particular moment, Hon Deputy Speaker, I am tabling* that document, where a seven-judge bench gave a judgment in October, 2002 saying that there cannot be any changes on a certain legal provision that was there.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, now you have a three-judge bench that is giving a judgment on a matter that has already been referred to by a seven-judge bench. That judgement is being referred to this Parliament. One of the judges then was Mrs. Shirani Bandaranayake, who is now the Hon. Chief Justice, who has given the interpretation which you read out now.

The Hilton Hotel case is in court at the moment and that is sub judice. How is that it is coming in? This particular revived Bill that is coming in says that protracted litigation is one of the reasons for this underprivileged companies or underutilized companies, and that can be debated. So, are you bringing in laws with retrospective effect? Now, there is a case of the Hilton Hotel, Colombo, - Case No. 52/2011/CO - where Mr. Nihal Sri Ameresekere had gone to court. So, I earnestly request you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, to ensure that this will be set aside until such time that the court gives an interpretation on this. Earlier a seven-judge bench had given a ruling on this.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Hon. Deputy Speaker, all these facts and circumstances have been duly taken into account when this Bill came up for argument in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has considered all relevant facts and circumstances and given its Determination. We are bound only by the Determination of the Supreme Court at the moment. Therefore, there is no legal validity or any argument which can be pursued on the basis of an impending case somewhere else. Even if there is a Stay Order or any other thing, as Parliament we are not bound by them because we are supreme in our legislative activities. The supremacy of the Parliament has been upheld in several decisions made in Parliament. Therefore, there is no basis for the argument of my Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. So, it must be dismissed.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Members, I have listened to both of you. This is only at the introductory stage today and the matter will be debated tomorrow. The Hon. Speaker will make a decision accordingly tomorrow when the matter is taken up for debate. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I appreciate that. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) ; 1. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I am still on that point of Order. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I have given a ruling. So, you may take it up tomorrow when this matter is debated. - [Interruption.] That has no relevance right now.

Rs. 79 billion. 7,900. . , " " . 2002 - He is one of the most articulate persons on public litigation. He,on behalf of the people of Sri Lanka, went to court and wanted a wind-up order given on the Hilton saga. But, the seven-judge bench ordered that there should be no involvement because the Constitution protects certain rights that are -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over.

888 889

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Please give me just two more minutes. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Then, one of your Members will lose two minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Just give me only two minutes, Sir. So, the order that was given stymied him, prevented him from proceeding further. But, once an order was given by a three-judge bench saying that this can be taken over, that it can be expropriated back again, then what happened was, he went to court today - Application No. 52/2011/CO - hoping that the High Court utilizes its jurisdiction and gives approval for him to go forward to protect this. Now, the reason why Hilton is being taken back is owing to the fact that there is mismanagement. The Government has had control over its management for 17 years, from 2nd October, 1994. Now if there is mismanagement, then it is the Government that has been in power that has been mismanaging. ( ) (The Presiding Member) You must be generous towards me also. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Presiding Member, I am also keeping a tab on the time. I am just on the verge of 36 minutes.You gave me 38 minutes and therefore I am just two minutes away from your mark. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, I am monitoring the time. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I know you are using a different tool to control me. ( ) (The Presiding Member) No, not at all. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Anyway, I will ensure that I sit down in two minutes. Now, out of Rs.10 billion repayments, 56 per cent was paid by the HDL Company. There are foreign

shareholders - there is a Swiss national; there is a Singaporean. You have an investment guarantee, you have a BOI guarantee and furthermore you have an arbitration. So, imagine if they invoke the arbitration clause, automatically Hilton will be subject to international scrutiny. Then how is the Government going to protect itself? While we are talking very positively, you want to take over Sevanagala, you want to take over Pelwatta, you want to take over Hilton. We oppose the entire Bill in principle and we want to ensure that the economy of the country keeps going without any problem. So, all what we want is a healthy economy where unemployment is reduced virtually to zero level and we want investments pouring into the country because when the Government messes up the economy, it is we in the Opposition, who have got to take on the economy. So, we want to work together. Finally, please ensure that you have a safer, sounder and more proactive economy that is left for tomorrow rather than screw it up today. I thank you, Sir. [. . 4.57]
