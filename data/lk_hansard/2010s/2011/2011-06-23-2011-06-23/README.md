... ( ) ( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Urban Affairs) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it is with deep sorrow that I rise to speak a few words on my dear Friend, the late Hon. D.P. Wickremasinghe whose fragrance of friendship has not faded away. He was basically an ideal Sri Lankan who was a dynamic personality. Although he represented largely the Sinhala voters, he stood tall enough to cut a place for him among the Muslims and Tamils and he rendered his services to all of them alike. His prime concern was the welfare of the common masses. His demise at the crucial hour to the development of the country is an irreparable loss to the whole country.

Known as Wayamba Jana Puthraya, the late Hon. D.P. Wickremasinghe, a one-time English teacher was truly a great son of Sri Lanka and was a silent worker in the political arena. He bravely stood up to the test of time. He gradually rose to the position as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, later as the Cabinet Minister for Cooperative Development and played a key role in politics.

His constant objective was to see a united Sri Lanka of all its citizens. He was a gentleman in politics and an ardent supporter and an advocate of human rights and democratic values. He had the opportunity of associating with prominent leaders of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party like the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and the late Hon. D.A. Rajapaksa, father of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa and was greatly influenced by their politics. He proved himself as a popular leader. He was particularly very friendly with the Muslims who appreciate with gratitude his kindness in establishing a village for the landless Muslims in Kurunegala and settling them there.

I join the Hon. Members of this House in conveying my deepest condolence to the members of his family.

Thank you.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I want to say a few words on this occasion to pay tribute to a great leader who sat in this House, served the people and who has left for us a son to serve continuously. In 1994, when I entered Parliament, Trinity College held a felicitation ceremony. At that ceremony

1927 1928

the late Hon. D.P. Wickremasinghe was also present. He was felicitated for being an MP and a Deputy Minister then. On that occasion, the other Ministers were the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, the Hon. Anuruddha Ratwatte, the Hon. Lakshman Jayakody and people of that calibre. We had nine MPs from Trinity College in that Parliament. In this 2010 Parliament, when Members were elected there was another felicitation ceremony. There were 12 Members of Parliament who were related to Trinity College and the Hon. Neranjan Wickremasinghe was one of them. I was there with him. As an old Trinitian, I cherish the relationship we had with the Hon. D.P. Wickremasinghe as well as the Hon. Neranjan Wickremasinghe.

At the time the late Hon. Savumyamoorthy Thondaman was my leader, when there was an issue of some estate workers having been attacked in Mawathagama, my leader asked me to visit Mawathagama, speak to the people and reconcile their minds. The Hon. D.P. Wickremasinghe was so cooperative that he sent his son, a Provincial Council Member then, to talk to the people and to reconcile the issues that had come up. After that, they have looked after those people so well that there was never such an incident. Today, the endorsement by the people of the long service of late Hon. D.P. Wickremasinghe has been that he was always elected to Parliament on a continuous basis since 1970 and he died a Minister. Today, the people of Kurunegala have sent his son, the Hon. Neranjan Wickremasinghe to this Parliament to continue his services, not only to the people of Wayamba but also to the whole country. So, this family which has done so much of service and obtained the endorsement of the people is a tribute to this great man. I also wish to pay high tribute to this great man. Thank you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by both sides of Parliament on the death of the Hon. D.P. Wickremasinghe. I should also add a few words. I had a long and binding friendship with the late Hon. D.P. Wickremasinghe when I was in charge of the Puttalam electorate. He was the Chairman of the COPE and under his Chairmanship we were able to visit South Asian countries to study about the working of the COPE. He had a very warm and cordial relationship with the Muslims; I should briefly say. I went directly to his residence carrying the MPs pass when I initiated this under the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs and when I met him at home to hand it over he was highly moved. I shall now direct the Secretary-General of Parliament to make a minute of the proceedings of the meeting today and send a copy thereof to the members of the bereaved family.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Presiding Member, I am very happy that you afforded me this opportunity to add a few words on the late Hon. Harry Abeydeera who had been a very close associate of mine. I still remember that when we were together at that time, we had many visits to his areas, especially to Tangalle, Beliatta and the surrounding areas. I should say that he was a very pleasing personality. Together with the Hon. Siri Andrahennady who was at that time the Deputy Chairman of Committees, we addressed youth leagues, womens conferences and other organizations in his district. He did not confine his political and social activities only to the area in which he was born - the Hambantota district. He travelled along with us to many parts of the island. We met on several occasions when we were campaigning at elections.

I can remember once there were some natural disasters and when our volunteer teams went from Colombo and the rest of the Island, Harry Abeydeera was quick to realize the sufferings of those victims, collected foodstuffs, particularly coconuts from that area, and distributed them to the flood victims and to those affected by other natural disasters. Harry Abeydeera was very young when we met him in this House. He quickly adapted to the changing pattern of the social and political scenario of this country. I must say that he played a distinguished role in and outside this House in espousing the cause, to which he was committed to. We had a very close relationship - very friendly, very cordial and very warm - with him.

I must also add that he was a close friend of the Muslims of Tangalle, Beliatta and in other places; the Fair Member, the Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa, who is seated here would vouch for that fact. He had served the community well. The late Harry Abeydeera contributed his full measure of service to this country. He came from the deep South. He was a great patriot, a true son of this soil. Sometimes, I think that if people of the calibre of the Harry Abeydeera were living today, they would have readily clasped the hands of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, for they would very well understand the path he is chartering out for the welfare of the people and the unity of the country. They built the United National Party to have patriotic citizens in this country, to love thy motherland, and follow other virtues, but, unfortunately, Harry Abeydeera could not carry those progressive ideals through that party.

1939 1940

Yesterday, Sir, we were at China Fort, Beruwala, at the funeral of Alhaj M.S.M. Faleel, the former Chairman of Beruwala UC, and a member of the UC, Ratnapura, a well-known gem merchant and I should mention here with gratitude that His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa too visited the bereaved family in China Fort yesterday. He even visited his Colombo residence hours before Haji Faleel passed away. The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, a Member representing the Kalutara district and other distinguished Ministers and a massive crowd was present and it was one of the best attended funerals that we saw in recent time. On his way to Colombo those days, my good Friend, the late Harry Abeydeera took off time to visit our good friend Alhaj M.S.M. Faleel. He discussed very many matters concerning the Muslim community with him at that time. He was ready to extend his hand of friendship and help to Mr. Faleel in order to alleviate the sufferings of the masses of that area. He was also helpful in the development of Beruwala and other areas because he had to pass Beruwala to come to Colombo and go back to his village passing Beruwala again. So, that was the central point for all to gather. Even His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa used to visit Faleel Hajiar at China Fort frequently. Whenever he comes those days - in the earlier stages of his political career - he used to stop at that place to have a friendly chat with Faleel Hajiar and his family. That was a halt - a junction - for a brief rest. Faleel Hajiar cultivated friendship among people, and of all religions. So, Sir, in this hour of grief, I would like to remind Abey's father, the late Mr. Abeydeera too, who was a well-known social worker whom we knew.

Finally, we convey our condolences to Mrs. Neela Samarawickrama Abeydeera, his children, the family members and to the constituents who loyally elected him to this House.

Thank you very much. [. . 4.26] ( )

[. . 5.25] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Presiding Member, today we pay tribute in this House to a person who had served this legislature and the country well and also the movement that he belonged to very loyally and dedicatedly.

I met the late Hon. Meryl Fernando for the first time when we were carrying the Sama Samaja Flag with its key symbol all along the Maharagama area. We too were Sama Samaja admirers during our school days. There is a cousin of mine, whose name is Dr. M. Haris Z. Deen. He got his doctorate in Quantity Surveying in the United States and he is now domiciled in London. The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana and the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne know him well. Even in London he keeps contact with the Sama Samaja Leaders here.

I still picture the late Hon. Meryl Fernando: a bespectacled, lean and tall figure. He always had a smiling face. He, at all times, stood upright and held his head high because he believed firmly in the principle that he followed. As was said by the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana, he belonged to the second line of leaders of the Bolshevik and the Samasamajist Movement in this country. We used to visit Pembroke Academy and Alexandra College. My cousin, Dr. M. Haris Z. Deen and I used to frequent those places and listen to those interesting political lectures. I remember the time whe there was very much a sway and attraction towards the Samasamajist Movement in the student circle and the universities.

Dr. Ruskin Fernando - if my memory is right - defeated the late Comrade Meryl Fernando in 1965. At that time Mr. Somaweera Chandrasiri was also a Samasamajist member representing the Moratuwa Electorate. The present generation would not, perhaps, remember that even the late Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyananda Dahanayake initially won the constituency of Galle as a candidate of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. He entered Parliament as an MP of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party.

When travelling all along the southern route at that time, we could meet several leaders of the Sama Samaja Party and the Bolshevik Wing like Dr. N.M. Perera and Dr. Colvin R. de Silva. Also we come across, Dr. Osmund Jayaratne, a well-konwn professor of the University then, Dr. H.A. De S. Gunasekera, a renowned economist. Right along the coastal belt we bumped into several notable Sama Samaja stalwarts. If you had met Meryl Fernando, the Chairman of the Moratuwa Urban Council, you would have been greeted by T. Rudra of Wellawatte, the former Mayor of Colombo. There were Sydney Wanasinghe at Wellawatte, D.F. Devapura at Bambalapitiya and D.S. Mallimarachchi at Kollupitiya. Then, there were also very charismatic political figures of the calibre of Leslie Goonewardena, his wife Vivienne Goonawardena, Anil

1955 1956

Moonesinghe, Jack (JCT) Kotalawala, Mangala Moonesinghe, Cholmondelely Gunawardene, Senator D.G. William, Doric de Souza, Bala Tampoe, Bernard Soysa, Soma Wickramanayake, Dharmapala Weerasekara and a host of others who made the legislature colourful then. They are indeed great names.

Comrade Meryl was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Meryl was deeply committed to serve the cause of the downtrodden masses as we described them with pride. He espoused the cause of the working class. He was in the Wages Board fighting for increase of wages for the workers. He was in the Rent Control Board safeguarding and protecting the rights of the rent-payers.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! .

, , [ ] . Whereupon THE HON. ERIC PRASANNA WEERAWARDHANA left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. CHANDIMA WEERAKKODY] took the Chair.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) ... , . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am very glad that you ascended the "throne" at this moment when we are talking about a student of Prince of Wales College. Although he studied at Prince of Wales sounding imperialism, Meryl was a prince of the children of farmers. . He moved with the poor; he worked for the poor. He became a UC Member winning the Koralawella Ward in the Municipal Council with the votes of the poor. In fact, the tree of samasamajism was firmly rooted in the soil of Moratuwa by the late Meryl Fernando. He was a great teacher. I should emphasize, he was an exemplary teacher.

I still remember the day the first "hartal" in Sri Lanka was staged, when the price of rice was raised, by a Motion moved in the Cabinet at that time by J.R. Jayewardene. Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel, our Muslim League

leader who was at that time in Dudley's Cabinet told that he opposed the move. But, still they raised the price of rice from 25 to 70 cents and there was this massive demonstration as never before seen in this country. It was called "hartal". People came to know for the first time what "hartal" was and about and martial law. Sir, my father was working at the Port Commission at that time under P.J.H. Hernu, a European. He is M.I.A. Hameed, but the people of Maharagama and Nawinna area called him Hameedu Bass. We were small students at that time. We were not allowed to go out. I remember the late Comrade Meryl Fernando bringing a host of people not only from Moratuwa, but also from areas like Balapitiya and Kosgoda. They were fighters. People ran away when they saw such sandos.

My father had a Raleigh bicycle and he was coming from the Port Commission to Nawinna where we were staying. Trees were cut down on the road and women folk was making "roti" on the high-level tar road. They warned "Hameedu Bass" not to proceed further because people were cutting down trees. He was too brave to heed that warning, and was cycling and cycling fast. A branch of a "mara" tree fell on his bicycle, a whole bundle of treacle tied to the cycle broke open instantly, and there was . . . , , , . -- . , , -

, Heroes of Boralugoda- .

They also took that lineage in order to protect the rights of the people and defeat the Cabinet proposal at that time. There were ideological differences unfortunately. The late Hon. Meryl Fernando broke away with Edmund Samarakkody and I believe Bala Tampoe and several others formed the VLSSP. I once attended the Mahila Samithiya meeting near the Bo-tree in Fort. Now, that building is no more and Edmund and Meryl waxing eloquent said, "All the members here will be in our Cabinet when we come to power", including my humble self. How overjoyed I was! Because there were only 19 Members. If they came to power I would have been a Cabinet Minister long ago, Hon. Deputy Speaker.

He was a media man, a good journalist. He always wrote truth. He did not vacillate. He did not concoct stories. Keeping with these Marxist, Bolshevik and Samasamajist ideas of the fourth estate, he contributed immensely to magazines like "Revolutionary History" in England.

He was a simple and humble man. I remember the days that he visited Maharagama as I told you earlier, Hon. Deputy Speaker, to meet Mr. D.L. Pathirage, the

1957 1958

[ ... ]

2011 23

former Chairman of the Dehiwela-Mount Lavinia VC and later the Maharagama TC. They visited all our relatives and even my uncle, the late A.L.J. Deen - who is popularly known as "Deen Bass" - was also very helpful when these people visited Azhar Place in Maharagama. They welcomed and treated them well in the traditional Islamic style and they used to go away happily. He was a simple person as some Member said here earlier. Once he was standing in a queue in a hospital. He did not want to jump the gun or break the queue. When people beckoned him to come forward, obtain the medicine and go, he did not do that because he felt that he was a man of the people. He was among the sick. So, he wanted other sick men to take frontline in the queue.

He helped sometimes to break jail and he fought against British imperialism, colonialism and capitalism. That was the time they never gave up their principles. They never compromised their principles with politics. He held steadfast until the last for the Samasamaja Movement and the ideology that he believed.

Another facet of the late Hon. Meryl Fernando, I should recall, is that he was a great cricket enthusiast. He did not live to see me making commentaries on cricket. But, he was a cricketer at Prince of Wales College. When we were travelling in the Fiat car of our uncle, I used to see Meryl getting off from the tram car and walking that whole distance of Siebel Avenue up to the Oval Ground to see the West Indies playing against Sri Lanka; England playing against Sri Lanka and those great and very interesting whistle-stop cricket matches that we had with Australia. He used to carry in a basket his midday food. He did not queue up at the tuck-shop to buy whatever he wanted. He simply walked the streets and he walked straight.

I am very happy, Sir, that members of his distinguished family are in the Gallery today to listen to the elegies delivered in memory of the late Hon. Meryl Fernando. I pray that his soul be sanctified.

Thank you.
