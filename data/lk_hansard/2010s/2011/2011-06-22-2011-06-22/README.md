(b) If so, will he state-

() . 5000 . , 2007 . ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, you had mentioned at a press conference that one of the parents had agreed to get the "blood money" and hence a pardon would be given to the girl. What about the second parent that was involved in this issue?

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) According to the Islamic Shariah Law, we have to get the consent from both the parents and then, of course, they will stipulate an amount as blood money. So, we are trying by various means to get the consent from both the parents. It is a very sensitive issue on both sides. So, we want to use all unofficial methods and be very cordial towards them and try to get their consent.

1663 1664

2011 22

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Second Supplementary Question that I would like to pose is that until you assumed office, this particular issue was approached somewhat in a lackadaisical manner. So, what measures can be taken to invigorate the Ministry of External Affairs as well as the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Saudi Arabia in order to ensure such things will not happen in the future?

We are lucky that you have been able to intervene and take this forward. If no such action taken, this girl's death would have occurred.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Well, Hon. Member, the reply to that question is, according to the law of that country, which is known as Shariah Law, even the King cannot give pardon. The official pardon can be given with the consent of the parents and after the stipulation of the "blood money." But, after His Excellency the President made a request, that country has been good enough to suspend the execution of the punishment temporarily. But, that does not mean that it is a total pardon. So, we must deal with the situation in a manner that will not harm the cordial relationship between the two countries. At the moment we can go on at least with the suspension of the execution until we get the consent of the parents because the law says very clearly that she can only be pardoned with the consent of the parents and after the stipulation of the "blood money".

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I want to ask the next question. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My third Supplementary Question: the foreign people were held negligent in a similar way with regard to the case of one Mr. Sunil Shanthas daughter in Colombo North who jumped off a particular building and died. But, no action has been taken by the Sri Lankan Embassy there and the Foreign Employment Bureau. Why? ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Hon. Member, had it happened in Jordan? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, Hon. Minister, it had happened in Kuwait.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, that is not relevant. ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) I cannot remember that incident. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It happened three weeks ago and the person who died was from Colombo North. ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Right, now I remember. That girl jumped off the building and of course, the parents thought that it was more than a suicide and suspected foul play. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, foul play. ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) I have appointed a special committee and sent a special officer also there to get me a report on that matter. I am awaiting that report at the moment.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you. :

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) ? How can you say no bank went bankrupt? Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, if you remember, your former Prime Minister, the late Hon. D.B. Wijetunga got up and made a statement before Parliament and said the Peoples Bank has gone bankrupt and the Opposition protested and he had to withdraw it. We had to intervene in order to prevent bank depositors withdrawing money over that statement. . , , . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) .

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) ? .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) -

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) We recapitalized the two State banks because there were problems, and it was only at that time the then Prime Minister, the late Hon. D.B. Wijetunga as the Minister of Finance said, Because the banks have no money, we have to recapitalize. So, there was no question of money being withdrawn because money was being pumped in to prevent the money being withdrawn. No bank collapsed to my knowledge during the UNP times. I think only one small non-commercial bank had a problem during the year 2000. But, I must say that I have not heard of any bank having difficulties; finance companies have had, but not banks.

Ravi Karunanayake) My point of Order is this: at the Party Leaders Meeting it was agreed that Questions should be answered. So, when a Question is postponed for the third time, I am compelled to ask you to intervene and get an answer for it. For every Question that is asked in this Parliament, Rs. 63,800 is being spent. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You can raise it at the Party Leaders' Meeting. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Well, we did it. We cannot be raising it at every moment at the Party Leaders Meeting.

QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE ASSAULT AT TAMIL NATIONAL ALLIANCE PARTY MEETING IN JAFFNA . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker for giving me this opportunity to raise a question relating to a matter of public importance in regard to an incident which happened on Thursday, the 16th of June, 2011 at Allaveddi in the Jaffna District. Sir, my Statement is as follows:

On Thursday, the 16th of June, 2011, the Tamil National Alliance had a meeting with our party activists and candidates to the Valigamam North Pradeshiya Sabha, to have a discussion about the forthcoming Local Government Elections, at a hall in Allaveddi in the Tellippallai police area. The police and the army had visited the place earlier in the day and made inquiries about the meeting. The meeting commenced at about 6.30 p.m. with about 30 party members. The Members of Parliament of the Tamil National Alliance, the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah, the Hon. Suresh Premachandran, the Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy, the Hon. E. Saravanapavan, the Hon. S. Shritharan and the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran attended the meeting. The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy left the meeting early.

At about 7.30 p.m., while the meeting was in progress, some army personnel entered the hall and gave orders to stop the meeting. The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran walked up to an officer who seemed to be in the rank of a Major and spoke to him and he was told that the meeting could not proceed since the TNA had not got police permission. While he was explaining that this was an internal party meeting that did not require any police permission and that in any case that was the matter between the police and us and not the military, several soldiers in full uniform, carrying automatic weapons and long poles in their hands, rushed into the hall and started assaulting the people. About 30 of them were led by an

1703 1704

[ ]

2011 22

officer who wore a T-shirt and army fatigue trousers and boots. He went up to the Hon. E. Saravanapavan and pulled out the microphone and raised his pole to assault him. The Hon. E. Saravanapavans security personnel intervened and they were dealt a few blows. The other MSD personnel formed a ring around the other Members of Parliament and identified themselves as police personnel. They were assaulted with the poles. The person who led the attack, pointed a finger at the Hon. Premachandran, and threatened and abused him. Many other candidates and party workers also were beaten and chased out of the hall. When the Parliamentarians were leaving, at the entrance again the soldiers came up and assaulted the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajahs security personnel. People were being assaulted outside the hall at that time also.

The Hon. Senathirajah telephoned Jaffna Security Forces Commander, Major General Mahinda Hathurusinghe and reported the matter to him.

He called back and found that the MPs were at the Tellipalai Police Station and sent Major General Walgama and other army officers. Major General Walgama expressed his regret and offered his apology. He also requested the MPs not to make a complaint to the police. But, the MPs told him that they will have to necessarily lodge a complaint and proceeded to make statements to the police. The MSD personnel who were injured also made statements and received treatment at the hospital. We understand that the police have reported facts to court the next day but have said that the said assault was carried out by unidentified persons in army uniform.

Major General Hathurusinghe initially issued a statement saying that this was a minor incident involving the army and the MSD personnel. But, later when he met the MPs on Saturday, he claimed that he had been misquoted by the press and assured them that the TNA can engage in the campaign work and that he would ensure that such incidents do not recur. He had assured the MPs that if this was done by the army, he would take stern disciplinary action.

We have quite clearly stated that this was in fact the army and no one else. No one in his right mind will accept that 30 to 50 men can walk around in Jaffna wearing army uniforms, armed with automatic weapons and speaking in Sinhala, without it actually being the army. However, on Monday 20th June, the Defence Secretary himself has stated in the "Island" newspaper that it was in fact the army that stopped the said meeting from proceeding. If that is the case, why have the miscreants not been arrested so far? The Defence Secretarys statement shows clearly that the miscreants can be identified.

This is a very serious attack on democracy, a flagrant violation of human rights and the freedom to engage in legitimate and democratic political activity in Jaffna. It confirms again that the military is attempting to rule Jaffna totally disregarding the rule of law. We call for urgent and immediate action to arrest the culprits whose identity is known to the authorities and that disciplinary and criminal proceedings be instituted. It is also clear that this assault was premeditated and was carried out by the army itself openly in uniform with impunity. The motive is also clearly political and intended to intimidate the voting public, the candidates, the Members of Parliament and prevent a free and fair election.

We call upon the Government to act immediately and apprehend the offenders. On our part, we wish to reiterate that we are committed to working with the Government on matters of urgent concern of our people and also to find an acceptable and long-lasting political solution within a united country.

We call upon all right-thinking people to denounce this act of violence by the army against democratic political activity and also to support us in a bid for a just and acceptable political solution to the national question.

Before I conclude, Sir, I wish to quote from what Lord Gautama Buddha, the noblest Son of Asia, has said in regard to violence and conquest. But, before I do that, may I urge this House to come to the following conclusions from the statement I have read.

The first is, the loudspeaker permit needs to be obtained from the police when a loudspeaker is used. No loudspeaker was used in this instance and there was no need for any permission to be obtained from the police or anyone else. Moreover, this was an indoor meeting attended only by party candidates and a few party activists and was not open to the public. The second is, five Parliamentarians were prevented by this violence from holding a meeting in their own electoral district. The third is, the military is able to act in this manner with impunity because a state of Emergency prevails in the country paralysing the normal laws under which the rule of law should be upheld.

We ask that the state of Emergency be repealed forthwith and we state that no free and fair election upholding impartially and independently democratic values can be held under a state of Emergency.

I would now like to read what Lord Gautama Buddha has stated, Sir. He stated, "The only conquest that brings peace and happiness is self conquest. One may conquer millions in battle but he who conquers himself only one, is the greatest of conquerors". This is what Lord Gautama

1705 1706

Buddha, the noblest Son of Asia had to say. This is something which I think all people in this country, big or small should accept, remember and adhere to.

Thank you. Sir.

No member shall impute improper motives to any other member

Now, Sir, the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara was imputing motives to me when he started his speech. It is contrary to Standing Orders. If he does not know the Standing Orders, let him take homework from me. I will teach him. Whatever he has spoken against the Standing Orders must be expunged. If he wants, he can bring in a substantive Motion. He cannot make remarks on another Member. Therefore, whatever said against the Standing Orders by the speaker who preceded me must be expunged. Otherwise, we cannot conduct the Business of the House. According to the Standing Orders, I have raised a matter of Privilege.

: It states, I quote:

According to the information provided, Foreigners were conspicuous among the former Prime Ministers advisors. A Mr. John Earl who was brought down by Ranil Wickremesinghe for publicity work during the 1999 Presidential Election and later named as consultant to the unit set up to develop a master plan for Strategic Communication and paid 239,280 US dollars per year. Accordingly his monthly pay was 19,940 US dollars or Rs. 2,053,820. It is also a well guarded but popular secret that whatever his designation John Earls main function appeared to be that of selecting the former Prime Ministers clothing, and providing him with speech training and strategies to create dissension in opposition ranks. A reflection of The Prime Ministers insecurities perhaps! A certain Mr. A.G. Cuthbertson who was appointed as an advisor for strengthening Government capacity was paid 227,625 US dollars per year which amounted to Rs. 1,953,781 monthly.

1809 1810

SALE OF LAND BELONGING TO ARMY HEADQUARTERS

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for making me available to move the Adjournment Motion.

The UPFA Government which has been promising no privatization not selling land to overseas parties without charging 100% taxes (from non-Sri Lankans) has been pursuing a policy to the contrary. They have been selling land which belonged to the Army Headquarters to Shangri-La and Catic (a Hong Kong Company). We have been informed that the receipts of the sales proceeds had not been disclosed as to where it has been posted. Therefore, we call upon the Minister to advise as to whether there has been a change of policy as to where the money has been credited 11.7 Billion taxes have been paid, if not how much have been paid as taxes and how many acres of land what has been the sales proceeds of this sale to these two institutions.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You have already taken 14 minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Would you stop me at 20 minutes so that the other 10 minutes could be used by the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) All right.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Sir.

So, all what we want to do is to fortify, strengthen and develop the economy. This is not an economy left only for the UPFA.We are the ones who brought independence to this country. We are the ones who have prime moved and brought development to this country. We are the ones who know how to integrate Sri Lanka with the world. That is what you are shredding and tearing apart. You basically bring in nationalism because that is the only thing you could use to cover all your sins. You think that spirit of nationalism will ride you through all the sins and the problems that have been created. So, I guess it is time for a wake-up call. You cannot live in the dead past all the time. You must ensure that you create a new course of activities that will be able to put Sri Lanka in the world map. You talk of investments, the tourist world, but you made such a fuss on a small question that was asked. We asked as to why on earth the Government is silent still on Channel 4. Two years ago the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe said he will take them to court. Why have you not done that? If you are frightened, please tell us and we will go on your behalf. That is the only way you can bring investments into the country; that is the only way you can bring stability to this country; that is the only way you can clear the bad name that has been created by any treacherous person, whoever he maybe. We can only support you. When you have a problem anytime, the easiest way is to put the blame on the UNP. But, we have been able to charter a course to help you. We, as the Opposition, have been most responsible in helping you. That is why you have Karuna Amman as a Deputy Minister. Who was he earlier? He was second to Prabhakaran. Today he is a Deputy Minister. How? Because you had a Peace Accord signed those days. He himself says that he saw a different world from the day that the Peace Accord was signed. But, you never give us that credit. What did Mr. Barack Obama say when Bin Laden was killed? He first called Mr. George Bush and said, "What you have started, I have concluded". That is how credit was given. What did Mr.Tony Blair do when the Good Friday Accord was signed? All what he did

1815 1816

[ ]

2011 22

was, he called his predecessor, John Major and said, "You and I have together charted a new course. This is what the United Kingdom wants and today we are signing the Good Friday Accord for the good of the United Kingdom". But, what is happening here? Everything is revolving around one person: |"I am the president; I am the person; I am the only one". All the debit is given to the UNP and all the credit is given to the Government. This is the insincerity that is there. Then, you want us to come and save the country. We do not care. We will protect the country because it is not only your country but also the country of all of us.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have already taken 20 minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you very much, Sir.

The revenue has increased from Rs. 240 billion to Rs. 284 billion for the first four months when we compare 2010 with 2011. That is an 18.4 per cent increase in taxes. These taxes have come from the common man. For a mobile phone call, if you spend Rs. 100, I think the Government takes something close to Rs. 20 or 25. If you buy some dhal, some milk powder or petrol, you pay a significant amount of taxes. So, the issue is very relevant. If the Government is taking taxes from the general public of this country, we would like to know whether these investors have been duly taxed or not.

What is the justification to sell the prime land of Sri Lanka purportedly to build a hotel to a fighter aircraft manufacturing company? I just do not understand this. If it is Hilton Hotel, if it is Shangri-La Hotel, if it is Marriott Hotel or if it is some other hotel company, then obviously there is some connection. But, here there is no connection. So, I expect the Hon Minister to give a justifiable answer to this series of questions we have raised.
