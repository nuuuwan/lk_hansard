( ) (Mr. Speaker) . [. . 1.56] ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Prime Minister must remember that our Constitution states that only when the ruler is just, it would rain on time. If it does not rain on time, , that means the ruler is not just and .

He did not explain to us why we require to extend the state of Emergency. If everything is normal, why do you require to extend the state of Emergency? We had the 2002 Local Government Elections without the Emergency; we had the 2004 Provincial Council Elections under the UPFA Government without the Emergency. Now that the LTTE is defeated and we are back to normalcy, why are you holding this Local Government Election with the Emergency in force? It has not helped to restore law and order.

Some of our Members of Parliament were assaulted on 4th February, 2011 when they were walking in the night. When they were going in a peaceful procession holding a peaceful demonstration, they were stopped by the police and then attacked by thugs. You can ask about it from our Deputy Leader, our General Secretary, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, the Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva and all the others who were there and who are in the House today. You use the Emergency to assault the Hon. Members of Parliament unashamedly. Then, within the week, you are going to have the Asia Regional Conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Members of that Association have been assaulted with the help of the police. The Hon. Members who are speaking after me will deal with this issue at length.

A few days before that what did we find? The Lanka-e-News office was burnt. There is no proper police investigation into that; to date, the police has not investigated that issue. We are aware of what happened, who was responsible and why the police do not make any investigations. I want to place this on record as my Colleagues in the House will speak on those issues further.

1119 1120

But, these are all part of our fundamental rights. Our fundametal rights of association, speech and expression are being violated. Those fundamental rights are a part of the sovereignty of the people, which is enshrined in the Constitution and we have come to this House to ensure its implementation. We are holding the Government responsible for that. It is not merely the fundamental rights that are at stake. The recent judicial observations have even sought to re-introduce the sovereignty of the British Monarch under the British Queen to say that we are being ruled by the power of the British Queen. Therefore, I am raising an issue of Privilege on the need of Parliament to reassert the sovereignty of the people under Article 3 of the Constitution, a right which is exercised under Article 4 (c ). So, that is a matter of Privilege I raise before I get on to the substantive issues.

Sir, our Parliament is a master of its own powers. We have to decide what the powers of Parliament are, based on the sovereignty of the people. We, in this Parliament, have taken an Oath under the Second Republican Constitution. The Second Republican Constitution was enacted by repealing the First Republican Constitution in terms of the provisions under Article 51 of the 1972 Constitution. The 1972 Constitution drew its powers from the Constituent Assembly, which met on the 19th of July, 1972 and empowered itself to enact a Constitution "to declare Sri Lanka to be a free, sovereign and independent Republic, a Republic which derives its authority from the people of Sri Lanka and not from the power and authority assumed and exercised by the British Crown and the Parliament of the United Kingdom in the grant of the Constitution to Ceylon and therefore to supersede the Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council, but also all other laws which may conflict with the new Republican Constitution. We have got our powers on the basis of that Resolution. With that Resolution, we cut the links to the British Crown as the source of our sovereign power and now our sovereign power comes from the people.

The British sovereignty was established by another set of agreements: the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, the Kandyan Convention of 1815 and the Declaration of British Sovereignty of 1818. Following these and utilizing these powers only, we were granted Independence under the Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council of 1946, which the British Parliament and the King amended in 1947 by the Ceylon Independence Act of 1947 and the Ceylon Independence Order in Council of 1947. By these legislative measures, the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the King in Council gave up their powers to legislate for Sri Lanka. The executive powers of the Crown together with its prerogatives were retained to be exercised by the Governor General as representatives of the King. Article 44 and 45 of the Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council empowered the Governor-General to exercise executive powers similar to the powers and authority exercised in the United Kingdom by the

Sovereign. The new 1972 Republican Constitution replaced both the legislative and executive powers of the Monarch. The National State Assembly exercised the legislative power of the people directly, and the executive power of the people through the President and the Cabinet, under Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the 1972 Constitution. When this Constitution was repealed, these powers were included in Articles 3 and 4 of the present Constitution. The Order in Council of 1946 did not refer to the judicial powers, but in the case of Liyanage vs. Queen, the Privy Council held that judicial power continued to be vested in the courts as set out in the Charter of Justice and the Courts Ordinance. The same Republican Constitution made specific provision for the National State Assembly to exercise judicial power through courts. Therefore, neither the courts nor Parliament can give legal recognition to the sovereign powers and prerogatives exercised by the Monarch. The recent judicial observations which have recognized the prerogatives of the Crown amounts to reversing our legal order, which is based on the peoples sovereignty.

These judicial observations are based on two cases which were decided before 1972. These are: Gunaseela vs. Udugama and the Edmund Hewavitharana case, which have accepted the validity of the British Army Act of 1881. The British Army Act of 1881 is based on the prerogative powers of the Monarch exercised since 1279 by Edward I to regulate and discipline the Army. The Army Act of 1881 recognized the prerogative of the Monarch in respect of all the offences which did not attract the death penalty, but combined this prerogative with the powers of Parliament in respect of mutiny as one single Act. The UK Parliament repealed these powers of the Monarch only in 2010. Since the Order in Council of 1946 recognized the prerogative executive powers of the Monarch in the United Kingdom, it was natural for the Supreme Court under that Constitution to recognize the validity of the Army Act of 1881. But, once we became a Republic, the power to regulate and discipline the Army was derived from Article 5 of the 1972 Constitution, which is repeated in Article 4 of the present Constitution. These articles state that the executive power of the people shall include the defence of Sri Lanka. Then, we are in the same legal position as Australia and the United States where the powers of defence forces are exercised under a similar article.

In the recent judicial observations, the courts instead of proceeding under Article 4 of the present Constitution, have sought to reintroduce the concept of the prerogatives of the Monarch relying on Articles 16, 105(2) and 168(1) of the 1978 Constitution, which keeps in existence all laws in force at the time of its enactment in September, 1978. This has become the basis of recognizing the Monarchs prerogative through the decision of the Gunaseela vs. Udugama case. The Monarchs prerogative was not part of the existing laws as of September, 1978. Article 12 of 1972 Constitution read together with the letter convening the Constituent Assembly and the

1121 1122

[ ]

2011 08

resolution passed therein, abolished the prerogatives of the Monarch and replaced it with the sovereignty of the people. Since the 1978 Constitution flows from 1972 Republican Constitution, it cannot validate the prerogative powers of the Monarch invalidated in 1972. This is the intention of the legislation. Unfortunately, the judicial observations have not gone into this aspect.

Now, we have come to a crisis situation where we say we draw our powers from the peoples sovereignty and there are judicial observations to the contrary saying that we have to recognize the powers of the British Queen. This is an absurdity. We cannot have it both ways. Our basic law has to draw its sovereignty either from the people or from the British Queen. We are now getting into a conflict situation. This is why I am asking you, Hon. Speaker, that we make a restatement of our sovereignty. We can direct the courts.

We did that in 1972 when the Speaker ruled that the National State Assembly had the right to proceed with the Bills on an Order Paper and disregarded and directed the Constitutional Court that they must finish the proceedings in two weeks. Similarly, the Speaker, Hon. Anura Bandaranaike again asserted the supremacy of Parliament against the Courts in 2001. So, what I am asking you is this: why are we now trying to recognize a British law which is against us? The Prime Minister says that the Europeans are now trying to come in here and take us before international courts. But then, you are accepting the laws of England. Is that not what you are doing? The Army Act of 1881 recognizes the power - [Interruption.] no, no but that is the same thing. I mean, just for the sake of putting General Sarath Fonseka in jail, you are now recognizing the sovereignty of the British Monarch. That is what you have done in Fonseka vs. Kithulegoda. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I am on a point of Order. You cannot disturb me.- [Interruption.] I am only talking of the law. - [Interruption.] I want to read from the judgment of the Chief Justice in Fonseka vs. Kithulegoda. That is you. [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) As pointed out by the Attorney-General, the interpretation of a constitutional provision cannot be made in a vacuum. Such interpretation should coincide and be comfortable with the rest of the Constitution. Some of us were in Parliament when we enacted the 1978 Constitution and we did not want the power of the British Monarch. So, if that is so, how can the Supreme Court now go and recognize this Act of 1881, just to keep General Sarath Fonseka in jail?

Now, I am asking another question: Why are we recognizing the Edmund Hewavitharana case? Edmund Hewavitharana was the brother of Anagarika Dharmapala. In 1950, he was arrested under Martial Law. Then, he was brought before the Court Martial. He said "I cannot be court-martialled because I was not mobilized by the volunteer force at that time". Using an imperial Act of 1881, he was court martialled. In fact, Wood Renton was the CJ throughout the case. Edmund Hewavitharana died in jail in Jaffna because he was not treated properly. Later on, the British Governor gave pardon. So, this is the same law, the Army Act of 1881 - the imperial statute - which was then used and caused the death of Edmund Hewavitharana. The same law was used to execute Henry Pedris and it is now being used to jail General Sarath Fonseka. . ? , . , . , , ? . . , . .

This Government is ruling the country according to the Constitution of Sri Lanka. We are a sovereign State. All laws that bind us come from the Constitution. [Interruption.] No, no. I will come to that. Please have patience.

[. . 2.39]

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Deputy Speaker, thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to participate in the Debate on the extension of the state of Emergency. Normally, a state of Emergency is declared only when there is an emergency situation prevailing in the country. According to Section 2 (1) of the Public Security Ordinance, where, in view of the existence or imminence of a state of public emergency, the President is of opinion that it is expedient so to do in the interests of public security and the preservation of public order or for the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community, the President may, by Proclamation published in the Gazette, declare that the provisions of Part II of this Ordinance shall, forthwith or on such date as may be specified in the Proclamation, come into operation throughout Sri Lanka or in such part or parts of Sri Lanka as may be so specified. None of the conditions stated in the Public Security Ordinance exists in the country for declaration of Emergency.

The Emergency Regulations give wide powers to the Forces. According to earlier Emergency Regulations, a person can be detained under a Detention Order issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence for a period of one year. But, they were amended and according to the amendment, a person who is arrested under Emergency Regulations can be kept only for three months. There is a judgment delivered by Justice Shirani Bandaranayake that a person arrested under Emergency Regulations cannot be kept for more than three months and at the end of three months, he must be released or he must be produced before a Magistrate and then remanded. But, what is happening now? At the expiry of three months, what are the police doing? They are not doing what the Government wanted them to do. They get a Detention Order under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and keep the person for another 18 months. So, this amendment does not give any relief to persons who are arrested under Emergency Regulations.

This amendment was brought in because the Government thought that a person should not be kept in detention under Emergency Regulations for more than three months. But, what is happening now? They arrest persons, keep them for three months and thereafter get a Detention Order and keep them in detention for another 18 months.

These Emergency Regulations give wide powers to the Forces and those powers are often being misused. For instance, one Gunasunderam Jeyasunderam, a person

residing abroad who is a highly qualified engineer, was taken into custody at the Katunayake International Airport on 4th September 2007 and was kept under Emergency Regulations for one year and two months. Thereafter, he was detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act for 18 months and was then remanded. Now, he is being detained at the New Magazine Prison for more than three and a half years. I have made several attempts to get him released but failed.

In spite of the Emergency Regulations being in force, violent killings and robberies have taken place. Lasantha Wickrematunga was killed during the state of emergency and one Ekneligoda, a journalist was abducted about six months ago. Still, his whereabouts are not known. The Citizens Forum in Jaffna has sent a letter to the President stating that robberies and crimes should be brought down. Within the last two years, 27 media persons including Lasantha Wickrematunge were killed and the Government must take responsibility for this.

Emergency Regulations allow white van arrests and these vans are not stopped and checked either by the Army or the Police at checkpoints. People who come in vehicles with tinted glasses are responsible for several abductions in Mannar. Several human rights violations are being carried out in spite of the state of Emergency.

In Jaffna, the Army is taking photographs of ordinary people. They ask them to come to public places, pay Rs. 100 and thereafter take photographs as if they are criminals. In this connection, my Friend, the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah, wrote a letter to the President. I will read it out.

It has been brought to our notice, that military personnel have been forcing people to gather in public places like libraries, make a payment of Rs. 100.00 and pose for family photographs in various places in Jaffna.

This has caused a great amount of fear and panic in the minds of residents in Jaffna, besides the obvious hardship that this exercise entails. According to information available with us, this commenced on the 5th of February 2011 in areas such as Kalviyankadu and continued in places like Irupalai and Kopay. This is now being done in many places in an organized way.

We are also informed that residents in the Kilinochchi District are forced to sign forms printed and written in Sinhala, contents of which they do not understand. This is also being done by the military.

Sir, I am tabling* this letter to be included in Hansard.

The Amnesty International and the other NGOs have requested the Government to do away with the Emergency Regulations and repeal the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act. The Government says that they have killed Prabhakaran and Pottu Amman and terrorism has been wiped out. What is now remaining is State terrorism, if I may say, and how are we to prevent it? It is State terrorism that is responsible for the killings of Mr. Kumar Ponnambalam, the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham, the Hon. Sivanesan, the Hon. Raviraj, the Hon. Maheswaran and Mr. Lasantha Wickrematunge.

What the country needs now is not Emergency Regulations but a good and efficient Government and the rule of law, which is lacking now. There is no media freedom whatsoever. It was under Emergency rule that the machinery of the press of the Uthayan newspaper was burnt, the machinery of The Sunday Leader newspaper was destroyed and this week, the LankaeNews office belonging to the JVP was destroyed and its Editor says, It is nothing but arson.

What is worrying the people now is the cost of living. The prices of consumer items have skyrocketed. An ordinary man cannot afford to have three meals per day. The price of a coconut is Rs. 60, a kilo of green chillies is Rs. 600, a kilo of red onions is Rs. 500 and the Government is unable to tackle the problem of the cost of living. Instead of taking steps to bring down the cost of living, the Government is unnecessarily spending money on tamashas. What is the necessity of having nearly 100 Ministers to rule this Government? I understand that the Government is paying Rs. 500 million every year to a PR firm in the UK to boost the post-war image of the country. The Government has imported Prado vehicles for Government MPs.

We do not want the Government to extend the state of Emergency any longer. It should bring down the cost of living. Otherwise, what is happening in Egypt now will happen here also and people will rise up and send the Government home. If the higher ranking officers like "KP", the chief procurer of arms and money for the LTTE, could be released, why can persons who are in prison now for merely doing odd jobs for them, not be released? I request the Government to give them amnesty and release them early in the way "KP" and others were released. We, the Members of the Tamil National Alliance, request the Government not to extend the state of Emergency any longer.

Thank you.

"The LTTE has been militarily defeated, but it maintains a state of the art propaganda, fundraising, procurement, and shipping infrastructure overseas particularly in the West. The LTTE has offices and cells in about 60 countries. About a million Sri Lankan Tamils live overseas, allowing the LTTE to establish a significant overseas presence"

We need to defeat this. Then he further goes on to say,

"Capturing KP is the beginning of a masterplan. As long as support for LTTE persists overseas, Sri Lanka will remain under threat. To meet these threats, it is paramount for Sri Lanka to build a powerful external security and intelligence service and a counter propaganda organization within the Foreign Ministry of Sri Lanka. By investing in, recruiting and training the best minds, future governments will be able to detect threats and neutralize them before they manifest".

"After Prabhakaran, KP was the biggest human rights violator in Sri Lanka. Like the Nazi trial of Nrnberg in Germany, KP should be charged for crimes and tried in a special court in Sri Lanka and given the appropriate punishment he deserves."

Mr. Presiding Member, the whole nation is exhuberant with delight and celebrating the 63rd anniversary of Independence. Independence was won for this country by several parties and several leaders. The first Parliamentary Election was held in 1947 and Independence was attained on 4th of February, 1948. The Rt. Hon. D. S. Senanayake pioneered the attainment of Independence and he was named as the Father of the Nation. In that 1947 Cabinet, there were great men like Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, Dr. T.B. Jayah, Mr. G.G. Ponnambalam and Mr. C. Sunderalingam, who have carved out a name for themselves and will be written in gold in our history. The National Congress, the Sinhala Maha Sabha, the All Ceylon Muslim League and the Tamil Congress got together and formed one party and that was declared as the United National Party, the founder of which was the Rt. Hon. D.S. Senanayake.

Today, what has happened to the party founded by him? They are disgracing him. When the whole nation has to celebrate the Independence Day, whoever it may be in the saddle of power, I am so ashamed to say that that party founded by the Rt. Hon. D. S. Senanayake thought it fit to take to the streets and have a demonstration against Independence calling it, Nidahase Vilapaya. Sir, this will be recorded in black letters in history .. . , , -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Azwer, you can continue. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . . . , history will record this as a "Black February" for the United National Party. Grassroots level Members, and my good Friends who are in the Party, are asking, What has happened to our leadership? Sir, I am surprised that the Deputy Leader of the Party, the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, also partook in this Vilapaya. When the National Anthem is sung, he inspires us by standing erect and keeping his right hand on the left chest. That is how he pays respect to the National Anthem. Today what has happened to that Hon. Karu Jayasuriya? Where has he been driven to? . . , .

. Representatives of the whole world came for the Independence Day celebrations. I am very happy to state, Sir, that for the first time the rural children, in their thousands, participated in the Independence Day celebrations. It was a very colourful procession. As a Muslim, I felt happy because children from Muslim schools in the backyard of Madagama in the Bibile Electorate, children of Al-Marjan Vidyalaya of Badulla, children from Muslim schools in other places in Uva Province came to this Independence Day celebration. They were led by Mr. Shashindra Rajapaksa, the Chief Minister of Uva. It was celebrations all around.

It is His Excellency the Presidents "Mahinda Chintana" development projects - whether there is hot weather or cold weather, there is flood or drought - that brings solace and salvation to the people of this country. It is not only we who say that but the international community and the international leadership have also accepted that fact. That is why I ask: Now, do not do this. It is not your history. It is not the culture of the United National Party. Do not support foreign agencies or foreign conspirators. You are still in the grip of foreign conspirators. You cannot get out of it".

This morning, Sir, I heard a nice song, which was broadcast by the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation and presented by Mr. T.D.K. Jayantha, . It describes beautifully what has happened to this country. When we want to grow more food here, - they have forgotten the name of the Hon. Dudley Senanayake, who went round the country with a camera on his shoulder inspiring the people to grow more food - this UNP does not want food to be grown in this country. They do not

want herali; they do not want del from this country. They do not want other vegetables to be grown in our backyard. They want all "English vegetables"; they call those English vegetables". . . . ".....

. . Sir, by the way, Lakshmi Bai or Kadija Umma - she went on Hadj also - happened to be my aunt. I must tell that especially to the Hon. J.R.P. Sooriyapperuma, who is here. .

? , ? . . . . ? Whom did he address? He addressed the distinguished Members of the Commonwealth of Nations, who are coming to this country at the end of this week. He addressed them; he spoke to them. He did not speak to the people of this country. That is why he stealthily made use of the English language or the Queen's language to address them. That speech has already been sent to the world. We know what he is doing and I also will send out my speech.

Sir, this must be recorded. In the Biyagama Electorate, there was a chap called Gonawala Sunil. ? He was imprisoned for the crimes he had committed. He came out and what did the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, do? The Members of the Commonwealth of Nations must know this when they come here. I will place this Hansard before them. He decorated him by awarding a post of JP - Justice of the Peace. Today, ashamedly, this Leader who calls himself the Leader of the Opposition - nobody in their own ranks knows who the Leader of the Opposition is - comes and says that the Government did this, the Government did that. Not only that, the Members of the Commonwealth of Nations must know how the human rights were completely negated in this country.

1211 1212

. The Members of the Commonwealth of Nations and the IPU should know that there was a torture chamber called "Batalanda" in the then Prime Ministers electorate conducted by him and that is the former Prime Minister who, as the Leader of the Opposition, now addresses the Commonwealth of Nations through this Parliament. , , . ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) He is referring to the conduct of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) No, no, I am not referring to his conduct. Sir, everything he said was against the - [Interruption.] I am not; I am not referring to his conduct. I may refer to your conduct but not his conduct because I know the conduct of both of you as I have been there much before you, for 49 years and six months. Do you know that? - [Interruption.] Yes. That is what he is capable of.

In this country, do you want to swim in a bloodbath? That is what I want to ask from my honourable Tamil Friends here. ! !

In July, 1983, all the Tamils left this country. When we go to the United Nations or visit other places, they say,

Your great President has brought us peace. We want to come back. Ayyo! save our properties in the North. We want back our properties robbed by Prabhakaran and others. We want to enjoy the sweet Karutha Kolumpaan Maampalam. This is what the Tamils now living in those countries, who left this country fearing for life, are saying today.

ADJOURNMENT

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , " " . . . Question proposed.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . .. .

IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO FLOOD-AFFECTED PERSONS .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I move, Whereas a humanitarian need of great proportions has arisen once again due to unprecedented floods in many provinces of the country, this House resolves that all effort must be taken by the Government and all other parties to grant immediate relief to those affected, and having regard to the loss of crops and cattle, a suitable compensation should be worked out in respect of same and that the food rations be continued and that the Government appeals to the international community for urgent assistance in this regard.

I am happy to speak on this Adjournment Motion which brings to the notice of this House, a very urgent situation that has arisen in the country. Hardly had the effects of the floods that engulfed the country in the month of January receded, a fresh wave of rains and floods have engulfed the country once again. This House knows the proportions to which this has gone. As the Motion itself states, this is "unprecedented". The first wave itself was unprecedented and we know that the second wave was worse than the first. Many parts of the country are still impassable and inaccessible. Several Hon. Members of this House are unable to attend todays Sessions because they cannot find passage to Colombo from the places that they are in. Even those who can find passage have chosen to stay back in their constituencies with a sense of responsibility so that they may be with the people who are undergoing great hardship at the moment.

I am glad that the Hon. Minister of Disaster Management is here. You will recall, Hon. Deputy Speaker, that the Hon. Leader of the Opposition raised a question at the last Session of Parliament and I would like to repeat that question today. That question is: Why was a state of a national disaster not proclaimed? There is provision for that in the laws that this House has passed. That is an important provision and an important proclamation must be made when one takes into cognizance the degree of the affectation. The answer that was given on the last occasion was: if such a declaration is made, that will affect the tourism industry. Now, that is not a satisfactory answer because if one looks at the world news of channels that were beamed all around the world two or three day ago, the floods in Sri Lanka was second only to the crisis in Egypt.

1215 1216

So, world news itself recognizes the seriousness of the situation that has engulfed this country. We understand the decision that was made to open the sluice gates, to preserve the dams and also to protect people from further harm. But, at the same time I wonder whether adequate notice was given to the people to get away from the areas where the waters pass through when the gates are opened. Now, these passages have been reserved. People are not supposed to live along that path. All that is known. But, we also know the reality that a lot of people actually reside in the passage through which these sluice waters flow and they have been severely affected.

As I said, it is estimated that at least one-third of the crops has been destroyed by the first wave. That is a grave situation. Not only the crops but the cattle that people owned have also been washed away by the floods. People have lost their homes. These floods have wreaked havoc in several districts such as Kilinochchi partly, Mannar which is still very much under water and parts of Vavuniya, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa have been very badly affected by the second wave of floods. In the Trincomalee District, still several areas are inaccessible particularly on the side of Muttur where several villages have still not been provided with relief items. The Hon. Minister of Disaster Management is here and he can take cognizance of that. This is not a charge; this is not finding fault; this is to bring the attention of the authorities that still it is difficult to reach some areas. Places like Verugal and several parts of the Batticaloa and Ampara Districts are still under water.

In the Batticaloa District, in the Paduvankarai area, even three days ago several people were still lodged on treetops unable to come down. The height of the water in certain parts where the roads have gone under is said to be seven feet and ten feet. Although according to reports, the levels are receding, they have not receded fully and it is taking its time. It is only the Government that can have access to several parts because most of these areas are inaccessible by road and therefore helicopters and navy boats have been utilized and need to be utilized. Others cannot have access to that kind of machinery. Even if we receive aid, even if the other countries come to our assistance, that relief must reach the people who are marooned in the waters. So, I urge the Government to take the necessary steps immediately.

I know that the Ministry of Disaster Management is doing its utmost. I am thankful to the Minister for he is working round-the-clock. I have tried to reach him many times but I was unable to because he is on the job. But, we all have to as a country pull our weight together and work at this but first and foremost, is the acknowledgement that there is a very serious issue, perhaps as serious as the tsunami itself, has happened and that consciousness does not seem to have come to the

rest of the country. That is one of the prime reasons why we are moving this Adjournment Motion in this august Assembly, so that the seriousness of the issue will be spoken, will be made known and the whole country can be put on a disaster footing as it were that our minds are focused on what our brothers and sisters are undergoing in some parts of the country, and that together without partisan politics, we can address this situation and put our heads together also and find better ways of serving these people who are marooned in the midst of water at the moment.

I urge this House to approve this Motion that I have moved, together as one voice, and the Hon. Minister to even ask for our assistance because several parts that are affected are in the North and the East, apart from the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Districts. Members of Parliament from the Batticaloa District have not come because they are there. Several Members of Parliament who reside in Mannar are unable to come; the Member of Parliament who resides in Mullaitivu is unable to come. The Member of Parliament from Vavuniya has chosen not to come. You can have the assistance of Members of Parliament from those places.

On behalf of the Tamil National Alliance, I would like to extend our cooperation fully in whatever way possible. There may be information that we receive which the Government may not get. In those situations a kind of mechanism must be set up so that that information is collated and people can be served as fast as possible. The National Disaster Management Centre perhaps is the place where that information can be given. So, I would like to conclude by once again urging the Hon. Minister to declare this event as a national disaster.

Thank you very much.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer, I can give you only three minutes. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Sir, this is a natural disaster beyond the comprehension and power of man. It is beyond his control. But, we are very happy to see that the President is always alert and alive to the difficulties and disasters faced by people of the country and he has taken a decision at the SLFP Central Committee to set up a task force, and we have released - sometimes sufficient - money to the flood victims; flood damage assistance - Rs. 50 billion. Four hundred tanks and anicuts damaged, around 2,273 houses fully damaged and nearly 71,000 hectares of paddy lands were hit.

We are happy, Sir, that our farsighted President has created a separate Ministry of Disaster Management and placed it under the able hand of the Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera who is doing yeoman service at the moment. His lieutenants, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa, the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, the Hon. A.L.M. Athaullah, the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva and the Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah have taken keen interest and they have visited all these areas with food items et cetera. I would only like to ask what the Hon. (Mrs.) Chandrani Bandara was speaking here. Has the United National Party officially done anything? Let us forget about it. This is the time that we have to get together.

I like the reconciliatory tone struck today by the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran who moved this Motion. He was very moderate and passive. They talked about Nachchaduwa. The famous writer, Farawin, shouting from there and Mr. N.M.M. Shahied, Attorney-at-Law have visited that area. Help and assistance is being re-echoed not only in Nachchaduwa but from all over: Eravur, Oddamavadi, Kinniya and so on. Then, Moulavi Hussain Abdeen was calling us daily from Kinniya. Mr. Ali Zahir Moulana, ex-MP, Mr. Basheer Segu Dawood and Mr. M.S.S. Ameer Ali, the former Minister of Disaster Management including GS Haniffa of Oddamavadi, all in one voice, are asking for aid. The Hon. A.R.M.A. Cader Hadjiar had sent a load of goods over there. Then, Sir, we must also at this moment pay a tribute especially to all the voluntary organizations and certain NGOs who are ever ready to help the victims, and who have already done so. I pay a tribute in this House particularly to the All-Ceylon Jammiyathul Ulema led by Alhaj Moulavi Hafiz Rizvi Mufthi; together with the Secretary, Moulavi M.I.M.

Thassim, they are doing a wonderful job. The donations are very well coordinated through Mosques. All the other religious organizations are also helping, Sir.

At this moment, Sir, before winding up, I must also emphasize this point. That is, we have to turn to God and pray because we have to ask help from God. For whatever mistakes we do - we make mistakes - the punishments come from Allahu Tha'ala. The Quran in Sura Al-Zilzal or "The Convulsion" states, I quote: "Iza Zulzilathil Arlu Zilzalaha Wa-Akhrajathil Arlu Askalaha Wakalal In sanu Malaha" [Sura 99 : 1-3]

There is tremor. There are certain black materials thrown out from the bowels of the Earth. Then, the man turns and cries out, Oh, what has happened?

Today we are asking that same question. This terrifying phenomenon is not particular only to Sri Lanka. See for example, Australia. What a nice country it is; what a beautiful country it is. On one side, there is floods and on the other, there is fire - flood and fire at the same time ! Brazil is also in the grip of such calamity.

Sir, when you are presiding here, I would suggest that through Parliament, we convey our sorrow and condolences to the people and bereaved families in Australia and Brazil. That is the duty of our Parliament.

Thank you, Sir.

There are a hundred thousand farmers and fishermen who have taken loans from banks and other centres. Due to this national disaster, they are unable to pay the capital and even the interest to the banks. Therefore, it would be better to waive their loans, capitals or at least the interest. I would also suggest you to even write off the loans in order to create a better situation for the farmers and fishermen.
