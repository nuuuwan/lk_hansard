( - , ) (The Hon.

If the Hon. Member who raised this issue in the House had given us a copy of it, the Government could have verified the veracity of the statement. ( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Sir, the day before yesterday he has given a copy of the statement to the Hon. Speaker. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) No, it must be sent to the Office of the Leader of the House. That is the procedure. Hon. Speaker, we have not received it. Therefore, the Government is unable to give a reply today. He is saying that a response must be given today. But, we have to verify the veracity of the various allegations contained in that statement. We will respond to this in due course.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , . . . . . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) There is a point of order.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, you announced at the beginning of this Question that was raised by Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah, that it was being raised under Standing Order No. 23(2). Standing Order 23 (2) states, I quote:

All questions, of which notice has been received by the Secretary-General.......

It only mentions the "Secretary-General". We are bound to give notice to the Secretary-General and nobody else. This was given not just one day before as required by the Standing Order, but two days' notice was given.

More than the required notice was given, and it is unfortunate that the Leader of the House says that he did not object to it. How could he have objected? The Standing Order only requires notice to be given to the Secretary-General and nobody else.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) 23 (2) :

, , .

. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) That is a different issue. But, the Hon. Member should know how to raise this issue within the purview of the Standing Orders. That has not been done. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . . . . .

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. Yesterday, at the Party Leaders' Meeting, we decided that we would have a full day's Adjournment Debate on this issue. This matter was raised by a Government Minister himself yesterday and now from the Opposition as well. Therefore, I think you will give consent to that. At the next Session, the first available opportunity will have a - ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) There is no issue at all. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) There is an issue, otherwise your Minister would not have raised it. Your own Minister has raised it and in consequent to that, he is testifying to it. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) But, there is a way of testifying it. The procedure has not been followed. But, still we are prepared to accommodate them and give them a debate. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , .

, products , cross-sale . . , . , . At this stage of the industry, given the economic development stage of the country where we need a load of capital as well, and we are all fighting to get foreign direct investment, restructuring the model of insurance will definitely add to a lot of cost. The combined insurers have made investments depending on some long-term goals. When we go and change the rules of the game, particularly for those who have already got business models and are already in the industry, I think personally, that it is unfair. There are countries -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, I must tell you that from all these groups, none of them asked for an abolition. They suggested a time period for the transition. So, we have accommodated them and there is no question of going back on that. That has been mutually agreed.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) So, I am saying, in principle, I disagree with you but we can compromise as you are saying. We can compromise on how the transition can be done. I, in principle, disagree with you not because different countries have different systems and we also have our system, but I, in principle, disagree about changing laws

259 260

to affect companies which are already in existence and are performing well. There are jurisdictions like in UK and Singapore where there has been a rethink on the policy and the existing companies have been permitted in those countries to maintain their combined licences while new entrants have been given licences either separately for life, or separately for general. So, there are situations where people have been extremely careful. Regulation is important and I agree with you on that as well. But, we are regulating to see the industry grow. That is the issue. . Actually, extending the period is the second best option. That is why we were proposing it because it is not the first best option.

, . . . . . , . , . . , , . , , . , . , .

The second point I would like to make quickly, Hon. Speaker, is that the Government for a long time, has worked on the idea of basically a risk-based capital. The Bill as it currently stands, basically talks about increasing capital but has not introduced the concept of a risk-based capital. If we look even as far back as the 2006 Annual Report of IBSL, the then Chairman talked about the Board having decided to ease introduce risk-based capital with effect from 2009. I looked at the 2007 Annual Report of IBSL as well. Even in that Report, it states, I quote:

The Board is taking steps to increase the capital of insurance companies and is also studying a model for introducing risk based capital, in order to move towards a system which is more appropriate."

Then, I looked at the 2008 Annual Report of IBSL as well and there was a change in the Chairman of the Board at that time and even in that Report, it states, I quote:

. Risk-based supervision supplements sound regulation with a focus on the volatile nature of the insurance business that can affect solvency and the ability to meet contingencies. Based on risk-based supervision, we focused on assessing the risk profiles of insurance companies,

Then, we looked at the 2009 Annual Report of IBSL, the Chairman of the Board has gone even further. I do not know whether this is a little misleading. He has stated, I quote:

"The risk-based approach we have adopted was applied constructively but firmly in 2009 ........ "

He further talking about supervision states, I quote:

Our former rules-based supervisory system was focused on establishing reasonable rules that scrutinize aspects such as the solvency margin, investments, minimum capital requirement, etc. However, this supervisory approach is considered to be insufficiently reflective of varying risk profiles of different insurers, inconsistent with a risk-based approach to management and supervision, ..

In other words, he is saying that our former methodology was out of sink with international best practices.

Then he states, I quote:

Our commitment is to strengthen the regulation of insurance, .. With our risk-based approach, insurance firms faced a fundamental change in the way that they are regulated, including a more proactive and challenging regulatory relationship.

He is suggesting that you already have a risk-based approach in the insurance industry and it seems to have been a Government policy for a long time.

Also, I went into the IBSL website and found that there was a Press Release which was issued on the 2nd of February 2010, in which it is stated, I quote:

However, this supervisory approach is perceived to be insufficiently reflective of varying risk profiles of different insurers, inconsistent with a risk based approach to management and considered as out of line with international best practices ..

So, Hon. Speaker, this is the point I am making. It is the risk management rather than rules that are important. It being the policy objective of the Government since 2006 and 2007, a report of consultants was supposed to be handed over in February, 2010, according to the IBSL website which refers to it. Therefore, I propose just to include the words risk-based capital in the new law. The rules could be drawn and amended from time to time as an industry develops by the IBSL Board. There are no perfect rules in risk management but there are benefits in actually adopting this. It will rationalize the use of capital particularly, when we, as a country are fighting for the scarce resource of capital.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, amendments of this nature are first brought before the Consultative Committee. Then, we can debate it and these are not really matters of great controversy between the Government and the Opposition.

261 262

[ ]

2011 05

So, certainly, if you can bring this up at the next Consultative Committee meeting, then, we can consider it. But, we cannot suddenly foist these amendments because this traditionally needs the attention of the Consultative Committee and also of the Ministry in charge of that. So, I would strongly recommend that you bring this up at the next Consultative Committee meeting.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Thank you, Hon. Minister. I have already brought this up at various forums including the amendments. Yesterday also we had discussions and I personally think that it could have been included because it being the policy, it needs a very small alteration. So, it would have been better if you had included it if you want to consider it in future.

Hon. Speaker, the final point I would like to make is with regard to the Disqualifications for being a Director on page 24 in the Second Schedule. Now, this basically refers to disqualification of directors and it has omitted the concept of "fit and proper" for directors. The Hon. Minister referred to the financial industry as a composite and you know in the banking industry, we have "fit and proper" criteria adopted. I went into the LawNet and looked at some of its references. It has one paragraph on "fit and proper" and one paragraph on "disqualification". It states, "No person shall be appointed, elected or nominated as a director of a licensed commercial bank or continue as a director of such bank unless that person is a fit and proper person to hold office".

Unfortunately, this draft has actually left that out. I also went into the Financial Services Authority to look at what "International Practice" is. We know that everything that is international we do not need to adopt but we can take what is good and reject what is not relevant to us. I think one thing you have done is, you have adopted a principle, which says that if somebody is disqualified locally or internationally, he is disqualified, which I think is very good but then, there is another principle that this refers to. It states here that they will consider individuals who may be under the disqualification list under circumstances relevant to the requirements and standards of the regulatory system. That is why I think the "fit and proper" criteria is important, not just disqualifications. For example, if a 20-year old drives on the road, meets with an accident and kills an individual, and if that is considered a criminal act by the court, he does not have to be disqualified for the rest of his life. So, if we had put a fit and proper criteria as well into that Act as an amendment, I think then it gives the discretion to the Board to know that a person like this could actually be included despite his disqualifications. So, that is the point that I would make.

Finally, I would say that it is the spirit of regulations that matters, not only the rules because sometime ago, one insurance company was singled out for infringement while there are others also with infringements. I think the spirit of the law is important in implementation, not just looking at the rules. So, I would strongly urge the Government, Hon. Speaker, to please re-look at these two amendments. I am only proposing these two. One is to include risk-based capital because it is a very, very small amendment, which can make an improvement to the Act. The other is, existing companies have made investments and taken long-term positions. So, when we, as legislators, go and change the ground rules - my view is that it should not be changed, but if we have to change it, - then we should definitely give them a much longer period and that is why I am proposing six years.

Thank you. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You have suggested that it should be four. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) No, Hon. Minister, I suggested that if you have to go with it, go with six.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, you have suggested that it should be four. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) No, Hon. Minister, I suggested that if you have to go with it, go with six.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I put it in writing to the Secretary-General. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) This is what you have proposed. You have proposed that Section 52 to be amended from three to four years.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) No, Hon. Minister.

263 264

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Your personal view maybe that it should be six, but what is -

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) No, Hon. Minister, that is not correct. I have addressed the letter to the Secretary-General and it is six years. As the second best solution, I would ask you to please consider that because it will be in the interest of the industry and the country. I sincerely believe it and also believe, the Sanasa and the co-operative movement will need a lot more time to adjust to this and we should not undermine them. Otherwise, they will be unfairly pushed at this stage into facing up to commercial competition. So, I think more time should be given.

Thank you.

Hon. Prime Minister, within the last period of one month, many murders that have taken place; many abductions have taken place in the Jaffna Peninsula and the situation in the society has been very severe. I hope the Government of Sri Lanka would take immediate steps to curtail these activities that are taking place in Jaffna. This is similar to the activities that were there even earlier when the terrorists were active. I do not know who is behind this scene. If terrorism has been curtailed, I do not understand how this sort of abductions and murders can take place in the Jaffna Peninsula.

Secondly, the most important factor as far as communication is concerned is transport. The roads in the Jaffna Peninsula are in a very delicate position. The A9 road is in a very bad condition. It takes more than two hours for people who are coming from Jaffna to reach Vavuniya. There are several Government employees travelling daily from Jaffna to Vanni, especially teachers, and due to bad condition of the roads they get delayed and this in turn, affects the students. Even passengers find it difficult to move around due to this bad condition of the roads. The Jaffna-Colombo Road is now one of the busiest roads. So, the authorities need to take quick action on this issue.

, , , , . , . . - , - . - . Therefore, we have to take immediate action to see that the situation with regard to roads and the transport system in the Jaffna Peninsula is immediately rectified.

The other main issue is with regard to the fishermen of this country. They find it difficult to fish in the seas of that area. , . .

That is, to have an All Party delegation under the leadership of the Hon.

None of those have been officially communicated to this country and it is an obligation on the part of Parliament and the Hon. Speaker to see that that is done.

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.B. Farook) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Speaker, Hon. Prime Minister, Hon. Ministers of the Cabinet, Hon. Leader of the Opposition and Hon. Members of both sides, at the outset I wish all the Hon. Members of the House a very Happy New Year and wish that prosperity reigns over Sri Lanka throughout the year. I consider it a great privilege to stand here today in this supreme House. First and foremost, I thank the Almighty Allah for having bestowed on me this esteemed position. Secondly, I, in all sincerity, thank the voters of Vanni, the Tamils, the Sinhalese and the Muslims who had voted me irrespective of caste, creed and race.

The shock wave that hit the Mannar District as well as the Island on the morning of 2nd December, 2010 had gradually receded. But, our hearts are still heavy over the untimely demise of our beloved Friend, the Hon. Noordeen Mashoor Hadjiar, a Member of Parliament for the Vanni Electoral District. And, I, as a Member who had entered this House, stepping into his shoes, feel that it is a grave and bounden duty on my part to say a few words of appreciation of his services to my people. To me, he was a vigorous and dynamic personality with novel and constructive ideas and policies.

I remember him addressing a meeting at the Mannar Kachcheri soon after he was appointed a Minister in the 2001 UNP Government. There, he stated that his boyhood

dream was to see the Mannar Causeway and the bridge repaired or reconstructed, and also said that he would have it fulfilled. Then it appeared to me as an impossibility, because I doubted whether such a massive development, at very much cost would be undertaken in a remote war-torn district. But, however, the idea mooted by him was carried through and put into action and today we enjoy the pleasure of a safe and comfortable ride along this three-kilometre causeway. Although his mortal remains had been laid to rest and he is no more with us, yet I do hope that all those who were present at that particular meeting would certainly remember him whenever they happen to ride across this causeway.

My maiden speech would be colourless if I do not draw the attention of this House to the prevailing situation in my District. The Vanni Electoral District is an agricultural cum fishing district and great developments are presently taking place, for which I thank the Government. Yet, more advances are to be made and from the Floor of this House, I promise my people to come up with new proposals and suggestions, as and when, necessity arises.

During the past two decades, the Mannar, Vavuniya and Mullaitivu Districts have had no residential Members of Parliament to attend to the immediate and day-to-day needs of the people. Hence, today, I make a solemn promise to my people that I would continue to stay in Mannar and that my services would readily be available to them.

Another important matter that has been disturbing us is with regard to certain provisions in the Prescription Ordinance and the Primary Courts' Procedure Act; that needs immediate attention.

Upto 31st of December 2010, I had been working as a Legal Officer in the Mannar Branch of the Legal Aid Commission of Sri Lanka and during my tenure of office, I had been trained to work for the cause of the poor, underprivileged masses and the internally displaced persons.

It is my experience that the 10-year rule in the Prescription Ordinance and the two-month rule in the Primary Courts Procedure Act had thrown out hundreds of displaced persons in the war-torn Northern Province, from their lands by unscrupulous, indiscreet and selfish trespassers.

This calls for remedial measures and I am of the firm opinion that at least some form of temporary adjustment be made in the law on a regional basis. I would not elaborate further but appeal to the Hon. Ministers concerned to kindly offer me a hearing at their disposal.

I also take this opportunity to draw the attention of the Government to the deadline fixed in respect of displaced people to register their names in the electoral registers in their respective areas. It is a known fact that a majority of

these IDPs are from my electorate, Vanni, and as this so-called final date carries with it certain sanctions, which in turn, would certainly burden my people, I appeal to the Government to consider this issue and grant an extension of this order.

Yet another area over which I am very keen to draw the attention of this House is with regard to the current escalation of arrests and detention of our people by the security forces. Today, we find our people salvaged and emancipated from that yoke of terrorism; thanks to the fearless actions of His Excellency the President.

Yet, in spite of the freedom achieved, almost every household in my area lives in constant fear of potential arrest and abduction. They are still in a state of abnormality and uncertainty. It may be that they are interested in wiping out the menace of terrorism completely. But, to my mind, such an exercise practiced ad hoc without following legal bounds, would be counter-productive as very many innocent men and women had been taken in on information given by their adversaries.

A cardinal factor to be remembered is that these men, both young and old, were really not active partners of terrorist activities but were mere helpers under pressure and coercion. Hence, today I take this opportunity in all sincerity, to appeal to the Government to grant a general amnesty and bring about an end to this sad episode, which rocked our beloved country for almost three decades. Let us all forget the past and turn a new chapter wherein all of us can join hands in saluting Mother Lanka. Then only, peace and harmony would reign in our part of the country wherein our people would be ensured of a normal and peaceful life.

I am aware of a religious text which says, Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God and I wish that this Government be credited with that virtue.

Yet another religion preaches us that, Love begets love and hatred begets hatred. If the noble principles underlined therein are adhered to unto the spirit of the letters, any government anywhere would certainly witness peace and prosperity settling on its citizens.

Before I conclude, I would like to thank the Hon. Speaker for giving me this valuable opportunity to address this supreme House and I also would like to thank my party leadership and request the co-operation of all Hon. Members of this House, whom I consider as my Brothers and Colleagues, to carry forward my noble duties as a Member of Parliament.

I also promise to co-operate with the Government to carry forward its socio-welfare policies and activities without let or hindrance from any anti-national element.

Thank you.
