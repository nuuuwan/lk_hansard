... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would like to quote from a Rome drama, which states :

Come, leave your tears: a brief fare-well:-...

He came, shed a tear on his nephew, the Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara and said goodbye. In another place in this drama, there is a dialogue like this. I quote :

What would you have, friend? whence are you? Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.

After about 40 years of public and political service to his Wellassa boomiya and to the whole nation, he was asked to go to the door. Sometimes, I wonder whether he passed away as a disillusioned man. I knew both the Hon. Dharmadasa Banda and his worthy nephew, the Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara, both sat together in this Parliament, the uncle-nephew added a new dimension and gave colour to this august Assembly. The Hon. Dharmadasa Banda was a very amiable person, very friendly, soft spoken but he can be hard where one should hit hard, and he hit hard. He was determined to see that his nation is free of foreign colonialism. He was essentially a man from Wellassa deeply rooted in this soil and had the traditional courage of the Sinhala man and I should say, a Sri Lankan man. He brooded no nonsense when it came to play his part for his country. He was national minded to the root. He was a great patriot. That is why after the present leadership, in the

1025 1026

[ ]

2011 23

lawn of the green party, he came to understand the futility of continuing further and joined hands with His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa and became a Minister.

Sir, the Hon. Dharmadasa Banda had a vision, a clear view of many a matter. We came to know him as a young boy at Zahira College, wearing a pair of trousers, dapper, short but he flew high in the volleyball court, specially. Zahira College is proud of having nurtured and educated Dharmadasa because he brought honour to his alma mater. He was a national volleyball player and he assumed international fame through it. I still remember, across the road at Zahira College in Maradana, there was the police station. There was a volleyball court. He used to play with giants, particularly from the Gampaha area. Today, Sir, I learnt that Gampaha which is one of the foremost areas in the volleyball game is not doing well and they wanted the Government patronage to improve the game in Gampaha and I say it must be given.

Then, Sir, as a student of Zahira College, he imbibed the qualities of great men and great religions.

It was the great nationalist leader and patriot Dr. T.B. Jayah who called Zahira College as "the Radiating Centre of Islamic Thought and Culture." The Hon. Dharmadasa Banda who came under the tutelage of Dr. A.M.A. Azeez, knew this underlying thoughts of Zahira College. He so well integrated himself into the multi-ethnic, multi-culture and multi-religious society - a society called the Sri Lankan nation. He played with Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burghers and Malays. He was brought up as a true national figure at Zahira. He knew and appreciated the religious background and the culture of all the other religions. I would recall here, Sir, - the name of Captain O.M. Muhlar of Zahira College, a famous Cadet Master. Then, the famous brothers B.J.H. Bahar, junior and senior - the first Indoor Cricket School was started in Zahira College and the Hon. Dharmadasa Banda, as a student, looked at these evolutions on a wider perspective. Then, in Cricket, in Rugger, as a volleyball player, he used to appreciate Samad, S.M.A. Razaak, Meerasahibu Abdul Majeed, SSP who was a former Colleague of ours in this Parliament. He had the distinction of leading the first Sri Lankan National Rugger team abroad. There was then the famous Tanker Hameed. Even in cricket, Sir, we had produced Ben Navaratne, who was one of the best wicket-keepers in the whole of Asia. In fact, it was the legendary Don Bradman who called Ben as the best wicket-keeper in the world at that time. Then, there was the fast fiery bowler, Sylvester Dias, who did proud to his alma mater. The man who won the first cricket single-wicket tournament is Gulam Razik. Hard-hitting Navendra was another great cricketer we loved to see in the middle The mercurial M. Shaharwadi, M. Anwer, Rauff Azam, Tuan Chuncheer and Farook Saleem made big names. Even in cadetting and rifle shooting, Sir, the Hon. Dharmadasa Banda had great respect for M. Mahsoom Haniffa, Mahendra and Haris Deen, Wrestlers like Shariff brothers and Ameen, in Soccer - Coomarasamy, in Athletic -

Thangarajah and Boxing - Albert Perera, one of the best known boxers in the country at that time. Sabir Ismail was a renowned Table Tennis player. T.S. Cassim was the best-loved Boarding Master and Cricket Coach.These were the people with whom the Hon. Dharmadasa Banda grew up in the nursery of Zahira College. Therefore, he had a clear view on men and matters when he entered the political arena. Presently, Mr. Fouzul Hameed as Chairman of Board of governors, and Principal Jiffrey, going great guns at Zahira.

I used to visit at that time - the Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara knows it very well - his hometown Bibile, Medagama, Kotabowa and Godigamuwa. The great Kariappers hail from this village. He showed us for the first time - that was when the late Hon. M.A. Bakeer Markar was the Speaker of this Parliament, under his leadership we went there - that in Kotabowa, in his area which is now very well looked after by my very good Friend on my left, the Hon. Gamini Wijith Wijayamuni De Zoysa. Where the Hon. Dharmadasa Banda left, now the Hon. Gamini Wijith Wijayamuni De Zoysa,has taken over and is giving light to that area. There was a Mosque built out of honey and eggs. , ! . , . . . , - The Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena bears witness as we were talking so many times about the Anuradhapura desecration. Now, Sir, the Hon. Dharmadasa Banda had he lived, he would not have allowed these things to happen because he was an embodiment of friendship and religious harmony. What a wonderful man he was! Now, see what is in The Sunday Times of 11th September 2011. Latheef Farook says, I quote:

While 18 websites - eight in Sinhala and 10 in English - have been identified as part of this campaign against Muslims......

That is,

Why this sinister hate-Muslim campaign now?

Sir, There are so many unsavoury stories circulating. I am very happy the Government stepped in - Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence also discussed with Jamiyyathul Ulama, Sri Lanka Muslim Council and other Muslim organizations and promised to take action to settle the issue. But, see this news what they have published in the - These things must be told. Therefore, the Government and the police can take care of itself. "The Sunday Leader" of 18th September, 2011 states, I quote:

"Muslim Shrine in Anuradhapura Destroyed"

The police is just looking at it. These are the types of things that bring down the image of this Government. Today, our President is in the United nations. He is

1027 1028

meeting with 54 - [Interruption.] -Yes, this is about the Hon. R.M. Dharmadasa Banda - .

Today 54 Muslim countries are behind our President and he is meeting them and also other leaders of the world. Now, at a time when tremendous progress is made in the talks in UK by our President, these anti-religious activities are happening; these are rabble-rousers, anti-nationalists at work at home. That is why we are reiterating in this House openly that the IGP must hold an inquiry and bring those culprits to book. I also have the pictures that appeared in the Navamani Weekly" newspaper, here. These things must be said openly so that action could be taken on anti-nationalists and people who conspire to destroy the image of our country and its leader.

There is an election in Colombo, Galle and Matale where there are a large majority of Muslim voters and this is what they do. ? , " , " . . . . .

I should say these few things in English. The Hon. Dharmadasa Banda, the former Minister of Supplementary Crops Development passed away on 23rd October, 2010. He died in a private hospital in Colombo at the age of 72. He was a teacher by profession. He took to politics when his brother, the Hon. R.M. Gunasekera, Member of Parliament was shot dead in 1964 and was elected as an MP in 1965. He was appointed Deputy Minister of Textile Industries in 1977. In 1989, he was the Minister of State for Upcountry Peasantry Rehabilitation. From 1990 to 1994, he was the Minister of Agricultural Development and Research. He was appointed a Senior Adviser to the Ministry of Public Administration from 2002 - 2004 and was again elected to Parliament in 2004. He joined the dissident UNP Group led by the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya to pledge support to His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa and served as Minister of Supplementary Crops Development from 2005 to 2009. Although the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya left, the Hon. Dharmadasa Banda served as the Minister. His son Mr. R.M. Harindra Dharmadasa Bandara is a Provincial Council Member of the Uva Province. The UNP Member of Parliament of Monaragala District, the Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara is his worthy nephew, as I told you.

Therefore I would like to say that the Hon. Dharmadasa Banda was an exemplary leader. He set an example to the past, the present and the future generations. I see the sorry plight of our very good Friend, his nephew. Where is he leading to? I am very

sorry, the Hon. Dharmadasa Banda, his worthy uncle realized the truth - that going with a party or a leader with no vision, no national feeling to serve the country is of no use, he is lagging behind. But, he is a young man. I must appreciate one thing about the Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Imthiaz Bakeer Markar and Rukman Senanayake. These are the people who should have left the party that shabbily treats them. But, they all have sterling political qualities, I believe. They are still remaining to see that they could build up a strong Opposition in this country as visualized by the late Hon. Dharmadasa Banda, and if you think that that will not come to pass, I appeal to the Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara, my young brother, please come over to this side; we will give you the correct position to serve the country well in the future.

The Hon. Dharmadasa Banda was one of the most senior Members who had served a long period in this House. It is the Hon. Maithripala Senanayake who has a record of serving over 40 years followed by, I think, the Hon. Alick Aluvihare, and then the Hon. A.C.S. Hameed and the Hon. Dharmadasa Banda.

In concluding, in our own way - he knew the Islamic rights - he was a devout Buddhist and he served the Buddhists and others in the Vellassa well.

We have travelled with him all over the country. We saw the vast development that had been taking place in Bibile and other areas. His contribution to Buttala Gam Udawa cannot be just forgotten.

Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara, you are very silently and patiently listening to me in this House. Please think of the future. Please think not of yourself but, as your late uncle did, of the country and take the correct decision at the correct time before too long.

May the Hon. Dharmadasa Banda attain Nirvana!

Thank you. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer to take the Chair.

( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Urban Affairs) Mr. Presiding Member, it is with deep sorrow that I rise to speak a few words of my Friend, the late Hon. Dharmadasa Banda, who was a friend of all and enemy of none. He was basically an ideal Sri Lankan and a dynamic personality.

Although he was elected largely by the Sinhala voters, he stood tall enough to cut a place for him among the Muslims and the Tamils and he rendered his service to all of them alike. His familiarity with the Muslims began with his being a student at Zahira College, Colombo, where he studied and played with the Muslim students.

His prime concern was the welfare of the common masses. He played a dynamic role as a Parliamentarian, as a Deputy Minister and as a Cabinet Minister in different governments under the leadership of Presidents J.R. Jayewardene, R. Premadasa as well as under our President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa.

He was one of those 17 Parliamentarians who staged the grand crossover from the UNP to the Government to support the Presidents effort to liberate the country from LTTE terrorism and to unite all the peoples of Sri Lanka as one nation.

The Hon. Dharmadasa Banda was a great son of Sri Lanka and was a silent worker in the political arena. He bravely stood up to the test of time. As a good sportsman, he took part in several sports activities, particularly volleyball. He also captained school volleyball team. As a devout Buddhist, he engaged himself in religious activities and served as the "Basnayaka Nilame of Kataragama Devalaya. Besides, he was also involved in many charitable activities.

He played a key role in improving the quality of life of the people of his electorate and was keen to see a united Sri Lanka.

He passed out as a lawyer and was a gentleman in politics. He was also an ardent advocate of human rights and democratic values. He proved himself as a peoples leader and was a good listener who was always ready to extend assistance to those who came seeking his assistance.

His demise at this critical hour of the development of the country is an irreparable loss to the whole country.

I join the Hon. Members of this House in conveying my deepest condolence to the members of his family.

Thank you.

, CANCELLATION OF NEW SYSTEM FOR REGISTRATION OF LANDS IN NORTHERN AND EASTERN PROVINCES . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Mr. Presiding Member, I thank you very much for giving me permission to move the Adjournment Motion regarding the unsatisfactory arrangement to register ownership of lands in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.

Sir, I move,

The Secretary, Ministry of Lands and Land Development has made announcement requesting people in the Northern Province to apply for a new Deed. According to the News Item appearing in the "Island" newspaper of 09th September, 2011,

Ministry of Lands and Land Development will verify the authentication of each application and that the respective land will be surveyed before a new Deed is issued to the rightful owner.

The Law applicable to registration of ownership in Sri Lanka is the Registration of Documents Ordinance except in areas in which Registration of Title Act has been brought into operation.

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka has pointed out numerous deficiencies in Registration of Title Act and called for amendments to that Act before it is implemented.

The ownership of any land can be registered in accordance with an applicable Law but the Ministry of Lands and Land Development cannot seek to give Deeds and decide on the Title and ownership of lands without having legal provision therefor.

The Grama Sevakas in the Nallur area have started distributing forms and collecting information.

The indication at the bottom of the form is that authentication of Title will be ultimately decided on observation and certification from the Grama Niladharis which arrangement is unsatisfactory.

This Assembly directs the Secretary, Ministry of Lands and Land Development to cancel the announced system of registering lands.

There are people who own lands but do not have deeds. What can they do?

Some owners of the property in Jaffna live outside Jaffna and in foreign countries. What is the arrangement that the Secretary to the Ministry of Lands and Land Development has made for these types of persons to apply and get a new deed? This can be made applicable only to those people who are living and having deeds in the Northern Province. There is another type of people in Jaffna who own lands but they do not have deeds. When a person dies intestate, his properties devolve around his children. They need not have deeds unless, of course, they make a deed of declaration.

Registration of Title Act, No. 21 of 1998 was passed in Parliament under very unfortunate circumstances in spite of opposition from the Bar Association of Sri Lanka and from certain Members of Parliament, both in the Government and the Opposition. The Bar Association of Sri Lanka appointed a committee to study the Registration of Title Bill of which Mr. Nihal B. Pieris, Attorney at Law and Notary Public was the convener. Among the other members who actively participated in the committee were Messrs Nehru Gunathileke, PC, -Chairman, Mahinda Ellapola, K. Sivanathan, Elmo Perera and K. Neelakanthan.

People of Sri Lanka are indeed very unfortunate that a Minister holding a responsible portfolio, who from the observation of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka relating to 35 Clauses, accepting 83 points as requiring amendment, was later instrumental in having the Bill passed in Parliament without any amendment whatsoever and also without considering the observations of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka on the balance 40 Clauses of the Bill.

In fact, it is the view of the members of the committee that existing laws relating to the establishment of title to lands are generally adequate. The Registration of Documents Ordinance is well framed and it has worked satisfactorily over the years. There is no problem as far as the law is concerned.

If the Government intends proceeding with the registration of title to lands, the Government should repeal the Act and introduce a new Bill drafted by the Legal Draftsmans Department, in consultation with a committee comprising of persons from the public and private sector who are well conversant with registration of title.

According to Section 1 of the Registration of Title Act, it shall apply to such Province, Administrative Districts or Administrative Divisions specified and the Ministers Order published in the gazette and in the newspapers. To my knowledge, no area has been gazetted as yet.

1045 1046

2011 23

The Government has prevented people from Mullikulam in Mannar, Keppapulavu in the Mullaitivu District, Mandaithivu and parts of Valigamam North including Myliddy and about 6,000 persons from Sampur from resettling in their own lands.

If the main objective of the Act is to facilitate the establishment of title to lands and to make marketable the title that is defective, the objective can be achieved more efficiently and speedily under a voluntary system of registration of title. Even in Western Australia, registration of title is not compulsory.

As the proposed system of registration of title is irregular, illegal, cumbersome and expensive, I want the Secretary to the Ministry of Lands and Land Development to cancel the proposed system of registration of lands.

Hon. Presiding Member, I know that the Minister of Lands and Land Development is a very good person. He will understand the difficulties and take steps to see that some relief is given.

Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Will an Hon. Member second the Motion? [Pause.] No. Order, please! Standing Order No. 34 (1) states, I quote: "A motion or amendment which by these Standing Orders is required to be seconded, and is not, shall lapse."

Therefore, the Motion has lapsed.

, .

, . . Question put, and agreed to.
