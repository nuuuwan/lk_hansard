CURRENT SITUATION IN JAFFNA PENINSULA [. . 2.14] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Speaker, - ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

, [ ] .

, , [ ] . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I move this Adjournment Motion in the House to discuss a matter that is urgent and of which notice was given with regard to the serious security situation that has arisen particularly in the Jaffna Peninsula and generally, in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. This matter was to be raised by our party Leader on the 4th of January, 2011when Parliament was convened for the first time for the year and a notice of that Motion was submitted the previous day as required by the Standing Orders. However, it was not taken on the 4th of January, 2011. Instead, it was taken up on the 5th of January, 2011 on account of the fact that, as we were told, the translation of that Motion was being delayed. However, curiously on the 4th of January, 2011, the Hon. Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development raised this matter after we had given notice of the Motion for our party Leader to raise it, but quite unusually and breaking with tradition, a Cabinet Minister sought to raise a question of public importance, as he claimed it to be.

777 778

2011 20

Again, breaking with tradition, no answer has been given up to date neither to the question that was raised by the Hon. Minister nor to the issue raised by the Hon. Member for Jaffna as the Leader of the Tamil National Alliance, Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi.

The issue is one of grave significance. When my party Leader raised this matter, he listed out several incidents of violence that had taken place in Jaffna in the months of November and December, 2010. These incidents of violence have largely gone without being investigated and that is the seriousness of the matter. The first issue is the with regard to the number of such incidents that took place in one particular area and that too in an area where there is -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Hon. Member should read the Adjournment Motion first so that this House will know the contents of the Motion because that has been the practice and procedure all along in this House. Could you kindly read the Motion? After that, we can debate.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am coming to that. I will read the Motion. But, before that I am seeking your permission to lay out the background circumstances under which this Motion is being moved and the Hon. Member will do well to be patient and listening.

Sir, there are a series of incidents that have taken place in the area that has the tightest security control in the whole country and no one, I repeat "no one" has been apprehended at the time of the offence in any of these incidents. Stranger still, no one has been apprehended even thereafter except in one or two instances and what is curious is that persons who have been apprehended by the security forces are said to be Members of the EPDP. The Jaffna Security Forces Commander, Major General Mahinda Hathurusinghe is on record saying -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, what is your point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, he is a well-known lawyer in courts, no doubt, but he must learn certain procedures in this House. He must

read the contents of the Motion. That has been done every time after this Member came to this House also.-[Interruption.] So, let him move it.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will move it.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is discussing the Motion. - [Interruption.] You sit down. I am telling him.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, there is no point of Order there. I have not refused to move the Motion. I will move it.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I am asking that from the Hon. Member. He is well-equipped to answer me. He does not want a brief from you in this House. - [Interruption.] No, he does not. Sir, he must move the Motion for us to debate. This has never happened. Let the Hon. Member learn at least now.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees there is no point of Order. I said that I will move it. I am giving the background to my Motion.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Motion must be moved to give the background. How can you have a cart without the horse or a horse without the cart? You will not end up in the journey.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Very well, Sir, I bow to your Ruling. [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You sit down. . . . [ ] . [ ]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I move,

"There is a complete breakdown in the law and order situation in the Northern Province and more particularly in the Jaffna Peninsula resulting in murders, kidnapping, extortion and other crimes.

This has gripped the residents of Jaffna in a fear psychosis since the perpetrators have managed to get away in every one of these instances.

The situation has been further compounded that even a Government Minister from the area has thought the situation so serious that he himself raised this matter in the House on 4th January, 2011, but no reply has been given by the Government to date.

In view of the deteriorating law and order situation in the Jaffna Peninsula, this House resolves that it is imperative on the Prime Minister on behalf of the Government to explain to this House what steps the Government intends to take to stop this grave situation from aggravating further."

Sir, I was on the issue that persons who have been apprehended, according to the Security Forces Commander, are members of the EPDP. One, then understands the indecent hurry of the Hon. Minister to have jumped the gun, so to say, and raised the matter himself in this House before it was duly and properly raised by the Party Leader of TNA. But, that does not cloud the issue. Sir, I will now table* a list of 24 incidents, for record.

There is a similarity, there is a pattern in some of these matters. Bodies were found in wells in a number of incidents. But, in none of those incidents was there a death due to suffocation in the well. Death had been caused previously and in almost all the incidents, the bodies were found with torture marks. A high number of incidents had been reported from Manippai area and also from Vadamarachchi East, particularly from Kudaththanai area where there were at least four incidents reported. One of the later incidents reported from that area was that of an employee of the Postal Department who was at the forefront of the opposition to an illegal sand-mining activity that was being carried out by the EPDP in that area. He has been seen at demonstrations, his pictures have appeared on the web. The EPDP is said to have a foundation called, "Maheswary Foundation". In fact, there is no such foundation because all of us in this House know that its incorporation is still being awaited, and for sand that costs only Rs. 286, this illegal body run by the EPDP charges Rs. 13,600 - a highway robbery - and people of that area have been protesting about this.

In fact, the "Maheswary Foundation" that is awaiting incorporation in this House cannot be incorporated at this point of time because the matter of incorporation of that body is sub judice at this moment. There is a court case pending, CA 647/ 2010, in which the issue of

incorporation of that foundation itself is a subject matter and in due time, we communicated to this House not to proceed further on that matter. In any event, it is that person who led the protest against this robbery by the EPDP on the residents of Jaffna. Armed gunmen invaded his house, shot him dead and got away. There are many curious matters that arise in these transactions and another curious issue is, several EPDP members attended the funeral, put up posters to mourn his death and tried to suggest that this was one of their own members who had died, when the world knows that he is the one who opposed the EPDP. So, one understands the reluctance of the Government to reply to this serious issue that has been raised; one understands the anxiety of the Hon. Minister to want to raise it first, himself. The Government does not have to look too far. The President has spoken a few days ago in Jaffna and stated that he has resolved to do away with all the underworld groups. There are no underworld groups in Jaffna. Anybody who knows about Jaffna knows that there are no underworld groups there. His Excellency the President does not have to look too far to know who these persons are, who illegally carry arms, who are threatening the people, who are driving the people into a fear psychosis, who are extorting money, who are demanding ransom and who are carrying out these murders. That is a group that is very close to the Government and that is why it has become necessary for the Opposition today, to take up this Adjournment Motion to discuss this matter and for the Prime Minister to reply to each of those incidents that I have placed before the House. In fact, when the list of incidents was given notice of, the Hon. Leader of the House stated that within 24 hours he cannot give a reply to that because there are several incidents. But, 24 hours later he came and said since there is a full-day Adjournment Debate that has been agreed upon; that he would answer each of those incidents at that Adjournment Debate. We are awaiting his reply to those incidents that were placed before the House and I have tabled many more that had happened from the 5th of January, 2011 to date. The Government must take responsibility for this state of affairs, particularly, when it was published in the media, quoting the Security Forces Commander himself identifying persons who were involved in at least one or two of these incidents. The most highlighted one is the murder of Mr. Markandu Sivalingam, the Deputy Zonal Director of Education of Valikamam. I have personally spoken to a very close relative of his. This murder has been carried out by a well-trained person, a person who had managed to get into that house through the chimney, which even a person of my dimension cannot go through.

There are footwear marks inside the chimney. He was so well-trained that he had used a micro pistol and even when Mr. Sivalingam had held the murderer down from his hands making him unable to raise his hand to fire, from below his hips, the murderer had fired one shot through Mr. Sivalingam's heart. Such a marksman, at least such a trained athlete, was the person who carried

781 782

* . * . * Produced at end of speech.

[ .. ]

2011 20

out the murder of Mr. Sivalingam. The murderer did not panic thereafter. He spoke to Mr. Sivalingam's daughter, asked for her earrings, showed his gun and walked out of that house without anybody apprehending him.

Now, various theories have been put forward as to the motive for this killing. But, one thing we can say is that the motive for the killing is not robbery; the motive for that killing is no personal feud. There was no personal feud as some people try to suggest, saying that his wife was living in another house. Two houses away his mother, who is elderly and sick, lives alone. Therefore, the daughter-in-law goes and sleeps in that house in the night. That has been sought to be made out as though he was estranged from his wife. That is far from the truth. One cannot find any plausible explanation that is being trotted out.

There is one other suggestion that has been made, that he was opposed to the event the Hon. Prime Minister attended in Jaffna, at which Tamil children were forced to learn the National Anthem to be sung in the Sinhala language in a short time. They were used to singing it in the Tamil language. We do not know the truth or otherwise of that allegation, and I do not want to be as irresponsible as to suggest that that is a reason for the killing. But, there is no other reasonable explanation that can be given either.

Why would the Government want this kind of negative publicity on itself? One cannot understand why the Government is doing this or allowing this to happen. Either the security forces who are said to be in total control of the Peninsula are running amok and the Government has no control over them, or whatever the security forces or persons allied to them do, the Government has no will to put a stop. Then, the Government is also turning a blind eye to the activities of the EPDP, which even the Security Forces Commander of Jaffna conceded is involved in some of these incidents.

I think it is time that the Government moves away from tolerating these kinds of persons to be part of their ranks. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission that the Government appointed has suggested in an interim report, that all those persons who are bearing arms illegally must immediately be disarmed. So, your own Commission concedes, your own Commission says that there are such persons. In Jaffna, it is common knowledge that it is the EPDP which is "that group" that is bearing arms illegally and that is a constituent of this Government. I am making a fervent appeal to the Hon. Prime Minister, who is present here and through him, to His Excellency the President to, at least at this point in time when you say that you want to reconcile with the Tamil people, at least at this point in time when His Excellency the President makes an effort to speak in Tamil, show his good intentions, at least now, move away from these criminal elements that are part of your Government. It is time that you told them, "Enough

is enough; this Government will not tolerate your criminality anymore" and move them out of the Governments fold. If you are serious about Tamil people respecting this Government, if you are serious about Tamil people taking what you say seriously, then it is imperative that you do that. But, the issue that has arisen now at this Adjournment Debate is identifiable instances of criminal activity that have all gone unresolved; none of those have been resolved. Out of the 24 incidents I have placed now before this House, hardly two or three have been even investigated and one or two persons apprehended. This is a very strange issue. In our parts of the country, where we have less than 10 per cent of the security measures that are prevalent in the Jaffna Peninsula, within a couple days, persons are apprehended and investigations are carried out. So, if you allow this state of affairs to continue, then you will be confirming the doubt that all of us have that it is some part of the Government that is responsible for all these matters. Some of these incidents have spilled over into the other parts of the Northern Province as well. Some of my Colleagues, who will speak after me, will detail those as well.

But, for the moment, let me wind up my speech, moving that this House adopts the resolution I have proposed.

Thank you.

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, while seconding the Motion, I wish to state that what we are discussing here is a very serious situation, not merely a

matter of law and order, but also a question as to how we are going to resolve the issues facing the Tamil-speaking people, especially in Jaffna. After the defeat of the LTTE, the Government promised normalcy, resettlement of the people in the North and a political solution. I will not speak on the political solution because that is not the issue that is being debated in this House today. All I want to speak of is about the resettlement in the Vanni, as it has not been done yet. Of the 160,000 people, the Government claims to have resettled - many are living with relatives - with temporary accommodation or living in tents. In Kilinochchi, there is an average of about four suicides a day because of the problems they face. That is an example of what is happening in the Vanni.

But, I will have to deal with the whole issue of law and order in Jaffna. The first sign of normalcy is the restoration of law and order. Before the end of the war, there was a reasonable improvement in the law and order situation in Jaffna. The problem that arose was the attacks by the LTTE, the nature of those terrorist attacks. But, you could say that normalcy was being restored. Then, there was an improvement after the defeat of the LTTE. The only worry was whether some of the LTTE top rungs were using Jaffna to hide. But today, there has been a deterioration in that situation, in fact, a total collapse, which is alarming. My good Friend has tabled this schedule of killings, which he has labelled as, Incidents. These incidents are deaths and if you examine some of them, for example, during the period between 27th December, 2010 and 3rd January 2011 - that is eight days - there have been over 10 killings. For instance, on 29th December, 2010 in Meesalai, Mahendran Selvam also known as Thiruvan Selvam, was killed. Then, on the 30th December 2010, in Atchuveli, there was a killing of Rasaiah Sivakumar. On 31st December, 2010, in Alvai area in Vadamarachchi, there was the abduction of Pushpadevi Yoganathan, a widow with six children. Again on 31st December, 2010, in Karainagar area, there was the dead body of S. Sivaneswarajah. Then, on 1st January 2011, in Urumpirai, a three-wheeler driver, S. Kopinath was reported missing. Then, on 3rd January 2011, in Yogapuram, Mahalingam Amutharasa was also reported missing. Furthermore, my Friend, the Hon. Sumanthiran, also referred to the Deputy Director of Education, Markandu Sivaligam, who was shot dead by unknown gunmen.

This is not counting those dead bodies that were found - one dead body was found in the cemetery in Atchuveli and another was found in a well in Karainagar. So, within a time frame of eight days, there were 10 to 11 killings, where some of the bodies were unidentified. It is an alarming situation. Just imagine what would have happened if this took place in Colombo or Kandy? Then, there would have been an immediate uproar in this House. The Government would have been besieged with these questions by the media much earlier and they would have been forced to take action. But, unfortunately, no

785 786

2011 20

action has been taken with regard to these cases in Jaffna. That is why this Debate is being taken up after much delay; after I made a request. When the Hon. Douglas Devananda, the Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development spoke, we asked for a debate. Why is it that the Government is not taking action on this? This is what we want to know. Are you ignoring Jaffna because these are Tamils? The Tamil media was threatened. They have asked why they were reporting these as these are normal killings that take place. Even in Colombo, you do not get 10 people killed in eight days. Even if you count the road accidents, you do not get that number. These are not normal; these are abnormal. Not only the Tamil media but also the Sinhala media personnel are frightened to report thinking that they would be taken away.

What worries us is that this situation is worse than in January 2009. In January 2009, you could easily say that there was a much better situation in Jaffna as far as law and order was concerned, and as far as the security was concerned. But, today, you cannot say that and the question is why they have not been apprehended. There are over 60,000 security force personnel in the Jaffna Peninsula. That is a large number. We have not got that number even in the City of Colombo. Then, you still have the High Security Zones that have taken a good part of Jaffna; a good part of Valikamam; a part of the Jaffna Town; about 30 per cent of the area. The roadblocks are there. Without debating the questions about these High Security Zones as to whether they should be removed or when they should be removed, there is one matter which many people have pointed out. That is, the movement of people is restricted. You cannot go to 30 per cent of that area. You cannot hide there and the roadblocks also restrict movement. There is a limited space for the people to hide in Jaffna. They cannot move around freely because the checkpoints and the roadblocks are there. There are soldiers sometimes walking down the roads. So, with all these security measures, why is it that the Government has not been able to apprehend them? Then, what does the police say? According to a news item which appeared in The Sunday Times of 09th January, 2011, they have stated, Ladies, dont wear jewellery or venture out alone. What on earth are the police there for? "Dont wear jewellery or venture out alone". Take the list of all these people who have been killed. I do not think Sivakumar was wearing jewellery. I do not think Mahendran Selvam was wearing jewellery. Certainly Pusphadevi Yoganathan who was killed was not wearing jewellery and she did not go out in the night. This is the only response you have got. The people from Jaffna are asking as to what on earth is happening; is this another form of revenge by the Government ? That is why the Government has to reply.

The inability of the Government to control this situation has led to allegations, both locally and internationally, that the Government is behind it. Not

only that, part of the blame has come on to the security forces. The Security Force Commander in Jaffna has said that they have apprehended some people for some incidents and they belong to the EPDP. Now, my good Friends of the TNA have made their allegations against the EPDP. That is also being said. The finger is being pointed in many directions. I read one report, which says it is the rogue elements to the security forces. Some people say this is a combination of retired security personnel and ex-combatants from Jaffna. Another speculation is that ex-Tamil combatants are involved in crime now. Then, the political groups are also there. I am not in a position to say who is doing it. But, I am in a position to say that the Government is not doing anything about it. We think that there should be a a full, impartial and effective mechanism to investigate these killings. All of this points down to a breakdown of law and order.

If you want the people from Jaffna to have trust in the Government, trust in the State, then we should ensure that there is law and order. When the Government has been unable to do so, the task is for Parliament to find out what has happened or how we can restore confidence and credibility in Jaffna. So, when we met in the first week of January, neither side of the House was opposed to my idea that the Speaker leads an All Party Delegation to Jaffna. Now, the LTTE has been defeated, there is normalcy in the country and we go there to find out what is happening. They have no confidence in what the Government has done. Many of us thought that was the best option, let us go there; let us find out. But, now the Government is opposed to it. I do not know why. They are opposing the All Party Delegation, which will really help them at this stage. We are being told to go on our own. We can all go on our own. We can come back and have our reports. Then, the Government will attack some of the parties saying, "We cannot accept these reports". Is that a good thing? But, we all know that when we go as one body, we act in a collective manner. We meet the Government officials, we ask questions, different Members will ask different questions and the Speaker will ask his own questions. Then, we all have to act in a responsible manner. As far as possible, I think the delegation should try to give a unanimous report. But, if they cannot and even if there are dissenting views, what does that matter? That is not a black mark for the Government. That is not a setback for the Government. If an All Party Delegation goes there and reports, and even if there are dissenting views, you can say everything is open and everything is transparent, and this is one way of rebutting some of the charges against the Government. Here is that opportunity. An All Party Delegation visiting Jaffna is the best for Sri Lanka. I am not concerned about what people say about the Government. That is their business. But, we are all getting worried about the bad name that has come to all of us in Sri Lanka and this is a matter of concern. That is why we do not want these incidents in Jaffna to be added on against Sri Lanka, that we refused to go into what was happening. Your approach of ignoring these issues and taking on friendly

787 788

governments and international organizations and abusing anyone critical of you, have not paid dividends. We can see that around. Sri Lanka is isolated and we are being besieged internationally. Why should that happen? Why are we allowing this?

It is difficult now for Ministers to go abroad. Some of you went abroad and when you were in India, there had been some incidents of hooting and slippers thrown. I know what it would have been like. I was in South India once and they surrounded my car and started shouting, Rajapaksa go home, Rajapaksa go home. I did not know what to do. So, I just waited. I got out and asked the police to say what they said in Tamil and found out all that. I said, I am also shouting, 'Rajapaksa go home'. Kindly, let me go home so that I can go home and shout, 'Rajapaksa go home' Now, you cannot do that even. So, at least I went there. I know the situation. Sometimes, even I am escorted out of the airport with security just as much as your Ministers.

When I went there in October 2009, I had the same security that the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, Minister of External Affairs had when he was there. I saw what happened. I was worried about that. If they come and surround the hotel, not only the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris but I will also get surrounded. What had I got to do? We do not like that to happen. Go there and make allegations. We will also make allegations. But, going and having all these demonstrations is not good for the country. Sometimes we are huddled into some room and told, Ah! You are from Sri Lanka and we are kept in a room in the airport. We cannot even go out; not even to go and have a look whether the restaurants have something for us to eat. Then, we were put on to the next plane; we had a transit to the destination. I do not think that has to happen because we must remember that the people in Jaffna want normalcy.

If you look at Hartley College, it has not yet been restored fully.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, you have taken two more minutes. Do you want to continue further?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Yes, a little bit more.

We have eight students from Hartley College who got four 'A's at the A/L. Look at the people who went to Jaffna. They went there to listen to the President. They may not vote for you. But, they want normalcy; they

want to work with you, just as much as, people in the South do. But, have you all reciprocated? You have not. That is the problem.

I am telling you, Do not miss this opportunity. Crack down on what is happening and let us all take this All Party Delegation to Jaffna. I know what Jaffna is like. I was there in 1975 with the late Mr. J.R. Jayewardene, Leader of the Opposition. They were cutting their veins and putting blood. I saw how they greeted Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike when her civic rights was taken away. I saw how they voted for Mr. Hector Kobbekaduwa, the Presidential candidate. It is a form of protest. Now, you can end that protest by coming to some form of an arrangement, agreement or settlement; it is good. Start by resettling the people in Jaffna and clearing up the High Security Zones. Basically, human rights is not something to shout at. This is not something foreign; this is not something that came from the West.

If you look at the great Emperors inscription, the famous Ashokan Pillars, they state sanctity of life, equality of persons and respect of others' views. I mean, those are the basics of human rights. From where did the Emperor Ashoka get this? From the teachings of Gauthama, the Blessed one. We are shouting here against human rights. Why? Just as much as Emperor Ashoka had reconciliation after the war in Kalinga, all we have to do is to start that process. Otherwise, we certainly will not be able to win the confidence of the people of Jaffna. The approach you are following has failed.

I am sorry that the Government Members are not here. They should come and take part and make sensible speeches. I mean, this is an important Debate. Not a single Member is here. There are only two Ministers in the front, the Hon. Prime Minister and another Minister. I know what the Minister's view is and I do not think we differ very much on that issue. But, where are the others who should debate on this?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I am also here. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) After all, this is a tradition. Let us take this up and bring it to an end. But, to do that, first let us take action through the All Party Delegation. It is up to the Government. The time for reconciliation is available but it is little. Make use of it, otherwise you are going to have trouble.

Thank you.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, I was listening to the Hon. Prime Minister's speech. He is a responsible Leader of this country. What I conceived from his speech was that it looks like he was endorsing the incidents and the killings. That is what I conceived in my mind. We have not added pepper or salt here. We gave the facts, the incidents. Although 16 incidents were given, not a single incident was replied to in a responsible manner; nothing. We have not received any constructive replies. It is very sad that the Hon. Prime Minister has given an example of a hair of an elephant. So, according to him, these incidents are negligible. There is a price given for life - a Jaffna Tamil mans life. There is a price given to it. If the Government applies this policy, I do not think that they can expect any national amity or reconciliation in this country. The way the Hon. Prime Minister replied was very disheartening. We expected a reply at least to console the hearts and minds of the people of the North. He said that there are incidents but compared them with Iraq and Iran, it is immaterial. This is a smaller country. Then, why can you not compare it with the percentage of killings? It is millions and millions. I can see that the House is virtually empty - the Opposition. Nobody seems to be interested. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) No. The Government Benches are almost empty. . ( . (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Yes. It is the Government Benches. I think the Hon. Sumanthiran also pointed out in this House itself there are criminals. I should bring first and foremost to everybodys knowledge, an advertisement placed by the EPDP saying that the Maheswary Foundation is approved and they have given a wrong picture to the Tamil community in the North. Collecting money by an illegal organization is, "extortion". If they say that the LTTE has extorted, it is the same thing that EPDP has also done. There is no difference. The leader of this Organization, the Maheswary Foundation, is the Hon. Minister, Douglas Devananda. I have a letterhead with me which proves that. Please note it.

Today, in the incident that has occurred in Kudathanai sand mining, the boy who was killed was leading the procession. There were photographs that appeared all over the websites, newspapers, etc. I think the Government should appoint a commission to inquire into this particular incident. They will definitely get further results and facts. It is definitely beyond mining of sand or selling. If they appoint a proper auditor to audit the money that is involved, definitely there are witnesses, I

801 802

[ ]

2011 20

know. But, the people are reluctant because they are still holding guns and the fear psychosis is there. They have threatened the people not to speak and come forward. In fact, they have organized two busloads of people to protest against the newspaper called Udayan, to stop them from divulging any facts. But, as usual, the newspaper published the article and also about the procession, and that we gave encouragement to stop the illegal sand mining in that area.

I think very recently, His Excellency the President had visited the Hon. Douglas Devanandas house at Layards Road. We saw the photographs. It is very sad. He is well aware of the incidents and the things done by the EPDP. I was shocked when I saw the photographs and thought to myself, Is the President visiting him? So, to whom shall we complain about these incidents?" Now, I would like to speak a few words in Tamil.

All the international messages sent during Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas time and also during President Mahinda Rajapaksas time, which appear in the WikiLeaks website, say that the Government has paramilitary groups; . , , . . If you look at the plight of the people in Jaffna, for 30 years, they went through very difficult times. First, there were Tamil terrorist groups. Then, the LTTE took control. Thereafter, the Sri Lanka Army went there; the Indian Army went there. For 30 years, they have been living through hell. So, I think, Sir, you will agree that they deserve a break to live peacefully as law-abiding citizens.

, LLRC . , 600 - 600 policemen - LLRC . , 600 . . , 600 . . ? - . . . We all thought that after the conclusion of the war, there will be a new journey. But, it is obvious that the Government does not want to make the North and the East a part of Sri Lanka. They want to keep it separate; they want to keep it under pressure and they want to do things their own way.

Then, Sir, I remember, that in the last Parliament, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, who was the Minister in charge of human rights, said that he will bring the Assistance and Protection to Victims of Crime and Witnesses Bill to Parliament so that witnesses get protection. Where is that Bill? I know that thousands of witnesses were prevented from going before the LLRC. Where is that Assistance and Protection to Victims of Crime and Witnesses Bill? I remember that in 1989,

813 814

2011 20

when we entered Parliament, it was the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, now the President, who showed us the way to the Human Rights Commission. Actually in 1989, when we came to Parliament, we did not know much about the Human Rights Commission; we had only heard of it. But, it was the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa who spoke of the Human Rights Commission, its importance and value. Today, when we speak of human rights, the Government Members insult us and say that we are supporting terrorist groups.

Sir, I say that compensation should be paid to the people in the North and the East for what they have suffered. Thousands of people have died. We do not know who is alive and who is dead. That is why we have been asking to release the names of the people who are in custody. From the reports you have, there are 9,000 people in custody. Where are the names? No names are given.

As I told you, the Government wasted nearly two years without getting down to solve the problem politically through devolution. They celebrated the war victory for nearly two years and again, the President has appointed a committee for the TNA to talk to, but looking at the mmbers in the committee, it is obvious that the talks would not progress because if the Government genuinely wants to devolve power and give a political solution, they must appoint people who have a desire to devolve power. When you appoint hardliners to this type of committee, it becomes a joke.

Earlier, he appointed some other committee in 2005. Why are you trying to reinvent the wheel? In the year 2005, a Committee was appointed with all the experts acceptable and they put out a report. You know that. Even the UNP said, We are prepared to accept the report of the Experts' Panel So, why do you want to reinvent the wheel? All these things have been discussed for nearly 50 years. President Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed an Experts' Panel and the report of that Panel was accepted by the Tamils as well as the UNP. So, everything is on the table; there is nothing to discuss. You have to decide what we should give and what we should take. It is that simple. Therefore, I appeal to the Government and the Leader of the House not to waste time by calling everyone for discussions.

Now, they call us for discussions to reform the Electoral Law. We said, We will support. After we said we will support, what happened? They said, We are not going to do it. Then, the President invited us for talks and said, I am going to create a post of Executive Prime Minister". . . -This is a waste of time. He was marking time to get a two-thirds majority and Members of Parliament to cross over. , - the whole of Sri Lanka

knows - , just marking time. . . . .

The present situation in Jaffna has been aptly described in a news item which appeared in the "Daily Mirror'' of 1st January, 2011 under the heading "Residents claim killings on the rise in Jaffna". It states, I quote:

" Residents of the area pointed out that on Dec. 11 an unidentified armed gang had reportedly entered the house of a Hindu priest

and shot him and his two children."

"In another incident, Vadikamam Zonal Director of Education, Makandu Sivalingam, had been shot dead at his house in Urampirai

last Sunday (26), in the presence of his 14 year old daughter. In a separate incident, a businessman was abducted and was later

hacked to death ...."

"They also claimed that abductions and robberies were increasing and accused the police of not taking any steps to arrest any of the

suspects and bring them before court."

Sir, The Sunday Times of 9th January, 2011 has given a list of criminal activities and I would like to mention them for your information. Two women were sexually harassed in Vadamarachchi. The body of a mentally affected person was found on the Polikandhi Beach. The body of a sexually molested 19-year old girl, Ariyanayagam Thulasi of Puloli South, Point Pedro, was found in an abandoned well. A young woman was abducted opposite the Udupiddy MPCS by two motorcyclists. Her whereabouts are still not known. A Hindu Priest of Nithyananda Sharma Temple and his two sons were fired upon by unknown persons opposite the Sanganai Muruhamoorthy Temple. The Police attacked some jewellers in Jaffna based on false information given

by a thief in Jaffna. Markandu Sivalingam, Zonal Director of Education, was shot and killed at his home at Valikamam. It is reported that he opposed the singing of the National Anthem in Sinhala on the National Defence Day. A 57-year old woman was stabbed and robbed of her jewellery by unidentified gunmen who entered her house at night in Point Pedro. Thirty-year old Shanmuganathan Vigneswary who was recently released from a Human Rights Rehabilitation Camp was abducted at Urumpirai. On the same day, 42-year old Rasiah Chandrasiri who was reported missing was discovered hanged three days later. In Jaffna, Yoganathan Pushpa Devi, a mother of six, was abducted at gunpoint by persons who arrived in a white van. On the same day, 28-year old Thevarajah Ketheeswaran of Kudathanai in Vadamaradchchi was shot and killed by armed men. S. Gobinath, an auto driver in Urumpirai, was abducted. On the same day, a woman was stabbed and her jewellery was robbed at Manipay. Army arrested an EPDP member in Jaffna town involved in robberies and handed him over to the Jaffna Police.

According to "Thinakkural" of 9th January, 2011, five persons, namely, Navaratnam, Thillainathan, Kamal, Jaleez and an auto driver, Dharma were abducted at Mannar on 6th January, 2011 between 3.00 p.m to 8.30 p.m. They were taken to Colombo and after investigations, they were brought back and released at the Mannar Police Station. When an army officer or police officer goes to another area to arrest a person, he must inform the releavent police station. But, it was not done. So, in this case, it is quite clear that this was done by the forces.

The Senior Police Officers in Jaffna seem to think that these incidents were the result of personal grievances. I do not think so. Who murdered the Brahmin Priest Nithiyananda Sarma at Chankanai and the Zonal Director of Education, Markandu Sivalingam at Urumpirai?

The Brahmin Priest and his two sons were shot at by two militants, with guns given to them by two military officers. In the case of Mr. Sivalingam, Zonal Director of Education, two armed motorists came, jumped over the wall, shot him dead and snatched the earrings of his daughter.

Definitely, these murders are not due to any personal grievances. In the case of Mr. Sivalingam, it seems that he had objected to the National Anthem being sung in Sinhala and insisted that it should be sung in Tamil, in the result, he was shot dead.

One thing that was common in almost all these criminal activities is that the culprits were armed. Robberies take place almost daily in Jaffna. There are 50,000 army personnel deployed in the North. What are the police and the army doing? Let the army and police,

841 842

2011 20

in joint operation, search all the houses and remove the guns. Let the army also recover all the guns given to the militants earlier.

I want the army and the police to take some positive action to bring down the crime rate and arrest the culprits. I wonder whether the persons who come in white vans have any connection with the army and the police, because those vehicles are not halted at checkpoints by the army and the police for examination, while buses are stopped and people are checked.

Sir, I regret that I had to make my speech to the almost-empty Government Benches.

Thank you. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. Before he starts, the Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will take the Chair.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I should preface my speech by declaring that before the match was started the Opposition withdrew the Motion and they have lost the match. They were bowling wides, no-balls and bouncers, crediting more and more runs to the Governments batsmen. - [Interruption.] Yes, we are hitting sixes against your no-balls and wides.

So much so, Sir, even the Hon. Sumanthiran who is a lawyer was shadow-boxing in this House when he started and I had to put him on the correct track.

Sir, it is in the North that this Government is spending more money for various development than anywhere else in this country. That fact must be known to the entire international community. Some people from here carry the message that Tamils are being killed here. Who says that? Some of our so-called Sinhalese leaders tell that. They are the most unpatriotic people in this country. The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan who is before me is a gentleman who comes from a noble family in the North, the

843 844

Ramanadan family. I am asking you: "Will you like to see anymore bloodshed in this country in the future?" No. The President has categorically stated that he will not allow any Pathala Lokaya either in Jaffna, Hambantota, Batticaloa, Colombo or even in Beliatta. Let us all unite and protect our diverse traditions. Terrorism is of the past. Where did His Excellency the President go and how did he go? Of course, everybody goes to Jaffna by chopper. He too went there by chopper and thereafter came to the venue in a motorcade and participated in that holy festival. Sir, the "Daily News" of 18th January, 2011, captioning a photograph states, I quote:

Religious ceremony

President Mahinda Rajapaksa participating in the Thai Pongal celebrations at the Duraiappa Stadium in Jaffna yesterday.

Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs Deputy Minister M.K.D.S. Gunawardena and Northern Province Governor Maj. Gen.

G.A. Chandrasiri are also in the picture.

It is an irony of fate that Mr. Alfred Duraiappa, whose name is given to this esplanade, was murdered in the North. By whom? By the terrorists.

( ) (An Hon. Member) By the LTTE. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the other day, we, with Mr. Speaker, went to Pakistan on a Parliamentary goodwill mission. There, the President, Asif Ali Zardari, the Prime Minister, Yusuf Reza Gailani, all the Governors including the Governor of Sind and Punjab, all the Senate Presidents and the Chief Ministers said in one voice: We have to learn a lesson from Sri Lanka as to how you quelled the worst terrorism in your country which was ravaging the country for 30 years. It is not only that. They asked as to how the country is taking off in its economic stride. They said, You have a 99.9 per cent literacy rate in your country. We have not been credited that much. We want mathematics teachers from you. How did you reach that high level? I said, Sir, it is through the 'Mahinda Chintana' - the Election Manifesto. It is not only a mere election manifesto but it is also a 'Mahinda philosophy'. I also told them that it does not remain only a philosophy but it is being put into real practice. The Deputy Secretary-General of Parliament, Mr. Dhammika

Dasanayake, the Hon. (Ms.) Kamala Ranathunga and the Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswaran were all with us there. You can ask them. So, everywhere the President goes, it is very evident that this is the opinion of people in other countries.

There is another matter that I want to state before the House. They want Sanath Jayasuriya, the crackerjack - masterblaster -cricketer, to come and play there. Because there is peace in the country, he hits sixes all over. They said, Come and play in Pakistan. The names of Sanath Jayasuriya, Muttiah Muralitharan, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and T.M. Dilshan are mentioned in every household in Pakistan. So, this is the opinion of the leaders and people of Pakistan. They say that the Tamil people in Jaffna have been hit and attacked. The first victim after the Duraiappah murder was the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, our respected Leader of the House. When he went to Jaffna, they attacked him. We all know what happened to him on that occasion. It was a real assault but what did he say? I will not be deterred by these terrorists. I will come over and over again to Jaffna to develop Jaffna. That is the attitude of a Sinhalese Leader and that is also the attitude of the National Leader, Mahinda Rajapaksa. Do you want to grasp that hand of friendship and economic development or do you want bloodshed? If you want real development, say so.

The Hon. R. Sampanthan is a very senior Member of this House, and I have a lot of respect for him. The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah knows that. He is now in the Madras Hospital. We pray in this House for his speedy recovery. He could throw in more wisdom to our national politics.

Look at what is stated in the "Thinakural" newspaper -

"" ! ", " . . "" . Sir, this is a very panoramic picture. Mr. Sudath de Silva, the young photographer who took this, deserves an international award for the best photograph in the world. That is the opinion of several pressmen in this country. , mafia . , . " , " . ! .

A boat service has been started by this Government between Talaimannar and Tuticorin, Rameswaram and other places in South India. This may be unbelievable, perhaps the world cannot believe this. But, this is a reality. These are miracles. This is the "Mahinda Chintana" miracle that is taking place in the North. I will develop the South and at the same time, I will also develop the North equally", the President says boldly to the whole world.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Give me one more minute, Sir.

The other day, what were they telling us when we went to India? "We were free, nobody harassed us". People might harass the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and his ilk. But, we went to Keelakkarai for Sadak Hadjiar's and Rifal Hadjiars wedding houses there. The Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Hon. Basheer Segu Dawood, the Senior Minister, Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie, the Hon. Faizal Cassim, the popular writer called Mana Mackeen and business magnate, M.H.M. Fazal - we all went there. We were welcomed and they all said in unison, We wanted to come to Sri Lanka. They are listening, morning and evening, to programmes that are aired by the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, not only to Muslim programmes, but even to music and other programmes daily, Sir.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Now, please wind up. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Lastly, I would say, please grasp the hand of friendship of the President. He is the man, the world - Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Japan and all the countries - want. If we lose this opportunity, I would say in this House, there would not be another person to solve all our urgent problems. Let us get together and live happily in future in our motherland.

Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you. The next speaker is the Hon. D.M. Swaminathan. You have seven minutes. [. . 5.57] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today we have been having a lengthy discussion and a Debate on the Motion that was moved by the Hon. Sumanthiran and seconded by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. Up to now, there has been no positive reply by the Government Benches regarding the issues that were raised.

In fact, at the last Session of Parliament, I too raised about the atrocities and killings that had taken place in Jaffna. We are not, at this stage, blaming any Government officers, the army, the EPDP or anyone. But, there should be some sort of an independent body. There is the army; there is the police. There is a full force of the army; there is a full force of the police in the Northern Province. Up to now, on any of these killings that had taken place within the last one and half months, not one single individual has been brought to book. No one has been produced in court and no one knows who are doing these killings. That is the only question we raise. Our debate is based on that. Who was behind these killings that took place in the Northern Province? We are talking about development; we are talking about His Excellency the President, but we are not casting aspersions on anyone. But, it is the duty of the Government to safeguard the interests of the people of the Jaffna Province. They should live happily. They suffered during the war for the last 30 years. You know the backward situation in Jaffna. I have spoken a number of times on that issue here. Education is in chaos; the entire economy is in chaos; the cost of living is so high. Today, an Hon. Member of Parliament stated that sand is being sold at Rs. 13,000 a cube in Jaffna, which is much cheaper than the price sold in Anuradhapura or in some other part of Colombo. That is not the issue. Why should even the selling of sand in Jaffna be given to an individual organization? Why does the Government not take it over and give it to the public at large? It does not matter who does it and at what the price the Government is going to sell it.

There are issues that the Government should specify on - the educational problem, the economic problem, the food problem and also the political problem that we are faced with today. There is no point in getting a political solution to the problem unless we know what our rights are and why a man in the Jaffna Peninsula cannot live in peace. An Hon. Member said that a person came all the way down a chimney to kill another. There were some people who just walked into a house, killed a young lady

and robbed their jewellery. So, what are the armed forces doing? What is the police doing? Today the Debate is only concentrated on that. I am very sorry to say in this House that up to now, none of the Hon. Members of the Government have specifically said what the causes are of this issue in Jaffna. The entire Debate is based on that. But, what is the reply that we have received up to now? Neither did the Hon. Prime Minister reply nor did a single Member of the Government Benches reply to us. So, Sir, it is my earnest request that at least in future, the Government should look into this matter very seriously because if this position continues, it would be even similar to the situation that arose a few years ago. We all know the causes of terrorism that arose a few years ago. There were many reasons for it: standardization of education, the economy of the country, the fact that the young people were unable to get jobs in the Government Service and many other issues were the major factors that contributed to the terrorist movement in this country. Are we trying to reopen that chapter again? I am repeatedly saying, it is the duty of the present Government, whether it is done by an armed group or by ex-officers of any organization or whether it is done by any politician, it is the duty of the Government to see that they are brought to book. But, Sir, unfortunately, that has not been done. Today, there is no evidence whatsoever. In fact, there was a Member who said that none of the United National Party Members had gone to the Eastern Province. That is totally incorrect. The Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, Mr. Daya Gamage, Mrs. Gamage, Mr. Sasidharan and all of us have sent food items to the Eastern Province in a small way.[Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) When are you going to Jaffna? - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Yes, Sir, on Tuesday we are going to Jaffna. Do you like to join me? Certainly you could join me. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You are showing some improvement somewhere. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I visit Jaffna once in two months, minimum. Hon. Azwer, if you want to join me, you can join me when I go there on Tuesday. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) If you want, you can come - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Certainly I will do that; no problem. The issue is not about the person who is going to Jaffna or the Eastern Province or the Northern Province. As far as Jaffna is concerned, I have been known in Jaffna more than anyone else, even before Hon. Azwer was known in Jaffna. I have got more roots in Jaffna than anyone of you. [Interruption.] I do not want to get into these controversies. [Interruption.] You are trying to sideline the issue. This is what the Government Benchers are trying to do. When a speaker speaks, you try to sideline and talk on unnecessary issues. This is not the Parliament we are asking for. We are asking for the rights of the Tamils of the Northern Province to be protected by the Government. We are not concerned whether you have gone to Jaffna or whether you have gone to the Eastern Province. [Interruption.] That is not the issue here. [Interruption] That is not the issue. The issue is to safeguard the rights of the Tamils of the Northern Province. The majority of the citizens of this country, 80 to 90 per cent are - ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Swaminathan, please wind up now.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) If they cannot live in peace, then it is the duty of the Government to look after them. These unnecessary remarks and aspersions are made by all of you just to deviate from the major structure of the issue. You must be liable for that; you must be in a position to ask for it; you must be in a position to reply. It is not a question of asking. That is not the point.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Now wind up, please. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Today, we have discussed this problem totally. But, up to now there is not a single reply to the issues raised in this Adjournment Motion that has been moved and seconded by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. We need a reply and we earnestly request the Government to make its reply in this House, as early as possible.

Thank you.

"Not a single individual has been brought to court". I will demonstrate to you, Hon. Swaminathan, how many people were brought before the law enforcing authorities in Jaffna during the last few weeks. So, you have to withdraw that. That shows the audacity and the malice in which you are speaking. You are telling this to the international community just to show that the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government is violating human rights and ill-treating the people of Jaffna. This is the picture the TNA and most people are trying to show. That is the agenda of the Tamil diaspora; that is the agenda of the defeated LTTE. We will not get caught to that agenda, Sir.

Sir, this lady was in conversation with a person in a very cordial manner. That is the evidence. So, you can imagine the inference one can draw. This is not an abduction; maybe it is an abduction in a different form. She has got on to the bicycle of that person. ... ( )

( ... - , ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne - Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs) Motorcycle. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Yes, motorcycle. So, they had been going for a ride. Then, you say the Government is not taking action; the army is not taking action. If they stop the couple and ask, "Where are you going?", you will come and say, "Oh! a couple cannot ride on a motorcycle in Jaffna; the Army is harassing them". So, when we allow them free movement also, you are accusing the Government. What is the meaning of this? This is the work of the Tamil diaspora. They want some incidents to be taken to international forums. We know that. Do you know what she has told to the police? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) There was no abduction. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) She was riding on a bicycle. . . . For you, it is an abduction; for the Tamil diaspora, it is abduction; for the TNA, it is abduction. So, this is how you distort facts. Therefore, there is no credibility in the information you have provided to this august Assembly. So, this is the nature of the work you are doing and you are undermining the credibility of this Government by all these false representations.

There have been incidents like that. So, what have we done? The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan said that not a single individual has been brought before courts. Is that true? Hon. D.M. Swaminathan, why are you diabolically lying to this august Assembly?

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, you need to wind up your speech in two minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Sir, I have a lot of other things to say. I will table* all these documents. * .

Sir, we have very plausible answers for each and every incident that they have raised where the Government, the police and the armed forces have taken action. Therefore, this Government has not failed in its duty of protecting the innocent Tamil people in Jaffna. I must say, that we are thankful to you for bringing in this Adjournment Motion, because that gave us an opportunity to demonstrate how the defeated LTTE is trying to discredit the Government underhand and underground. But, that effort has failed because we have concrete facts and cogent evidence to prove that all the issues raised by the Hon. Members of the Opposition are false.

Thank you very much, Sir.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) You cannot raise a point of Order now. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please go to your seat. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) It is a wrong statement. My position is, Sir, if the Government had given us all these information, we would not have made any statement to that extent.

asked the Minister of Mass Media and Information:

(a) Is he aware that an article in the Daily Mirror of July 29th 2010 engages in denigratory stereotyping of Non-Governmental Organizations agitating for changes in laws relating to gender and sexuality?

(b) Will he accept that the references in that article to a few diplomats who are amongst those trying to create an impression that heterosexuality is an outdated, obsolete disposition are intended to raise the spectre of foreign influence in an area in which changes have in any case been recommended by the wholly national Sri Lankan Law Commission?

(c) Will he take steps-

(i) to prevent such examples of media distortion, designed to create prejudices against foreigners and diplomats whilst diverting attention from issues that should be debated and discussed objectively; and

(ii) to advise those responsible for such newspapers that prejudice and hate speech should not be propagated and that freedom of speech must be accompanied by responsibility?
