This matter was to be raised by our party Leader on the 4th of January, 2011when Parliament was convened for the first time for the year and a notice of that Motion was submitted the previous day as required by the Standing Orders. However, it was not taken on the 4th of January, 2011. Instead, it was taken up on the 5th of January, 2011 on account of the fact that, as we were told, the translation of that Motion was being delayed. However, curiously on the 4th of January, 2011, the Hon. Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development raised this matter after we had given notice of the Motion for our party Leader to raise it, but quite unusually and breaking with tradition, a Cabinet Minister sought to raise a question of public importance, as he claimed it to be.",

A high number of incidents had been reported from Manippai area and also from Vadamarachchi East, particularly from Kudaththanai area where there were at least four incidents reported. One of the later incidents reported from that area was that of an employee of the Postal Department who was at the forefront of the opposition to an illegal sand-mining activity that was being carried out by the EPDP in that area. He has been seen at demonstrations, his pictures have appeared on the web. The EPDP is said to have a foundation called, \"Maheswary Foundation\". In fact, there is no such foundation because all of us in this House know that its incorporation is still being awaited, and for sand that costs only Rs. 286, this illegal body run by the EPDP charges Rs. 13,600 - a highway robbery - and people of that area have been protesting about this.",

In any event, it is that person who led the protest against this robbery by the EPDP on the residents of Jaffna. Armed gunmen invaded his house, shot him dead and got away. There are many curious matters that arise in these transactions and another curious issue is, several EPDP members attended the funeral, put up posters to mourn his death and tried to suggest that this was one of their own members who had died, when the world knows that he is the one who opposed the EPDP. So, one understands the reluctance of the Government to reply to this serious issue that has been raised; one understands the anxiety of the Hon. Minister to want to raise it first, himself. The Government does not have to look too far. The President has spoken a few days ago in Jaffna and stated that he has resolved to do away with all the underworld groups. There are no underworld groups in Jaffna. Anybody who knows about Jaffna knows that there are no underworld groups there. His Excellency the President does not have to look too far to know who these persons are, who illegally carry arms, who are threatening the people, who are driving the people into a fear psychosis, who are extorting money, who are demanding ransom and who are carrying out these murders. That is a group that is very close to the Government and that is why it has become necessary for the Opposition today, to take up this Adjournment Motion to discuss this matter and for the Prime Minister to reply to each of those incidents that I have placed before the House. In fact, when the list of incidents was given notice of, the Hon. Leader of the House stated that within 24 hours he cannot give a reply to that because there are several incidents. But, 24 hours later he came and said since there is a full-day Adjournment Debate that has been agreed upon; that he would answer each of those incidents at that Adjournment Debate. We are awaiting his reply to those incidents that were placed before the House and I have tabled many more that had happened from the 5th of January, 2011 to date. The Government must take responsibility for this state of affairs, particularly, when it was published in the media, quoting the Security Forces Commander himself identifying persons who were involved in at least one or two of these incidents. The most highlighted one is the murder of Mr. Markandu Sivalingam, the Deputy Zonal Director of Education of Valikamam. I have personally spoken to a very close relative of his. This murder has been carried out by a well-trained person, a person who had managed to get into that house through the chimney, which even a person of my dimension cannot go through.",

There was no personal feud as some people try to suggest, saying that his wife was living in another house. Two houses away his mother, who is elderly and sick, lives alone. Therefore, the daughter-in-law goes and sleeps in that house in the night. That has been sought to be made out as though he was estranged from his wife. That is far from the truth.

Prime Minister, who is present here and through him, to His Excellency the President to, at least at this point in time when you say that you want to reconcile with the Tamil people, at least at this point in time when His Excellency the President makes an effort to speak in Tamil, show his good intentions, at least now, move away from these criminal elements that are part of your Government.

Out of the 24 incidents I have placed now before this House, hardly two or three have been even investigated and one or two persons apprehended. This is a very strange issue. In our parts of the country, where we have less than 10 per cent of the security measures that are prevalent in the Jaffna Peninsula, within a couple days, persons are apprehended and investigations are carried out. So, if you allow this state of affairs to continue, then you will be confirming the doubt that all of us have that it is some part of the Government that is responsible for all these matters. Some of these incidents have spilled over into the other parts of the Northern Province as well. Some of my Colleagues, who will speak after me, will detail those as well.",

All I want to speak of is about the resettlement in the Vanni, as it has not been done yet. Of the 160,000 people, the Government claims to have resettled - many are living with relatives - with temporary accommodation or living in tents.

Before the end of the war, there was a reasonable improvement in the law and order situation in Jaffna. The problem that arose was the attacks by the LTTE, the nature of those terrorist attacks. But, you could say that normalcy was being restored. Then, there was an improvement after the defeat of the LTTE. The only worry was whether some of the LTTE top rungs were using Jaffna to hide. But today, there has been a deterioration in that situation, in fact, a total collapse, which is alarming. My good Friend has tabled this schedule of killings, which he has labelled as, Incidents. These incidents are deaths and if you examine some of them, for example, during the period between 27th December, 2010 and 3rd January 2011 - that is eight days - there have been over 10 killings. For instance, on 29th December, 2010 in Meesalai, Mahendran Selvam also known as Thiruvan Selvam, was killed. Then, on the 30th December 2010, in Atchuveli, there was a killing of Rasaiah Sivakumar. On 31st December, 2010, in Alvai area in Vadamarachchi, there was the abduction of Pushpadevi Yoganathan, a widow with six children. Again on 31st December, 2010, in Karainagar area, there was the dead body of S. Sivaneswarajah. Then, on 1st January 2011, in Urumpirai, a three-wheeler driver, S. Kopinath was reported missing. Then, on 3rd January 2011, in Yogapuram, Mahalingam Amutharasa was also reported missing. Furthermore, my Friend, the Hon. Sumanthiran, also referred to the Deputy Director of Education, Markandu Sivaligam, who was shot dead by unknown gunmen.",

In January 2009, you could easily say that there was a much better situation in Jaffna as far as law and order was concerned, and as far as the security was concerned. But, today, you cannot say that and the question is why they have not been apprehended. There are over 60,000 security force personnel in the Jaffna Peninsula. That is a large number. We have not got that number even in the City of Colombo. Then, you still have the High Security Zones that have taken a good part of Jaffna; a good part of Valikamam; a part of the Jaffna Town; about 30 per cent of the area. The roadblocks are there. Without debating the questions about these High Security Zones as to whether they should be removed or when they should be removed, there is one matter which many people have pointed out. That is, the movement of people is restricted. You cannot go to 30 per cent of that area. You cannot hide there and the roadblocks also restrict movement. There is a limited space for the people to hide in Jaffna. They cannot move around freely because the checkpoints and the roadblocks are there. There are soldiers sometimes walking down the roads. So, with all these security measures, why is it that the Government has not been able to apprehend them? Then, what does the police say? According to a news item which appeared in The Sunday Times of 09th January, 2011, they have stated, Ladies, dont wear jewellery or venture out alone. What on earth are the police there for? \"Dont wear jewellery or venture out alone\". Take the list of all these people who have been killed. I do not think Sivakumar was wearing jewellery. I do not think Mahendran Selvam was wearing jewellery. Certainly Pusphadevi Yoganathan who was killed was not wearing jewellery and she did not go out in the night. This is the only response you have got. The people from Jaffna are asking as to what on earth is happening; is this another form of revenge by the Government ?

So, when we met in the first week of January, neither side of the House was opposed to my idea that the Speaker leads an All Party Delegation to Jaffna. Now, the LTTE has been defeated, there is normalcy in the country and we go there to find out what is happening. They have no confidence in what the Government has done. Many of us thought that was the best option, let us go there; let us find out. But, now the Government is opposed to it. I do not know why. They are opposing the All Party Delegation, which will really help them at this stage. We are being told to go on our own. We can all go on our own. We can come back and have our reports. Then, the Government will attack some of the parties saying, \"We cannot accept these reports\". Is that a good thing? But, we all know that when we go as one body, we act in a collective manner. We meet the Government officials, we ask questions, different Members will ask different questions and the Speaker will ask his own questions. Then, we all have to act in a responsible manner. As far as possible, I think the delegation should try to give a unanimous report. But, if they cannot and even if there are dissenting views, what does that matter? That is not a black mark for the Government. That is not a setback for the Government. If an All Party Delegation goes there and reports, and even if there are dissenting views, you can say everything is open and everything is transparent, and this is one way of rebutting some of the charges against the Government. Here is that opportunity. An All Party Delegation visiting Jaffna is the best for Sri Lanka. I am not concerned about what people say about the Government. That is their business. But, we are all getting worried about the bad name that has come to all of us in Sri Lanka and this is a matter of concern. That is why we do not want these incidents in Jaffna to be added on against Sri Lanka, that we refused to go into what was happening. Your approach of ignoring these issues and taking on friendly",

I saw how they greeted Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike when her civic rights was taken away. I saw how they voted for Mr. Hector Kobbekaduwa, the Presidential candidate. It is a form of protest. Now, you can end that protest by coming to some form of an arrangement, agreement or settlement; it is good. Start by resettling the people in Jaffna and clearing up the High Security Zones.

    "text": ". ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, I was listening to the Hon. Prime Minister's speech. He is a responsible Leader of this country. What I conceived from his speech was that it looks like he was endorsing the incidents and the killings. That is what I conceived in my mind. We have not added pepper or salt here. We gave the facts, the incidents. Although 16 incidents were given, not a single incident was replied to in a responsible manner; nothing. We have not received any constructive replies. It is very sad that the Hon. Prime Minister has given an example of a hair of an elephant. So, according to him, these incidents are negligible. There is a price given for life - a Jaffna Tamil mans life. There is a price given to it. If the Government applies this policy, I do not think that they can expect any national amity or reconciliation in this country. The way the Hon. Prime Minister replied was very disheartening. We expected a reply at least to console the hearts and minds of the people of the North. He said that there are incidents but compared them with Iraq and Iran, it is immaterial. This is a smaller country. Then, why can you not compare it with the percentage of killings? It is millions and millions. I can see that the House is virtually empty - the Opposition. Nobody seems to be interested. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) No. The Government Benches are almost empty. . ( . (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Yes. It is the Government Benches. I think the Hon. Sumanthiran also pointed out in this House itself there are criminals. I should bring first and foremost to everybodys knowledge, an advertisement placed by the EPDP saying that the Maheswary Foundation is approved and they have given a wrong picture to the Tamil community in the North. Collecting money by an illegal organization is, \"extortion\". If they say that the LTTE has extorted, it is the same thing that EPDP has also done. There is no difference. The leader of this Organization, the Maheswary Foundation, is the Hon. Minister, Douglas Devananda. I have a letterhead with me which proves that. Please note it.",

So, this is the opinion of the leaders and people of Pakistan. They say that the Tamil people in Jaffna have been hit and attacked. The first victim after the Duraiappah murder was the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, our respected Leader of the House. When he went to Jaffna, they attacked him. We all know what happened to him on that occasion. It was a real assault but what did he say? I will not be deterred by these terrorists. I will come over and over again to Jaffna to develop Jaffna. That is the attitude of a Sinhalese Leader and that is also the attitude of the National Leader, Mahinda Rajapaksa. Do you want to grasp that hand of friendship and economic development or do you want bloodshed? If you want real development, say so.",

We are not, at this stage, blaming any Government officers, the army, the EPDP or anyone. But, there should be some sort of an independent body. There is the army; there is the police. There is a full force of the army; there is a full force of the police in the Northern Province. Up to now, on any of these killings that had taken place within the last one and half months, not one single individual has been brought to book. No one has been produced in court and no one knows who are doing these killings. That is the only question we raise. Our debate is based on that. Who was behind these killings that took place in the Northern Province? We are talking about development; we are talking about His Excellency the President, but we are not casting aspersions on anyone. But, it is the duty of the Government to safeguard the interests of the people of the Jaffna Province. They should live happily. They suffered during the war for the last 30 years. You know the backward situation in Jaffna. I have spoken a number of times on that issue here. Education is in chaos; the entire economy is in chaos; the cost of living is so high. Today, an Hon. Member of Parliament stated that sand is being sold at Rs. 13,000 a cube in Jaffna, which is much cheaper than the price sold in Anuradhapura or in some other part of Colombo. That is not the issue. Why should even the selling of sand in Jaffna be given to an individual organization? Why does the Government not take it over and give it to the public at large? It does not matter who does it and at what the price the Government is going to sell it.",

I am very sorry to say in this House that up to now, none of the Hon. Members of the Government have specifically said what the causes are of this issue in Jaffna. The entire Debate is based on that. But, what is the reply that we have received up to now? Neither did the Hon. Prime Minister reply nor did a single Member of the Government Benches reply to us. So, Sir, it is my earnest request that at least in future, the Government should look into this matter very seriously because if this position continues, it would be even similar to the situation that arose a few years ago. We all know the causes of terrorism that arose a few years ago. There were many reasons for it: standardization of education, the economy of the country, the fact that the young people were unable to get jobs in the Government Service and many other issues were the major factors that contributed to the terrorist movement in this country. Are we trying to reopen that chapter again? I am repeatedly saying, it is the duty of the present Government, whether it is done by an armed group or by ex-officers of any organization or whether it is done by any politician, it is the duty of the Government to see that they are brought to book. But, Sir, unfortunately, that has not been done. Today, there is no evidence whatsoever. In fact, there was a Member who said that none of the United National Party Members had gone to the Eastern Province. That is totally incorrect. The Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, Mr. Daya Gamage, Mrs. Gamage, Mr. Sasidharan and all of us have sent food items to the Eastern Province in a small way.[Interruption.]",
