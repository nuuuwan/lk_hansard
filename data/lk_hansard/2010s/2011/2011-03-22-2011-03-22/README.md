() .. ( )

( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Speaker, I seek your indulgence to make a Statement on behalf of the Government on the current situation in Japan following the earthquake and tsunami.

The Government of Sri Lanka expressed its deepest sympathies to His Imperial Majesty Emperor Akihito and the Government of Japan in the wake of the destruction caused by the earthquake, which was followed by a tsunami. His Excellency the President, in his message of condolence, stated that the Japanese people possess incredible resilience and courage that will certainly help them to overcome any destruction and to continue on the path of national progress. In a further manifestation of solidarity, support and compassion, His Excellency the President personally visited the Japanese Embassy in Colombo to meet with His Excellency Kunio Takahashi, the Ambassador of Japan and to sign the condolence book.

Under His Excellency the Presidents guidance and directive, the Government of Sri Lanka pledged a donation of US Dollars 1 million for the relief and recovery efforts that are currently underway in Japan. The cheque of US Dollars 1 million will be handed over by Dr. P.B. Jayasundara, Secretary to the Treasury, to the Japanese Ambassador today. As further testimony to the abiding friendship and solidarity between Sri Lanka and Japan, the Government of Sri Lanka has, parallel to the donation, offered to dispatch a team of medical

professionals to help care for those who have been affected by the disaster along with a search and rescue team comprising armed forces personnel who are trained and equipped for that purpose. The Government will extend further assistance to the people of Japan, if necessary.

Mr. Speaker, the Government of Japan has informed us that there is no need for measures of an emergency nature following the explosions of the nuclear power plants in the Fukushima area, which is approximately 200 kilometres north-east of Tokyo. The Government of Sri Lanka has full confidence that the Japanese Government will take all necessary measures to manage the situation.

A large number of Sri Lankans opted to return to Sri Lanka, following the disaster. The Ministry of External Affairs, in consultation with the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Japan and the SriLankan Airlines, facilitated their return, which was purely a commercial operation. Our Embassy continues to be in close contact with the relevant Japanese officials with a view to ensuring the safety and well-being of Sri Lankans in Japan.

Sir, I wish to reiterate that the Government of Sri Lanka stands ready to give further assistance to the people of Japan in order to assist them in overcoming the devastation. We have every confidence that the people of Japan, drawing on their tremendous reserves of strength and courage and showing their indomitable spirit as they have often done on many occasions in their history, will overcome this calamity.

We wish them every success. The Government and people of Sri Lanka stand by them in a spirit of friendship and solidarity at this time of difficulty. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Hon. Speaker, in recent times no country has had to face the triple-disaster faced by Japan. Japan is a country, which from time to time, had to face earthquakes and tsunamis. But, no one anticipated an earthquake of this magnitude - of 9 Richter scale. It was so severe that the resulting tsunami in fact came over the tsunami walls that were put up to protect the cities in that part of Japan. We saw on television, major ships resting next to skyscraper buildings or high-rise buildings in those cities. What has concerned the world in addition to this is the Fukushima Nuclear-Power Plant explosion, which delayed the rescue efforts and as a result even today, there is no final estimate of the dead. I read that it had been estimated to be 18,000. Though the Fukushima Nuclear-Power Plant has to a large extent been brought under control, the surge in the pressure of the number 3 reactor is still unsettling and the world itself is concerned of the use of nuclear-power plants.

We have to remember the help the Japanese Governments have given us for many projects - whether it be power like the Samanalawewa, whether it be the Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital or the National Youth Services Centre in Maharagama or the roads that we built. This country which has helped us so much has suffered damage which is estimated to be 4 per cent of their GDP and the World Bank says it will take five years to overcome this disaster. So, at this time, the thoughts of the people of our country are with the people of Japan and we all wish them a speedy recovery. We know that the people of Japan are undergoing tremendous hardships comparable to what their grandparents and their parents faced with Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the end of the World War II. But, we have to admire the Japanese people for the spirit in which they have faced these disasters and we hope that their country will be settled back to normal and soon recover to give leadership to the Asian countries.

Mr. Speaker, I think the sentiments expressed by the Government, the Hon. Minister of External Affairs and me and whatever you say, should be conveyed to the Japanese Government, the Japanese Parliament and to their Imperial Majesty the Emperor.

Today, we are expressing our solidarity with the Government and people of Japan, who have been the strongest development partners of our country. For over 50 years, as the Hon. Leader of the Opposition mentioned, Japan has been helping us in our development efforts. But, it is particularly poignant because when the tsunami struck Sri Lanka in 2004, the first country that came to our assistance was Japan. They gave us an immediate grant of US Dollars 90 million which was a grand humanitarian gesture. They did not go through the normal Parliamentary procedures, which are so important in development assistance. Within a matter of days, the Government of Japan released US Dollars 90 million to Sri Lanka for our rehabilitation efforts. They followed it

363 364

[ ]

2011 22

up with a soft loan of another US Dollars 90 million. So, at this time of tragedy, I think we should all have our feelings of sadness as well as confidence in the Government and people of Japan who came to our assistance at a very difficult time.

I must also mention that we have received a large amount of development assistance from Japan, for the outstanding work that we have been able to do. The new Mannar Bridge, improvement to the causeway, the Outer Circular Highway Project, Southern Transport Development Project, Upper Kotmale Hydropower Project and many other very important ventures, which we have undertaken have been financed by Japan. So, they have been great friends of ours and I think we should convey to the Government and people of Japan, our appreciation of what they have done for us and our determination to express our solidarity to our friends.

Now, Sir, I want to get to the main Business of the Day.

Then, the next one is the repealing of the debits tax imposed on the consumer through banks, which is going to be implemented from the 1st of April, 2011. I was under the impression that this was going to be an instantaneous arrangement, but I was subsequently corrected saying that it would be implemented from the 1st of April, 2011. It is important that the benefit of this Act should percolate down to the consumer. Banks have made billions of money through this tax but they have not compensated the consumer either through better service or more humane approach and have not felt remorse at all. There are many areas. The benefit of interest rates that were supposed to be reduced by the banks as a result of fiscal activities carried out by the Government have not percolated down to the consumer. The borrower today is in the same plight as before. Heavy collaterals are required to borrow a very small sum. Today Rs. 100,000, Rs. 500,000 or Rs. 1 million is nothing for small and medium-scale investors.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) That is because of the strategic importance of the investment.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What is the strategic importance? If you have got to pay US dollars 200 million, why is it that they are exempted? Where is the strategy in it? - [Interruption.] Then, give that benefit to Mlesna Tea; give that to Ceylon Tea Services; give it to Aitken Spence; give it to John Keells; give it to our local companies. Our stock market is booming. Our local capital base is there - [Interruption.] Come on, Hon. Minister, when did you talk of investments? - [Interruption] Hon. Minister, when did you talk of investments? You were on the other side of the fence. You were talking of the down-trodden worker. But, you were not talking about an increase of

That is the only way that you can get this country moving forward. That is all I want to say. [Interruption.] - I am talking to an honourable Minister, not to a backbencher who is dishonourable. [Interruption.] - So, all we basically want to say is that -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Yogarajan has been given 20 minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I will take about 12 minutes of that. I think the Hon. Harsha de Silva might take some time from that as well. So, going on that basis - the active working Minister has gone off from here - all I want to basically say is -

(iii) No.

(iv) In obtaining foreign aid for a research grant, the research project proposal including the budget, is submitted to the relevant establishment through the Head of Study, Head of the Faculty and the Vice Chancellor. In this manner the university authorities become sufficiently aware of the research project and the manner in which its monies are utilized. Thereafter conducting the research and utilization of the monies for it according to a methodology agreed upon is the responsibility of the teacher who is in charge of the research. The findings of the research are made known to the Head of Study, Head of the Faculty, the Vice Chancellor and also the establishment which granted the research through progress Reports and Final Reports.

The findings of researchers are given publicity through local and foreign research sessions, seminars and recognized research periodicals. Further, such particulars are included in the University Annual Report. Giving publicity to findings appreciating the freedom of education is the common tradition of the entire University system. Therefore it is not necessary to make the Faculty Council, the Senate and the Education Authority aware of this position.

(b) (i) Yes. This money is included in the University Account in terms of Section 99 (i) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 and the other financial regulations of the Government.

(ii) Not relevant.
