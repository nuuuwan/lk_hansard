, , , . , , , , . ( ) (The Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

, [ ] .

, , [ ] . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair.

[11.39 a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Chairman, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of Defence. With your permission, may I begin with a quotation from John Donne, I quote:

PERCHANCE he for whom this bell tolls may be so ill, as that he knows not it tolls for him; and perchance I may think myself so much better than I am, as that they who are about me,

and see my state, may have caused it to toll for me, and I know not that..

Mr. Deputy Chairman, the allocation for Defence continues to grow each year even after the war has ended and for this year and the next year, the budgetary allocation reaches Rs. 230 billion. There are reasons for that and those reasons will reveal a greater threat to this country than what it has faced any time before in its history. The tragedy, though, Mr. Deputy Chairman, is that the country blinded by triumphalism and euphoria is unable to see it yet. I wish to suggest to you today a way of discerning what awaits the country as a whole. In the aftermath of war, much is being said about uniting the country. We are also keen that this country be united and that all its peoples live in harmony, as President Barack Obama often says, E pluribus unum, "Out of many, one". But, one of the natural corollaries of unity is that when one is affected, all are affected. You cannot strike my brother and not hurt me. You cannot take away my sister's liberties and not take mine. If we are all connected, we will all rejoice together and suffer together. The people of the North-East had the worst excesses of the State thrown against them. They have been deprived of food, medicine, shelter, water and most importantly, their own dignity. They have been denied full and equal access to their citizenship-rights of this country, the rights have been taken away from the people of the North-East, those people of this country who are numerically inferior. Those liberties cannot be taken away from the Tamil people and the Muslim people and not be taken away from the Sinhala brethren. This countrys history is littered with examples of the rights taken away from the peoples of the North-East, then also being taken away from those in the South, perhaps not in equal measure but with unerring certainty.

The Prevention of Terrorism Act - PTA - is a good example of this. This was devised to control Tamil youth. It was then used to decimate communities in the South. His Excellency the President himself and our own Ambassador to Geneva, Miss Tamara Kunanayakam, were bitter opponents of the same PTA that is being used with impunity today. Here is what Miss Tamara Kunanayakam had to say about the PTA in 1987 at the Human Rights Council. I quote:

Most of the arrests, the victims of which, by and large, are Tamils, are affected under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and Emergency Regulations. It may be noted that the Prevention of Terrorism Act has been described by the International Commission of Jurists as an ugly blot on the statute book of any civilized country".

She went on to say, I quote:

"...no longer can the government of Sri Lanka divert the attention of those genuinely concerned by the human rights situation in that country by references to separatism and terrorism. It must, as we said earlier, address itself to

the root causes that have given rise to violence and violations that characterise Sri Lankan society today".

What prophetic words! In the late 1980s and early 1990s, His Excellency the President himself showed us, by example, how one should go about complaining to the

2803 2804

UN bodies when human rights of the citizens in this country are violated with impunity. He complained about the disappearances of the youth in the South to the UN Working Group. This fact is recorded in the legal annals of this country - the official Law Reports - and I would like to read from page 223 of Sri Lanka Law Reports 1992 - Volume 2. I quote:

"In September 1990 the petitioner went to Katunayake airport to board an aircraft bound for Geneva where the 31st session of the working group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances was being held from 10-14 September. At the airport 1st respondent disclosing the fact that he was an Assistant Superintendent of Police informed the petitioner that he wished to examine his baggage for fabricated documents which were likely to be prejudicial to the interests of national security, and which were likely to promote feelings of hatred or contempt to the Government,...

The petitioner refused to permit the search and wanted to contact a lawyer. The first respondent did not object to this. The petitioner then spoke on the telephone to Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike the leader of the opposition and thereafter threw the bags at the first respondent and asked him to examine them. The first respondent examined the bags and recovered 533 documents containing information about missing persons and 19 pages of photographs and issued a receipt for them which was countersigned by the petitioner. The petitioner however refused to make a statement to the police."

So, we saw the spectacle of the PTA being used against the Southern youth of this country. As one who entered the legal profession around that time, I too have had personal experience of seeing how this draconian piece of legislation was used against the Sinhala people as much as it was used and continues to be used against the Tamil people of this country - [Interruption.] One important reason for the lack of professionalism in our police force is the PTA. - [Interruption.] The police no longer possess the ability to investigate crimes. All they have to do is to extract a confession from a suspect when the chances of him getting out on bail is almost nil. I can confidently say that more than 95 per cent of the PTA convictions are based solely on self-incriminating confessions that are made admissible under the PTA. - [Interruption.] You will get your chance.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) I will ask one simple question.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will listen to you. Please bear with me for a moment. I once appeared for a husband and wife who had been charged under the PTA for failing to give information to the police about a supposed LTTE operative, which is another offence found only in the PTA. The TID, as usual, has extracted confessions from them to this effect. But, that supposed LTTE operative who had also been arrested somehow resisted and did not make any

confession about his supposed LTTE activities. So, he was released. But, this respectable couple still had to face the charge. On the day of the trial, that supposed LTTE operative came to court as a free man to watch the proceedings in which two people were charged and convicted for failure to give information about him to the police. That shows how ludicrous the provisions in the PTA are. Now, Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, you may ask me your question. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Member, you quoted from one of the speeches of President Barack Obama but are you aware that during the course of the -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I did not quote from one of his speeches. I said, "as he often says".

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Fair enough. I agree. But, are you aware that the US Senate passed a Bill last week and in that Bill there is one sentence which I will quote. Then, I will be silent and respond to you during my time. It states, A person who was a part of or substantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against United States or its coalition partners,

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, Sir, that is deviating from what is relevant. I will continue with my speech. I thought the Hon. Member was seeking a clarification from my speech but he is seeking a clarification from some Bill that has been passed in the US. I am not concerned with that. He can speak on it during his time. - [Interruption.] I will not address that. You can speak about that when you wish. - [Interruption.] You are not seeking a clarification on anything I have been speaking about.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, thanks to the September Session of the UN Human Rights Council, the state of Emergency was withdrawn with effect from 30th of August this year. But, the very same Emergency Regulations have been reintroduced through the PTA. The situation is worse now. At least previously, the validity of these Regulations depended upon the extension and vote in this House, month after month. Now, it is for ever. Although clearly the Regulations and even the PTA are ultra vires, the Supreme Court dismissed two petitions challenging this without giving reasons. It was quite obvious that they really had no reasons but only instructions.

The impunity and the gun culture that prevails in the country was brought up to sharp focus just last month when two advisers to His Excellency the President were involved in a shoot-out in the Colombo District itself. The Adviser on Trade Union matters died and the Member of Parliament who monitors this Ministry was quickly shifted out of the country to prevent arrest. If this can happen in Colombo, one can imagine what happens in the North and the East. The "Grease Yaka" saga and the sudden increase in robberies in Jaffna now are all designed and choreographed to keep tensions going and to justify the continued presence of the large military in the North and the East.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, the business and investor community today is reeling after the passing of a Bill enabling expropriation of property. This is the most serious development and our party opposed the Bill in the strongest of terms. The rich were not the only ones affected. But, before the passage of that Bill, the poor and the marginalized, most notably in Colombo, had their houses demolished in broad daylight. But, this came as no surprise to us. What is called "expropriation" now has been happening in the North-East for many decades. Peoples private dwelling houses have been taken away. They have been forced on to the streets or IDP camps and this happened with impunity. To date, the private dwelling houses that the army occupies extends to almost 1,000. We should not for a moment delude ourselves into thinking that the South is insulated from the North and that the West is insulated from the East. The people of Ponnalai in Jaffna are not allowed to go to their own homes but tourists from the South are permitted to go to that area. The military occupies Madagal, Keppapalavu, Mullikulam, all of these areas and therefore the people of that area cannot go back and resettle.

Today, the Sinhala media is under severe threat. Many brave Sinhala journalists are in exile. Others have been killed. Prageeth Ekneligoda continues to be missing despite former Attorney-General Mohan Peiriss recent irresponsible assertion that he is in a foreign country.

This too came as no surprise to us. In the years during the war, as many as 12 Tamil journalists were killed; many were forced into exile and others were imprisoned and convicted. One such was Mr. Tissainayagam who was convicted under no other law than the very PTA against which our own President and his Colleagues lobbied against with such eloquence and passion. After the conviction of Mr. Tissainayagam, there has been yet another conviction and the judge concerned has now received the due promotion.

On the 16th of June this year, there was an election-related meeting at Allaveddi in Jaffna at which five Members of Parliament of the TNA were present. It was attacked by 30 to 50 soldiers and officers of the Sri Lanka Army in full uniform and carrying automatic weapons. I made a complaint at the Tellippallai Police immediately,

but was forced to make it in Sinhala - a quarter of a century after Tamil was also made an official language. To this day, the only action taken by the police is to file information at the Mallakam Magistrates Court saying that unidentified men in army uniform attacked a TNA meeting. Can there be a bigger joke than this that so many pretenders are able to run around in such a heavily militarized area in army uniform and armed to the teeth? What is the point in allocating such a colossal amount to the Defence Ministry if the assailants in the Allaveddi cannot be apprehended? If this can happen with such impunity in the presence of MPs and then for over six months no action is taken, can one imagine the levels to which respect for the rule of law has fallen in the heavily militarized North and East? Today I wish to challenge the Government on this. Bring the offenders involved in this crime to book, if you are serious about your assertion that it is only a few individual soldiers who are involved in excesses and that you take prompt action to punish them. I can tell you that you will not do it for the simple reason -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) How can you say that? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will tell you the reason. - [Interruption.] It is for the simple reason that in this case, as in most, the orders came from the very top and these are not isolated incidents for which some individual soldiers are responsible. I challenge you again. Prove me wrong if you can. The Hon. Minister of Sports, you prove me wrong, if you can. - [Interruption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You name, we will prove. - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Not you. I told the Minister, not you. - [Interruption.] You have nothing to do with this. - [Interruption.]Sit down. - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister, is he your Deputy? Hon. Azwer, you sit down. I mentioned the Allaveddi attack - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

Azwer always helps me to take a break and drink a glass of water. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, what is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Deputy Chairman, the LLRC Report was submitted to this House on Friday; not even three or four days have gone and the Hon. Member is referring to the action that the Government has to take in the future. I would respectfully ask you, Sir, to expunge such statements made by the Hon. Member, because those are misleading the House.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Allaveddi attack assumed prominence only because of the presence of five Members of Parliament, but what about the attack on the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti in Jaffna? - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) What about Rajpal Abeynayake? Talk about him.- [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You sit down. - [Interruption.] What about the attack on the Hon. Suresh Premachandrans Secretary? -[Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) You take your own time and reply later. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, you sit down. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Chairman, I expect the Chair to maintain discipline. This Member cannot go on like this making a mockery of the Proceedings in this House and the Chair allows it. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Sumanthiran, you continue with your speech. - [Interruption.]Hon. Azwer, please sit down.- [Interruption.]. Hon. Azwer, please sit down.[Interruption.]

. . ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, you have named him three times. He is still on his feet. Will you ask him to go out now? You have named him three times.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) You must send him out.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, he has to be sent out. You have named him three times. The Standing Orders say that you name him once and then you send him out. You must follow the Standing Orders. You named him three times and he is still here in the House. Send him out of the House. Act according to the Standing Orders.- [Interruption.]

Is the Chair impotent to do anything when a Member stands up and shouts like this? Why is that Chair not able to do anything? -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Members, please sit down. Let the Hon. Sumanthiran speak.- [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If he does not take his seat, send him out. That is what the Standing Order says. - [Interruption.]

If he lowers his pitch, I might understand what he is saying, but not at that high pitch.- [Interruption.] The list is long and has come to the recent abduction of two JVP activists in Jaffna on Human Rights Day. What then is the point of allocating such a colossal amount to the Ministry of Defence, if this is the state of the rule of law in the most militarized part of the country.- [Interruption.] So, if you believe, North and South, East and West are connected, if you know the history of this country, you must also know that what threatened the lives, livelihoods, the way of life of people in the North and East will also come to threaten the lives, livelihoods, the way of life of the people of the South. - [Interruption.] Hon. Githanjana Gunawardena, I am talking about your people now. Why are you shouting at me? - [Interruption.]I am talking about the people of the South, why are you shouting at me?-[Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You first listen. Why do you not first listen?- [Interruption.] You sit down and listen. -[Interruption.] Today, I said that right at the beginning. You were not listening. - [Interruption.]

2811 2812

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Today, the most serious problem the people in the North and East face on a daily basis is that of militarization. The military controls all aspects of individual, social and professional lives. But, perhaps the most destructive practice is the running of commercial enterprises by the military, from barber salons to bars and restaurants and hotels to tourist services. The military's presence is strong. I recently met a gentleman from one of the Chambers of Commerce in Colombo who recounted a story to me. He had met a labourer on the A9 near Mankulam who had asked him the price he had paid for the thambili he was drinking. This gentleman had told him that he paid Rs. 40, to which the labourer had said that it only costs Rs. 20 in Vavuniya and that if the local people are allowed to sell this, they would sell it for Rs. 30 and make a 50 per cent profit. But, the army sells it for 100 per cent profit and will not let them engage in this trade. This has completely decimated the livelihoods of people in those areas. People who would otherwise have run the local barber salon or set up their little shops on the side of the A9 Highway, are rendered unemployed and destitute. If there is one certainty in this country, it is that you cannot compete with the military. [Interruption.] But, it is not just livelihoods; the entire economic structure of the North has been undermined because labour and overheads are free of charge when the military gets involved in business. Pricing becomes distorted and competition is quashed. The military is an external artificial factor that further disturbs the economic equilibrium in an already disturbed land.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage - Minister of Sports ) Hon. Member, have you been to Mullaitivu? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, I have been. Please sit down. - [Interruption.] You must not disturb me. Go to your seat. Why do you not go to your seat? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) Have you been to Kilinochchi? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, the Hon. Minister of Sports is speaking from somewhere else. You go to your seat and ask me. Then, I will answer you. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please!

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage -

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) [Interruption.] - You do not know anything about the North. Have you been to North?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I have been there. It does not require a prophet, only a student of History can predict the trajectory of the Sri Lankan economy in the coming years. When we have seen warning signs in the last few years, from security companies to hotels and restaurants selling vegetables, the military is unmistakably becoming interwoven into the fabric of the countrys economy. As we consider the subject of Defence, consider the voices of those from the North and East; heed their warning.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Of course!

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) In their history, you will see your future. - [Interruption.] Unless we dramatically change the way we run this country and say Enough is enough. Civilian rule will be a matter of the past". Civilian rule, however flawed -

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) That is why we say that they do not want it. What they want is development. That is what they want.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You know how they voted at the last election.

( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

2813 2814

2011 19

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon Gitanjana Gunawardena. What is the point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) Sir, he is misleading the House saying that there is no democratic rule in the North. He is saying there are no elections in the North. He is completely misleading the House.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena, that is not a point of Order. Hon. Member, you may carry on. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Surely, the Hon. Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning knows that. ( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) He says there is no democratic rule, he is completely misleading the House. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Civilian rule, however flawed and inefficient, however chaotic and unwieldy, should never be surrendered to the oppressive dictatorship of military economic rule. - [Interruption.] By calling the army out, each and every single district in the country on the 6th of each and every month by a gazette notification, the President, in effect, declares a No-Confidence Motion against the police and its ability to maintain law and order on a monthly basis. ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella - Minister of Mass Media and Information) You have forgotten the past. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We have forgotten the fact that the correct and the right place for an army - ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) You have forgotten the past.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am talking about the present, every month what the President does; not the past. - [Interruption.] Are you also saying that the rain has stopped but the drizzle continues? The Prime Minister, quoting from one of his Ministers, said that the rain has stopped but the drizzle continues. Are you also saying that? Two and a half years after the war ended, you are justifying the drizzle. Unashamedly, you are justifying what you call the drizzle. We have forgotten the fact. - [Interruption.] We have all forgotten the fact. - [Interruption.] All right. They are looking at you. You are being watched. You have done enough. He saw you. Now, enough. Sit down. You got your marks. Now, sit down.

We have forgotten the fact that the correct and right place for an army in a normal society is behind barracks. The country cannot live in a perpetual state of military siege. The army need to be retained and sent back to civilian life. The military is a hammer in the tool box of State policy. It is a very powerful hammer but not every problem is a nail. I appeal to every right-thinking Member of the Government today, do not condone the continued militarization of our country. It is patent that this is continuing to ruin the social fabric of the North and the East, and therefore, will soon eat away all that is precious in our democratic tradition in the South too.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Sumanthiran, there is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella. Hon. Member, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Hon. Sumanthiran is mentioning about the militarization of the society. This is -

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) That is not a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) He is basically misleading the House. Sir, I request you to expunge that part of it because he is not talking here, he is talking to the pro-LTTE diaspora who are working tirelessly overseas -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, you speak later. Sir, that is not a point of Order. He is unnecessarily taking my time. That is not a point of Order.

2815 2816

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Minister, that is not a point of Order.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Minister must be asked to sit down. That is not a point of Order. - [Interruption.]

Nothing. - [Interruption.] Nothing. This is already happening. I appeal to you again. - [Interruption.] Listen to the appeal. - [Interruption.] Hon. Hisbullah, will you sit down please? You do not have to shout. I appeal to the - [Interruption.] That is because you cannot control your Members. The Chief Government Whip must control the Members. Now, listen to this carefully, please. You would not even let me say. Listen to this carefully.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, you carry on please. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Do not be fooled by the efficiency with which Colombo is being beautified. This is not the job of the military. The longer you take to protest the militarization of the North and the East, the more difficult it is going to be for you to take a stand against forces that are already at your doorstep. That will completely annihilate the precious democratic way of life of the entire country. One way in which you can do this - [Interruption.;

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) Who wrote your speech?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I wrote it. One way in which you can do that today is to speak up against - [Interruption.] I am telling you something that you - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister of Sports, why do you not look after your sports bodies? I am telling you something today. One way in which you can do this is to speak up against the mammoth allocation on the military in the Budget of 2012.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Members, please take your seats. - [Interruption.] Hon. Hisbullah, please sit down. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You have a precious opportunity today to speak up against this trend that I am speaking about. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage, please sit down.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You can vote against the allocation today. You have a wonderful opportunity to say, "Enough is enough. We will not allow militarization of the entire country". You have it with you. - [Interruption.] Do not throw it away. You may not get a chance next year. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, we will not allow the TNA to propagate terrorism in this country; we will not allow to do that. -[Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am saying that you may not get another chance. Such is the speed of takeover of all aspects of the civilian life. Sir, I wish to say a few words with regard to - [Interruption.] Again, the Hon. Member who has been warned several times is on his feet. - [Interruption.] Sir, again he is on his feet. I appeal to the Chair. - [Interruption.] No, Sir, you cannot allow that.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Sumanthiran, you continue.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You told him three or four times. He is still on his feet disturbing and you do not take any action. - [Interruption.] I will be constrained to say that the Chair is scared. - [Interruption.] I will be constrained to say that the Chair is scared. Is the Chair scared? Why is the Chair not taking action as you are duty-bound to do?

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Do not listen to him. You continue with your speech. Why do you listen to him? You continue with your speech. - [Interruption.] Hon. Azwer, please sit down.

2817 2818

2011 19

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) When you chair the Proceedings, you are duty-bound to do something. If you are incapable of doing that, you must go away from that Chair; you must not sit in that Chair.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, please sit down. - [Interruption.] Hon. Members, please sit down. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You must go away from that Chair. [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Deputy Chairman, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, he is insulting the Chair. We cannot permit that in this House. He is referring to Mr. Deputy Chairman as you

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] and is insulting the Chair.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Sumanthiran, you carry on. - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You congratulated me. - [Interruption.] .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Go to Hulftsdorp. .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) There goes the Hon. Azwer again; again he is on his feet. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) You address the Chair. - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am repeatedly appealing to the Chair- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) You cannot question me. You continue with your speech.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, you have named him. If he does not listen to you, you have to ask him to leave.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, what is the point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, according to the Standing Orders, you cannot read your speech. Being an eminent lawyer, whose speech is he reading? Is it the diasporas speech? ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) That is not a point of Order. - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am not reading my speech. I have my points written on this. I will put that also away and speak. - [Interruption.] I never read my speech in Parliament. I will put that piece of paper away.

Sir, I wish to say something about reconciliation and this is important. If the Government Members and the Government Ministers think it is not important, they will continue to disturb me. I am going to say something about reconciliation.

2819 2820

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) Do you want the bank statement? This is the bank statement. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) MTV? What MTV? - [Interruption.] That is why you have got the MTV to attack me everyday. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Minister, please sit down.- [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Minister of Sports is violating all the traditions of this House. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Thank the LTTE for making Rajapaksa the President.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

[Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I would not get entangled in that, Sir. I know the Hon. Minister very well. ( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) Yes. But, this is your bank statement. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, he should not do this. I was saying some words on reconciliation. If the Government thinks that it is not important, they can shout me down. If you think reconciliation is not important, you shout me down. - [Interruption.] What I want to say is that true reconciliation is always victim-centred; true reconciliation must listen to the voices of those who have suffered; true reconciliation is never prescriptive by any government. Recently, there was the first National Conference on Reconciliation. The word "reconciliation" does not fit that Conference. Twenty two people spoke in that and except for three, all were from the majority community. I am told that the first list of 16 persons were entirely from the majority community. What is the reconciliation there? With whom are you trying to

reconcile? With yourselves? If you are serious about reconciliation, you must listen to the voices of those you say you want to reconcile with. - [Interruption.] Hon. Azwer, please sit down. - [Interruption.] Please, sit down. - [Interruption.] This is just another ruse that the Government is using and the direction - [Interruption.] All right, now sit down. -[Interruption.] Sir, the Chair cannot permit this.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Do not listen to Hon. Azwer. Hon. Member you continue with your speech. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, you cannot ask me to go on when somebody is standing up and barking like a mad dog.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] - [Interruption.] There you are! Now, there are more mad dogs,

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

more barkings. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, what is the point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, the Hon. Sumanthiran referred to Hon. Azwer as mad dog.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

That must be expunged and he must be warned not to use unparliamentary language while addressing the House.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) If there is anything against the Standing Orders, that will be expunged. Please sit down. Hon. Azwer, you pointed out your matter. So, please sit down now. Hon. Sumanthiran, you continue with your speech.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) . , . , . !

.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) I am giving the final warning to you, Hon. Azwer. If you disturb again, I will send you out. Hon. Sumanthiran, please continue.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay, that is the final warning. Sir, I was saying that you must listen to the voices of those who have suffered. Nobody can gainsay the fact that it is the people of the North and the East who have suffered the most during this war; you cannot say otherwise. What is the mechanism that the Government has instituted to listen to the voices of those people? You had elections and they spoke very clearly.

You had elections in a staggered fashion three times this year and at every turn they spoke to you very clearly and elected the TNA as their representatives. You must talk to the representatives of the people, that you must do. If you are serious about reconciliation, you must listen to what the TNA has to say on behalf of the people. If in this House itself you manifest your inability, your unwillingness to listen to the peoples representatives from the North, that shows what you will do in time to come as well. You cannot achieve reconciliation by merely shaking hands with some people, one or two individuals, and making them Ministers or Deputy Ministers in your Cabinet. That is not reconciliation. Your contempt for the rule of law is seen by the fact that there are Deputy Ministers in your Cabinet who have committed serious immigration offences, pleaded guilty to them and served sentences in other countries and have come back only to be made Deputy Ministers here. You have Ministers in your Cabinet who are proclaimed as persons who are being sought after the law for murder and abduction of children and they still remain Ministers in your Cabinet. - [Interruption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, what is your point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is referring to the conduct of the Ministers and the Deputy Ministers.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) That is not a point of Order. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If that is the attitude that you can win over some criminal elements from the Tamil society, keep them with

2823 2824

you and then show the world that you have achieved true reconciliation, Sir, that will not sell. You have to achieve true reconciliation with the people, with the actual people, not with persons who have been discarded and who have been proclaimed as persons who are being sought after and are unable even to go to the neighbouring country. - [Interruption.]

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda - Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development) !

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Minister is disturbing me unnecessarily. I do not know why he is so disturbed. Why are you so disturbed? I am talking about a Minister who is a criminal. Why are you disturbed? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Douglus Devananda, please sit down. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Why are you getting worried? I referred to a Minister in the Cabinet who is a criminal. Why are you getting disturbed? Why are you getting worried about it? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Minister, please sit down now.

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah)

. . rose.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Another Member is standing. Why? Do you also want to be added to that list? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Sumanthiran, why are you responding to those interruptions? You continue with your speech. -[Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No true reconciliation with the people will ever be achieved by getting a few criminal elements and making them Ministers. - [Interruption.] The only way, if you are really seriously interested in winning over the hearts and minds of the Tamil people of this country, is - [Interruption.] Again he is disturbing.

. . !

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Sumanthiran, you carry on with your speech, please. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) This is the problem. The moment I say, "Achieve true reconciliation by a genuine process", you touch a raw nerve; everybody gets so upset and starts to disturb. So, that is indicative, I am saying that is indicative of the path that the Government is treading today which is in the opposite direction to reconciliation.

I am appealing to you, please turn around, leave all those criminal elements out, come and join with the people and the people will respect you for that. When I say "criminal elements", one person repeatedly stands up, identifying himself. - [Interruption.] There again he stands up identifying himself. - [Interruption.] Again he stands up identifying himself.

Sir, before I conclude the speech, I will make this appeal once again. I appeal to the Ministers and to the Members in the Government ranks and you have an opportunity today to say, Enough is enough. No further militarization of the country - North and East or even the South and West. That is in your hands today. You choose to ignore that and as I said, our history will be your future and I hope that sensible minds will listen to this today. If you really want reconciliation with the people who have been trodden under the jack boot of the army, who have been mercilessly ill-treated, who are still living under tarpaulin sheets because there are no houses that are being built for them, who have to see the spectacle of multi-billion dollar roadways and bridges that are being built by the side but they have no roof over their head, who still hold pictures of their loved ones

2825 2826

[ .. ]

2011 19

going from street to street, junction to junction, town to town looking for their loved ones who are missing and you treat them the way you are treating them today, you will never achieve reconciliation. If you are sincere about reconciliation, if you really want this country to be one, there is only one way and that way is to listen to the voices of those people, grant them the right that they are entitled to as a people and then in one country we can live together as brothers, as equals with dignity. - [Interruption.] Even after all the warning signs have come about, even after we have shouted ourselves hoarse from here with the sound of moderation telling you -

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! Hon. Sumanthiran, are you going to wind up now? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am winding up. Even after we have repeatedly told you as the representatives of the Tamil people that we are willing to live with the Sinhala people and the Muslim people in this country, not as second-class citizens but as equals, entitled to and enjoying our rights as a people, if you continue to ignore that, there is no way in which you will achieve reconciliation.

Thank you very much.

[1.58 p.m.]

() .. ( ) ( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Deputy Chairman, because of the brevity of time, I will confine myself to just one particular point. This has to do with those sections of the Report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission that address problems connected with International Humanitarian Law. I think they have said some very valuable things that we need to take note of and these are matters of urgent concern to the international community as well. For example, the LLRC Report points out the reality with regard to the No-fire Zones. That is, the Government established these No-fire Zones as a result of an agreement between the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Report quotes chapter and verse. It gives detailed factual information which proves beyond any doubt whatsoever that the LTTE never had any intention of observing a No-fire Zone. That is there; a profusion of evidence which establishes that beyond any doubt. That is, bringing in artillery and positioning the artillery among the civilian population. Then, persons in civilian clothes coming there and mingling with the civilian population so that they cannot be identified or distinguished from the civilians. From the beginning that is how the LTTE dealt with the whole issue of No-fire Zones. Then, the Government established a second No-fire Zone and a third No-fire Zone and made provision for safe corridors. But, the Report asks the question whether all of this was not eventually used by the LTTE to harm the civilian population.

Now, I want to make the point, Sir, that the Darusman Report has been deliberately mischievous and misleading with regard to these areas. The Darusman Report contains photographic evidence relating to the shelling of makeshift hospitals such as the Puthukkudiyiruppu Hospital.There again, the Report gives unimpeachable evidence that as far as these makeshift hospitals were concerned, the LTTE came and placed guns at the periphery of these hospitals; they parked their military vehicles within the precincts of these hospitals. Now, that whole body of evidence is suppressed in the Report that was prepared by the Panel of Experts appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. It gives a distorted picture which is contradicted by the evidence that is referred to extensively in the Report, which was submitted to His Excellency the President by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. So, I want to raise this question: "Should the international community not address this issue?" That is, on the one hand you have a government that is established as a result of the democratic process. On the other, you have a terrorist organization which is flouting all the rules of international law which are binding on the established government. So,

it is an asymmetrical situation. I think that is a new situation which has developed and which requires detailed attention. The whole body of international law grew up in a different context. That is, conflicts among State actors. But, you have here a fundamentally different situation. One is a State actor and the State actor is constrained, restricted and hamstrung at every point by the rules and practices of international law, by the Geneva Convention and by the protocols. None of it is binding on the terrorist organization as we saw with regard to what they did in relation to the No-fire Zones and the matters connected with the shelling of hospitals.

Sir, I would also like very briefly to refer to the differences. Now, we have the LLRC Report and we have the Darusman Report. These two things are very different from each other and what are the differences? The Darusman Report says that it is prepared on the basis of evidence obtained from people in whom the Panel had confidence. But, the people who gave this evidence asked for a cast-iron guarantee that their names will not be disclosed. So, surprisingly, astonishingly, the Darusman Committee gave them an assurance that for 30 long years, the identity of the people who gave this evidence will not be disclosed; their identity will not be known; their probable motivation cannot be probed; the infirmities in their evidence cannot be discovered because there is a cloak of secrecy and that cloak of secrecy cannot be penetrated for three decades. There can be no procedure which violates the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness in that flagrant manner. On the contrary, the LLRC Report has been based on an open and transparent process. They mention in the footnotes the people who gave that evidence and under what circumstances that evidence was obtained. It is therefore much more credible than the material that is contained in the Darusman Report.

Secondly, the Darusman Report presents a narrative but - again incredibly - they say that they cannot be held responsible for the accuracy of that narrative. They do not vouch for the accuracy of what they themselves state in their Report. Nothing can be more irresponsible than that. On the other hand, the LLRC Report is based on evidence which they revealed, which is stated in their footnotes and is, therefore, verifiable. Anyone can look at it and see whether the findings are in accordance with the evidence that was led before the Commission.

The last point of difference between the Darusman Report and the LLRC Report is this. The Darusman Report says that they did not investigate. They say that in so many words in three different places. They also say that they did not have the authority to investigate. In that case, how is it possible for them to reach the conclusion that there is credible evidence against the Government of Sri Lanka with regard to matters which would expose the Sri Lankan Government to liability in respect of grave crimes? How can you come to that finding without any

2843 2844

investigation? They say that they did not investigate; that they did not have the authority to investigate.

Then, what is the value of that process? By contrast, the LLRC Report says that they did investigate and where the investigations took place, these are the conclusions they arrived at. With regard to some other matters they did not have the equipment, the machinery to investigate and those would have to constitute the subject matter of a subsequent process.

So, these are the points I wanted to make, Mr. Deputy Chairman. We have a highly speculative and irresponsible report, that is the Darusman Report, and we have the LLRC Report, which is founded upon very credible and responsible premises. I thank you, Sir.

I am telling the Hon. Members of the TNA that you still have in your mindset, the conditions that prevailed in 1988 when the entire situation was different, when the LTTE held a large chunk of this countrys power and when the LTTE held the military power. India was throwing its weight on this question. But now, circumstances have changed entirely. Therefore, you cannot further ask that the North and the East be combined into one province, because that would be a condition that will run against the Muslims as well as the Sinhalese who are living in the Eastern Province. Therefore, the change that has taken place from then to now must be recognized, and a new balance of power has been struck with the defeated LTTE. So, in that context we can only negotiate and you can intervene. Therefore, I hope you will come in through a Select Committee, express your views and let us begin the devolution of power at some point. You remain in the Opposition. You canvass for your point of view. But, let us start the devolution process to which you must give your support in the name of the Tamil people.
