The other matter I would like to place before you is that we have now started going into non-traditional areas. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, I saw that. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) . smallholders 5000 10,000 . . 3,000 .

10,000 , 250 . 20 . 40 . What is more important is that we did soil testing and adaptive trials for one year and we have now established that rubber can be grown in most parts of Vavuniya and in some parts of Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu. There is a huge demand for natural rubber. Seventy per cent of our rubber production is purchased for the value-added industry, which brings in a huge amount of foreign exchange earnings. Now, the demand is such that we are not able to satisfy with the commensurate increase in production. This is why we are expanding into new areas and in another three or four years time, I think we would be able to produce sufficiently to satisfy the new increasing demand of the value-added industry. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My second question, Sir, is this: Hon. Minister, you said that value-addition is the most important criteria and it certainly is the case. But, Ansell Lanka (Pvt.) Limited, which is one of the biggest companies that use natural rubber and centrifuged rubber, does not buy it from Sri Lanka. I saw that you had expanded into new areas like Moneragala, Vanni, Kilinochchi and so on. I would greatly appreciate if you could also look at intercropping because that is the only way to maximize on the labour problem that you are having. At the moment, you are having a major labour problem with regard to tea and rubber. Instead of giving 24 or 25 days of work, they are giving only 17 to 18 days work.

639 640

Competitiveness is not there. So, please ensure that you bring in productivity, efficiency and also competitiveness through the introduction of intercropping.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Mr. Deputy Speaker, actually Ansell Lanka (Pvt.) Limited does purchase quite a significant amount from smallholders. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But, centrifuged rubber is not bought. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) No. It is being - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Our quality is not good enough. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) They have in fact set up several factories. Even the RPCs have set up several factories which produce centrifuged rubber which, of course, is used by Ansell Lanka (Pvt.) Limited and other companies to manufacture surgical gloves and other value-added products. As I told you earlier, there is a 70 per cent demand from the value-added industries. At the moment, we are not able to satisfy the total demand because some of it is imported. So, what we are trying to do is to go into these new non-traditional areas and increase rubber production, so that we can save the foreign exchange component which is being used for import of some of the needs. Only a small amount of the need, at the moment, is bought by these value-added industries.

The other thing that we are trying to do, Hon. Member, - I am sure you will endorse it - is this. We have started introducing rainguards in order to increase productivity. .

If you take traditional rubber-producing areas like my district, Kalutara, for example, because of the heavy rainfall and the changing climatic conditions, tapping days are fast decreasing. That is why we have gone into areas like Moneragala, Padiyatalawa, Maha-oya, Polonnaruwa and even areas in the North, so that we can get more tapping days. Also, the other thing that we are trying to do is to propagate the use of rainguards.

[11.08 a.m.]

. . . ( ) ( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Urban Affairs) Mr. Deputy Chairman, I thank you for affording me the opportunity to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of Education. As President Mahinda Rajapaksa believes that the nearly four million school-going children are the nations greatest resource, he has from the beginning of his Government, committed to take all necessary measures to provide them with a good education and to mould them as a society fit enough to meet the challenges of the future.

However, there has been a prevailing disparity in educational opportunities among children of different sections of the population. The people who can afford find places for their children in international schools. Most parents, however, are vying for a place in popular schools in the cities. They even resort to various corrupt means to get a place for their children in popular schools. The rest of the people unwillingly admit their children to the primary and secondary schools in the country, which depend solely on Government financial allocations. Most of these schools have been lacking even the basic facilities, while some schools are given all the facilities. As a result, some schools have been performing well while the others have failed to perform well.

The disparity in education is a social injustice. Once those children are out of school and take their places in society, they suffer from an inferiority complex; there is no personality development in them. President Mahinda Rajapaksa has realized this grave injustice caused to a section of the population. He has, therefore, taken corrective measures to narrow this disparity, particularly as it affects the growth of a sound generation for the future.

It is in view of this, a programme to develop 1,000 secondary schools as high quality schools has been planned to be put into action from 2012 to 2016. This will

691 692

be a major turning point and a milestone in the education system of the country. I see it as a significant step in the direction of overcoming the problems in the education system.

A sum of Rs. 95 billion has been allocated for the Ministry of Education in this Budget. I wish to emphasize that every secondary school in the Island should have the facilities of a computer unit, a library, a science lab, a home- science unit, agriculture equipment, sports equipment as well as musical instruments. However, practically, providing these maybe a difficult task to perform. That is why President Mahinda Rajapaksa, has in his wisdom, proposed to give priority to develop 1,000 high quality secondary schools, covering all Divisional Secretaries' areas. He has also proposed that 5,000 well-performing primary schools too be developed and be connected to such high quality schools, which will be improved to meet universal standards. Though that would not solve the problem immediately, it would, to a certain extent, help narrow the disparity in educational opportunities.

The more important aspect in the development of schools is to find qualified teachers. Hence, the Government has proposed to recruit teachers for Mathematics, Science, Information Technology and Languages. Also, as a policy, the Government proposes to recruit teachers direct to the respective schools. This, I am certain, will solve the teacher-shortage in schools and will be adequately staffed.

Another matter on which I wish to express my appreciation to the Hon. Minister of Education is that he has been successfully implementing a programme to teach Sinhala to Tamil medium students and Tamil to Sinhala medium students, thus laying the foundation for national unity and understanding each other. He, as the Minister of Education understands the needs and aspirations of all communities, particularly the wish of communities to bring up their children in their religious environment and in their own cultural background.

Muslim schools in this country have been established in line with this objective. However, most of these schools today suffer from a shortage of teachers for important subjects such as Science, Mathematics and English. Besides, they lack resources and facilities.

At this stage, I wish to recall the support given by the late Hon. (Dr.) Richard Pathirana as the Minister of Education, to Muslim schools. He had given me the freedom to help Muslim schools in remote areas in the country. I was able to provide new buildings to a number of schools in the country. He had helped the Muslim Ladies College, Bambalapitiya and Hameed Al-Husseinie College to be developed and a number of Provincial Council schools in the City of Colombo. When

the Duplication Road was extended in front of Muslim Ladies College, I, as the Minister of Highways, paid them a compensation of Rs. 35 million to purchase a land to put up a hostel.

I must say that after the late Hon. (Dr.) Badiuddin Mahmud, it was under the late Hon. (Dr.) Richard Pathirana that we got a boost for Muslim education. However, Muslim schools continue to suffer without required resources and facilities. Efforts have been taken by the All-Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference to rectify the situation with the co-operation of the Ministry of Education. A delegation of the All-Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference met His Excellency the President and had discussions with him on issues related to education of Muslim students. The President was very considerate and agreed to appoint a Committee of eminent educationalists to study the issues related to Muslim education and make recommendations. On the directive of His Excellency the President, the Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha, the then Minister of Education, appointed the said Committee on 13th December, 2006 and the Committee submitted its Report to him on 26th October, 2009, and to His Excellency the President on 27th December, 2009. Both had agreed to implement the recommendations. The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha also helped to develop the Muslim schools in the Colombo District.

Among the very vital recommendations, is the establishment of two boys schools: one in Kandy and one in Colombo South. In fact, the request for such a school in Kandy is a quarter century old. Similarly, a considerable Muslim population of Colombo South living in Bambalapitiya, Wellawatta, Havelock Town, Dehiwala, Mount Lavinia, Ratmalana and Nugegoda up to Maharagama do not have a single Muslim school for their children. Being unable to get admission to non-Muslim schools, they have no alternative other than sending their children to the so-called international schools incurring exorbitant expenses.

Citing the poor state of Muslim schools as the cause for poor admissions to universities, the Committee has stressed the need to rectify the situation. The Report submitted points out that the Muslim students admitted to the universities also show how the low rate of admission is related to the inadequacy of facilities found in Muslim schools. Comparatively the percentage of Muslim students entering the universities in Sri Lanka is seen par below. Focusing on the shortage of teachers, the Report emphasizes the need to fill the vacancies of Moulavi teachers for Muslim schools. For 20 long years, no such appointments have been made. However, I thank His Excellency the President for his intervention and having got 200 Moulavi teachers appointed out of 399 candidates who got through the recruitment exam. As there are still more vacancies for Moulavi teachers in Muslim schools, action should be taken to appoint the remaining 199

693 694

[ . . . ]

2011 05

Moulavi teachers who qualified at the recruitment exam.

I find, however, that the recommendations of this Report have not been implemented as yet. Perhaps, there was not sufficient time for the Hon. Susil Premajayantha to implement it before he took over the new portfolio.

Sir, I table* this Report together with the Memorandum sent by the All-Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference and request that these two documents be included in Hansard.

As the present Minister of Education has great understanding of wider issues affecting the Muslim education, I am confident that he will take necessary action to implement the recommendations made in the two documents. I am also confident that the Minister, when selecting the secondary schools for development, will take Muslim schools into consideration on the basis of close proximity to the connecting primary schools.

I wish the Minister well. I hope you will have the backing of the full House, including the Opposition, and make sure that these two recommendations placed before the House, will be implemented. Thank you.

, , , , , . [3.07 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Presiding Member, I am pleased to speak today on this very important subject of Education and Higher Education. It is unfortunate that your Minister and the Deputy Minister have been unable to handle the portfolio of Education. I feel that this is the reason why you had to take somebody from our side, to poach from our side, a person whom you call "an educationist" - [Interruption.] No. He is from Colombo. I am not on his side. I am in the UNP. - [Interruption.] He is not in the town today. He has gone for his daughters engagement.- [Interruption.] Sure. - [Interruption.] No, not now. I do not accept it.

So, you had to poach a so-called educationist from our side, from the UNP, to monitor your Ministers. This is very unfortunate. If a person who runs an international school is fit to monitor the Ministry of Education, then, we can find thousands of persons in this country today who will be fit to monitor the Ministry of Education because international schools are mushrooming today all over the country. Every small town is having an international school. Is it not the failure of the education

system of this country that has led to so many international schools coming up in every small town all over the country? If people were confident that they can enter their children into a school close to their house, give them a good education, develop them into good citizens in this country who will have a good job and a good future, then they would not bother to spend extra money and send their children to international schools. These international schools are run by those who cannot even speak or write a proper sentence in English. Even the so-called educationist falls into the same category, unfortunately. Why are they promoting international schools? Are they promoting international schools because they want to promote education? They claim today that they are going to promote education in the country, that they have so much love for the children and that is why they are crossing over to promote education. But, they are only promoting their own wealth by running international schools.

Today, the international schools which have come up all over the country need some sort of regulation. The option of educating a persons child in the English medium is a right that they should have. At the same time, is it not necessary for the Government to regulate such international schools laying down the minimum requirements so that those children could get a good education? This country has always been committed to providing a good education, a free education. But, if people opt to pay for education and go to international schools, then we cannot object to it. However, the State has the responsibility to regulate such schools.

I am sure the Hon. Education Ministers programme of starting 1,000 schools of high standard all over the country, to some extent, will reduce the need for children to be sent to international schools. Most of those who send their children to international schools are parents of the middle-class or above, who feel that if they cannot admit them to popular schools, they should admit them at least to international schools.

Hence, the Ministry should formulate certain rules and see that children who go to international schools get a good standard of education. For that, the minimum criteria must be fixed not only for physical resources but even for human resources. There are Government schools which started the English medium but were not able to find enough teachers who can teach in the English Language. So, how are these mushrooming educational institutions finding their teachers? Maybe they are finding teachers who are not qualified to teach the subjects they teach in the English language. However, for name's sake they are running the so-called international schools.

I wish to speak to the Minister of Education. There was a shortage of teachers in plantation schools and during the time of the former President, Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, we, the CWC, made a

757 758

[ ]

2011 05

proposal and the Government agreed to appoint 3,179 teachers to plantation schools. Hon. Minister, the plantation schools got these teachers on a school-based appointment. So, they were appointed to schools on condition that they cannot ask for transfers from those schools to any other school because the vacancies in those particular schools had been identified and teachers were selected for those schools from those who opted to join that school on merit within that school alone. So, they have to teach in those schools. When somebody asks for a transfer, the Government officials do not allow. But, we can see in Matale, in Kurunegala that a lot of teachers are being moved to adjoining Muslim schools and the estate schools are being deprived of teachers. This is because some of the officials are taking there own decisions. Since there is a rule that these teachers cannot be transferred, they are using a dubious method by calling it " ", not transfers but they say " " and they are attaching them to some other schools on a temporary basis. But, on the whole, these estate schools or plantation schools are being deprived of the teachers whom they should have. We have always said that when you take teachers by open examinations, those who come and join the Tamil schools or plantation schools, because it is difficult for them to travel to plantation schools or because those are small schools, they always get transfers and move out. Due to this situation, during the last process of appointments, specific schools were mentioned and it was also mentioned that they should be qualified in Hinduism or Christianity to be appointed to plantation schools so that they will not be able to go to Muslim schools where there is also a shortage. That should be addressed separately. You should not deprive these plantation schools of teachers by attaching them to other schools in that area.

Now, I would like to speak a few words about the Ministry of Higher Education. The Hon. Minister has been given the task of expanding higher education with the participation of the private sector in the provision of higher education to our youth. As you know very well, there are a large number of children who are anxious to have higher education and when they do not get admission to the universities here, they look for other means of accessing higher education. This has become a big business in Sri Lanka today. Every single upstair building in Colombo has now become a university campus. You must not just allow these so-called university campuses to open up in a random way.

Hon. Minister, you are a capable person. You understand, think, plan and work very hard and I feel you are the only person who can do this. So, you must do this task in a very well-planned manner. The United National Party, as a policy, is not against the participation of the private sector in higher education. But, we are for a regulated and properly-monitored expansion of the higher education system with the involvement of the private sector. It should not be just somebody putting up a board, charging fees and sending money abroad for the so-called

examinations, which goes into hundreds of thousands of rupees. If you want to do the CIMA, you need Rs. 400,000 a year. If you are doing a degree course, you need Rs. 600,000 a year. But, are they all providing a fair and decent education to our children? This is what you have to look at. You must approve these institutions before they commence business in this country. It should not be a business though it generates income. Education should not be towards the generation of income alone; it should be to provide a valuable service to the community.

Hon. Minister, today there is a private medical college that has come up. There is so much of criticism and protest against this private medical college. We had a private medical college earlier during former President J.R. Jayewardenes time. That was a very good institution. I know of doctors who had qualified from there and are doing very well, but, that was done in a planned manner. It was equipped with a hospital, a board of management, qualified staff and there were minimum requirements that were met before that institution started functioning. That was mainly because it was started by the college of private medical practitioners in this country. The doctors started it together as a joint operation and the private medical practitioners were involved in it. So, nobody could object to the quality or standard of it. But, today, there is so much of criticism about the private medical college that has come up because it does not even have a hospital.

Hon. Minister, I would suggest - we do not have to invent the wheel again - that we just look across India where they have successfully involved the private sector in higher education for so many decades. I went through the website of the MGR Medical University in Chennai. According to that website, there is a statute that gives the minimum requirements a medical college should have prior to starting their first year. Before admitting even one child to that medical college, they have to meet certain criteria. The number of buildings that should be there, the number of classrooms, the equipment in the laboratories, the different kinds of laboratories, the professors, the lecturers, their required qualifications, the number of beds which the hospital should have, the number of operating theatres they should have and the number of other facilities required are all stipulated in that. Only after those requirements are met, is the licence given to admit the first child.

Similarly, there is the website of the Anna University of Technology. Hon. Minister, in Tamil Nadu alone 175,000 engineers are produced every year. Their population is three times Sri Lankas population. We do not produce even 1,750 engineers a year. One hundred and seventy five thousand engineers are produced in Tamil Nadu. They are employable engineers and they are all employed. At the moment, there is a shortage of 200,000 engineers in Tamil Nadu alone. The Anna University again has minimum criteria for approving an engineering college and for approving each of the courses

759 760

in the engineering college. Each of the departments have to have minimum requirements, as I said earlier, of physical resources, equipment and human resources.

So, if you would look into a system that is transparent, where you announce in advance the minimum requirements that these colleges should have, or the universities should have, and if you approve them only after they meet those minimum criteria, then you would not have any problem. Otherwise, if there is going to be more and more protests against private higher educational institutions, like the SAITM Medical College in Malabe, then you would be doing a disservice to this country because the people would all get together to obstruct any private involvement or private investment in higher education and that would create a permanent damage to higher education in this country.

As far as school education is concerned, we are one of the most advanced in South Asia. But, as far as higher education is concerned, Sri Lanka has definitely not achieved the standards achieved by the other countries in South Asia. So, it is important that we have to involve the private sector in improvement of higher education in this country. When the Hon. Indika Gunawardna was the Minister of Higher Education in this country, he was lamenting that though he allocated Rs. 50 million to the Eastern University to start a course in Computer Technology, they would admit only 25 students per year under that scheme for Computer Technology.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member your time is over. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I will wind up, Sir. With an investment of Rs. 50 million, the university system can provide admission only to 25 persons. But, if you give that Rs. 50 million to a private sector entrepreneur, I am sure he will be able to produce at least 250 graduates using those funds every year. So, we have to look at private sector involvement in higher education as a positive measure. But, it has to be regulated and done in a proper manner, unlike international schools.

Thank you. [. . 3.27]
