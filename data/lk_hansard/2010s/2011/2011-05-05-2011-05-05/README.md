(a) Will he inform this House whether a feasibility study has been carried out by now to find out the possibility of using the energy of ocean waves as a source of generating electricity?

(b) Will he state the possibility of using the energy of ocean waves competitively with other renewable sources of energy?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I thank the Hon. Minister for giving me a detailed reply. My first Supplementary Question is, will the Hon. Minster agree that the use of energy of ocean waves as a source of generating electricity is being implemented by most of the countries in the world?

( ) (The Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka) , , , - - . -tidal waves-, -wave energy , wave momentum -, -ocean thermal energy- .

- ocean thermal energy conversion - . . .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) My second Supplementary Question is, if the feasibility report has not been studied, from Unawatuna to Panama, as the Hon. Minister says, - ( ) (The Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka) It is a pre-feasibility study that was done.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Will a feasibility study be carried out in the near future?

( ) (The Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka) A pre-feasibility study had been done, not a feasibility study. A complete feasibility study has to be done.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) If that is so, as I said, this is a very important matter as far as energy generation is concerned. Will that project of generating electricity from ocean waves as another source of renewable energy be taken up by your Ministry as early as possible? ( ) (The Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka) Yes, we are exploring the possibility of using ocean wave energy as a source of energy and as a clean green energy in the near future.

"The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat al Qaeda."

He further says, I quote:

"After nearly 10 years of service, struggle and sacrifice, we know well the costs of war. These efforts weigh on me every time I, as Commander-in-Chief, have to sign a letter to a family that has lost a loved one, or look into the eyes of a service member who's been gravely wounded. So Americans understand the costs of war."

That is, to collateral damage.

"1. Allegations concerning the targeting of civilians or clearly excessive attacks"

"Under international humanitarian law and the Rome Statute, the

death of civilians during an armed conflict, no matter how grave and regrettable, does not in itself constitute a war crime. International humanitarian law and the Rome Statute permit belligerents to carry out proportionate attacks against military objectives.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . [. . 4.59] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Mr. Presiding Member, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to participate in the Debate on the extension of the state of Emergency. According to the Public Security Ordinance, only when there is an emergency situation or chaos in the country, you can declare a state of Emergency, not otherwise. I ask the Hon. Prime Minister to inform this House whether there is any emergency situation or chaos in the country. Recently, at a press conference, the Hon. Prime Minister stated, We have also noted some controversial persons arriving in the country under cover. We have to retain Emergency Regulations to track such persons. The normal law is quite sufficient to arrest those people the Hon. Prime Minister has in mind. Just to arrest those people, you do not need Emergency Regulations.

It is when Emergency Regulations were in force that extortions of money took place in Colombo. Two or three police officers and the co-ordinating secretary of a Minister were caught red-handed extorting money at the Peliyagoda Fish Market. Earlier, there were similar extortions at the Kotahena Fish Market as well. Now, I understand, they have been released on bail. Why could the Emergency Regulations not be used to detain such persons who extorted money? About three weeks ago, a person who had been studying in the United Kingdom came to Jaffna on holiday and he was taken into custody by people who came in a white van, manhandled and released later.

Sir, the real problem the country is facing is the rising cost of living. The prices of almost all consumer items - milk food, wheat flour, petrol and gas - have gone up. But, we do not find anybody protesting about the rise in prices. When I was in New Delhi sometime back, the Indian Government increased the price of petrol only by Rs. 2 and there was a mass protest and the whole of India came to a standstill. What are our Members in the Opposition doing now when the prices of all consumer items are going up?

When I joined the Government Service in 1953, I was paid only Rs. 150 and I needed only Rs. 65 for my expenses for a month. I used to wear John White shoes at that time. But, what is the position now? Is the salary enough at least for one week? The Government servants were promised a salary increase of Rs. 2,500. Has that been paid? When are you going to pay that?

Recently, the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella, Minister of Mass Media and Information and Cabinet Spokesman, stated in a press conference that the TNA accepted the Report of the Panel of Experts appointed by the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, as we are representing the LTTE in Parliament. This only shows that he has not read the Report. There were 40 pictures attached to the Report and further they have faulted the LTTE as well. What is said in the Report is not new to us. We all knew that these things happened. I want to inform the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella and the other Hon. Members of this House that we are not representing the LTTE but we are representing the people of North and East, who sent us here.

More than 20 people who were in army custody remain missing. The Government must inform the names of the people who are in custody now. A database of the persons in custody was promised but it is not forthcoming.

The Sri Lankan Government needs to respond to all allegations of disappearances with more than a ritual blanket denial, said Brad Adams, Asia Director of Human Rights Watch. He further said, Family Members of those disappeared have the right to know if their loved ones are alive or dead.

Sir, another issue is, between Mavattapuram and Keerimalai on either side of the road, a mass scale of quarrying is being done by V.V. Karunaratne & Company and these stones are crushed, and the crushed stones are kept there in several heaps. Then, these crushed stones are being taken by this company to some other place. The army says that this area is a high-security zone; I do not know who has given this contract to V.V. Karunaratne & Company. When you go to that place, you can see the machineries and tippers. As I said before, there are several heaps of crushed stones on either side of the road. This has caused very deep pits near the cement factory and hence the sea water might come in at any time. You can make the cement factory functional and use these limestone to make cement. The wealth of that place is being taken out to somewhere else. I have brought this to the notice of the GA and the Commander of the Security Forces there.

Finally, I also want to refer to the question of Privilege raised by the Hon. Suresh Premachandran, MP in this House, about two days ago, as to how he and his private secretary were treated by army personnel. These things happen in Jaffna as there is no civil rule. Therefore, we, the TNA, oppose the extension of the state of Emergency. Thank you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . [. . 5.14] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Presiding Member, I am compelled to express my views over the Emergency law which is in existence for the last 25 years and get its life span extended every month. Although it is going to be a bitter experience for me, it is my duty and responsibility to comment on it on behalf of the people who had elected me to this Parliament.

Today, the Advisory Board appointed to advise the UN Secretary-General, which consists of powerful countries like America and Britain had collectively created a grave situation in which the sovereignty and the good image of the country is being seriously threatened. Their interference in our internal matters is not healthy for us. As a passionate citizen of this country, I believe that it is my utmost duty to point out that the Emergency law and the related violations are the principal causes to set out a base for this bitter situation. This law justifies the violation of human rights and threatens the media freedom. On many occasions, it did not allow to express objections even in a democratic manner. This law allows to keep anyone detained for any period of time without the consent or order of a court of law. Totally, this law is used as a main weapon to violate and confiscate the democratic rights provided to the people of this country.

During my recent visits to the Anuradhapura, Vavuniya, Jaffna and Welikada Prisons, I could see the impression of the cruelty of this law and I also looked at the living Tamil prisoners who had fallen victims to its

fierce grip without any justice or humanity. I also listened to the grievances of the Tamil prisoners who had been detained for as long as 5 to 18 years making them virtually losing any hope for survival. Recently, the Chief Justice, the supreme authority of justice in this country, ordered to file action against those who were charged and to release the others forthwith. As the Attorney-General has not given his permission up to now, those who can be released are yet kept under detention. I wonder whether the democracy of this country has been pushed to a pathetic state in which even the order of the Chief Justice is just neglected.

I wish to ask this respectful august Assembly, one question. If the Attorney-Generals Department is unable to file action against a suspect, does it mean that the Department is inefficient or functioning with mean communal views? You maybe aware and admit that a 18-year period bears a very considerable portion in human life. How cruel is it to detain a person for 18 years in a prison without any justification? According to law, a prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment is supposed to spend 20 years in jail. From this, five years will be deducted if his performance is satisfactory. Then, on account of further allowances, leave et cetera, a life-sentenced prisoner could come out in 10 to 12 years. But, how cruel is it to keep a prisoner for 18 long years without an order from a court of law. When a person is detained in jail, he is completely isolated from his parents, brothers, sisters, community et cetera. He is totally separated from his traditional ethics and related functions and also from the roots of his culture. This is a serious violation of human rights.

I met a prisoner in the Anuradapura Prison, who was suffering from grave agony for not getting permission to attend his mothers funeral. Similarly, every prisoner I met there was in the extreme edge of agony and has virtually lost hopes for survival. It is appropriate to point out that the suspect charged for the attempted suicide attack on the ex-President, Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunga, had admitted his charges and was sentenced to imprisonment. But, the Hindu Priest and his wife in Batticaloa arrested in this case have been detained in jail for the last eight years leaving their two children in an orphanage. Cases are filed against some suspects with certain charges, but they have become just "postponement" cases. No witnesses or lawyers are present, no documents are submitted and the routine manner is just to call the cases for the sake of calling and then postpone them. The Chief Justices order to release the suspects on bail while the cases are being called, has also been ignored. I wish to point out that this Emergency law paves the way for violations to be made by the Attorney- Generals Department.

Hon. Speaker, respectful Members, we were informed that the list of the detained Tamil prisoners would be released during discussions between the Government and

379 380

the TNA. We appreciated and welcomed it. But, even after three rounds of discussions and even after indicating three dates for their release, what we faced was only sheer disappointment. How pathetic and grave it is for the wives of the ex-fighters to keep on wondering for years if their husbands are still living or dead. Similarly, can anyone simply ignore the pathetic situation of the parents who live in anxiety without knowing the fate of their disappeared children for so long? Many wives are still struggling to decide whether to erase the kunkumam supposed to be the pottu in red from their foreheads and whether to remove their thali for good. What a great sorrow it is for a woman. In a democratic country, can we allow any citizen to live in an atmosphere without knowing if his or her beloved ones are simply missing, detained or dead?

If the promises given at the initial stage of the discussions are not executed, can we believe that the decisions to be made at the oncoming discussions will be fruitful to solve the ethnic issue? Our expectation is that. The initial failure must not end up as a total failure. However, nobody can deny the fact that this Emergency law allows total permission to the Attorney-General's Department and to the related parties for violation of the law.

Under these circumstances, we have no other alternative but to vote against the extension of the state of Emergency.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Presiding Member, in this House today, again we are going through the unfortunate process of extending the state of Emergency. Two years after the war has ended, at a time when we should be going for reconciliation, we are having a Debate today on the extension of the state of Emergency.

Every Member representing the Government who spoke today made it a point to reject the UN Secretary-Generals advisory Panel of Experts Report. I think they believe that rejecting the Report, speaking against it and denouncing the UN Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Panel is the only way to establish their patriotism to this country and their loyalty to the Government. This is very unfortunate.

Today, we are living in a civilized society. When civilization started, step by step, so many rules, so many laws and so many regulations emerged, evolved. They all evolved because the right of one man should not infringe on the right of another. In a society, there is a way we are supposed to live and to enable that, the civilized society evolve so many laws and rules. Similarly, in the international world, in the global society, we have created an institution called the United Nations. All nations which joined the United Nations signed the UN Charter; they accepted the rules and regulations of the United Nations and they pledged their acceptance and agreement to abide by the regulations of it.

We, Sri Lanka, are one of the founder members of the United Nations movement. The United Nations Organization has its own rules and regulations. Under

that, the Secretary-General of the United Nations has a right to appoint a panel to advise him. The Hon. (Dr.)(Mrs.) Sudharshini Fernandopulle, while speaking, said that this Panel is illegal, that it did not have the approval of the Security Council of the United Nations or the members of the United Nations. The Secretary-General has every right to appoint anybody to advise him and that does not need the sanction of the United Nations General Assembly or the Security Council. This Panel of Experts has issued a Report. If the Secretary-General is to act on this Report, then he has to get the endorsement of the Security Council or the members of the United Nations before he proceeds further.

At this stage, what should the Government be doing? The Government should address the issues that have been raised in this Report of the Panel, deal with those and also pursue this in a diplomatic manner so that the international community can be convinced that there were no issues in Sri Lanka or that we are doing our best to make good whatever losses that took place during the war or during the last phase of the war and that we will reconcile the issues that have arisen during the end of the war. Without doing that, what are we doing? We are arousing the people; we are making rhetorical statements; we are only making things worse again. We are creating a fear psychosis; we are creating a phobia in this country and we are using the media to the extremes.

Soon after the Report came out, there was a private media institution which aired a programme to start their news each day called Rata Wenuwen 8. On the first day, they showed the atrocities the LTTE committed, killing civilians in this country. We never approved it; we are not a part of it and we do not approve the killing of any person.

In fact, when the al-Qaeda leader was killed on the 2nd of May, there was euphoria in the US. A friend of mine sent me a message. He said, I will not rejoice over the death of any man. I will only mourn the death of one or even many. I cannot rejoice over the death of any person. That is the humanity; that is how we should be. But, what do we do? We are arousing the people. That particular TV programme I was speaking about showed on the second day that the Tamil people in this country are being treated equally. Maybe, the laws say that but in fact, is it happening? There are grievances of the minorities; there are grievances of the Tamil people. All governments in this country, right from the late President J.R. Jayewardene up to President Mahinda Rajapaksa, have accepted that there are grievances of the Tamils and the minorities. That had been acknowledged when His Excellency the President appointed the All Party Representative Committee and also the All Party Conference.

He said that there are differences and they have to be reconciled, they have to be addressed through our own

387 388

mechanism and set up the APRC to evolve a solution, a home-grown solution, to the ethnic conflict in this country. What has the Government done with it? They have just thrown it away into the wastepaper basket. The Chairman, who was shown to all foreign visitors as the symbol of the peace process, is today not talked about. So, this is the reaction of this Government to reconciliation, which is very unfortunate.

While the Hon. (Dr.)(Mrs.) Sudharshini Fernandopulle was speaking, she mentioned about collateral damage. Our good Friend, the Deputy Minister of Economic Development, the Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, in his speech said, We did everything to minimize the deaths during the last phase of the war but still there may have been casualties. We regret it. That is exactly what the UN Panel, the United Nations and the whole world is expecting from Sri Lanka. The Report of the United Nations Secretary-Generals Panel of Experts on accountability in Sri Lanka states this so well and clearly. It states that there are five core categories of potential serious violations committed by the Government. They have been listed as, I quote:

(i) killing of civilians through widespread shelling; (ii) shelling of hospitals and humanitarian objects; (iii) denial of humanitarian assistance; (iv) human rights violations suffered by victims and survivors of the conflict, including both IDPs and suspected LTTE cadre; and (v) human rights violations outside the conflict zone, including against the media and other critics of the Government.

These are the accusations against the Government and at the same time, in the next paragraph, they list the atrocities and the accusations against the LTTE.

(i) using civilians as a human buffer; (ii) killing civilians attempting to the flee LTTE control; (iii) using military equipment in the proximity of civilians; (iv) forced recruitment of children; (v) forced labour; and (vi) killing of civilians through suicide attacks.

Here, it is so clearly stated that the LTTE used civilians as a buffer and the Government can accept this fact and that civilians did really die not due to their own action but due to the circumstances of the war in the last phase.

The Government should reconcile the minds of those people who are suffering today because they lost their loved ones. The Hon. E. Saravanapavan, in his speech said that today the women are in a dilemma. They do not know whether their husbands are alive or dead. They are unable to wipe off the pottu on their foreheads because they are not certain that their husbands are dead and they are fearing to keep that pottu also because it is considered wrong to have the pottu if their husbands are dead. Similarly, they are unable to decide whether to have their thali around their neck or whether to remove it because they do not know whether their husbands are alive or dead.

. . ( ) ( . . - , ) (The Hon. H.R. Mithrapala - Deputy Minister of Livestock and Rural Community Development) Hon. Member, why do you not talk about Osama bin Laden as well? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Osama bin Laden? What has Osama bin Laden to do with our country? - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. H.R. Mithrapala) Why not? - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I am talking about our country. I am talking about reconciliation between the Tamils and the Sinhalese so that we can live unitedly in this country. - [Interruption.] You also do not get carried away. You are a good lawyer. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Do not behave like this.[Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I do not mind you calling me that. My heart knows that I am not a traitor.

I am a faithful citizen of this country. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. H.R. Mithrapala) You are supporting terrorism.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Never, I have never been. I have never been and will never be a supporter of terrorism. I have never taken to arms. I do not believe in violence. I do not believe in winning my beliefs through violence. I can never support a terrorist. I have sat with the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana to create a peace agreement between our people so that we can live unitedly forever.

You always say that the war was not against the Tamils but against the terrorists. Today, we have people in the prisons. Our former Minister of Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms is present here. Why do we allow people to visit those criminals who have been convicted? I believe and you believe that they are criminals. They are people who have done wrong: they may be murderers; they maybe rapists; they maybe rogues. They could be put in prison for several reasons. During the period they are in prison, though you and I think they are criminals, for their family members, they are brothers, they are fathers, they are sons, daughters or a sisters. What do these people do? They make every occasion possible to go and visit them, to buy something for them, to make at least one day of the month somewhat happy for them, even though they are in prison. Why do we do this? Because human relationships are beyond what a man does or does not do. What did this Government first do? There were cemeteries built by the LTTE. Maybe there are terrorists who are lying under those tombs. But, the families of those terrorists still think of them as brothers, fathers, sons or sisters. For them, once a year, they take an opportunity to go there and worship for their souls. This Government used bulldozers to destroy all these cemeteries and put up army camps and cantonments over them. This cannot lead to reconciliation. You have to sympathize with your enemy, understand him and address his issues. Only that will lead to reconciliation. Are we willing to do that? Only when we do that, we can get rid of not only the UN Panel, but no panel can take action against our country if we are willing to face realities. To take up the issue that we are facing today in a realistic manner, we have to reconcile.

Recently, the TNA went to Vavuniya. They were promised that they will be given lists of persons who are presently in custody. My Friend, the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena was supposed to go with them and get the names. Do you know that one newspaper had questioned as to why Sajin De Vass Gunawardena was put to discuss this when he is only a backbencher. But, I thought that was a very good thing. He has the direct ear of His Excellency the President and he can do something useful and his being in that discussion will be very effective, I

thought. And, when I read in the newspapers that the TNA is going to be having access to the TID's database, I was very happy that the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena had succeeded in convincing the powers that be, to give or disclose this information. Unfortunately, they did not get it this time also. It is very good if you do that. That will destroy the Panel Report to some extent. That is reconciliation.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have to wind up now. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, please give me two more minutes. ( ) (The Presiding Member) That is too long. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) So, for reconciliation, you disclose those names. Then, as the Hon. E. Saravanapavan said, if those persons, the families, are unable to reconcile themselves whether a person is dead or alive, those wives who are still in a dilemma as to whether they should wipe off their pottu, remove their thali or not, will be able to do it. Then, we can have true accountability, the account of the number of people who would have died during the war as collateral damage. I do not call it the killing of people willingly by any government or any forces or anybody. It is collateral damage caused partly by the LTTE because they held them as human buffers and partly by the Government which overlooked them and went on with the war. So, those people who are found dead after that have to be compensated. Those families, those relatives have to reconcile themselves to the realities. So, there has to be an opportunity given to those people. Only then we can have reconciliation and true peace in this country.

Sir, I will not speak for a long time. I have just one sentence to add. True reconciliation can come only if the cause for the war is eliminated from our society. That is equal treatment to all communities and meeting the political aspirations of the Tamil people of this country. Only then, we can reach true reconciliation and permanent peace in this country and I hope the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena can contribute towards that.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Can I ask you one question?

391 392

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Go ahead, please. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Reconciliation is a process that is definitely taking place step by step. But, in the same spirit, you being a Member of the Tamil community, the elite Tamil community, - if I may say so - why can you not think about reconciliation of your differences with the Hon. S.Thondaman also? Let us start there. Let us start reconciliation between the same community first and we will approach reconciliation most certainly.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) This is not reconciliation between persons - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) His Excellency the President will definitely approach that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan)

Thank you.
