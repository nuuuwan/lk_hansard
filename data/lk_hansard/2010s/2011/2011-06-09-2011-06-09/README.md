Sir, there were persons such as T.F.A. Latheef, A.J. Kareem and also A.L.M. Yusuf, a talented radio artiste, who can sing Ghazal and Qawwali very well in Sinhalese and Tamil too. , , .. , , . .. .

Finally, Sir, I have a duty to perform. The other day, the Hon. Leader of the Oppositions beloved mother, Mrs. Nalini Wickremasinghe, passed away. See how generous and large-hearted our President was. He issued a condolence message which states: In this moment of bereavement, the President commended the role of a mother played by late Nalini Wickremasinghe who bequeathed to the country leaders committed to serve the nation. That was the opinion of the President of this country. Irrespective of party politics, he and the First Lady visited her house, paid their respects at the funeral and issued that condolence message for the whole world to know. We too condole her death because I myself knew Madam Nalini Wickremesinghe well. I used to go to the 5th Lane house when when Mr. Esmond Wickremesinghe was living. In those days, I, as Minister of State for Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs, used to present Mrs. Wickremasinghe with a packet of dates, annually. She used to write to me in handwriting beautiful letters, which are in my possession still.

But, I am sorry to say that the son of this great lady, without keeping up to her expectations - . . . . , . . .

, . very senior journalist, who also comes here to report House proceedings, gave me a paper bag. This is a bag in which somebody had sold something in the market of Kandy. It has the scriptures of the Holy Quran "Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem" - "In the name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful", inscribed on it. All the surahs of the Holy Quran start with that, you know it very well, Mr. Presiding Member. I am very happy to address this House on this subject when you are presiding. These bags have been made out of the pages of the textbooks published by the Department of Education. Somehow or the other, those have reached the "kadalakarayas" and the other paper vendors in the market and they have made these bags out of these. We are against that and are always against exhibiting pictures of even Lord Buddha, Jesus Christ and other religious persons for commercial purposes. They should be punished. I will be bringing this matter to the notice of the Government and the Hon. Prime Minister, who is also the Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs. This should be stopped forthwith and the culprits who took the pages out of the school textbooks issued by the Department of Education and sold it to the "kadala kade" for them to make these bags should be punished. Sir, I can see you bending, signalling me to sit down. Sir, there is another Regulation to be brought before the House, on which I may say a few words.

Thank you very much again, Sir, and I say that this is a great and one of the happiest moments in my life in Parliament since I was able to address the House on this subject when an Hon. Member of your calibre, talent and intellectual capacity was presiding. [. . 4.16]

: : ANIMALS ACT : REGULATIONS

[. . 4.45 ]

. . ( )( . . - , )(The Hon. H.R. Mithrapala - Deputy Minister of Livestock and Rural Community Development) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I move,

"That the Regulations made by the Minister of Livestock

Development under Section 35, read with Section 3, 3AA, 11, 26 and 34 of the Animals Act, No. 29 of 1958 and published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1629/17 of November 26th 2009, which were presented on 05.04.2011 be approved. (Cabinet approval signified)"

As far as the legal provisions with regard to animals and animal products are concerned, Animals Act, No. 29 of 1958 plays a pivotal role to save and safeguard the valuable animals in the country. This was initially enacted in 1958 to regulate the slaughter of animals; enable the restriction, control or regulation of the removal of animals from one district to another; make provision for the branding animals and for the issue of vouchers in respect of animals which have been branded and to regulate the sale and transport of such animals; provide for the seizure and detention of animals which commit trespass and for the assessment and recovery of damages of such trespass; provide for measures for the improvement of the breed of animals.

The unique animal identification system has been already developed and implemented throughout the country which will enable easy traceability with the use of special ear-tags replacing the conventional branding system.

I would also like to inform that we have already started awareness programmes for all stakeholders and the Department of Police also. The special handout has been designed, published and circulated to all Divisional Secretaries, Police Stations and to relevant stakeholders in order to make the public aware of it.

In this connection, I also like to mention that the following programmes have been developed for the improvement of dairy sector during the period 2010-2015 in order to make the country self-sufficient in milk:

Production system based on smallholder dairy farms development programmes

Medium-scale dairy development programmes Feed resources development programmes Consumption promotion programme of domestically produced milk and milk products Improving efficiencies in milk marketing chain programme Cattle breeding programme Veterinary services improvement programme Research programmes Manpower development programmes and Institution development programmes

According to the requirements, the said Act has undergone three amendments by Act No. 10 of 1968, Act No. 46 of 1988 and Act No. 10 of 2009 in order to regularize the shortcomings in the Act. However, the regulations formulated under the provisions of Animals Act, No. 29 of 1958 and subsequent amendments are not adequately fulfilling the legal requirements to achieve the intended national objectives.

1319 1320

Therefore, more strong regulations have to be formulated covering every aspect to address the present demand and the global trends in achieving national and international standards in livestock farm registration, identification and traceability of animals, safety of foods of animal origin, animal welfare, animal care centres, usage of animal in research and depopulation of animals. Improvement of livestock sector has become an indispensable part in the accelerated development that takes place in the country in line with the Mahinda Chintana which envisages doubling the number of milk cows enabling self-sufficiency in milk in the country.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, in achieving this task there are many obstacles to be curbed such as illegal transport and slaughter of cows, cruelty to animals, poor supporting services and substandard animal husbandry practices.

Contagious diseases of animals that could easily be spread through illegal transport of animals is also considered as a major threat affecting productivity of animals as well as the well-being of the public.

These regulations have been formulated in order to strengthen the previously formulated regulations and newly formulated regulations for establishment and maintenance of animal care centres, more specific animal identification and traceability system, introducing animal transport system conforming to the welfare of animals and active involvement of veterinarians in the whole process. In achieving the daunting task spelt out in "Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future" these regulations will contribute enormously by supporting and facilitating the huge development programmes already planned, launched and initiated by the Ministry of Livestock and Rural Community Development.

Sir, I would like to mention here that two of our Members in this august Assembly have proposed two Private Members Motions in this regard.

Under these circumstances, I believe that the regulations I have presented become very important. These regulations solve the problems confronting the facts I have mentioned earlier.

Even at present, five welfare centres have already been registered. Apart from this, I have instructed the National Livestock Development Board to separate a suitable farm land for this purpose. I have also planned to commence small-scale welfare centres at the District Secretary's level .

Thank you. . . Question proposed.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Anura Dissanayake. You have 30 minutes.

Mr. Presiding Member, it is very appropriate for me to make certain comments on these important Regulations presented by the Hon. Minister of Livestock and Rural Community Development. I think this House would definitely give its approval for the Regulations under the Animals Act.

Two hundred and sixty thousand people escaped from the LTTE and ran away to safe areas. The security forces led by our great, gallant soldier, Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa saved them.

Technical colleges and other educational centres have been established in those areas. Vast amount of development is taking place in those areas daily. The Mahinda Rajapaksa regime has ensured not only the right of the man but also the right of the animal. This must be borne in mind. ?

Where were the human rights activists in the worlds when people were chased away and killed by the bayonet of the Tigers? What were the people who are now fighting for the human rights in the world doing then? These questions must be asked from all conscious and right-thinking people. What is happening across the Palk Strait is politics. Let them do their politics; Hon. Saravanapavan, let us do our politics together here in order to revive the society, relocate the people and give them habitable places, make them educated, build hospitals and roads for them and give them electricity. All those things are done under the "Mahinda Chintana." ! ! - , - , .

... . I gave an interview to the BBC. In that I produced all these three books, "Mahinda Chintana" written in English, Tamil and Sinhala. Also, there is a book written in Tamil for the first time, "Mahinda", written by our good friend, Mr. S. Thilainathan. , . . . A comprehensive book written for the first time on the life and deeds of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa is now out and it will be issued to schools, libraries and other places. I

quoted "Mahinda Chintana" for the BBC, and described it as our Magna Carta. I quote: Blending all your thoughts Develop man towards preserving the family Develop family towards preserving the village Develop village towards preserving the country And develop country to win the world.

This is what "Mahinda Chintana" states in Sinhala: " ...."

, . When I read this out to the BBC interviewer, he was surprised and said, So far nobody has told us what the contents are. This is not only an Election Manifesto, but it is a philosophy of a President who thinks well about his countrymen, his citizenry.

"Mahinda Chintana" is also a development manifesto. This is the Chintanaya that unites Sri Lanka. This is the Chintanaya that fights against all the foreign forces in this country, all the conspirators who try to destabilize the country, whether they are here or abroad. Some of the people in the Opposition - I do not want to name them -

, . ; . . . , ; . . ? . , . , ? . . , , , , , , , , . , . He knows the world condition. This is a very crucial time for Sri Lanka. It is the development we are trying to achieve. We are trying to make a wonderful Sri Lanka for the future generations. Therefore, he must join hands with the President in order to develop this country. This is his country and my country. If we get together, there will be a beautiful and united Sri Lanka for us to live happily.

This morning we discussed this matter at the Consultative Committee presided over by the Hon. Arumugan Thondaman. The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah and the Hon. Mohamed Aslam were also present. I am very happy that the authorities concerned have now issued certain circulars to the police and about the precautions they have taken. The circulars are in regard to how many animals could be taken in a vehicle, prohibition of their torture, and issuance of medical certificates as to the health of the animals. Yes, according to Islam, you must have healthy animals, not sick animals. That is specific as far as the Qurbani Law is concerned. The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie, our senior Minister, is here. Once, he was in charge of the Muslim Affairs in this country. He knows it well. I brought to the notice of the Hon. Minister that bringing Regulations is one thing, but when these animals are transported, it is well and good if we see to the safety of the animals and that they are not tortured. . . - this lorry or the transporting vehicle can transport only this number of animals or cattle, not beyond that . We accept that. Therefore, we are very happy that the Ministry has prepared those guidelines and given to the police stations but what happens in certain areas is, there is always mischief makers. People are harassed. They have to obtain the medical certificate, the Grama Sevaka certificate, the Divisional Secretary's certificate and all that. All those should be complied with by whoever who wants to transport animals. We agree with that, but harassment should not be there.

The police have been very helpful to us. I remember, Sir, the other day, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa had a conference in which the former IGP, Dr. Mahinda Balasuriya, the Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie and the Governor, Mr. Alavi Moulana and all of us participated. There, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa gave certain instructions because the Constitution guarantees us our religious freedom. According to that, "Qurbani, Ulhiyya" has got to be given by the Muslims and there should not be any sort of impediment to that. Strict instructions must be given to Police regarding this matter of transporting animals for Qurban.

Sir, there is another matter. There is a copy of a flag that has been sent to me by some farmers from Jaffna,

which says, " 27 " - "National War Heroes Memorial" - " !" Now, this flag is being sold in schools as well in Jaffna. But, there is no Tamil in that. Earlier, I said in this House that a paper was given to me by a well-known journalist, Mr. Puththirasigamoney, one of your friends, Hon. Saravanapavan. That is about Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. That is a different thing. This was given to me by another senior journalist, Mr. F.M. Fairoos. I am thankful to him. I have brought that to the notice of the Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs. Sir, they asked me to inform the Government. I spoke to the Defence Secretary, Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa. He was surprised that such a flag has been printed only in Sinhala and English in Jaffna. Straightaway, he ordered withdrawal of this. That is the way our Leaders who understand - he did not know that this has happened - and respect the Tamil culture and the Tamil community act. Our President has gone down in history that on behalf of the 70 million Tamils living in this world, the only person who spoke in Tamil in the United Nations is none other than His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, our dear President. This is the way that he treats the Tamils and the Tamil language. We may have certain difficulties about journalists in the North. He is looking after all those things. He is very friendly with you, Hon. Swaminathan. He is friendly with all the journalists. Which leader of a country would invite journalists to have breakfast with him every month at his official residence? It is done only by our President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Therefore, Sir, I an happy to say that this has been corrected and timely action has been taken. On behalf of the Tamil-speaking people, I thank Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa and also my good friend, Mr. Puththirasigamoney who brought this to our notice through certain farmers of the Northern Province. - [Interruption.] Yes, of course, the Hon.. Saravanapavan has all the right to interrupt me. Hon. Saravanapavan, I will give way.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) A letter was sent by the Ministry in charge of the Tamil language. But, the entire letter is in Sinhala. I bring that matter to your kind notice. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Please do that. We will bring that to the notice of the higher authorities once again and definitely attend to it.

Sir, the Medical Research Institute has recommended that an individual must consume about 100 millilitres of milk per day. See, how much of attention His Excellency the President is paying to these matters; he is definitely

1339 1340

receptive to the needs and requests of the people. He promised, in the last Budget, that the price of a litre of liquid milk would be increased to Rs. 50. So, if the JVP, without killing cattle, rear about 50 cows or produce about 50 litres of milk per day, they will earn about Rs. 5,000 a day. They can definitely increase their income if they could rear about 100 cattle. So, let them do that instead of killing four-footed animals and double-footed human beings; let them rear these cattle and earn a good income.

Also, I would recommend to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and the others in his rank to have a good cup of milk daily. . . That is very good, Sir.

In Batticaloa, I have over 9,000 members; in the Jaffna District, I have over 8,000 members and in the Mannar District, I have over 4,000 members. It is the same with Batticaloa and Kalmunai. If you take the first six districts, there is only one district from the South - that is Puttalam. All other districts are from the North and the East. Actually, that shows the confidence the fishermen have in us and in our progamme. Even yesterday, my Friend, the Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathan, Member of Parliament, brought 200 odd people from Waikkal. The first thing they wanted was to join my Organization.
