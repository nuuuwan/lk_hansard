Azwer) Hon. Deputy Speaker, the attire that should be worn by the Hon. Members of Parliament is strictly prescribed. If anybody enters the House attired contravening that etiquette, he would be sent out of the Chamber immediately. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition demonstrated and removed his tie in this House, which means he did not follow the etiquette that is prescribed for the Hon. Members of Parliament. Under normal circumstances, if your eye catches him doing so, you would have asked him to withdraw. So, for doing that and violating the Standing Orders, I think you have to take action in order to suspend the Hon. Leader of the Opposition from attending Parliament. Not only that, he demonstrated to the world that he was removing it; he said he was removing it. After he removed it, with only the coat, his attire cannot be accepted because it should also have a tie. The Hon. John Amaratunga cannot wear a tie with the dress he is attired in.

(ii) whether the Minister has spoken with Indian counterpart on this matter?

(d) Will he also state whether Sri Lankan Government insist that India stands by the previous agreement of handing over Katchatheevu Islands to Sri Lanka, and they have no claim to such an Island which Sri Lanka legislatively and historically owned?

(e) If not, why?

() .. ( ) ( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Deputy Speaker, the first part of the Question - part (a) - is whether I would inform this House when India officially gave up their claim on the Kachchatheevu Island. I would like to tell the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake that there was no question whatsoever of India giving up a claim to the Kachchatheevu Island because India did not assert sovereignty over the Kachchatheevu Island. So, there was no giving up, there was no handing over, it is not a situation where India had sovereignty and India then decided to hand over sovereignty to Sri Lanka. It is not a situation like that at all.

What really happened was that in 1974, there were negotiations on the historic waters in the Palk Bay and the Palk Straits and Sri Lanka, - Ceylon, as the country was then called - was able to establish, through historical evidence, that we had consistently exercised sovereignty over the Kachchatheevu Island. We made use of records which went back to 1665, to the time of the Dutch East India Company. The Government of Ceylon made use of extensive records including maps, correspondence and legislative instruments, which clearly indicated that since 1665, Ceylon exercised sovereignty over the Kachchatheevu Island. So, that was the position which was clearly reflected in the Agreement that was signed in 1974 between the Governments of India and Ceylon.

Sir, now I would like to tell my Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, that this position is very clearly set out by my counterpart in the Government of India, Sri S.M. Krishna, the Minister of External Affairs of India in a statement which he made to the Lok Sabha. These are the words of the Indian External Affairs Minister. I quote:

I wish to bring to the attention of the august House that our fishermen have access to visit the Island for rest, for drying of nets and for the annual St. Anthonys Festival, and that the rights do not cover fishing around Kachchatheevu Island.

We will have to also bear in mind the fact that as per the Agreements we have concluded with Sri Lanka in 1974 and 1976, Kachchatheevu Island lies on the Sri Lankan side of the Maritime boundary. These Agreements were laid before Parliament. Therefore, as far as the Government of India is concerned, the issue of Maritime boundary between India and Sri Lanka, and consequently, that of sovereignty over Kachchatheevu Island is a settled matter.

It is a settled matter. As far as the Government of India is concerned, there is no question about that at all. It is absolutely settled. So, that is my answer to the first part of the question, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

In part (b) of the Question the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake asks me whether I will table the agreements signed by the Governments of Sri Lanka and India on the rights of Kachchatheevu Island. I shall be happy to table* the Agreements.

The Agreement in 1974 is initialled on behalf of Ceylon by the then Prime Minister, the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike and on behalf the Government of India, it is signed by Srimathie Indira Gandhi.

In part (c) (i) of the Question, the Hon. Member asks whether I would state why various claims are made by Indian political personalities trying to revive the Indian claim on the Kachchatheevu Island. I regret, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that I cannot speculate on the motives of other persons as to why they are making statements. As far as the Government of India is concerned - and that is what matters - there is no dispute or controversy with regard to this matter at all and in the words of the distinguished External Affairs Minister of India, it is a settled matter.

Then in part (c)(ii) the Hon. Member also asks me whether I have spoken with my Indian counterpart on this matter. I have not done so. I frequently talk to him on matters which concern both our Governments. There was however no need for me to discuss this matter with him at all because there is no issue or problem with regard to sovereignty over the Kachchatheevu Island.

The fourth part of the question, part (d) is, will I state whether Sri Lankan Government insist that India stands by the previous agreement of handing over Kachchatheevu Island to Sri Lanka?. There is no previous agreement Mr. Deputy Speaker, there is a current agreement. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake has misdirected himself and this part of the question is based on an erroneous conception of the current situation.

Under those circumstances the fifth part of the Question - part (e) does not arise.

- * . . Produced at end of Answer.

. . , .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, my question was framed 11 months ago, when the claim came from nobody else but the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Mrs. Jayalalitha. She made the claim and if you try to say that I am trying to rake something which is non-existent, I guess that it is a preposterous lie. I am sure that you yourself is convinced that my question was based only to protect the territorial integrity of this country. I am happy that the response that has come has only proven that it is totally in the hands of Sri Lanka. So, on that basis, the question needs to be answered only through Parliament, which has now been done. So, coherently, Mrs. Jayalalitha can back out of the claim rather than go forward on this issue.

If this is the case and you maintain such good solidarity with India, why do you not pursue on the land bridge? Hon. Minister, you were with us in the UNP Government, with the Prime Minister then and the Leader of the Opposition now, when we proposed the land bridge. Now, that the Kachchatheevu Island problem is no more, there cannot be any problem with the international maritime. So, why do you not ensure that the land bridge between Sri Lanka and India is put to place because certainly it will be useful in today's context for the trade that is expanding in this area.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Deputy Speaker, these matters are resolved on the basis of allocation of certain responsibilities to certain agencies of the State. It is very clear that a matter like this falls within the purview of the Central Government of India. It is the Central Government of India that can decide matters relating to sovereignty and questions involving relations with other countries. There can be no better evidence of the categorical stand by the Government of India than the authoritative statement made by the External Affairs Minister of India on the Floor of the Lok Sabha. That is final; that is conclusive. There is nothing more to be said about the matter. The land bridge is a totally different matter. Of course, we can discuss any issue with the Government of India. The depth and the range of that relationship makes the resolution of any problem possible and that is not related to the Question which the Hon. Member has asked here. He has asked about Kachchatheevu; he has not asked about a land bridge. But, that and any other matter can certainly be discussed in a very amicable manner between the Governments of Sri Lanka and India.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, my second supplementary question is, you mentioned that you have an extremely healthy relationship with the Minister of External Affairs of India, which we appreciate. I mean, with your experience, with your knowledge, you should be having that. If that is the case, why do you not also pursue CEPA, which you and I started, to expand trade between Sri Lanka and India? It will be helpful because one of the few efficient Ministers of that side, the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, is having problems with the Kachchatheevu. Seventy three fishermen have been caught and are having problems. If there is no problem, then why does Tamil Nadu keep mentioning this? So, I guess with todays answer, you have put us to rest from a Sri Lankan perspective. But, please ensure that no such bellyaches take place in future.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Well, we would certainly appreciate suggestions of this sort, which are made in good faith by distinguished Members of the Opposition. As I said yesterday, foreign relations represent a field in which there must be a certain spirit of solidarity and working together, between the Government and the Opposition, and it is in that spirit that I respond to the constructive suggestion that was made by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. I would like to say that the Government of Sri Lanka is placing a very sharp emphasis on connectivity and as far as the railroad systems are concerned, very considerable progress has been made. The Government of India has been supportive and I would also like to tell the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake about the Colombo-Tuticorin ferry service and also what is contemplated -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That ferry service is suspended. Is that correct? () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Yes, temporarily. Now, Talaimannar-Dhanushkodi is also being considered. You are aware of the very large number of flights linking Colombo with Indian cities. So, any other suggestion which would enhance connectivity between the two Governments will be very seriously considered by us. In fact, the theme of the Seventeenth SAARC, which was held in Addu City in the Maldives very recently was Building Bridges, connectivity. So, that is an area in which we are very much interested and we would consider seriously your suggestion and discuss matters with the Government of India.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, the third supplementary question that I would like to ask you is, obviously, the sensitiveness of India and Sri Lanka spreads out within the geographical location of Sri Lanka. The Chinese invasion into the economy has certainly perturbed this and more serious statements have been made on this than the Kachchateevu issue. On the other hand, the Indian ports are proliferating day by day there and also a statement was made by no other person than one of the senior Ministers in Parliament that a loan from China is being converted to equity and the Hambantota Port may have equity participation of the Chinese. Has the Minister of External Affairs of India or anybody from India mentioned the futuristic problems that may arise owing to certain major countries taking control of our economic activities which is very sensitive to them? So, let us try to ensure that such problems may not occur in the future and how have you handled this situation vis--vis the problem that is there before us?

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Well, Mr. Deputy Speaker, this is another attempt to create a problem that does not exist. We have extremely cordial relationships with India and we have equally cordial relationships with China. Both countries are very active and vigorous participants in the economic development of our country at this crucial time. They both are tried and tested friends who have stood by this country through thick and thin and we are proud of the quality and the depth of the relationship that this country enjoys today, both with India and with China. There is no tension and no Minister of the Indian Government has raised this matter with me, and I state again that this is not a helpful approach to these issues. It is on the contrary, an attempt to create problems when none exists.

Thank you.

(a) (i) The Rent Board has not conducted entitlement enquiry number 2690.

(iii) This matter does not come under the purview of the National Housing Development Authority and this is a matter that comes under the powers and responsibilities of the National Housing Commissioner.

(b) It will be determined by the fact whether Mrs. Punyavale Nalayini will be able to meet the required legal criteria at the inquiry currently being conducted by the National Housing Commissioner.
