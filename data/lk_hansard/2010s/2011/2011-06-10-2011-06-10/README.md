.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Speaker, I thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to speak on the Vote of Condolence on the death of the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne who was a very close associate of mine. Our family has known Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratnes family for about three generations and I gained a tremendous amount of knowledge from the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne. He

studied at Royal College and subsequently pursued higher studies at the University of Ceylon where he was honoured with a Bachelor of Arts in History. Then, he entered the Ceylon Civil Service and became a great administrator. His father was Sir Edwin Wijeyeratne who was a Member of the State Council for the Kegalle District, a Senator, an Ambassador for Sri Lanka in London and he was knighted also. With that background, Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne was a true human; a true gentleman. He was a philosopher; he was an academic; he was an administrator; he was a religious person; he was a poet and above all, he was a true human. That is what I would like to emphasize here. Although he was a Buddhist, he respected all other religions. He respected Hinduism; he respected Islam; he respected Christianity and he was of great value to the society.

I can well remember when he contested for the post of Diyawadana Nilame in 1975, I acted as his lawyer and I appeared on his behalf for the election. I was greatly privileged to serve him and from there onwards, I was greatly honoured by being with him in many fields, politically and otherwise. He was a Minister in His Excellency J.R. Jayewardenes Cabinet. Prior to that, he held the post the permanent secretary in two Ministries. Then, he was the Government Agent in Anuradhapura and the Acting Government Agent in Jaffna. He was the pioneer who started the Anuradhapura Sacred City Project. He established the Sri Lanka Cultural Triangle. When he served in the UNESCO, he was very keen to start this project. He was a true Buddhist and a person who really adhered to the principles of Buddhism. Being an administrator and a politician, he had administered this country to great heights and it is our duty as Members of this august Assembly at least to learn the great aspirations that he had in his mind. He was a great reader; a voracious reader. He knew administration of many languages. He knew and read on any subject. He could speak on any religion even without referring to any documentation; that was Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne.

In the same way, he was fortunate to have a lovely wife called Nita Dullewe and she was also a great pillar of strength for his success. He was also blessed with five children. The eldest son is Neranjan Wijeyeratne who was also the Diyawadana Nilame of the Sri Dalada Maligawa. The second son is Mano Wijeyeratne who was with the United National Party. Unfortunately, he is not with us in the UNP today. He had been a Member of Parliament for about 15 years. Today he is an adviser to His Excellency the President and he also was a great asset to his father. His wife is the Honorary Consul-General for Turkey. The third son is Anuradha Dullewe. He is a planter by profession and did a lot as far as his own field is concerned.

His fourth child was Lankesh Wijeyeratne. He was a lawyer by profession and a very lively person, but unfortunately he predeceased his father. The fifth child is Nishangani Wijeyeratne. She is the only daughter of the

1401 1402

[ ]

2011 10

late Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne. She got married to Mr. Hulangamuwa who is a chartered accountant and he is now the Director of Sunshine Holdings.

Hon. Speaker, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to speak a few words in respect of Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne and I hope he would attain nirvana.

Thank you. [..2.50] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Gamini Wijith Wijayamuni De Zoysa - Deputy Minister of Education) , , . , . . . , , . . , -, , - , . . , . , , , , . .

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) I am happy to be able to participate at this point and speak a few words to express my respect and condolence to the family of the late Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne,

1413 1414

2011 10

who was the son of Sir Edwin Wijeyeratne and Lady Leela Wijeyeratne. I have many reasons to speak today.

One is that the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne represented Parliament from the District of Kegalle, which I too represent. My father was a contemporary and a close friend of the Hon. Nissanka Wijeyeratne. Furthermore, the Hon. Nissanka Wijeyeratnes son, Manoda Wijeyeratne and I were also colleagues who contested together and served together in this House. At the same time the late Nissanka Wijeyeratnes brothers, Dr. Cuda Wijeyeratne and the late Tissa Wijeyeratne, were very close family friends. I remember when I was a child I used to go to see Dr. Cuda Wijeyeratne as our family doctor. The late Tissa Wijeyeratne was a close friend of my father who studied together in England. They had two completely opposing political doctrines - my father was a Conservative and the late Tissa Wijeyeratne was a Marxist, but they were good friends. All this has a certain bond and an obligation for me to say a few words of this great man.

His children, Neranjan, Manoda, Anuradha, Lankesh and Nishangani, have served the community in one way or the other. They have been worthy children of a worthy father. I think lots of things have been said about his service. So, I need not repeat them. But, it is important to say that he went to Jaffna as the Government Agent with Major General Richard Udugama in the wake of the 1958 riots. He was sent there to look after the issues and he did a grand job. In his service in Anuradhapura as the Government Agent, the late Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike entrusted on him the implementation of the Anuradhapura Sacred City Project and everybody knows how well he did that. He held many positions and finally, under the late President J.R. Jayewardenes Government, which was made of many giants, the Hon. Nissanka Wijeyeratne was one of those great giants in that Cabinet. He had an exemplary period of service and he was the Education Minister and even today, people in all villages in the Kegalle District speak about the service he rendered. A lot of people were given education, jobs and the level of the service was greatly enhanced by the work during his period. This is one of the things people still speak about.

The highlight of his career which really shows his greatness, not only as a politician, but as a statesman also was that when he was the Minister of Justice. Following the 1983 riots, there was a prison riot in Sri Lanka in July in which dozens of people were killed in prison. As the Minister of Justice, the Hon. Nissanka Wijeyeratne resigned from his portfolio. This is something exemplary and something we do not see today. That was his greatness that went beyond being a simple politician and to be graded as a true statesman. When he became the Diyawadana Nilame and after that, little did he or his family think that his son would also succeed him as Diyawadana Nilame. I think Mrs. Nita Wijeyeratne can be one of the few or perhaps the only mother in Sri Lanka who can say that she had a husband as the Diyawadana

Nilame and also a son also as the Diyawadana Nilame. She holds that honour.

I would say that the Hon. Nissanka Wijeyeratne was a man of great versatility. In his public life, he displayed not only wisdom but wisdom with humour also. He was a lovable man. Once Professor Carlo Fonseka had introduced him as a scholar, a poet, a politician, an ambassador and a prestigious civil servant; a lot of words to describe a single person. In fact, as my Colleague the Hon. Gayantha Karunatilleka rightfully said, the collection of his poetry, which was called Ape Appachchi put together by his children was actually a great collection of his works.

I would also like to recollect a story that somebody told me. The Hon. Nissanka Wijeyeratne was a close of friend of Prof. Carlo Fonseka. During the 1980s, in the uprising of the JVP insurrection, Prof. Carlo Fonsekas son was in trouble with the army and there was an imminent arrest. At that time, the Hon. Nissanka Wijeyeratne intervened and ensured that his friends son was all right. He went to great extents to make sure that he was not taken in.

Now, again when you look at his son, the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne, there was a similar episode at one point, when Mr. C.A. Chandraprema was taken to the fourth floor and was being harassed, the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne was one of the first few with his wife Bharathie who got involved to make sure that Mr. C.A. Chandraprema was not harassed unduly and that he was released. So, you see the greatness that runs in the family. That is something we should appreciate.

In closing my remarks, I would like to say that one of the greatnesses of the Hon. Nissanka Wijeyeratne was not only that he loved and respected Buddhism, but he equally loved and respected other faiths and religions also. I express my condolences and respect to the family on behalf of the people of Kegalle District.

Thank you.

[.. 3.54 ] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I rise in this House today to pay my humble tribute to the memory of a great personality who rode as a colossus in the political, religious and

social firmament of Mother Lanka. He inherited a noble culture; a great Buddhist background. An intellectual of repute, a scholar of fame, a philosopher in his own right, an advocate of religious persuasions and an enlightened personage of multi-religious concepts - he is Deshamanya Dr. Nissanka Parakrama Wijeyeratne.

Sir, I have lot of things to say but, you are limiting my speech. Therefore, I would only say this much. I chose to speak particularly in English because people in India adore him. The should understand what I am saying about their hero. He has attended several conferences in India particularly in Kayalpatnam and his scholarly disposition is still being talked about in the corridors of the Indian Muslim leaders and even in the Tamil Nadu State Assembly.

Deshamanya Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne was born to a leading family in Sabaragamuwa on 14th June, 1924. He passed away on 07th January, 2007 at the ripe age of 82. He was the son of that great Buddhist nationalist, Sir Edwin Wijeyeratne, who served as the Minister of Home Affairs and Rural Development. It is during this time Sir, one of our greatest patriots, a national leader, a freedom fighter and the leader of the Muslim community, Dr. T.B. Jayah, came in close contact with Sir Edwin Wijeyeratne and carried the National Flag of Sri Lanka to its greater glory!

A former old Royalist, Dr. Wijeyeratne, graduated with BA (Honours) in History at the University of Ceylon, and thereafter served in the then prestigious Ceylon Civil Service. He was conferred an honorary Doctorate of Philosophy by the University of Colombo in 1978.

He was the secretary to the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. When he was the Chairman of the Radio Ceylon I came in very close contact with him. He wanted Muslim scholars to come and record their speeches in their own language. He encouraged the recital of the Holy Quran through the radio at that time which is being well carried forward by Mr. Hudson Samarasinghe, the present Chairman of the SLBC. He was elected to the post of the Diyawadana Nilame or Chief Lay Custodian of the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy for ten years from 1975. In fact, his eldest son, Neranjan Wijeyeratne served in that post thereafter. Dr. Wijeyeratne also delved deeply into Sri Lankan sociology and religious philosophy. He entered politics and was elected from the Dedigama electorate at the General Election in 1977. He served as the Minister of Education, Higher Education and Justice in 1977. He served as Sri Lankas Ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1990 following the foot steps of his great father who was the first High Commissioner of Independent Sri Lanka in Great Britain. He was an Executive Committee Member of UNESCO and his profound interest in scholarship was seen in the interest he showed in his proposal to revive the ancient library at Alexandria.

1419 1420

It is during that time, Sir, he came in close contact with Dr. Ananda Guruge, Dr. A.M.A. Azeez who was another great scholar, a senator and the principal of Zahira College, Dr. S.I. Imam of the University of Peradeniya and Dr. Allama M.M. Uwise. He got the real taste of the Islamic lessons from these great Muslim Savants. Dr. Wijeyeratne's in-depth knowledge on Islam was remarkable, and was seen in his participation at the Islamic-Tamil Research Conference held at Keelakarai in Tamil Nadu, India. His deep interest and affiliation to the spiritual guru of Sufism in Islam, the ubiquitous Mohideen Guru Bawa, in his search for spiritual enlightenment was legendary. He made inroads into the works of Imam Gazali, Ibnu Arabi and the famous poets like Omar Khayyam, Imam

Sa adi, Kusro and Allama Iqbal.

His in-depth knowledge on Islam was revealed when he addressed a distinguished gathering at a ceremony to celebrate Allama Iqbal organized by the Pakistan High Commission in 1980s wherein he spoke in depth on "The significance of Tawaf" or circumambulation around the Kaaba at Makkah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

A collection of the late Dr. Wijeyeratnes famous English poems ranging over two decades was published titled, "Ape Appachchi: An Anthology of Our Fathers Poems" in 2001. He was honoured with the sublime title of "Deshamanya" by the President of the country.

Sir, there is another significant contribution he made to make the Sri Lankan history colourful. That was in regard to the declaration of the National Flag. The present National Emblem of Sri Lanka was created in 1972 under the ideas and guidance of late Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne. At that time, he was the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and the Chairman of the National Emblem and Flag Design Committee. The designer of the National Emblem was the Venerable Mapalagama Wipulasara Maha Thero.

During the same year, in 1972, four leaves of the Bo tree were added to the four corners of the Sri Lankan National Flag under the direction of late Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne. Prior to 1972, the corners of the flag were occupied by symbols depicting spearheads. The four Bo leaves added by late Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne reflect the core principles: Mettha, loving kindness; Karuna, compassion; Upeksha, equanimity and Muditha, happiness.

Sir, as the Cabinet Minister of Education and Higher Education, late Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne introduced the Universities Act No. 16 of 1972. The new superior court complex in Colombo was established by late Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne with Chinese Government aid during his

tenure as the Cabinet Minister of Justice. He established the Sri Lanka Cultural Triangle with aid from UNESCO for preservation of national heritage sites in Sri Lanka and proposed the Sri Lankan President's Fund which provides health and education assistance to the needy and underprivileged even today.

The Hon. Nissanka Wijeyeratne also set up the Sacred City of Anuradhapura and shifted the urban city to the newly created Anuradhapura town and he is responsible for the establishment of the Anuradhapura Airport.

Sir, this House had been adorned by distinguished personalities in the past representing generations. I can recall the names of the late Right Hon. D.S. Senanayake, the Hon. Dudley Senanayake and now the Hon. Vasantha Senanayake. Then, Sir, there is the Rajapaksa family of the late Hon. D.M. Rajapaksa, the Hon. D.A. Rajapaksa, the Hon. Lakshman Rajapaksa, the Hon. Roy Rajapaksa and the His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa, the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa, the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa and the Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa. Then, there is the distinguished family of the Gunawardanes of Boralugoda firm. Hon. Philip Gunawardene, the Hon. Robert Gunawardene, the Hon. (Mrs.) Kusuma Gunawardena, the Hon. Indika Gunawardena, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena and the Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena and his aunt, the Hon. (Mrs.) Vivienne Goonewardene and the Hon. Leslie Goonewardene too.

Then comes, Sir, our hero, the late Sir Edwin Wijeyeratne, the late Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne and the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne. The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne was very close to us when he was in the Government. He sat next to me, Sir. Whenever I wanted to raise a point of Order, he was very helpful in getting the Erskine May. As a result, Sir, I was able to stop the Proceedings of the House twice or thrice when the then Deputy Speaker, the late Hon. Anil Moonesinghe was presiding. He came to Puttalam and started the palmyrah industry there. He was also gifted with a great, versatile and able wife, Bharathi, whom we know very well, was the Consul-General for Turkey in Sri Lanka. The Hon. Mano Wijeratnes familys shadow overshadowed her when she sought the assistance of the Turkish Government to put up a massive and colourful housing scheme, architecturally very beautiful, in the Weligama area.

Then, Sir, I must also not forget the late Hon. T.B. Ilangaratne and Hon. (Mrs.) Tamara Ilangaratne and the late Hon. Rajaratna and the Hon. (Mrs.) Kusuma Rajaratna. Then, there is the Mudliyar, A. Sinnalebbe who proposed a Motion on the National Flag in the State Council. There were Mudliyar A. Sinnalebbe, the Hon. Latheef Sinnalebbe and the Hon. Rizvi Sinnalebbe. We must also not forget the late Hon. Reggie Ranatunga, the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga and the Hon. Ruwan Ranatunga

who are with us. There were the Hon. M.E.H. Mohamed Ali and the Hon. M.E.H. Maharoof who came from Eastern Province.

He also served as a Second Lieutenant in Ceylon Artillery of the Ceylon Army Volunteer Force. Though I have so many things to tell about his life, Sir, I would only say that we condole with the members of his family.

Lastly I would like to quote from "Thirukkural" which he asked me to quote every time when I was with him because he liked books and other things. There is a quotation which aptly describes the man: " . " " " . That means, one who showers loving kindness - Meththa - is the one who is considered of a noble birth.

[ .. 4.04] ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake - Minister of Public Management Reforms) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I wish to associate myself with the Vote of Condolence on the late Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne for two reasons: mainly because he was a very close colleague and associate of my father, late Hon. Gamini Dissanayake and also for the fact that I am a very good friend of the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratnes son, the ex-Parliamentarian and Minister, the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne.

The Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne comes from a very noble lineage in Sabaragamuwa. He was a politician par excellence, a civil servant and also a diplomat in the final stages of his life. I would say that the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne is a politician of the old-school, where honour and integrity mattered a great deal. He was a star in the galaxy of stars in the 1977 Cabinet of the late President J.R. Jayewardene.

Men of the calibre of Ranasinghe Premadasa, Lalith Athulathmudali, Gamini Dissanayake, Nissanka Wijeyeratne, Ronnie de Mel, E.L. Senanayake were all members of this "Superstar Cabinet' and I am very happy to say that the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne was an old-school politician who held the principles of integrity and honour as the core values of his political career.

A politician like Nissanka Wijeyeratne was motivated by the core principle of service to the people. Power to him was service; power to him meant empowerment of people; power to him meant nourishment and upliftment of the constituency that he served in Kegalle. Therefore,

as a Cabinet Minister of Education he was able to give a large number of appointments to graduate teachers. Also, the fact that he comes from a very distinguished lineage mattered a great deal to him because he knew that he has to uphold the very noble principles of integrity that his family stood up for.

His brother Tissa Wijeyeratne was a barrister by profession. He served as a Sri Lankan Ambassador to France and Switzerland, Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Defence and as the Senior Adviser on Foreign Affairs to the then Prime Minister, (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike. The late Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne also has one younger brother, Dr. Cuda Wijeyeratne who is a consultant psychiatrist. He was also a noble member of the Ceylon Civil Service. He had also served for a brief period in the Ceylon Artillery Volunteers as a Second Lieutenant.

His contribution to the National Flag was mentioned earlier in this noble august Assembly. He also had a large role to play as the Minister of Justice in establishing the new Superior Courts Complex. He was the singular force behind the establishment and construction of that courts complex, maintaining close ties with the Peoples Republic of China.

The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer mentioned the fact that he brought in the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978. But, I would like to emphasize here that the University of Ceylon was the only university in Ceylon from 1942 until 1978. As a result of this Act, it was separated into five independent universities: University of Colombo, University of Peradeniya, University of Jayewardenepura, University of Kelaniya and University of Jaffna. So, you can see the contribution he had made by looking at the emphasis given to his service. Although we talk about this today, not many people know about it. But, the fact that we have five very strong independent universities running today in this country is a large measure to the contribution that the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne had made.

Also, as a politician in the J.R. Jayewardene Cabinet from 1977 to 1989, he distinguished himself as a very humble human being, whose core values were never compromised. So, in this sense, I feel, my friend and colleague, the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne, has to play a larger role than he is playing now and contribute in a much more meaningful and positive way to the values that his father brought forward through his generation.

So, I do not want to take too much more time here. I am very happy to be associated with this Vote of Condolence. On this occasion, I convey my condolences to the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratnes family. May he attain Nibbana!

Thank you very much.

, IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ISLAND WIDE PROGRAMME TO EDUCATE THE MASSES IN DESTROYING WASTE MATERIAL SUCH AS POLYTHENE, PLASTIC ET CETERA [. . 4.12 ]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I move,

That this Parliament resolves that an island wide programme to educate the masses in destroying waste material such as polythene, plastic etc., be implemented since the usage of polythene and plastic material has rapidly increased in the island and large scale environmental pollution is taking place due to the indiscriminate disposal of such material.

The reason as to why this Private Members Motion is being brought in, is, not that you can eradicate the usage of polythene, but the reduction of such waste material, which is highly non-destructible would certainly help to reduce pollution in this country. As you know, Sir, there can be waste material in any place of a city in a country. Even when we pass places like Parliament, we can see there is enough waste material. All we want to do is to ensure the reduction of such waste material.

Sir, if you take the reduction of waste material, it only helps to reduce the pollution. If I take the Colombo Municipal Council as an example, which has only five Electorates with 2.5 million people, you would know that there is roughly 850 tons of waste material coming out of it. Of this waste material, 65 per cent is supposed to be wet waste material and 35 per cent being dry material. Of the 35 per cent dry waste material, I have been informed reliably by professionals who are in the recycling process, that polythene accounts for almost 30 to 40 per cent of the garbage.

So, you can see that at least about a hundred tons of polythene has come into use. Now, this is the reason why being responsible citizens, it is necessary to guide the people in the correct way and this Private Members Motion is only to raise awareness.

We have a very active Minister and I am sure he has already embarked on this. Of course, that does not necessarily mean that the law by itself can bring this

problem under control, but awareness and I think deterrent effects will certainly bring this under control. So, I am sure your Ministry would have done the needful, but I would appreciate if you could raise more public awareness programmes through media. For example, television is a medium through which you can reduce the peoples unawareness on these types of things. It is true that polythene certainly can help reduce the cost of living; there is no question about it, but the resultant factor is that using of polythene will increase environmental pollution. So, that is a spin-off effect on both sides: on one side it will reduce the initial cost and on the other, it will increase the cost for the recycling process. On that note, I would appreciate if the Ministry can raise certain awareness programmes through the state media and I am sure that that can play a very positive deterrent effect to the people concerned.

Furthermore, I am informed that Al Gore who has been fighting for global warming has mentioned in his address to world in various issues that when you try to destroy such polythene which is difficult to destroy, it affects the Ozone Layer and global warming will take place.

Now, here it is not something that what is done in Colombo will have an impact on the world by itself. But, if every country, every city put its act together, then we will certainly have a safer world tomorrow. Now, that is the concept which I thought and the necessity to bring in such a Private Members Motion and to solicit the assistance of the Government in order to make this issue known and ensure that it goes forward. Hon. Minister, if you look at the country by itself, you would see that a lot of areas where earlier things were done by paper are done by polythene now. I think one of the biggest offenders are the political parties themselves. But, I am sure the political parties have realized this and over the last couple of years they have changed their attitudes and a more user- friendly or more ozone-friendly materials are back again. Unfortunately, the cost factor is the prohibiting factor in doing such reversal activities. So, the Government must look into these type of things and give tax relief, where required, because recyclable paper or recyclable polythene is not all that cheap. So, all I want to do is not to take too much of time in trying to labour the point because I am only trying to preach to the converter. But, Hon. Minister, I am sure your Ministry can play a much more proactive role to educate the younger generation in destroying waste material such as polythene.

Today, the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake is doing a ferocious and changing attitude towards the higher education which I appreciate. Likewise you can do something from the lower grade so that the people will inculcate in their thinking that, this is the way forward. Then, they are also held responsible as world citizens or as the citizens of the nation and that inculcation will help them to make a safer world tomorrow.

Hon. Minister, sometimes you might come out with the question as to how you can collect the money. I thought of linking one particular area which will help in order to ensure such revenues are obtained. I know that getting resources is not all that easy, but if you look at the Galle Face Green - that is how I basically thought of this idea - you can see the amount of polythene that is collected in one particular evening. Now, just in front of that you have got the land which was there for the army headquarters that was sold out to Shangri-La Hotel. Now Shangri-La, maybe a flagship company, coming into the country. There was a tax of 100 per cent that was enforced on such a company, but today that company is exempted from paying that 100 per cent tax in Sri Lanka. That tax exemption amounts to Rs. 6.75 billion. Now, Rs. 6.75 billion is not collected from them. So, you could say, "Okay, you are a flagship company. Ensure that you pay "x" amount of money for environmental activities. This could be a way to generate money and I am sure you could take this idea up with the Cabinet of Ministers and ensure that if it is difficult to obtain such revenues, this is the way you could probably get those revenues from companies which are exempted from tax because a sum of Rs. 6.75 billion is not a small amount.

It certainly can be utilized for the betterment of the countrys activities for which money is starving. Furthermore, when you look at this, it only provokes me to think about the areas of obtaining money for this type of activities. I have just received the booklet that comes along with the Annual Report of 2010 issued by the Central Bank and in this I was searching for where the revenues of this sale are shown. But, I do not see the revenue booked in under the accounts of Sri Lanka. Every country has a Balance Sheet. Every country has a Profit and Loss Account. On that basis, you account for the revenue that comes in and the costs that you incur. When you look at the book that shows fiscal responsibility, it is necessary that the revenue you generate be shown in it. But, I do not see the money that has come in from the sale of land to Shangri-La Hotels shown in the accounts of Sri Lanka. I would like to ask the question - we, Parliamentarians are held responsible for public probity according to Article 148 of the Constitution on financial matters - why monies that have come in have not been booked in the accounts? This Rs. 6.75 billion is only from Shangri-La Company. What about CATIC company, which is another Hong-Kong company that has bought another 5 acres from close by, for which the tax exemption is accumulating to Rs.11 billion? For that, the tax exemption was Rs. 11 billion - that is Rs.11,000 million. That has not been accounted. That shows that it is absolutely wrong according to the accounting system. You would wonder as to why I am venturing out from the subject of polythene to accounting, but I am only trying to tell you how you can bring money in, if you do not have money in your Ministry, Hon. Minister. Therefore, I am only digressing from that area

to say that, if by chance you do not have money, this is the way that you can tell the Cabinet of Ministers of how you can collect money for your activities.

So, I do not want to take too much time on this. I hope that this House would unanimously resolve on this Motion since through this we are trying to educate, inculcate and ensure that each citizen of our country plays a role in terms of reducing global warming whereby little Sri Lanka also would be able to play our role for the sake of the world we live in. I hope we would get a unanimous resolution on this Motion and also I hope that the Hon. Minister would carry this project forward before too long.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you, Hon. Member. Hon. D.M. Swaminathan will second this Motion. [. . 4.22 ] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I second the Motion and I just want to speak a few words on this. Can I speak a few words, Mr. Presiding Member? ( ) (The Presiding Member) Of course. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Thank you. I think this is a very important project. Implementation of this project is important especially to younger generation. They should be educated on the eradication of polythene and throwing waste material around the streets of Colombo. But I think the Government has now taken some stringent measures in this regard. I can see that there are bins kept all over the Colombo city and there is a basic system put in place in that way. I must say that it is a commendable thing. As the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake clearly laid out, the Galle Face Green becomes completely a mess on Sunday evenings. I think the main reason for this country gets flooded and mainly the city of Colombo gets flooded is due to the blockage of drains. Drains at the place where I stay in get completely blocked within a couple of minutes after a heavy shower. So, there is something radically wrong in the system. These are the factors that are really blocking the system.

There is another fact that I would also like to bring to your knowledge, Mr. Presiding Member. We are now

1429 1430

talking about environment. I have seen a number of vehicles owned by the security forces, like army and police, that belch out fumes while we are talking about a Green System in this country. I have not taken down the numbers of those vehicles. But, I just wanted to bring it to your kind notice that we should put a stop to this because the environment has now changed. I must say that today the Government has taken steps to give a good facelift to Colombo and we must congratulate the Government for it but there are many more things to be attended to. This system should be eradicated for the sake of the younger generation. Schools should be notified how to eradicate the usage of polythene and implement this project. Thank you.
