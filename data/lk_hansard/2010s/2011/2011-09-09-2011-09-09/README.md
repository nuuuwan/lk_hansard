A man of peace, a man of culture, a man of reconciliation, a man of sports, a man committed to democracy, a man of unity and amity, a man of religion - these sublime qualities exemplify the late Hon. Lakshman Jayakody.

He was a devout Buddhist. He served the people of Gampaha nay the whole country in an exemplary manner. He was a shining example of leadership. He was also a shining example of dedicated service not only to his people but also to humanity as a whole. We understood him well. His long and colourful career was a lesson to all Parliamentarians. He was appointed as the Minister of Cultural Affairs five times. He also served as the Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs. He added glamour, colour and dignity to that position. It was amazing to talk to him. As the then State Minister for Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs which office came under him, I realized how well he understood the intrinsic value of Islam. He fully well knew the problems of the Muslim community not only in this country but also the world over. He was in charge of the Wakfs Board which administers all the mosques and Muslim charitable Trusts in this country. He was also at one time instrumental in sending Sri Lankan Muslims to the Holy City of Mecca for the performance of Hajj - the last wish of every Muslim. He grasped the finer points of the Sharia Law. He also used to read the Dhammapada. . . , .

Sir, he was always very inquisitive to read this magazine which is in my hand, The Muslim World published by Motamar Al-Alam Al-Islami, President of the World Muslim Congress, Senator Raja Muhammad Zafarul Haq of Pakistan, Secretary-General of the World Muslim Congress and our own Mohamed Haniffa Mohamed, a former Speaker of our Parliament who is a Senior Vice-President of the MOTAMAR.

Sir, the World Muslim Congress leaders were very much concerned about the plight of the Palestinians. For

thirty long years our President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, headed the Sri Lanka-Palestine Solidarity Association espousing the cause of those hapless people of Palestine.

I would like to quote a piece of this Magazine, The Muslim World. If the late Hon. Lakshman Jayakody were alive, he would have been very much agitated to know this. He was very keen to know as to what was happening around the Muslim world.

This article under the title War crimes in Afghanistan written by S.M. Hali, Political and Defence Columnist, published in this magazine The Muslim World" states, I quote:

The latest issue of German daily Der Spiegel and US journal Rolling Stone disclose an abominable and grotesque spectre of psychopaths in the United States Army, who murder Afghans in cold blood and brandish their victims severed heads like hunting trophies.

It further continues, I quote:

The Der Spiegel story is aptly titled: Das zweitte Abu Ghuraib; while the Rolling Stone Op-Ed The Kill Team: How US soldiers in Afghanistan Murdered Innocent Civilian tells the same story. The grisly description pertains to a group of US soldiers from Bravo Company of the 3rd Platoon-part of the 5th Stryker Brigade, deployed in Afghanistan, who took it upon themselves to eliminate innocent Afghans only for their perverted pleasure. One of the culprits, Corporal Jeremy Morlock even severed the little finger of his first victim Gul Mudin, an unarmed 15 year old Afghan youth of La Mohammad Kalay and has carried it around as a souvenir. The mental depravity of the group has reached the stage that appalling photos of the dead have been treated like a war memento and passed from man to man...

. Afghanistan . They were carrying those as war mementoes, Sir. It is appalling; cannot digest. It goes on to state further, I quote:

.... the United States Government has categorized a large number of people as unlawful combatants,...

They are themselves awoken to the truth only now.

... a US classification, which denies the privileges of prisoner of war (POW) designation of the Geneva Conventions.

Certain practices of the United States military and Central Intelligence Agency have been condemned by some sources domestically and internationally as torture.

Even in their own country, people did not agree to the worst crimes that they were committing. I quote further:

The hard fact is that the US armed forces are suffering from battle fatigue, having been engaged in needless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which have taken a toll of 4,765 US military personnel in Iraq, 2,403 in Afghanistan and having slaughtered 1,421,933 Iraqis and over 30,000 Afghanis at a cost of US $ 1,180,653,714,792, was bound to have an adverse effect on the US combatants and turn them into Kill Teams.

Just look at this, Sir, are they human beings?

.... sheer gory pleasure of killing afghans, throw sweets and candies out of Stryker vehicles and when hungry and destitute Afghan children rush to pick them up, they are sprayed with bullets.

439 440

That was the name of the game they were playing. Sir, the late Hon. Lakshman Jayakody knew these coming events. - - , .

. .

After serving Parliament for a long period of 35 years, he was appointed as a Senior Presidential Adviser. Whenever I used to visit the Presidential Secretariat, I always met him and paid my respect to him. His secretaries know this.

He used to sing and enjoy. He once sang a song in a musical programme on Rupavahini. I also participated in this programme called "Rhythm Chat". He sang this song: " "

. . " - "

Then, Sir, he asked me to sing a song in that programme. I sang this famous song:

" ....."

.

He hugged me with joy and happiness. Then, as I told you, " 45 " . . . 60 , . " ! !" . , , .

. . .

. , .

Sir, as I told you, the late Hon. Lakshman Jayakody was very much interested in Haj matters and it was only the day before yesterday that the entire Hon. Muslim Members of Parliament gave their pledge to the Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie to carry on with the Haj activities this time without any interference.

" - "

That augurs very well. The Western Province Governor, Seyed 'Jamal al-Lai' Alavi Moulana also attended this meeting. So, today, we need people like the late Hon. Lakshman Jayakody among us.

As you know, the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, the third holiest mosque in the Islamic world, was burnt down in 1968. That was the first Qibla direction towards which the Muslims faced and prayed. Now, look at this.

" "

(11.09.2011) '' .

"" . .. .

The fight is going on. It can be Bodh Gaya or the Pope's Cathedral in Rome. Of course, the terrorists have no eyes. Though there is recognition of religion, they even bombed the Dalada Maligawa and also the Jayasiri Maha Bodhi in Anuradhapura. We have to save all these religious places. I remember, when the Bamiyan Buddha Statues were broken by the Taliban in Afghanistan, the whole Muslim Community also joined the others to condemn that sacrilegious act. We cannot forget our most respectful Ulema Alhaj Moulavi Niyas Mohamed (Al-Gafoori) here. He led the procession against such demonic destructions in the world. Sacrilegious, he called them and he also made an international appeal in order to restore or rebuild the statues and it had been done.

Sir, there is another thing which I want to mention about the late Hon. Lakshman Jayakody. He was in charge of Muslim activities as the Minister of Cultural and Religious Affairs and we used to visit him regularly. He respected Muslim culture and traditions.

441 442

[ ... ]

2011 09

Now, Sir, I want to bring this to your notice. This is the most important thing about issue of identity cards to Muslims. 08.09.2011 '' . ,

" 1972 11 . 39 ,..."

.

I hope that this problem of issuing identity cards wearing the traditional headgear of the Muslim community will be solved satisfactorily. The Commissioner of Registration of Persons should clarify this position to the Muslim community. Sir, I do not want to take much of your time on this matter.

I must tell that the Hon. Lakshman Jayakody was also instrumental in encouraging particularly the Tamil and Muslim writers. I have in my hand a magazine called, Malligai written by that versatile and veteran editor, Dominic Jeeva who can be called the" father of the magazine journal" in this country. This is the 11th September issue. Denagama Siriwardana wrote a book in Sinhalese, Sir," " . '' .

" ! : ... "

... , , , . . . , , . " - " . . :

" . '' ... 2004 '' ."

This type of translation must be published more and more and it should help to build a strong bridge between literary and cultural affinity of Muslim community with the Sinhala community and others.

Sir, as I told you, the late Hon. Lakshman Jayakody served in this House as a distinguished Member for 35 years and ten months. What a long service he had in this House! What a remarkable personality he was! He was a model unto all the Parliamentarians now and for all times to come. He was born on 24th August, 1930 and breathed his last on 30th August, 2010.

He also helped the "Ahadiya" movement. I observed today Uwain Hadjiar of Gampaha listening to this from the distinguished Gallery. He was one person who was very close like a shadow to the late Hon. Lakshman Jayakody. The Hon. Lakshman Jayakody frequently visited Muslim areas like Thihariya, Allalamulla, Kahataowita, Kal-Eliya, Poogoda, Pasyala, Nambuluwa, Galoluwa, Ogodapola in the Gampaha District. He very much liked these areas. He was able to speak to their minds. The late Hon. Lakshman Jayakody knew the art of speaking to other religionists, because he understood those religions, their culture and their way of life.

Then in 1960, he was in Parliament for four years, four months and 28 days; in 1965, five years and four days; in 1970, one year, 11 months and 26 days; in 1972, four years, 11 months and 26 days. He had a very colourful distinguished career. Then in 1978, he was in Parliament for eight years; in 1989, five years and four months; in 1994, four years and two days; in 2000, he was there only for 26 days. In total, he has served this House for 35 years and ten months.

Therefore, Sir, on this occasion, I should say, not only as a Member of this House but also as a Member of the Muslim community, how grateful the Muslim community is to the late Hon. Lakshman Jayakody who served other communities and all humanities well. He looked after the Muslim community like his own children.

At last, Sir, may I covey my deepest condolences to his beloved wife, Pamitha whom we knew very well, who used to come to several functions accompanied by the late beloved husband - I also have visited his place at Alenmethiniyarama Road, Thimibirigasyaya, Kirulapona - also to Chandana who is following the footsteps of his late revered father and also a distinguished Member of the Western Provincial Council and to Arundathi, his loving daughter.

May I say, Sir, in our own language, may God bless his soul. !

[4.13 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Presiding Member. I am honoured to be able to speak today to record my appreciation of the service rendered by the late Hon. Lakshman Jayakody. I got to know him in the seventies, when he was the Parliamentary Secretary to the then Prime Minister, the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike, whom he served loyally throughout his political career. Those were difficult days, when the JVP insurrection had just been overcome, but the socialist measures taken by the Government led to hostility and misrepresentation in the West. I recall meeting Mr. Jayakody in those days at the

443 444

house of Mr. Tilak Gooneratne, our High Commissioner in London, who had served in the Commonwealth Secretariat, and could not understand the hostility that we then had to face. I remember in particular efforts to claim that the Government had used excessive force in overcoming the insurrection, ignoring both the danger we had faced and the manner in which Government soon restored normality, leading to the respect in which the JVP, after undergoing trial, subsequently held our judiciary. The rehabilitation process then, though slower than what the present Government has achieved, was thorough and much appreciated at the time.

Even more telling with regard to the challenges the then Deputy Minister of External Affairs faced was the concerted attempt of the British press to highlight conditions in the plantations and claim that these were due to racism on the part of the Government. That was shortly after the plantations had been nationalized, and Government was trying to improve the appalling treatment of estate workers which the British plantation companies had indulged in, while claiming - as has been graphically expressed by Colonel Derrick Nugawela in his fascinating memoir, "Tea and Sympathy" - that the welfare measures Sri Lankan managers proposed could not be implemented because of obligations to shareholders. But the balance sheet has always been more important than politicians will acknowledge, and I suppose we need to keep this in mind in analyzing and developing international relations.

Mr. Jayakody dealt manfully with such criticism, and I am reminded now of his equanimity when dealing with hypocrisies on an even grander scale. Subsequently, on the strength perhaps of our earlier acquaintance, it was he who contacted me on behalf of Mrs. Bandaranaike, to ask if the SLFP could publicize my letter of resignation from State Service following the deprivation of Mrs Bandaranaikes Civic Rights, the precursor to the seven lean years during which democracy was in effect suspended in Sri Lanka. Those were the days in which, after elections in Sri Lanka were postponed, the "Times" in London claimed that this was not a problem, because Capitalist Tea tasted sweeter.

Given her trust in him, and his ability to assuage the concerns of all the various factions in the SLFP, it was Lakshman Jayakody whom the SLFP nominated to the Attanagalla seat to replace Mrs. Bandaranaike after she was summarily thrown out of Parliament in 1980, an act which sadly went uncriticized in the Western media, given their predilection for the antics of the Jayewardene Government. But, despite his seniority, he was happy to allow Mr. Anura Bandaranaike to become the Leader of the Opposition in 1983, when the TULF Members vacated their seats, following the introduction of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution. That was the reaction of the then Government to the appalling attacks on Tamils in

July 1983, which the then President, Mr. J.R. Jayewardene seemed to condone in his Address to the nation on July 28th, in giving into what he claimed was the motivations of the attackers.

By the time the SLFP returned to office in 1994, Mr Jayakody was seen as belonging to an older generation, so he did not exercise any great executive authority. But, as Minister in charge of Cultural Affairs and Buddha Sasana, and in other respects, he continued to perform dependably and honestly, and continued an example to the younger members of his party.

Along with the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, he did yeoman service for Trinity College where he had been educated and helped to establish its title to areas such as the Asgiriya Stadium which had been developed by the College.

As the Hon. Member who spoke before me pointed out, his commitments to the values of other religions even while upholding his position as the Minister of Buddha Sasana and Minister of Cultural and Religious Affairs is something to be commended. His mild and conciliatory manner concealed the courageous commitment to his party and the democratic perspective on which his political career was based. Though short of stature, he stood firm with dignity and did not allow the serried ranks of Government to cow him when, for five long years, there were just about half a dozen Members of the Opposition in Parliament. He had belonged to the days when Parliament was a forum for debate and when the Speaker above the fray, held the balance between forces that had an equal right to be heard. As we head back, Mr. Presiding Member, to such a situation under the leadership of the present Speaker and all of you who sit in this Chair, we should remember with gratitude the example set by the late Hon. Lakshman Jayakody during those terrible days between 1983 and 1988 when Parliament was merely a tool to be manipulated at will, with only a few SLFP Members to withstand the absolute power of an unelected overwhelming majority

So, in remembering him today, Mr. Presiding Member, I am offering my condolences to his family. Let us remember the tremendous role he played in times of great difficulty.

Thank you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by both sides of the House on the death of the Hon. Jinadasa Nandasena, ex-Member of Parliament. I too would like to add my sentiments. He served the poorest of the poor. I knew him well and he lived a humble life - neither brought anything nor did he take away anything. While serving his people of the electorate he did not lose sight of the Muslim pockets at Welegedara, Kelaniya and also Akbar Town, established by the Malay leader Justice, M.T. Akbar where there is a large concentration of Malays. It was only the other day, my good friend, Mr. M.B.M. Mahir, the former Secretary-General of the Islamic Centre, a great patriot and a Muslim activist, a prominent broadcaster on the dissemination of Islamic knowledge, told me whenever a problem faced by the Makola Muslim Orphanage and the Home for Elders, established by the late leader Sir Razik Fareed and functioning under the aegis of Moors Islamic Cultural Home, the late Hon. Jinadasa Nandasena was good enough to help all those courses.
