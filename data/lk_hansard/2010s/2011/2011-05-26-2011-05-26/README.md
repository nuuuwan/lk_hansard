Many have been asking us, "You all are basically talking about such matters in Parliament, but what is going on in Parliament itself ?

This news items further states, I quote :

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, my first Supplementary Question is - I will ask them according to the Standing Orders - will the Hon. Minister explore the possibility of planting alternative trees in this area, preserving the watersheds of those mountains and the hilly places?

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Sir, that is the intention of the Ministry. We are taking all steps to preserve the watersheds in those areas. We have seen that in places where eucalyptus is grown, the watersheds have been affected. So, our intention is to remove the eucalyptus in a systematic manner to preserve the watersheds.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Then, the second Supplementary Question is, will you take steps to implement the provisions in the Declaration of the Nagoya Conference, which the Hon. Minister and myself attended in two sessions, in keeping with the Question I have raised, as far as the pinus and eucalyptus trees are concerned?

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Yes. We have taken notice of the problem and we will definitely take action on it. We have already earmarked in the plan how to cut the eucalyptus trees that have already been planted in various parts of the Island and definitely, those will be replaced by our own varieties.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, my third and final Supplementary Question is, in keeping with the national requirement or the need of the hour, when you uproot the eucalyptus and pinus trees, would vegetables be grown in those places for the benefit of the people of the country? - [Interruption.] Grass to feed you; grass to feed the Leader of the Opposition.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) We will find it out, Sir.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Thank you. See how nicely the Hon. Minister answered.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Okay. We will continue with this Motion on the next day.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I would like to state that we apologize to the members of the family of the Hon. Nissanka Wijeyeratne who have come here because we are unable to finish this Vote of Condolence today, and to bear with us because there are a large number of Members of Parliament, both from the Opposition as well as Members of the other parties who want to speak. Therefore, I think it is better to have another separate day in order to proceed with the Vote of Condolence.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Okay. We will continue with this Vote of condolence on another day.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Now, we will move to the next item.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Hon. John Amaratunga.

: : PRIVILEGE : BLACKOUT OF PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I have to raise a Matter of Privilege, Sir. I wish to bring to your notice about a serious breach of privilege that has occurred in respect of the proceedings of Parliament on the 25th of May, 2011; that is yesterday. I requested a digital recording of yesterdays proceedings - 25.05.2011 - and on an examination I found that the whole segment of the proceedings have been blacked out. - [Interruption.] This is what I was told. I do not recall the Hon. Speaker making a ruling to expunge any portion of yesterdays proceedings. In the circumstances, it appears that some unknown person has taken upon himself to censor the proceedings. This is a serious violation of my privilege as a Member of Parliament. I seek your indulgence to raise this matter in this House. Sir, in the past

865 866

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

. . rose.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Will you please sit down? This is relating to a matter of my Privilege.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please sit down.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Member, do not try to poke your finger into each and everything and disturb me. Please sit down. I will not give way, Sir. - [Interruption.] In the past, even when there were incidents, still for all, these digital proceedings were given but yesterday - [Interruption.] I did not commit any mischief in this House. I only read out my Motion that I had given. Maybe there were others who disturbed. But, why should I be penalized? My question is, Sir, the privileges that I enjoyed have been violated and where is it stated in the Standing Orders that certain things have to be blacked out or erased. [Interruption.] Not even in the Committee on Parliamentary Business have we taken up a situation like that. This is a gross violation. Therefore, Sir, what I am requesting is -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! When such a situation occurs in the House, the normal practice is to expunge -

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No, no. Where is that practice? I have never heard of that practice. In the past - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) No, that was the practice. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) It is the right of the Chair to expunge anything that is unparliamentary. That is how it is done.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The Hansard is - [Interruption.] How can you say that? The Speaker did not make any ruling.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The Chair does not have to announce that. That is accepted.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) My argument is, the Speaker did not make an order to black it out or to erase it.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) No, when there is trouble, the practice is to expunge anything that is unparliamentary. So, that was the ruling given by the Hon. Speaker.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No. If the Speaker had made such a ruling, I would accept it; I would not have any argument. But, there was no ruling like that.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The office is talking of a practice. There is no practice like that.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Azwer.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I would like to raise a relevant point of Order because all proceedings that are recorded are in the possession of the Speaker. How did this Member have access to that? - [Interruption.] How did he have access to those proceedings which are in the custody of the Speaker? How did he have? Yesterday, Sir, they made this House look like a mad House. They completely acted against the Standing Orders. They were making fools of themselves; [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

even the Leader of Opposition,

standing for hours and went away.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please sit down. - [Interruption.] Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair.

, .

, , . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, on this issue, what happened yesterday was, I did not commit any offence in this House. I only presented a Motion with regard to the university students problem; that they have been taken to Army Camps and put on forcible training. As a result, there were other Members who disturbed. What can I do for that? [Interruption.] I am talking only about my privileges; I am not talking about anyone else's. Therefore, Sir, I vehemently object to the digital proceedings being blacked out. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have raised it but the practice is that when there is a commotion in this House, the recordings are not released. That has been the practice of the House of Commons also. That has been the practice for a long time. Therefore, there is no breach of privilege or breach of the Standing Orders. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, there has been umpteen number of cases in this House.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Even in the House of Commons when there is a commotion, though a live telecast is given it goes blind.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) This is the Parliament of Sri Lanka, not the House of Commons. We have enjoyed this privilege. Why are you depriving us?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is the ruling given by the Speaker over and over again. There is no breach of the Standing Orders and no breach of privilege of you, as an Hon. Member. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Our privileges are being violated and you, the Chair, must safeguard our privileges. That is why we appeal to you.[Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) There is no breach of privilege. That is very firm.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) That is very unfair.
