... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, some are born great, some achieve greatness and some others have greatness thrust

upon them. The late Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere whom we are eulogizing in this House today was born great. He achieved greatness and also greatness was thrust upon him.

The name J.P. Obeyesekere kindles in us a great past and a glorious heritage. He hailed from a noble family. The Obeyesekere family, the Bandaranaike family and the Ratwattte family have emboldened themselves for the future good of Sri Lanka and all of them had a common goal and an aim, and that was to see that Sri Lanka achieved full measure of Independence. Towards that great goal, they worked very hard.

I came to know the late Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere very well when he was a Senator. I often used to go to the Senate at that time. Our great Scholar and Principal Dr. A.M.A Azeez, Senator M.D. Kitchilan, Senator S.H.M. Mashoor and I used to sit at the table and have our lunch in the Senate restaurant which was a very popular place at that time. Even the MPs of the House of Representatives walked along Queen Street at that time - now it s renamed as Janadhipathi Mawatha - to the Senate and enjoyed sumptuous meals leisurely.

Sir, as it was told, he received his early education at Royal College and he cut a brilliant figure there. Later, he graduated from Trinity College and Cambridge. He obtained a MA Degree from there. He was a member of the Cambridge Union Society. He excelled in debating skills. At the same time, he was a well-known great athlete. He was tall and stood tall in life. He had an amazing personality and a character that we all could imbibe today as the Hon. Members of this House because he was so exemplary in his inward and outward activities. One of the most remarkable feats that the late Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere achieved was piloting himself a plane all the way from UK to Ceylon. The Hon. Lasantha Alagiyawanna's father, Muhandiram Dharmasena Alagiyawanna, together with the late Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere initiated social welfare activities in Siyane Korale in the Gampaha District.

This was how the Ceylon Provincial Edition of Daily News of Thursday, 14th September, 1946 reported the late Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere piloting a plane to Colombo: Mr. J.P. Obeyesekere, son of Maha Mudliar who piloted his own plane from Heathrow Airport, London was greeted by his mother, Lady Obeyesekere, on his arrival at Ratmalana Airport yesterday after his 7,000-mile flight. Ceylonese make civil aviation history. It was a 7,000-mile flight from London to Ratmalana. - - ? ? , , .. . .

735 736

He has written a book on this trip titled, My Airway Home : England-Ceylon Solo Flight : Arrival Ratmalana 13th November, 1946. The cover of the book shows his parents, Sir James Peter Obeyesekere and Lady Obeyesekere welcoming their son and the faithful Auster VP-CAO aircraft is in the backdrop. Sir, I, with the permission of the Hon. Lasantha Alagiyawanna who gave this to me, will place this book in the library so that all of us and the future Parliamentarians can learn and follow the footsteps of the late Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere. Who can do that with such bravery? No one has done so far. Can anyone in the distant future repeat this performance? We hope we will live to see that day.

He was also in the Royal Observer Corps - Rajakeeya Wimarshana Hamudawa - from 1935 to 1945.

His beloved wife, Mrs. Siva Obeyesekere who is in the distinguished Gallery today, would be very happy to see that these elegies were delivered on her late beloved husband. The Hon. Dew Gunasekara said that we had the privilege of meeting Mrs. C.C. Cooray, Hewawitharana family and others in this great movement.

The late Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere was a tower of strength to Siva when she was the President of the Mahila Samithiya. Mrs. Siva Obeyesekere was a former Minister of Health and the late Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere was a former Deputy Minister of Health and Finance. She was also a former President of the National Crafts Council of Sri Lanka and took a great interest in that. Even now we go to Salu Sala and Laksala to buy handloom products. She could be described as the mother of the handloom industry in this country. She popularized that. A lot of people went to the handloom shops to purchase handloom products because of Siva.

The late Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere was a Member of the Egodapotha Village Committee. He associated closely with the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and became the SLFP Organizer of the Mirigama Electorate, what was known as the pocket borrower of the Bandaranaikes; the Hon. Obeyesekere won over it, distinguished himself and displayed his various talents in this House and outside by being a Member of this House.

One thing that we could not forget is the Ranpokunagama Housing Scheme, which is a very well-designed and constructed housing scheme on land donated by the late Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere. He had also visited many countries as a delegate, especially in the health sector, at conferences held in Canada and Nigeria.

The time came for a sacrificial act in his Parliamentary life when the late Hon. Sirimavo Bandaranaike wanted to enter politics and became the first woman Prime Minister

in the world. All due honour should be showered on the late Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere for giving way for the late Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike to enter the Senate.

He was one who did not want to see accidents in this country politically or in motorways. So, he took up the challenge. He was the President of the Ceylon Society for the Prevention of Accidents. Today, our Colleague, the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne is excelling in that chair and doing a great job of work.

The Hon. Obeyesekere was a former President of the Sri Lanka Scout Association. He donated 24,000 acres of land on behalf of the people to put up houses and for all other social welfare. What a great man!

He was awarded the highest national honour of Deshamanya by the then Prime Minister.

We know, Sir, Thihariya is a Muslim village just overlooking Attanagalla. He was very closely involved with the social upliftment of the Muslims of Thihariya. I know it very well. Mrs. Siva Obeyesekere will vouch for it. Then, there is the Kal-Eliya Muslim Ladies Arabic College, which the late Alhaj M.A.M. Abdul Hassen from Warakapola started together with Alhaj H.L.M.A. Cader and Alhaj A.H.L.A. Saleem. Moulavi Alhaj M.A. Alawi Abdulhassen (Al-Azhari) was the founder principal of that college. I used to visit Kal-Eliya every week and assist Moulavi Alawi Abdulhassen in the college work. We received tremendous help and assistance for this first Muslim Womens College not only from the late Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere but also from Mrs. Siva Obeyesekere and from the Bandaranaike family too. There is a Borstal Institute in Wathupitiwala. We used to visit this institute on every Ramazan and Haj festival days. There were children of the Muslim community too in this institute and we can never forget the help which came from the late Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere for their welfare. There was a home for the disabled at Doolmale in Thihariya. I know that the founder of this home, Alhaj M. Ashroff Hussain, was able to get assistance from both the late Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere and Mrs. Siva Obeyesekere and also the leaders of the Bandaranaike family in order to improve its conditions to make it a very powerful home, which looks after the welfare of the poor disabled children. Now, it is being managed efficiently by people of the calibre of Jiffry Haniffa, President; S.I.M. Haleel, BA (Hons.), Secretary; A.T.M. Zubair, Treasurer and other able members.

Sir, today we pay our respect to a great man; a noble man; a man of character; a man of courage; a man of vision. I would kindly request you to convey our sentiments to Mrs. Siva Obeyesekere which is another great name in the political and social spheres of this country, to other family members and also to the people of the Siyane Korale.

The Gampaha District is now being tremendously improved by the Minister of Economic Development, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa. I could visualize, if the Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere was living today, he would be the happiest person to see this development. I know for one thing that Mrs. Siva Obeyesekere will be the happiest living today - may she live long with good health - to witness the massive revival, the development and the renaissance that is now taking place in the Gampaha District under Mahinda Chintana. Thank you. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! I wish to announce that we have the presence of Dr. Hugh Brady and a delegation from the University of UCD, Ireland. May I take this opportunity to welcome them to our Parliament.

Thank you.

The next speaker is the Hon. J.R.P. Sooriyapperuma.

[. . 1.55] ... ( . . . ) (The Hon. J.R.P. Sooriyapperuma) Hon. Deputy Speaker, today I am speaking about one of the great descendants of this country. In the Maritime Provinces of Sri Lanka, there were two eminent families, I should say, dynasties: one was the Bandaranaike Dynasty of the Horagolla Walauwa and the other was the Obeyesekere Dynasty of Batadole Walauwa and they were there more out of love than out of power. People of Siyane Korale appreciated their role as social leaders for about three centuries. Sir, Siyane Korale is the largest korale in Sri Lanka. It starts near the Kelani Bridge and ends at Pasyala. On one side, you have the Kelani River and on the other side, you have the Kandy Road. The entire population is 21 lakhs as at todays reckoning. This is the largest korale in the District.

And, for three centuries the Bandaranaike family and the Obeyesekere family were closely related and they were eminently unchallenged in the area. They were actually a social service generation rather than an authoritarian generation. That love is expressed by vast majorities; that the Bandaranaike party is getting at election times. Hon. Bandaranaike and his great ancestors were reckoned as the real barons of this country and the title changed from Horagolla to Batadole whenever the vacancies occurred. I, with a lot of regret, mention today that we are talking about the last baron of this country. Hereafter, you cannot get a replacement for Bandaranaikes and Obeyesekeres. All others are synthetic, Hamu Mahattayas.

Now, this pleasant gentlemen whom we are talking of, is a six and a half feet tall stalwart who started education at Cambridge University in England. During the war, he joined the RAF and took part in the war effort. Some students who went from Sri Lanka to England during the war joined the RAF. One was the late Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere. There was another gentleman called Mr. Ananda Kularatne. He was the son of Mr. P. de S. Kularatne. He piloted a RAF plane and was shot down over Germany in 1941. But, these young men who went over there participated in what is due and what is expected of a young man who is going to be a leader of this country. We must be proud that the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford gave us a lot of leaders; more than leaders they gave us culture. More than culture, they gave dignity to man and that is what we should not forget. The Hon. Bandaranaike is remembered more for his love for the people than any other power and that role was handed over to Hon. J. P. Obeyesekere and Madam Siva Obeyesekere after the demise of the Hon. Bandaranaike. Today the Hon. Bandaranaike is no more, the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike is no more and the Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere is no more but the base that they have laid in Siyane Korale is untouched even to this day. That is why we get victories by millions of votes at election times.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, there was the malaria epidemic in 1935. At that time the Obeyesekere family started the Wathupitiwala Hospital in a large way. That was the Central Hospital in the Gampaha District at that time for the poor people to get medicine.

Even today Wathupitiwala is recognized through that hospital. That is an eternal tribute to the Obeyesekere family for the service they have done to Urapola area and that area is very fortunate. When Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike got married, he changed into the national dress. The spinning of the dress was done at Urapola by the village girls and women and he wore that as a tribute to the people of Attanagalla. This was like the Indian Kadar Viyapar and from that time onwards, Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike popularized the national dress and in that role, what was done by the Obeyesekeres to Urapola, which is the central area of Attanagalla cannot be forgotten.

The Hon. Obeysekere is an eminent person whom this country has produced. The last of the barons, in good manners, decent behaviour, political correctness, one of the great men we had, we are remembering at this time. I am sorry, it is a tragedy we are losing all the families and their children are no more. I do not know what happened to them. The Senanayake families are no more, Kothalawala family, the same; Attygala families, the same; Bandaranaike family, it is a tragedy. One of the noblest children this country had, one of the noblest gentlemen this country has ever produced, the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike, is no more. Then Senanayakes, no

739 740

more. This great person, the Hon. Obeyesekere, I call him the last of the barons of this country. There is still a living monument of his, that is Mrs. Obeyesekere, I pray you live long and in good health. About two million people of Siyane Korale bless you and show their goodwill towards you for the services you have done and your ancestors have done about 300 years ago.

Finally, Sir, I take this opportunity to convey my deep sorrow to Madam Obeyesekere on the demise of this heroic and noble gentleman.

Thank you.

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Hon. Presiding Member, perhaps I get emotionally moved when I rise in this House to speak about the late Hon. M.H. Amit especially because I carry very nostalgic memories about him. I developed long-abiding friendship with him for nearly 50 years from the time I joined the All-Ceylon Muslim League. We both entered Parliament together in 1989 and sat together on adjoining benches of the Government side in this House. He was born at Katukelle, Kandy on 3rd February 1914, the year World War I started. Katukelle was a place of settlement of Malays who had been settled by the imperial government after the demobilization of the Malay regiment in the 1870s. His maternal grandfather was Mr. Joharan, a leader of the Malay community. His grandmother was Mrs. Miskin. His paternal grandfather was Mr. Ahamed Chuttra, a common name in North Sumatra. He dropped the name Chuttra and used the name Ahamed which later became Amit. On the demobilization of the Malay regiment, a number of officers were selected and sent to the Island of Labuan in the Malay Archipelago for guard duty; his paternal grandfather was one of them.

He was born to a family of 13 children, including a set of twins. His elder brother was Yahiya Noordeen Amit, the, thre were other brothers - Brahamdeen N. Amit and

759 760

Jamaldeen N. Amit. He studied at St. Andrew's College, Nawalapitiya and took part in religious and social activities in that area when young.. He first learnt the ABC of politics by helping Mr. H.O. Lebbe to win a ward in Nawalapitiya UC at that time. He always told us that he worked for Mr. Lebbe because Mr. Lebbe looked like King George V! He was also closely associated with the Hon. R.E. Jayatilleke, the then Minister and also President of the Nawalapitiya Sports Club and Amit played football for this Sports Club. He was a master of English, Latin, History and Geography.

The Hon. M.H. Amit played a significant role in the events that had preceded the historic landmark - of forming the United National Party. At his demise, he was the only surviving Member present on that momentous day - 6th September, 1946 - when the United National Party was formed at Palm Court. His leader Dr. T.B. Jayah, Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel, Mr. Jabir A. Cader and also Mr. Thowfeek Marikar Bawa attended that historic meeting. The following year the UNP, under the leadership of Right Hon. D.S. Senanayake, won freedom for Sri Lanka.

The Hon. M.H.Amit combines in his person the politics of the pre-Independence and the post-Independence era.

He was passionately steadfast in the campaign for adequate representation for Muslims in the pre-Independence era just as much as he was for Independence from Great Britain while opposing the demand for fifty-fifty as he only could. By a strange combination of destiny and fortune, he thrust himself into the centre stage of the political activities of Sri Lanka. It is therefore not surprising that he should have met Mohandas Gandhi as far back in 1927.

Being honest to a fault in politics as in other matters, he dedicated his life to serve humanity without even a passing thought of enriching himself in the process. So, it is not surprising that this unsung hero should leave behind a legacy of an honest politician with an impeccable record in public life and I wish that all those in politics emulate him. That indeed would be a fitting tribute to this wonderful man whom I admire and honour so much.

Mr. Satyamurti the famous Indian politician once paid a glowing tribute to Quadi-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan. He said, I quote:

"The Quadi - e - Azam was uncorrupted and incorruptible. Every Muslim political figure in India had his purchase price but not the Quadi-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah."

The same tribute is applicable with equal force to the Hon. Amit.

The Hon. Amit attended every UNP meeting at that time organized by the United National Party. He contributed in every possible way to enhance the UNPs image and advance its political activities. Such was his quality. Though he contributed in no small measure towards the progress of the party from its very inception, he showed no eagerness to secure the plums of office. He was extremely patient and awaited his turn. He had no wish to push aside others with the attempt of seeking high political office. He was too humble for that. Nevertheless, his sincerity, loyalty and political consistency did not go unrewarded.

When in 1988, the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa was asked to appoint a Malay person to the Parliament, several Malay organizations forwarded their applications. But, President Premadasa told his Media Secretary, Evans Cooray to bring that man - Amit.

"Whenever I had a meeting somewhere in a remote village not known to him, he would take his fishing rod and come and attend that meeting. He attended every Gam Udawa. That was the dedication he showed", President Premadasa used to always say. I am sorry to say that he was a disappointed man later as far as the leadership of the UNP was concerned. But, when the first opportunity came, he was appointed a Member of Parliament and I was also so fortunate to join him in this House. That was in 1989. It so happened that I too was chosen to Parliament together with him.

The Hon. Amit has been in public life for well nigh 70 years. He was assisted by his Colleagues, Senator M.D. Kitchilan, MMC, A.M. Nazeer MMC, Deputy Mayor, S.L.M. Shafie Marikar, T.A. Jayah, S.Z.M. Mashoor Moulana and others, in his political activities. Whether it was floods, natural disaster or communal conflicts, the Hon. Amit was invariably there offering all possible assistance to the refugees or victims. He also served as a Haj Liaison officer and he had made his services available to the Muslims.

I remember very well, Sir, those days when the ship, "Safina-Al-Arab" came to the Colombo Harbour from East Pakistan, which is Bangladesh today, he as the Secretary of the All-Ceylon Muslim League with the late Hon. Faleel A. Cafoor, another distinguished Member of this House, we, all together, helped the Ceylonese pilgrims to go by S.S."Safina-Al-Arab". He was very much dedicated and it was done very neatly and nicely. Nobody blamed him and people still remember the way the Hon. Amit and the group led by Hon. Falil a. Caffoor, Alhaj M.A. Razack managed the Haj activities at that time.

His services were much appreciated that Sir Mohamed Marcan Markar, the first Muslim Minister and Knight, when he was Chairman of the All-Ceylon Muslim Political Conference, had appointed the Hon.

761 762

[ ... ]

2011 12

Amit to draft the memorandum that was presented before the Soulbury Commission. Here is a unique person, Sir, who drafted two memoranda for the Soulbury Commission: one for the All-Ceylon Moors' Association and the other for the All-Ceylon Muslim League that he represented.

He has held innumerable positions, which is a tribute to his ability and skills. He was the Chairman of the Rule Revision Committee of Sri Lanka Railway; Chairman, Central Consultative Committee; Member, Public Service Commission; Member, Education Services Committee; Member, Paddy Board of Review; Chairman, Rent Control Board; Member, Board of Regents of the Colombo University; Member, Muslim Advisers' Committee of Radio Ceylon; Representative, Ceylon Dunya Malayu Conference in Penang; Vice-President, All-Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference and until the time he passed away, the Deputy President of the All-Ceylon Muslim League.

Perhaps the role he played as an advocate of the Supreme Court is lesser known because of his many achievements in the political arena. Here too, he shone like a beacon. The Hon. Amit practised law with a difference, in the sense, that he did not do it for pecuniary gains but here too as in politics, he served the people. He never demanded a fee before a case or even afterwards. His grateful clients would approach him with much deference just to ask how much they owed. He would only say give me something and as always that something was a pittance. But, the Hon. Amit never complained. He was too much of a philanthropist for that. I used to visit his house at Welikada in Rajagiriya adjoining the Mosque. His wife always used to complain saying, He came in a black coat, but no money in the pocket. That was the great Advocate, Hon. Amit.

I wish to mention an incident, which provides eloquent and striking proof of the very high standards that Hon. M.H. Amit has put for himself in the performance of public duties. He had given an appointment to a Muslim teacher in the Eastern Province. This teacher, with some others, brought several pots of curd to his residence at Rajagiriya to show their appreciation for the kindness he had displayed to them. But, the Hon. Amit being a perfectionist refused these pots of curd as a matter of principle. He did not want to convey the impression that he was accepting rewards for performing his duties. Such was his conscientiousness. Later, when I was walking on the road, I found this teacher eating the curd with the others by the Rajagiriya roadside. I asked them Why are you eating this? They said,

.

?,

I brought it from the East, how can I carry it back to Batticaloa? So, they were eating it on the road. It would have been too inconvenient to take this curd back all the way to Eravur.

I may be permitted for a faint stir of personal memories. I owe a deep debt of gratitude to the Hon. M.H. Amit who got me an appointment through Mr. T.A.M. Dain , a kinsman of his, in the Travel Department of James Finlays, BOAC. This appointment virtually opened the skies for me and gave me the opportunity to lay the foundation for my future travels abroad.

After I got this employment, I went to see him with a gift - a lamp - with my cousin Dr. Harris. He said, Azwer, I do not work for a lamp, you give this lamp to a house where there is no electricity. That is the type of person he was. That was his calibre. That was Amit! Such an exemplary man, we would not easily find among ourselves today.

The Hon. Amit had been my friend, guide and philosopher. I am happy that I have been provided with the opportunity of writing his biography - it is here with me - and I named this as the Tale of two Eras - like the Tale of two Cities. Sir, here, I should mention one thing. He was a lecturer, a senior lecturer at Pembroke Academy and also at Alexandra College. He said, "on a rough estimate, there would be in this country over 10,000 students whom he would have taught". Some of them are Supreme Court Judges like Justice Thambiah, Justice Ismail and international figures like Gamini Corea; Head of the Police Force, Rudra Rajasingham; Cabinet Ministers like Gamani Jayasuriya, the Hon. M.L.M. Aboosally, the Hon. C.A.S. Marikkar - called the "Sinhala Marikar" - and a host of others, too numerous to mention. He taught at Siddhartha College, Balapitiya and was very close to the father of socialism in this country, the late revered Philip Gunawardena because Dr. T.B. Jayah - Amit's father-in-law, was the first teacher at Ananda College after teaching at Dharmaraja College in Kandy. I think the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya would vouch for it because he is also an old Anandian. There, he laid the foundation for the freedom struggle.

During the imperialists days, they had to wave the flags of the kings on their birthdays. Two students - Philip Gunawardena and Robert Gunawardena - refused to carry that at that time. So, they could not attend classes for some time. Dr. Jayah lovingly caressed their heads and took them across the road to Stocks Garden where he was living, and taught them. They passed the matriculation exam and Philip Gunawardena, the beloved father of our Chief Whip, the Hon Dinesh Gunawardena, went to Wisconsin University in America and graduated there. After graduation, Philip Gunawardena wrote the first letter in his own handwriting, - I should have the copy of it - stating Sir, if not for you, I would not have come here and become a graduate.

Sir, I should also mention here that the Hon. Amit served the Muslim community through the Mosques. He was the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Wekande Jumma Mosque and the Malay Association and

763 764

he was also a member of the Malay Cricket Club. When Mr. M.D. Kitchilan was the Chairman of the Halequeen Football Club, he captained it and played for the Club. Mr. F.A. Yaseen of the Football Federation knows it well. At that time when G.G. Ponnambalam demanded fifty fifty, he said No we will have a balance representation.

Dr. T.B. Jayah, in his historic speech made in the State Council, said: If it is for national independence without any conditions laid, we will support the granting of freedom and self rule". The Hon. Amit thus supported the Right Hon. D.S. Senanayake. That shows the love and affection he had for this country.

Sir, the late Hon. Amit first married Razeena Jayah, the daughter of that great national leader, Dr. T.B. Jayah. They had four children: Fowzia, Lareena, Branudeen, and Sherozaz. Sir, the late Hon. Amit in his later life used to take me to Polgasowita, his daughters picturesque garden, the place where I would like to go on and on.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Azwer, please wind up. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I am concluding, Sir. Then, after her demise, he married Queeni Kamuria Burah and they had six children namely Shamsheer, Ferial, Kanisha, Suraiyah, Ameena and Inthiqab. I should say, Sir, this in particular about Ameena, - the entire family would agree with me - she was very close to her stepfather and even when he came to this House, she used to minutely supervise his attire, even to the extent of combing his hair. She cared for him so affectionately.

Sir, on this occasion, I should say that my entry into this House also was essentially paved by the late Mohamed Hashim Amit.

Also, I would pay a tribute to Mr. Abdul Kareem Hameed and Gitanjali, the loving grand-daughter of Hon. Amit, for enabling me to publish this book captioned A Tale of Two Eras, which I table*.

Sir, may I conclude my speech in true Islamic spirit, Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajioon.

( ) (The Presiding Member) I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by both sides of the House on the death of the Hon. M.H. Amit, ex-Member of Parliament. I shall direct the Secretary-General of Parliament to make a Minute of the proceedings today and send a copy thereof to the members of the bereaved family.

We will take up next the Vote of Condolence on the death of the late Hon. Sarath Munasinghe, ex-Member of Parliament.

[. . 3.40 ] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Presiding Member, I would like to add a few words of appreciation on the Vote of Condolence of the late Major General Sarath Munasinghe. He presided over many sessions in this House as the Deputy Speaker and I had a very cordial and friendly relationship with him. When he was electioneering, he used to take me to all the areas in his electorate, Polgahawela, and he was supported by "Samasri" Alhaj B.M. Farook of Pothuhera, who was one of my cousins. He had an abiding interest for the people of this country. He loved the people; he loved the land. He was one person who rose up on all issues regarding the defence of the country. He never let down the country as some others did. He was, to the last letter, a valiant soldier and a loyal Sri Lankan who wanted to rid this Government and the country of the LTTE terrorists. He worked tirelessly, conscientiously and loyally in that direction. He was also a former military spokesman. He passed away at the Asiri Surgical Hospital in Colombo on 16th March, 2008 after a brief illness when he was 59 years.

A battle-hardened infantry, Major General Sarath Munasinghe also served as a career intelligence officer and at one time, he held the post of Deputy Director in the Intelligence Unit of the military. Being an old boy of Maliyadeva College in Kurunegala, he became the first military spokesman of the Defence Ministry and made a commendable contribution to the war against the LTTE. He was in the LTTE hit-list for a long time as he commanded the platoon which killed Charles Anthony alias Seelan in the early 1980s in Jaffna.

In 2000, he entered Parliament and held the position of Deputy Speaker for a brief period. Major General Sarath Munasinghe has published a book titled A Soldiers Version after he retired from service in early 2000. If Major General Sarath Munasinghe was living today, he would be the happiest man to see that this land is rid of the LTTE terrorists. He wished, prayed for its elimination and also fought so much in order to attain that position. Under President Mahinda Rajapaksa, this country is free today and I think the foundation stone for such a great victory was laid by people of the calibre of Major General Sarath Munasinghe and a host of others too innumerable to mention.

So, Sir, this country today is enjoying the air of freedom and people are able to move from the South to the North; from Jaffna to Colombo and from Colombo to Jaffna.

It was a coincidence, Sir, that you and I travelled yesterday from Trichi to Colombo by Mihin Lanka. I went there to attend the Kilakkarai Islamic-Tamil

Research Conference. You had gone to see some of your ancestors and we were returning back together.

Sir, because this country is free now, the Sinhalese, the Tamils and the Muslims are able to walk around freely, undeterred and none is afraid of any terrorist attack. The Tamil Language is fostered and nurtured in this country. Yesterday, you pointed out to me at the Trichi Airport some incident and both of us conveyed our sentiments to the officials at the Trichi Airport. There were a large number of passengers, all Tamil-speaking. There, all the TV programmes are telecast in Hindi. But, here in our country, it has been ensured that the Tamil language is also given equal opportunity in all fields of activities. I should also mention hee that great cultural activities are taking place today around the Wellawatte Ramakrishna Mission and the Colombo Tamil Sangam in Wellawatta. There is the vel villa; there are temple celebrations and there are mosque kanduri. So, such a situation has arisen because of the freedom we have achieved. We must, at this moment, pay our tribute to the late Hon. General Sarath Munasinghe, who was one of those responsible for such a situation.

Thank you.

He was educated in the Maliyadeva College and ended up his career as a Major General. He fought quite a number of battles. He joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in the year 1999 and was very helpful to the party. He was once the Deputy Speaker of this House. He was a very close associate of our former President, Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.

I wish to join the Members of this House in conveying my deepest condolences to the members of his family.

Sir, permit me to speak a few words about the late Hon. M.H. Amit. Sir, it is with deep sorrow I rise to speak a few words on my dear Friend, the late Hon. M.H. Amit who was a Member representing the Malay community following the lineage of the great leader, Dr. T.B. Jayah. Although he was appointed as a National List MP to represent the Malay community, he was an ideal Sri Lankan who represented all communities in Sri Lanka. He was a silent worker who lent his ears to the grievances of the people.

He was one of the main pillars of the All-Ceylon Muslim League and rendered yeoman service to the people irrespective of caste, creed or religion. His prime concern was to serve the people. He also served in several statutory bodies such as the Public Service Commission, the Education Service Commission and was the Chairman of the Central Advisory Board of the Sri Lanka Transport Board.

He was a liberal democrat who believed strongly in democratic principles and committed to defend democracy in Sri Lanka. He was very friendly with the Sinhalese and the Tamils and associated with the rich and the poor alike. He never went after positions and his

appointment as a National List MP was an honour bestowed upon him.

He proved himself as a leader who stuck with policies and principles in politics. He was also an advocate. His demise is an irreparable loss to our country and I join the Members of this House in conveying the deepest condolence to the members of his family and pray to Allah to grant him the felicity of Jennathul Firdouse.
