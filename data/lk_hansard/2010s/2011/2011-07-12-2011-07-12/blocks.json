They were actually a social service generation rather than an authoritarian generation. That love is expressed by vast majorities; that the Bandaranaike party is getting at election times. Hon. Bandaranaike and his great ancestors were reckoned as the real barons of this country and the title changed from Horagolla to Batadole whenever the vacancies occurred. I, with a lot of regret, mention today that we are talking about the last baron of this country. Hereafter, you cannot get a replacement for Bandaranaikes and Obeyesekeres. All others are synthetic, Hamu Mahattayas.",

    "text": "Now, this pleasant gentlemen whom we are talking of, is a six and a half feet tall stalwart who started education at Cambridge University in England. During the war, he joined the RAF and took part in the war effort. Some students who went from Sri Lanka to England during the war joined the RAF. One was the late Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere. There was another gentleman called Mr. Ananda Kularatne. He was the son of Mr. P. de S. Kularatne. He piloted a RAF plane and was shot down over Germany in 1941. But, these young men who went over there participated in what is due and what is expected of a young man who is going to be a leader of this country. We must be proud that the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford gave us a lot of leaders; more than leaders they gave us culture. More than culture, they gave dignity to man and that is what we should not forget. The Hon. Bandaranaike is remembered more for his love for the people than any other power and that role was handed over to Hon. J. P. Obeyesekere and Madam Siva Obeyesekere after the demise of the Hon. Bandaranaike. Today the Hon. Bandaranaike is no more, the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike is no more and the Hon. J.P. Obeyesekere is no more but the base that they have laid in Siyane Korale is untouched even to this day. That is why we get victories by millions of votes at election times.",

This was like the Indian Kadar Viyapar and from that time onwards, Mr. S.W.R.D.

Amit especially because I carry very nostalgic memories about him. I developed long-abiding friendship with him for nearly 50 years from the time I joined the All-Ceylon Muslim League. We both entered Parliament together in 1989 and sat together on adjoining benches of the Government side in this House. He was born at Katukelle, Kandy on 3rd February 1914, the year World War I started. Katukelle was a place of settlement of Malays who had been settled by the imperial government after the demobilization of the Malay regiment in the 1870s. His maternal grandfather was Mr. Joharan, a leader of the Malay community. His grandmother was Mrs. Miskin. His paternal grandfather was Mr. Ahamed Chuttra, a common name in North Sumatra. He dropped the name Chuttra and used the name Ahamed which later became Amit. On the demobilization of the Malay regiment, a number of officers were selected and sent to the Island of Labuan in the Malay Archipelago for guard duty; his paternal grandfather was one of them.",

He presided over many sessions in this House as the Deputy Speaker and I had a very cordial and friendly relationship with him. When he was electioneering, he used to take me to all the areas in his electorate, Polgahawela, and he was supported by \"Samasri\" Alhaj B.M. Farook of Pothuhera, who was one of my cousins. He had an abiding interest for the people of this country. He loved the people; he loved the land. He was one person who rose up on all issues regarding the defence of the country. He never let down the country as some others did. He was, to the last letter, a valiant soldier and a loyal Sri Lankan who wanted to rid this Government and the country of the LTTE terrorists. He worked tirelessly, conscientiously and loyally in that direction. He was also a former military spokesman. He passed away at the Asiri Surgical Hospital in Colombo on 16th March, 2008 after a brief illness when he was 59 years.",

But, here in our country, it has been ensured that the Tamil language is also given equal opportunity in all fields of activities. I should also mention hee that great cultural activities are taking place today around the Wellawatte Ramakrishna Mission and the Colombo Tamil Sangam in Wellawatta. There is the vel villa; there are temple celebrations and there are mosque kanduri. So, such a situation has arisen because of the freedom we have achieved.
