[1.40 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, may I, at the outset, congratulate and thank His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, Dr. P.B. Jayasundara, Secretary to the Treasury and the other officials, who have given us a very progressive and praiseworthy Budget, which is based on very sound macroeconomic foundations.

Sir, Sri Lanka has had its own ups and downs in the eyes of scholars of politics and development. When you look at our economic and monetary policies from time to time as an illustration of policies, Sri Lanka is an illustrative case of development theory and practice. There was at one time a strong emphasis on import substitution industrialization and social welfare in the '60s and '70s. Thereafter, we gained critical attention for our shift to economic liberalization in 1977 as well as the rise of the neoliberalism and authoritarianism and armed insurgencies in the 1980s.

The last decade, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, has seen a new focus on Sri Lanka as a test case for internationalized conflict resolution and liberal peace-building in a protracted intrastate conflict. We saw the peace process breaking down and thereafter replaced by intense and successful military campaign, which naturally was seen by many as a possibility of defeating terrorism and creating peace by military means. Having achieved this remarkable victory, our President has now produced several Budgets based on very strong foundations of security, development, peace and prosperity. When you look at these links among security, development, peace and prosperity, we cannot forget the transnational impact of localized wars that made the resolution of intrastate conflicts a matter of global security. Following this, international development co-operation has undergone a general shift from being conflict-blind to being conflict-sensitive, thus using development assistance as a tool for transforming conflicts and building liberal peace.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, politics of market reforms for neoliberal development and the politics of State reforms for liberal democracy, minority rights and power-sharing bring about different implications in different situations. Everybody agrees that the one-size-fits-all policy cannot be imposed on any country.

Yesterday, when I attended the opening ceremony of the Southern Highway, the presence of Mr. Yasushi Akashi, the Special Envoy of the Japanese Government for Peace at one time, brought back some nostalgic memories to me because I was one of those members of

1075 1076

[ ]

2011 28

the Government team negotiating with the LTTE. One important feature of this negotiating team of the previous United National Party administration is that all the members who were in the negotiating team are now with His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Mr. Yasushi Akashi would definitely be looking at this entire transmogrified situation where Japan, as one of the members of the co-chairs concept including the United States, the European Union and Norway was instrumental in organizing donor conferences as a parallel feature of the negotiations for peace with the LTTE. Having attended every one of those donor conferences, I feel that this whole approach has now been turned on its head and particularly, having attended the opening ceremony of the Southern Highway, Japan being our largest donor would certainly acknowledge and appreciate the efforts taken by His Excellency the President in taking forward the country. This whole process of development ran parallel to a very difficult and atrocious war which had consumed large amounts of our budgeted funds. What was significant was that none of these developments were set aside because there was a war, which was absorbing large amounts of budgeted funds.

Now, we feel it is important for us to focus on a speedy path of development, keeping in mind the necessary macroeconomic fundamentals. On this point, may I divert and digress for a moment, Sir, to refer to a few paragraphs of the Budget Speech, firstly, Paragraph No. 34 and I would like to speak in Tamil because it has some implication for the people, whom I represent.

Sir, the most significant development in the Budget is the further fiscal consolidation bringing down the fiscal deficit to 6.2 per cent next year. What is encouraging is that there is a continuous declining trend since the conclusion of the war in 2009, when the deficit was as high as 9.8 per cent of GDP. We must bear in mind that Budget outcomes are often different to the estimated amounts. There are revenue shortfalls and expenditure overruns, which we have to contend for. But, I am sure, the Treasury would be quite keen to maintain this declining trend in managing the fiscal deficit and now, it has been projected to be 6.2 per cent for the next year. That is a very welcome feature and I am sure those who value macroeconomic fundamentals would certainly appreciate this declining trend in deficit reduction.

Some of my Colleagues in the Cabinet, particularly from the Left - I heard the Hon. Tissa Vitarana too pointing this out today - have not approved of the rationale behind the devaluation of the rupee by 3 per cent. In the short term, the impact on prices of imports may hurt, but by reducing imports and increasing exports, the trade deficit is going to improve. This corrective measure was deemed necessary for some time owing to the massive trade deficit. Therefore, Sir, I am inclined to

1077 1078

endorse the policy, though the Central Bank and others may contend that the impact on the widening trade deficit on the current account could be minimal considering the expansion in exports, earnings from tourism and increased inward remittances.

True, these earnings had brought down the trade deficit of the current account to US Dollars 2.2 billion in the first eight months of 2011. But, during that period of eight months this year, the trade deficit reached up to US Dollars 6 billion. During this corresponding period, the export earnings increased by 28.6 per cent to US Dollars 7 billion. Yet, the import expenditure increased by 50.6 per cent to US Dollars 13 billion. So, it would certainly not be healthy for macroeconomic stability not to take any corrective action with respect to the exchange rate. Of course, the Central Bank may argue that the Foreign Exchange Reserves were high and that those would suffice to finance about six months of imports. Then, there is also the argument that a high proportion of these reserves comprised of foreign borrowings rather than earned reserves, which cannot be ignored. Therefore, Sir, I thought the Treasury has been very prudent in imposing this measure of 3 per cent devaluation of the rupee.

Sir, during the remaining few minutes, I would like to refer to an important aspect which has been included in the Budget at my request and I must thank His Excellency the President for having included it as a request from the Minister of Justice. That is, to include the concept of an international arbitration hub in Sri Lanka. This is a concept which we feel is a very important step in trying to market the legal resources of this country and in particular, to attract a large amount of foreign exchange into the country by way of fees for international arbitration and mediation. Sir, a competitive environment inducing individuals and firms to seek and use knowledge, identify market opportunities, drive entrepreneurship and thus create wealth, jobs and economic growth is an important part of becoming a knowledge hub. Therefore, this whole idea of creating an international arbitration centre in Sri Lanka is a very welcome feature and I must also thank the President for having mentioned in the Budget that a three-acre plot in Hulftsdorp, close to the Court Complex, would be reserved for us to set up and expand the existing Court Complex to include even the offices of the Attorney-General's Department and also to house the proposed international arbitration centre.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Minister, you have one more minute.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, I would certainly be expanding on this subject during the Committee Stage Discussion on my Ministry. But, in an overall context, this Budget has provided for all sectors very progressive ideas and has given the necessary funding to improve the facilities in all different sectors. Particularly, I believe, this Budget has been based on very sound macroeconomic fundamentals and I do not think any detractor could persuasively argue that at a time like this, we could have produced a better Budget.

Thank you. [. . 1.59]

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would like to say a few words in English at this moment. Let me go straight into the Budget Proposals that His Excellency the President presented last Monday with mounds of numbers meant to confuse and mislead all the Members of the House, both in the Government coalition and the Opposition.

1081 1082

When you look at the recurrent expenditure, excluding the interest on domestic and foreign borrowings and the pension payments that have to be paid, which should be shown separately to better understand what the Government is intending to do, it has come down from Rs. 1,110 billion to Rs. 618 billion. That is all what the Government is spending and of that, it has allocated a staggering Rs. 215 billion to the Defence Ministry, which is over 35 per cent of the total. That is far too much when the whole future of Sri Lanka is touted as one of the knowledge and education-based economies.

Please remember that the cost of the Ministry of Defence is for ongoing expenditure and not for pensions. Therefore, the Rs. 162 billion allocated for personal emoluments is staggering, when compared with the allocations for education, higher education and youth affairs including the expenditure allocated through the Provincial Councils which only amounts to Rs. 106 billion.

I, therefore, strongly believe that this Budget should reflect a transfer of resources from brawn to brain if we are to achieve the goals set for a knowledge-based economy and good teachers in public education are desperately required. The Governments English and IT campaigns which commenced two years ago have been a total failure and to compound that, the Government is now calling for a trilingual society. If we cannot be a bilingual society, I cannot see how we can become a trilingual one with no concerted campaign of resource allocation to go with the rhetoric.

It is important to realize that no amount of rhetoric that constantly emanates from the Government can change the reality. Reality happens only when something concrete is done about it. We have a very intelligent human resource but that resource is not receiving the required investment. Training of good teachers does not happen overnight. It takes a long time to achieve results and we cannot afford anymore delay. So, I request the Government to look at the overall picture and realize that this country is spending far more than it can afford on defence and a higher allocation for education will, I believe, achieve a better return of investment and provide our youth with prospects of employment, which they currently do not have in this economy.

Further, with regard to the specifics of the education sector and the emphasis the Minister of Education is expected to put into changing the syllabuses, yet again, I would caution that people at their younger age should be more focused on core subjects than the general ones. It is all very well if we have adequate quality of teaching at the primary level to do so. However, our children still lack the basics of education. I see that situation all the time in my own Constituency, Biyagama; it does not take

even half an hour for you to reach there from here. I am asked to donate chairs for various schools in my constituency. When a school does not have chairs for the children to sit, how can they be directed to focused education streams at an earlier age?

We have got our priorities completely upside down. We cannot transform to a technologically savvy workforce until our children know the basics of at least two languages and are able to communicate and learn using the internet tools that must be made available to all schools. Only last week, I saw the Minister of Education donating just one computer each, to schools that do not have computers in the Homagama area. If the schools so close to Parliament do not have the basics and if money is not allocated in the Budget for them to receive these, then how can the country make any progress in this area?

We must spend more time and money all the way from primary to tertiary education, if we are to keep the principles of free public education available to all those who seek it. When the universities are forced to use a security firm that has ties with the Ministry of Defence which cost them considerably more than the current security expenses, how can the universities allocate funds for teaching? Therefore, even the allocation made for the Ministry of Higher Education is a question. The university teachers are now agitating for a higher pay stating that the promises made to them have not been fulfilled in this Budget. These are all indications of less money being spent on education and not more.

I apologize for taking so much time of the House to request more allocation for education but I believe it is the single-most important area that has been overlooked in this Budget and if we are to achieve any of the goals of the "Mahinda Chintana - Idiri Dekma", we must transfer more funds to this sector, not in the next year but now.

I am sure, I speak for all the Members of the House as well as those in Government who are afraid to speak for the youth of the country, fearing they will lose their jobs at the next Cabinet reshuffle.

Now, I would like to touch on a point which my Friend, the Hon. Member for the Matara District, pointed out on Friday. He maintained that the privatization that the Government is engaged in is not as transparent as it should be, with friends of the State receiving benefits. Why does the Government go through an elaborate charade to state untruths to the public? The Ministers are the servants of the State and when they state untruths to those who pay their salaries, then it is time for them to be sacked. This is another example of wasteful action that will eventually have to be subsidized by the tax payer. Under these circumstances, who would want to invest in this country?

I ask the Government to stop harassing the private sector, which is the main contributor to the economy and its growth. On one hand, the President reiterated the need

1083 1084

[ ]

2011 28

for private sector participation in his speech at the opening of the new Southern Highway yesterday. But, to contribute to the economy, the private sector must feel confident that there are no threats in doing business. There are threats everywhere and it was evidenced only last week when the largest tea buyer of Sri Lanka, stayed away at the auction due to intimidation and threats by goons.

The recent expropriation Act has done nothing to soothe investor-confidence and in fact, I have been made aware of some investment decisions that have been put on hold due to this sudden development. The result of this has been that potential foreign investors have come to the conclusion that Sri Lanka is a very high-risk country to do business purely due to the shortsighted actions of the Government.

Further, the Government has stated in the Budget that they would allocate 37,000 hectares to locals in the plantation sector on lease for 30 years. This is just a populist statement that will cause more problems for the plantation sector, which is already reeling from high costs of production and other challenges. They should not be burdened by more challenges of friends and family given land in plantations that will disrupt their operations further.

The Government has announced an allocation of US Dollars 110 million for the SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka for the next three years. Both continue to make staggering losses. Does the country have to pay this kind of price for the whims of the Government, that often preclude this airline from making commercial decisions?

I appeal to this Government not to try to go into areas which they do not know how to manage as that only makes matters worse. I ask the Government to concentrate on turning around the mismanaged loss-making enterprises that they currently own to profitable ones that can contribute to the State revenue and thereby provide relief to the people instead of making them pay for the poor management of the Public sector.

Instead of the Government asking the private sector to be more accountable, it should be more accountable. The private company will fail if it continuously makes losses. It is the Government that should be more accountable, but it is the citizens of Sri Lanka who have to pay for the bad management of State enterprises. It maybe in the Sri Lanka Cricket, the Ceylon Electricity Board or in the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. Please sort them out first. I am pointing out that this Government has not allocated funds to the areas that should receive funds and it is due to their own mismanagement and not of the public.

If the Government continues on this path of mismanagement by not allocating funds to the areas which need development, there is no hope of Sri Lanka

becoming the "Miracle of Asia", rather, it is more likely to need a miracle to save it from being drowned in a sea of debt.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, lastly I wish to thank all the Sri Lankans who work hard overseas and remit their hard-earned money to enable this Government to take credit for the growth of the economy. I believe that it is they who have raised the living standards of the people and saved this country from bankruptcy, not the Government. I ask the Government to take note of this and not just give investment incentives to entrepreneurs but to give some kind of financial insurance assistance for the returnees to enjoy in their later years.

Thank you. [. . 2.22] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne - Minister of Productivity Promotion) , . , , ,

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne) , - - , . . [2.38 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, after listening to the presentation of the Budget by His Excellency the President, I am inclined to place before this House the plight of the people of the Northern Province and show you how once again the Government has betrayed them. The Budget Proposals are not going to take them out from their state of anguish.

Sir, when His Excellency the President announced the need to find alternative mechanism to end terrorism and restore peace, we were very much eagerly listening to him expecting some object-oriented proposals to solve the nations number one problem, the ethnic problem. But, there was no correlation between his pronouncement and the proposals. Though he claimed that he has prepared a Budget including proposals suggested by the Hon. Members of Parliament, to our utter dismay there was no

consideration to the aspirations and problems of the people of the Northern Province, whom we represent. What the Members of Parliament stated on this Floor again and again to the Government was to prepare a people-centred development-oriented Budget that would lead to proper reconciliation, peace and prosperity.

Specific issues of the people of the North have been brushed aside under the carpet of national priorities and programmes. Whoever who prepared the Budget has simply ignored the issues and concerns expressed by the Members of Parliament on this Floor during the last Budget Debate and thereafter. The Government is very adamant to apportion a high level of recurrent allocation to the Defence Ministry. This year too nearly 20 per cent of the recurrent allocation goes to defence, covering even the fourth year after the end of war.

One of the urgent needs of the war-affected people of the North is housing. The much announced Indian housing is still coming whereas the Defence Ministry is given the largest allocation of Rs. 3,000 million for construction of permanent quarters for security establishments and this is over and above the colossal amount spent on housing in this sector last year. The Government has planned a good programme to convert all thatched-roof houses in Anuradhapura into tiled-roof houses within the next few months, by next February when the Deyata Kirula" Exhibition will be held there. What I would say is that there had been no seriousness on the part of the Government towards fulfulling the housing needs of the war-affected population for the last two and a half years.

I also earnestly request that since you have announced the achievement of a mine-free country, to allow the people to go and settle in their own places without any further excuses. Our most important national issue today is reconciliation and a political solution to the ethnic problem. The Budget Proposals do not give any serious consideration to this matter and we hardly find any sound proposal towards this end.

His Excellency the President has pronounced that representation of the minority communities in the Northern Provincial Council and Parliament has paved a solid way for dialogue. We cannot understand these empty words. I do not want to comment on the seriousness of the Government in having a dialogue to solve the ethnic problem, as we have seen it for the last 60 years. But, I would say that the Northern Provincial Council has virtually come under the control of the Minister of Industry and Commerce and the Governor has become his puppet. One other Minister too makes use of this puppet. There is no space for a majority of the Hon. Members of Parliament to take part in the decision-making process with the present military Governor, who does not know the culture of civil administration or have any respect for peoples representatives.

1093 1094

When it comes to socio-economic development in the North, what the Budget provides for is a drop from a bucketful, comparing the needs of the province. If the Northern Province has recorded a growth rate of 23 per cent, a rate we have never heard of in the history of Sri Lanka, why are the people there suffering from growing unhappiness and discontentment? There must be something wrong which the Government should attend to immediately. If replacement of what is lost or damaged is counted as growth, then there must be something wrong conceptually with the national accounting system of this country.

Roads, shopping centres, the presence of the corporate sector and banks would not reduce the number of suicides, prostitution, child pregnancy, poverty, robbery, drug addiction, mental illnesses, the feeling of insecurity, lack of family security, and inadequate livelihood opportunities. That is, of course, with a little pinch of salt like "Grease Devils". These are conditions created or introduced into the communities in the North after the war. These have been introduced after a systematic elimination of traditional institutions, knowledge-gaining systems, leadership and the capacity to sustain the values of those communities. The capacity to rejuvenate them internally by the community itself has been pathetically destroyed. If these conditions are not properly internalized in policy-formulation and properly addressed by the Government with appropriate programmes using the Budget as a tool for transformation, then the country will be heading for clear trouble in the future.

The communities have to be first rehabilitated in order for them to reap benefit from the infrastructure the Government now builds up. Unfortunately, the cry for adequate community development programmes has fallen on the deaf ears of the Government. We learn that the Government has taken a decision not to implement any donor-assisted community development programmes in the North. The Government has to come down from its adamancy.

Sir, I humbly appeal and request the Hon. Minister of Economic Development to grant immediate approval to implement the Coastal Community Development Project in the North, which is already implemented in the East. For this project, the ADB has earmarked US Dollar 20 million in its country programme and has already developed a project design, but keeps it pending approval by the Hon. Minister. This will help a lot in the recovery of the war-affected community.

At a macro level, the Government is already failing ineffectively in reconciling with the minorities after the war. Armed with a victors mentality, the politicians are still making statements which are not at all conducive for reconciliation.

But, the victors magnanimity is not visibly and widely seen. There has to be effective re-orientation among the police service, the armed services, in the machinery maintaining law and order, among the clergy, the media men, all the private security services, the frontline workers who work with the communities and at large, among the general public because prior to the war, these were the elements that were effectively and rigorously trained to look at a Tamil person as a potential terrorist or as a suspicious species, to catch him and handover to the army or the police for further action, treatment and follow-up. One cannot expect these people to become saints overnight, to treat their potential enemies as brothers and sisters for them to be hugged and kissed. They have to be re-trained to be minority-friendly. No amount of dancing, singing, exchange tours and games among the affected is going to bring about reconciliation. They are not going to change the mindsets which are lamenting for something they have lost, which once lost is lost for ever and you cannot replace them. They were belittled and permanently insulted for their being in certain circumstances in their life. Every family has lost something valuable, which was bequeathed to them by their ancestors. They preserved and perpetuated them for posterity. The inflicted internal damages to the individual, the families and the communities have to be handled in a delicate way. The Government, even after three years, does not have an indepth understanding of the reconciliation needs, but is bent on implementing programmes which they think is good for the affected people.

His Excellency the President spoke of a vision to ensure rural-centric development in which all citizens would get equal opportunity to be engaged in economic activities and social development. The actual development process taking place after the war in the North has taken away the grip which the rural people hitherto had in the rural economy; the control of the rural economy is no more with the rural people in the North and the East. The Mahinda Chintana has already failed in strengthening the Northern rural economy. The Government has institutionalized poverty in the villages of the North and it is going to be an enormous task to deinstitutionalize poverty in the North.

Sir, I have touched only on a few matters arising out of the so-called Budget. The problems of our people are simply outside the decision-making, attitudinal framework of the present Government. This has to change. The Government is acting only on the basis of information it receives from its paid servants who are serving their masters under some limitations, whether they are members of the armed forces or of the civil service. Sir, my plea is that the Government should listen to the peoples representatives. There is no room for them to genuinely take part in the decision-making process at every level, even at a very local level in the North. The continuation of the present state of affairs will be detrimental to the future of the whole country.

1095 1096

Then, Sir, I wish to bring to the notice of the House a serious incident that took place at the Anuradhapura Prison yesterday, 27th November, 2011. We have already brought to the notice of the Government the various difficulties and hardships these detainees undergo. We are informed that around 2.00 p.m. yesterday, two jailors and 25 prison guards entered the section where the Tamil detainees were kept and had beaten them very badly saying that they had come to check them for some reasons. They were kept under heavy rains and their clothes and other belongings were thrown out.

In this merciless attack, more than 20 persons sustained injuries and four persons are undergoing treatment for severe injuries. They are, Ariharan of Jaffna, Sasi of Vavuniya, Nixon of Trincomalee and Thaya of Vaddakkachchi. The attack had been so merciless that they had not even spared the disabled who were there. They had been deprived of their own aids. The small temple in that precinct was damaged; the idol was thrown away.

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) . . ,-[ ] 14 . . [ ]

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) They are detainees who are undergoing physical and psychological difficulties and such an attack on them is really inhuman. Due to rigid conditions, hardly any information has been received about the detainees. When the detainees attempted to report that to the jailors, they had not been entertained by them; there was no place to report. At around 7 o' clock, when the Superintendent came, they reported to him, but he had not taken it seriously and advised them to ignore the matter. Following that, these 65 detainees went on a hunger strike, which is still continuing. They want an undertaking that they will be given one hundred per cent security and an assurance that such an incident would not be repeated.

I urge the Hon. Minister to take action and institute an immediate inquiry, provide redress and make arrangements to expedite the legal process with a view to producing them before court. Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! The next speaker is the Hon (Dr.) Mervyn Silva. Before that, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer to take the Chair?

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena - Minister of Agriculture) Sir, I propose that the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.
