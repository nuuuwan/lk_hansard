( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, I would like to join the Leader of the House in expressing my condolence on the death of the Hon. Noordeen Mashoor. I did have the opportunity of dealing with him both as a Parliamentarian, as a person who had contested in alliance with us, and also as an individual.

I got to know the late Hon. Noordeen Mashoor in the year 2000 and then in 2001, when he contested the Parliamentary Elections with us in the UNP. When he served in that government, he certainly took an interest in the affairs of Vanni; it was especially a crucial time when we were discussing both the resettlement of the displaced Muslims in the Mannar District as well as the whole peace process itself. The areas that the Hon. Noordeen Mashoor represented had part of it really under the armed units of the LTTE. Therefore, during this time, he took a keen interest in ensuring not merely the rights of the Muslims but also the rights of the Sinhalese and

the Tamils. He was very interested in many aspects of development, but at heart, the Hon. Noordeen Mashoor always had Mannar as his first interest. It was unfortunate that he was not elected to this House in 2004. During that time, as a person who was not in Parliament but nevertheless a politician, I had to deal with him. We had to work together on many elections and there were times when I had to go to Mannar to address meetings.

The final rounds of political work I did with him was during the Presidential Election of 2010, when he organized the Mannar area for us. He organized it for the then Presidential Candidate, General Sarath Fonseka, who is now unfortunately in jail and then during the Parliamentary Elections when he contested the Vanni Electorate. He was a good companion. He was a good supporter of the Government when we were in office. But, primarily he was a Member of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. I met the Hon. Noorden Mashoor a few days before his death. No one anticipated that he would be taken away from us so fast. He had much more to contribute and he was a knowledgeable person. His own practical knowledge was immense. The death of the Hon. Noordeen Mashoor at this stage, is a loss to this House and also to the people of Mannar, because he was particularly concerned with the development of Mannar including the island. So, I would like to join the other Members of the House in conveying our condolences to the members of his family.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Speaker, it is not always that we, in this House, move a Vote of Condolence on a Member who had been with us in the current Parliament. The Hon. Noordeen Mashoor who had served this Parliament on two previous occasions and was re-elected at the last Parliamentary Election, to represent the people of the Vanni District on behalf of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, suddenly met with his death which came as a bolt from the blue to our party and its leadership. The Hon. Noordeen Mashoor was a multifaceted personality. The void he has left is a very difficult one to fill. I must confess that the recent Local Government Election ,which I had to face without the Hon. Noordeen Mashoor in the Vanni District, was a testament to his untiring efforts. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress has always relied on his towering personality to carry on our political activities in the Vanni District, and as a matter of fact, in the entire Northern Province. He happened to represent the Northern Province and he was also elevated to the position of Deputy Leader of our party a few years ago.

The Hon. Noordeen Mashoor was born on the 30th of November in 1962 and departed us at a comparatively young age of 48 years. When I heard the shocking news that morning, I rushed to the hospital and I was only able to see his lifeless janaza, and the way in which he had departed that early morning after prayers, left an indelible impression on me. It was only the previous day that I happened to meet him and discussed with him some of the current political issues. He was somewhat taken aback at the appointment of Ministers and Deputy

821 822

Ministers because he wanted to be appointed as a Deputy Minister to look after his area. But, then we took a decision to abide by the difficulties that the Government faced and were assured that subsequently he would be given a position since he had already been a non-Cabinet Minister representing his people. He had undergone many an adversity facing challenges from different quarters. One important facet was, he was a man who would not unnecessarily trouble the leadership amidst whatever challenges he faced and he would personally be taking charge of whatever adversity he faced. There was an occasion where a false charge was brought against him for having printed sample ballot papers during an election. I believe that was during the last Parliamentary Election and he had to spend a few days in the custody of the CID.

Those people who had put him through such difficulties would not have realized that this man, who was sleeping on a mat for two days was endowed with enormous wealth, which he amassed through his perseverance and endeavours. He was somebody who gave up his wealth very willingly and there are thousands of people who would testify to this fact. Sir, he would never be forgotten by the people of Erukkalampiddy, the largest Muslim village in the Mannar District. When they faced the severe adversity of having to be expelled from the North, he almost single-handedly, saw to it that they were resettled in a place called Nagavillu in Puttalam and the entire village had ever been indebted to him, and that was shown in every subsequent election where he got an overwhelming mandate from those people.

Mr. Speaker, he was also someone who always respected the aspirations of the Tamil people and built up a very cordial working relationship with his fellow Parliamentarians and the leaders in the North. He was a permanent feature in all our delegations for discussions with the leadership of the TNA and they would testify to the fact that he was able to make a very sobering effect on the relationship that we maintained with the Tamil leadership. He always realized that the co-existence of Muslims in the North, with the Tamil and the Sinhala brothers, was an essential prerequisite to finding a lasting solution to the burning problems there. He also had the courage to go to the jungles of Vanni and even meet with the LTTE when there were problems faced by the Muslims. Having discussed matters with me, the Party Leader, during the period when we had the ceasefire, he dedicated himself fully to see that the resettlement of his people became the ultimate reality. Though the resettlement process is ongoing, the people in those areas would always remember the extent to which the Hon. Noordeen Mashoor went in to see that they had the necessary facilities for resettlement.

I would, on behalf of my party, pay tribute to the Hon. Noordeen Mashoor and would also like to say a few

words in Tamil since there are many of his constituents, who are supposed to be in the Gallery today. Unfortunately, today being a Friday, all the visitors will have to come in only after their visit to the Mosque. But, since I have been called upon to speak, I thought I should also record my contribution in Tamil.

( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Urban Affairs) Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is with deep sorrow that I rise to speak a few words about the late Hon. Noordeen Mashoor, who was a Member of this House. By his demise, we have lost an outstanding politician and I personally feel the loss of a good and dear Friend. I knew him from the very early days as a gem merchant. His extraordinary quality of not holding any personal grudge against anyone had helped him to earn many friends, both in Sri Lanka and abroad. It was this quality that helped him to be the choice of the people of Vanni, to get elected to this House.

Having represented the people who were seriously affected by terrorist activities, he dedicated his time and energy helping to alleviate the sufferings of the people. He stood above ethnic, racial and language barriers and had been helping all who sought his services. He was a most cultured personality and stood up to full height, in that, as tall as himself. He won the admiration of all communities - the Sinhalese, the Tamils and the Muslims - and was loved by all of them. He rightly deserved his appointment as Deputy Minister of Ethnic Affairs and National Integration.

The Hon. Noordeen Mashoor was also a man of his conviction and had always upheld what he was convinced to be the right thing. Being a pleasant personality with an ever-smiling face, he played a very vital role in community development activities without any fanfare. His untimely demise at a young age has deprived the country of a gentleman politician who could bravely stand up to the test of time.

Sir, I am very grateful to you for giving me these few minutes because I have to attend another meeting at 4.00 p.m. I join the Members of this House in conveying my

heartfelt condolence to the members of his grieving family.

May Allah grant him the felicity of paradise! Thank you. [.. 3.54] . ( . ) (The Hon. S. Shritharan) ! ! ! . 2010 . , ? ? ? , . , , , . Lobby . . . , , , .

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Mr. Presiding Member, while associating myself with all that has been said by the Hon. Members of this august Assembly about the late Hon. Noordeen Mashoor, I also wish to say a few words about him.

He belonged to the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. As far as the Tamils are concerned, there has been a very good rapport with the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress for the last several years. We are confident that if you want to solve the ethnic question to the satisfaction of all, we need the support of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, irrespective of the fact that they are in the Government now.

The Hon. Noordeen Mashoor was born at Erukkalampiddy and had received his education there and at Kandy. Thereafter, he had graduated from the University of Jaffna. It was in this House that I met him for the first time in December 2000, when he got elected from Vanni under the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress ticket. I also got elected to Parliament under the All Ceylon Tamil Congress ticket from Jaffna for the first time in December 2000. From that day onwards till his death, we had been moving very closely with me. When I heard about his death, I was shocked; I was shocked to hear that my learned and beloved Friend had died at the age of 48 years. I could not believe it. He had been a Member of Parliament. He had been a Deputy Minister. Had he not died, he would have ended up as a Minister. He did not discriminate between communities. When he was a Member of Parliament representing Vanni, he helped not only the Tamils and the Muslims, but also the people there who went to him asking for help. He is a very religious person. Every year he used to go to Mecca. He wanted to help his community.

The other fact that I want to state in this House is this: I was a bit worried that he was also affected by the people who got displaced in Mannar and Jaffna. I tender my apology on behalf of the Tamil community, to my Muslim friends for what had happened to them in Jaffna and Mannar in 1990. I hope that that type of incident would not happen again and we will not allow it. Everybody in this House spoke good of him. He was indeed a very good person. He was a very good friend of mine. We used to discuss daily about our problems and he was always with a smiling face.

Finally, I would like to request the Chair to convey my condolences to the members of his family, to the Sri

Lanka Muslim Congress and to the people of Vanni. It is not only a loss to the members of his family but also a loss to me as well as to the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress.

Thank you. [. . 5.46]
