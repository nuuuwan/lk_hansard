( )

( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Hon. Member, on behalf of the Minister of External Affairs, shall I table the Answer or read it out?

() ( ( ) () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Sudharshini Fernandopulle) Can you read out at least the summary of it?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Okay.

(a) (i) United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Information Centre, World Food Programme, United Nations Population Fund, United Nations Childrens Fund, World Health Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization, International Labour Organization and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

(ii) United Nations Development Programme - UNDP : The United Nations Development Programme is the main body responsible for coordinating UN development work, especially national efforts to reach the Millennium Development Goals - MDGs, with particular emphasis on halving extreme poverty by 2015.

United Nations Information Centre - UNIC : United Nations Information Centre is the principal source of information about the United Nations system and UNIC is responsible for promoting greater public understanding of and support for the aims and activities of the United Nations by disseminating information on the work of the Organization to people,in their local languages.

World Food Programme - Established in 1961 by the General Assembly and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization - FAO - Conference, WFP provides food aid primarily to low-income and food-deficit countries, assist in the implementation of economic and social development projects. World Food Programme further provides the relief needs to victims of natural and other disasters.

United Nations Populations Fund - UNFPA : The work of the UN Population Fund is guided by the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development adopted in Cairo in 1994.

The funds strategic plan covering the period 2008-11, addresses three cross-cutting needs, mainstreaming young peoples concerns, emergencies and humanitarian assistance and special attention for marginalized and excluded populations.

Internal Labour Organization - ILO : As the only tripartite UN agency, it brings together representatives of governments, employers and workers to jointly shape policies and programmes about employment and work, thereby promoting rights at work, encouraging decent employment opportunities, enhancing social protection and strengthening dialogue in handling work-related issues. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees - UNHCR : The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is mandated to lead and co-ordinate international action to protect refugees and resolve refugee problems. Its principal functions are to provide international protection to refugees and other persons of concern, including stateless people, and to seek durable solutions for them. While its mandate specifically covers refugees, UNHCR has also frequently been asked to protect and assist Internally Displaced Persons - IDPs - in conflict-generated emergencies.

(iii) Yes, the programmes have the approval of the Government.

(iv) All foreign-funded programmes and projects are supervised by the Department of Foreign Aid Review and Budget Monitoring of the Ministry of Finance and Planning. Relevant Government institutions/ Ministries are provided with copies of such agreements signed by the Ministry of Finance and Planning for project implementation. The Line Ministries, in turn, are required to report on the implementation as well as progress of the relevant projects to the above Department of the Ministry of Finance and Planning on a regular basis.

(b) The grants received by each of the aforesaid organizations and institutions from the year 2005 up to now are not applicable to the Ministry of External Affairs. The information is available with the Ministry of Finance and Planning.

(c) Does not arise.

() ( ( ) () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Sudharshini Fernandopulle) Sir, I thank the Hon. Deputy Minister for giving me a detailed Answer for the Question. My first Supplementary Question is, - these UN organizations give funds to various Non-Governmental Organizations - whether the Governments concurrence has to be obtained for that?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Yes, it has to be obtained.

() ( ( ) () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Sudharshini Fernandopulle) Foreign experts are brought into the country from time to time, when you get experts with the same expertise in Sri Lanka as well and various reports are published, some of which are beneficial to the country whereas some are detrimental. So, I want to know whether the Government has some sort of a monitoring system on that or whether approval of the Government is obtained when such experts are brought into the country?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) It is necessary to get the Government's concurrence, but we cannot influence those experts to include our views in their reports. There is a separate panel of UN experts. But, sometimes they do not recruit experts from Sri Lanka. So, if Sri Lankans are interested in getting recruited to such panels, they have to write to the UN and request to be admitted to those. But, when they come here, we have to take their reports into consideration.

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Could I ask the Hon. Deputy Minister why the IOM and UNOPS were omitted from the list and is it correct to say that UNOPS actually collects funding from other sources and does not actually receive a grant for operation here, that instead it collects funds that might otherwise be more usefully utilized by Sri Lankan organizations?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) I did not understand your Question, Hon. Member. Are you asking why I did not mention the IOM and the UNOPS?

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Yes, and is it correct that the UNOPS does not get any co-funding, but instead collects grants from other sources, which could more usefully be utilized by Sri Lankan organizations?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) That is how they are functioning; that is their mandate. They do not come under the United Nations. They collect funds from other institutions, not from the UN.

1579 1580

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Can you clarify the fact that they do not come under the United Nations? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) They do not come under the organizations and institutes which are operating in Sri Lanka and which are affiliated to the United Nations Organization. ( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) So, how are they connected? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) They are working independently. ( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) So, do they have a separate agreement with Sri Lanka? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Do you mean the IOM? Yes. ( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) No, I mean the UNOPS. The UNOPS calls itself the United Nations Office for Project Services and I believed it was a part of the UN. But, as you just very kindly explained that it is not a regular part of the UN, does it really have a role in Sri Lanka? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) UNOPS is basically doing construction works on contracts and various other things. So, it comes under these main bodies I mentioned. There are altogether nine organizations under the United Nations umbrella. So, that comes under those nine organizations.

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) So, is it a separate institution? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) It is not a separate institution, but a separate body functioning under the nine organizations of the UN, which we have accepted.

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) So, we will have to get the information we need about their funding from the Treasury. Is it?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Yes, of course.

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Thank you.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is your point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I refer to Standing Order No. 78. According to that, you cannot criticize persons engaged in the administration of justice. This is exactly what the Hon. Member is doing. The other thing is, he referred to a Member whose case had been withdrawn by the Attorney-General. So, Sir, there are two aspects: one is, criticizing the Attorney-General and the other is, reflecting on the conduct of an Hon. Member of this House. Therefore, he must withdraw what he said. He must know the Standing Orders. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Whatever statements he has made contrary to Standing Orders will be expunged. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Thank you, Sir.

( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I ask your indulgence to make some observations on a matter in respect of which there has been considerable interest during the last two weeks.

I wish to clarify the position with reference to the reported incidents involving Indian fishermen in the recent past. The first of these stemmed from reports that on the 12th of January and the 23rd of January respectively, two Indian fishermen lost their lives. Subsequently, on the 15th and on the 16th of this month, several Indian fishermen were apprehended by Sri Lanka nationals in our waters and handed over to the Police.

I would like to make it clear in this regard that Sri Lanka deeply values her close bilateral relationship with India. The Government has carried out the most diligent and meticulous examination into the reports of the deaths of the two fishermen. On the basis of the information that was made available, the Sri Lanka Navy was instructed by the Ministry of Defence to carry out its own inquiry. The Navy has the facility of keeping track of the precise location of any of its vessels at any given time, especially when they happen to be deployed in the waters between India and Sri Lanka. Based on the data recorded by these facilities, it is clear that there were no Sri Lanka Navy vessels in the vicinity of the locations, where the incidents are alleged to have occurred.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, it must be emphasized that it is the policy of Sri Lanka to treat any foreign fishermen found in our waters in a humanitarian manner. The Government has given explicit directives that this policy must be followed on all occasions.

At the same time, we must be particularly mindful of the difficulties faced by our own fishermen, including those of the fishing community in the Northern Province. As we are all aware, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the waters on our side of the International Maritime Boundary Line off our Northern and North-Western shores are very rich in living marine resources. It is the northern fishermen who have traditionally fished in these areas. However, for several decades they were constrained from doing so, because we had due to security concerns during the time of the struggle against terrorism, to enforce a ban on fishing in those areas which were security-sensitive at that time. Today, that situation is no more and they are looking forward to resuming their livelihoods. However, they now have to face the problem of the illicit fishing carried out in these waters by fishermen from the other side of the Palk Strait. It is this regrettable situation that has led to the apprehension of the Indian fishermen.

The two Governments are in close contact on this issue. During the visit of the Indian Foreign Secretary to Colombo last month, it was agreed that the Joint Working Group on Fisheries would meet soon. We stand by our commitment to the policy of humanitarian treatment. At the same time, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we have made clear that the authorities do have an obligation to prevent incursions by their fishermen across the Maritime Boundary for illegal fishing.

Incidents involving fishermen crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line have been taking place over a long period. It is now clearly recognized that a durable and stable solution to the problems in this regard requires an approach directed towards preventing the occurrence of these incidents rather than an attempt to find solutions after the incidents have occurred. An ad hoc approach does not serve us adequately. The basic requirement is to prevent the incursion by fishermen across the Maritime Boundary. This has naturally been the focus of attention in the discussions which have taken place between the two Governments during the last few days. Some helpful steps have been taken in this regard.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, there is also a clear acknowledgement of the need for an appropriate mechanism to address these issues in a continuing time frame. The mechanism identified for this purpose by both Governments is the Joint Working Group on Fisheries, which is an existing mechanism although it has not met for some time. It is proposed to revive this process in order to address the relevant issues comprehensively. The Governments of Sri Lanka and India will also encourage fishermens organizations on both sides to discuss informally, viable solutions and their implementation. This will be a helpful point of departure. Dates will be fixed for the meeting of the Joint Working Group in due course.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is a matter for satisfaction that - thanks to the immense fund of goodwill and understanding between Sri Lanka and India - this issue has been resolved amicably.

I thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! I wish to make an announcement. This House cordially welcomes the Delegation, now present in the Speakers Gallery, from the European Parliament led by Mrs. Jean Lambert, MEP. They belong to the South Asia Group. [. . 4.44]

( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva - Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management and Leader of the House of Parliament) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am very glad to participate in this Adjournment Debate moved by the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The gist of the Motion is that there is no need for the extension of the state of Emergency anymore. I think the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake is playing a dual role. He has forgotten the era when

1657 1658

[ ]

2011 24

hundreds of thousands of people were killed during the JVP insurrection. Media personnel, respected Buddhist Monks and many other Government servants including the Army and Police personnel were brutally killed by the JVP and the then Government had to impose a state of Emergency in order to protect the lives and property of the State and the people. It was at that time that the Emergency Regulations were framed in order to secure law and order in the country. Thereafter, when the JVP insurrection was over, the LTTE started their activities. Therefore, it was incumbent on the part of the Government of the United National Party as well as that of the UPFA to impose a state of Emergency in order to preserve the law and order of the country. So, this is not peculiar only to Sri Lanka. Especially when the worst terrorist group in the world was fighting for a separate State in this country, we had to ensure that our country is not divided. The LTTE has killed more Tamil people than Sinhala and Muslim people in this conflict. We should not forget that. Why we imposed the state of Emergency was to protect the lives, not only of the Sinhala people but of the Tamil and Muslim people also.

Thereafter, Hon. Deputy Speaker, with the vibrant leadership of His Excellency the President, we have been able to eradicate terrorism to a certain extent whereas the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and the United National Party was trying to drag our feet. They went on a path where they wanted to discuss; they divided the country in an unofficial manner and entered into some agreements and strengthened the LTTE. But, when our President took over the country, he was an example to the whole world. His name will go into the Guinness Book and to the world political arena as the "One President-One Leader" of a small country, who fought against the terrorism; defeated terrorism and liberated our land. He not only liberated the Sinhala people but he also liberated our Tamil brothers, sisters and mothers in Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi as well as in Batticaloa and other areas. Even the MPs of the TNA who were caught up in the LTTE net who were frightened of the LTTE, who could not speak - [Interruption.] We gave protection to them and we liberated them too. We are happy about that. So, we use the Emergency Regulations in order to save the nation.

Now, there is a question as to why we ask for an extension of the state of Emergency when the war is over. If you see peripherally, the war is over. But, we are aware of our intelligent reports and all what is happening in the foreign soil. They have established a mock Eelam government in exile and they are trying to regroup the LTTE supporters and the LTTE cadres who are here in Sri Lanka. Even during the conflict, Hon. Deputy Speaker, we did not kill all these people after they were caught by the Army. We took them into custody and we are now trying to rehabilitate them. So, the people are in existence. The LTTE cadres are there, and the Tamil diaspora is there in foreign soils still collecting money

and trying to establish contacts with some of the LTTE cadres who have gone underground in Sri Lanka. So, that is why we need the state of Emergency; to search when we get information.

The Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake was asking us, Why do you not act under the normal law? Under the normal law, supposing we get some information about some terrorists who are getting ready or hiding in some place, then we have to go to the Magistrate and get a warrant of arrest and that sometimes will take two or three days. By that time, he will move from that place to another place. So, that is why we need the state of Emergency. It empowers the police or the army personnel to go immediately and arrest such person. It is for the benefit of the country. Sometimes, civil liberty and other things have to be compromised for the cause of national interest. If you take some Acts which are found in Singapore, Malaysia and even in the Western World, these provisions are there. Therefore, Sir, there is much justification for extending the state of Emergency.

I am happy that the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake is here. He stated so many incorrect facts with regard to the Emergency Regulations. I can bring to the notice of this august Assembly the Emergency Regulations which were promulgated on the 13th of August, 2005. According to the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1405/14, several Emergency Regulations were promulgated. Of that, only a few Emergency Regulations exist now because the latest Emergency Regulation which was promulgated by His Excellency the President and the Regulation made under the Public Security Ordinance have repealed a number of Regulations which were there earlier. For example, I will read the Emergency Regulation 8. It states, I quote:

Taking into possession of buildings and premises used in connection with any offence under these Regulations . That has been repealed. Then, Emergency Regulation 12 states, I quote:

Special precautions should be taken to prevent the entry of unauthorized persons into any area, place or premises occupied or used for the maintenance of essential services.

That has also been repealed. Then, I will read Emergency Regulation 13. It states, I quote:

Prohibit the holding of public possessions or public meetings in areas and the duration specified in order made by the President.

That has also been repealed. So, the right of expression is there. There are no restrictions in holding the meetings. Earlier, the Emergency Regulations placed certain restrictions. Now, His Excellency the President and the Government has repealed that. It is a diabolical untruth for him to say that the right of expression has been curtailed.

1659 1660

I quote Emergency Regulation 14. It states:

Power to impose curfew in certain areas by the President.

That Regulation has also been repealed by this Gazette.

Then, I will come to the Emergency Regulation 15. It states, I quote:

Competent Authority is given the power for preventing or restricting the publications in Sri Lanka or any area of it, or the transmission from Sri Lanka to place outside Sri Lanka, of matters harmful to the national security or public order.

That has also been repealed. That is why the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and the other Members of the Opposition distort facts abroad as well as in Sri Lanka, at seminars and discussions in public and secret, to make the Government unpopular. So, that Regulation has been repealed and we cannot take action against any of these people who distort facts and say various harmful things about Sri Lanka, His Excellency the President or the administration. Hold that liberty that is there to tell any diabolical untruth regarding Sri Lanka! Earlier, it was not so, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Earlier, we could have charged them under the Emergency Regulations but we have now given them freedom.

Emergency Regulation 16 states, I quote:

Advisory Committee to be appointed in every Divisional Secretarys Division consisting of public servants, trade unionists......... These Committees advise the relevant authorities on the preservation of public order..

That is not necessary and that has also been repealed. Then, Emergency Regulation 18(1)(b) states, I quote:

Secretary to the Ministry of Defence is empowered to make orders in order to prevent persons from causing destruction or damage to movable or immovable property.

That has been restricted only for three months.

Emergency Regulations 19 (b) and 19 (4) have been repealed in a restricted way.

Emergency Regulations 19(5), 19(6), 19(7) and 19(8) which were there in the original Emergency Regulations list has also been repealed.

Then, I will read the Emergency Regulation 23. It states, I quote:

Householder to give lists of inmates when required.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, when terrorism was at its peak, we brought this Emergency Regulation that every

householder should give the names of their inmates. We did so in order to check whether any person comes to that village or to that city from outside for any terrorist activity. So, that has been repealed.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, if that has been repealed, why do you still ask the residents in Jaffna to do that?

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Nobody is asking. This has been repealed. You can go to courts and ask that. There is no justification in asking that. You are a lawyer.- [Interruption.] ( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera - Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare)Hon. Member, you are in Colombo. You go to Jaffna - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Hon. Minister, you can continue with your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Then, I will read Emergency Regulation 25. It states, I quote: Offences against movable and immovable property That has also been repealed.

Then, Emergency Regulation 26 states, I quote:

Any act or conduct of a person urging or advising the necessity of overthrowing or overpowering the government by unlawful means is an offence.

That has also been repealed. Even if you try to throw our Government away by unlawful means, we will charge you under the normal law and not under the Emergency Regulations. You can see the amount of concession that we have given even to the terrorists and to the people who want to act in an unlawful manner to throw away a Government. - [Interruption.] Do you get this type of democracy in any part of the world? - [Interruption.] No, Hon. Sumanthiran, listen to this. Emergency Regulation 27 states, I quote:

Affixing posters or distributing handbills, leaflets which are prejudicial to the public security or public orders is an offence.

1661 1662

[ ]

2011 24

That has also been repealed. So, you can distribute any leaflet or you can put up any poster even if they are prejudicial to the public security.- [Interruption.] Then, Emergency Regulation 28. It states, I quote:

Communication or spreading of rumours ..

This is what the Opposition is doing.

.and false statements which is likely to cause public alarm or public disorder.

That has been repealed. Otherwise, the Leader of the Opposition and most of you can be taken into custody under this Regulation. But, fortunately or unfortunately, that has been repealed and the Government can still not act under the Emergency Regulations on whatever false statements or rumours that you spread .

If you take the Emergency Regulation 29 which has also been repealed, it states, I quote:

Those who print, publish any document or make films

That is what had been done. You had been making films to tarnish the image of Sri Lanka.

or photographs with the aim of promoting communalism, terrorism or creating communal tension will be guilty of an offence.

That Regulation has also been repealed. Then I will read the Emergency Regulation 30. It states, I quote:

Any person taking photograph of buildings, places or things without permission of the authorities shall be guilty of an offence.

You are aware that we brought this Regulation in the interest of public security when terrorism was at its peak. That has also been repealed. Emergency Regulation 31 states, I quote:

Making false statements when required to make under emergency regulations, will be an offence.

It is not an offence now. Even if you get caught, you can make a false statement and get away.

Emergency Regulation 32 states, I quote:

Whoever without lawful excuse, has in his custody any drawing, map, plan or outline of an office, organization, institution of the government or the armed services shall be guilty of an offence.

That has also been repealed.

Possession of subversive literature was an offence earlier under Regulation 33. Now, it has been repealed.

Emergency Regulation 34 states, I quote:

Collection of arms, offensive weapons, dangerous articles, or trains any persons in the manufacture or use of those arms and ammunitions shall be guilty of an offence upon conviction be liable to rigorous imprisonment for a term not les than ten years.

Now, that term has been increased to 15 years. There is much of justification over this action. If somebody collects arms and ammunition and engages in terrorist activities, then we can charge him and increase the fine. I think we are quite justified in bringing this new piece of legislation.

Emergency Regulation 35 states, I quote:

Wearing of apparel uniforms by persons not attached to armed forces will be an offence.

Those days, the LTTE cadres wore army uniforms, came to villages and shot at the people; they caused much of destruction. So, at that time we brought in this Regulation to punish them. The JVP also did the same. Those days they dressed up in police and army uniforms, robbed the banks et cetera and rioted in the villages. Therefore, we made even the wearing of a uniform an offence. But, now that has been repealed. I hope they would not repeat it.

Emergency Regulation 36 states, I quote:

Possession or transportation of explosives, guns, offensive weapons, and offensive resembling substances will be an offence.

That also has been repealed. You will be charged now under the normal law, not under the Emergency Regulations.

Emergency Regulation 37 states, I quote:

Throwing any thing or substance at any person or any vehicle that can cause damage will be an offence which upon conviction be liable to rigorous imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years".

That has also been repealed and you will be charged under the normal law.

Emergency Regulation 38 states, I quote:

No person shall without lawful excuse, point at any person any gun whether loaded or not.

Earlier, if you point a gun, loaded or unloaded, it was an offence under the Emergency Regulations. Now, we have repealed that law also.

Emergency Regulation 39 states, I quote:

No person shall intimidate or obstruct any person.

That has also been repealed.

Emergency Regulation 41 states, I quote:

Threat of death by any manner or bodily harm to any other person can be tried by the High Courts and upon conviction can be punished with death.

We brought in this Regulation especially during the time of the LTTE insurrection because they were extorting a lot of money from the innocent Tamil people

1663 1664

and from business people. So, we brought this Regulation to prevent that. Now, we have repealed that Regulation also.

Emergency Regulation 47 states, I quote:

Powers of investigating police officers investigating into an offence under any emergency regulation.

That has been repealed.

Emergency Regulation 48 states, I quote:

Documents of suspected persons in possession shall be admitted in evidence against such persons.

That has been repealed.

Emergency Regulation 49 states, I quote:

The right to make inquiries by the investigating authorities and the duty to give assistance to those authorities.

That has been repealed. A person who had been arrested under the Emergency Regulations had a duty to give assistance to the authorities. Now, that is not there. So, they can lie and get away.

Emergency Regulation 54 states, I quote:

Death of any person due to action of or in custody of any police officer or any member of the armed forces should be reported the facts to the IGP or nearest DIG of the area.

That has also been repealed.

Emergency Regulation 55 states, I quote:

Upon receipt of the report under Regulation 54, IGP or the DIG shall direct an officer not below the rank of ASP to make necessary investigations.

That has also been repealed.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would take some time because - the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake tried to paint a picture that there are so many regulations which are very harmful to society - I want to demonstrate that that is a diabolical untruth. Emergency Regulation 56 states, I quote:

"Conducting of post-mortem and burial of cremation of dead bodies".

It has now been repealed. Earlier, you could not just cremate a dead body.

Emergency Regulation 57 states, I quote:

"High Court to inquire into death of any person upon application made to it by the IGP".

This has been repealed.

Emergency Regulation 58 states, I quote:

"Powers of Attorney-General with regard to the cases referred to under regulation 57".

It has been repealed.

Emergency Regulation 63 states, I quote:

"Admissibility of statement in evidence whether or not it amounts to a confession or whether or not such statement was made while in the custody".

I would like to make a point on this. The Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that under the Emergency Regulations, you can take a person into custody and get a statement and thereafter you can make use of that statement as a confession. That is not possible. That Regulation has been repealed.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Under the PTA -

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) PTA is a different matter. PTA has been in existence for a long time.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It is still in existence.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) We are not debating on the PTA, we are debating on the Emergency.

Emergency Regulation 64 states, I quote:

"The provisions of Chapter XI of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act shall not apply to any investigations conducted under any emergency regulation ."

It has been repealed. Likewise, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Emergency Regulations 65, 67, 70, and 71(b) have been repealed.

We have kept certain regulations which are very vital and necessary for the protection of our country to ensure that terrorism will not raise its head again. There is a greater responsibility on the part of the Government to safeguard our country from terrorism, which our brave soldiers have done. We cannot allow terrorism to come back. We have to take necessary safeguards to ensure that we get the benefit of the development, which will be embarked upon by our Government after the defeat of terrorism. It is the duty of every right-thinking Hon. Member and every right-thinking citizen of this country

1665 1666

[ ]

2011 24

to support the extension of the state of Emergency at all times to preserve the territorial integrity of our country. We are quite aware that there are very many forces within Sri Lanka as well as outside Sri Lanka to disturb the political equilibrium in Sri Lanka. Therefore, His Excellency the President and the Government think that it is our responsibility to ensure the protection of our motherland.

Thank you very much, Hon. Deputy Speaker. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! The next speaker is the Hon. Dilan Perera. Before he starts, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer to take the Chair?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I propose that the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer do now take the Chair.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . .

[. . 5.26] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to participate in the Debate on the Adjournment Motion which states that the Opposition proposes to the House that the state of Emergency is not further needed as more than one and a half years have passed since the conclusion of the war.

In this connection, I want the Hon. Members of this House to refer to Section 42 of the Constitution, which states, I quote:

"The President shall be responsible to Parliament for the due exercise, performance and discharge of his powers, duties and functions under the Constitution and any written law, including the law for the time being relating to public security."

Normally, a state of Emergency is declared only when there is an emergency situation prevailing in the country. Section 2 (1) of the Public Security Ordinance states, I quote:

"Where, in view of the existence or imminence of a state of public emergency, the President is of opinion that it is expedient so to do in the interests of public security and the preservation of public order or for the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community, the President may, by Proclamation published in the Gazette, declare that the provisions of Part II of this Ordinance shall, forthwith or on such date as may be specified in the Proclamation, come into operation throughout Sri Lanka or in such part or parts of Sri Lanka.........".

None of the conditions stated in the Public Security Ordinance exist in the country for the declaration of Emergency. [Interruption.] I am saying that. [Interruption.] I have referred to Sectio 2 (1).

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) But, you must support your argument.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) The Emergency Regulations give wide powers to the forces and according to the earlier Emergency Regulations, a person could be kept for one year in detention under the Detention Orders issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence. But, that was amended sometime back and the period of detention of one year under Emergency Regulations is now limited to three months only. Another offence is included in the new regulations. That is, any offence under the PTA is also an offence under the present regulations.

Now, this amendment does not give any relief to the prisoners who are arrested under the Emergency Regulations, because the police on the expiration of three months period under the Emergency Regulations obtain a Detention Order from the President under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which enables a person to be kept for 18 months. So, the amendment has not done any good or given any relief to those who are arrested under the Emergency Regulations.

This amendment was brought in because the Government felt that a person should not be kept in detention for more than three months and that the police inquiries should be finished within three months. There is a judgment delivered by Justice Shirani Bandaranayake that a person arrested under the Emergency Regulations should not be kept for more than three months and at the end of the three-month period, he must be released or produced before a Magistrate and remanded.

These Emergency Regulations give wide powers to the forces and these powers are being misused. For instance, one Gunasunderam Jeyasunderam, a foreigner, who is a highly qualified Engineer, was taken into custody at the Katunayake International Airport on 4th September, 2007 and he was kept under Emergency Regulations for one year and two months. Thereafter, he was detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act for 18 months and after the 18-month period, he was remanded and he is now being detained at the New Magazine Prison. He is innocent, he has been in remand and in detention for more than three and a half years. I have made several attempts to get him released but my attempts were not fruitful.

It was under the Emergency Regulations, Brahmin Nithiyanandan and his sons were shot by ex-militants, by guns given to them by the Army. An education officer was shot dead in the same manner. The fear which these incidents have caused is still prevailing in the minds of the people in Jaffna and they are still in a fear psychosis.

I wonder whether in Jaffna, there is a civilian rule or a military rule. Emergency Regulations, resettlement, high

security zones and media freedom are all intertwined. With regard to the high security zones, the Defence

1673 1674

[ ]

2011 24

Secretary says that there are no high security zones in the North. The Government Agent in Jaffna has also told the Canadian Parliamentary Delegation that there are no high security zones in Jaffna. I asked the Prime Minister whether 30 per cent of the North namely, Valigamam North, is said to be a high security zone. The Hon. Prime Minister wanted three weeks' time to answer this Question but the answer has not yet been given.

When you go past Tellippallai, Army officers say that the area was under a high security zone. Are we to believe the Defence Secretary or the Government Agent or go and see the actual situation prevalent there? Several areas have been unofficially declared as high security zones and the people are not allowed to go and resettle there. At least at this late stage, will the Hon. Prime Minister inform this House whether certain areas in the North are under high security zones and these unofficially declared high security zones are responsible for not taking any steps to resettle people. In Valigamam North Division, only in three Grama Sevaka Divisions namely, Illavalai North, Illavalai North-West and Vithakapuram, people were recently resettled. I also understand that steps are being taken to resettle people in Kollan Kallady, Tellippallai, Kadduwan, Kurumbacity, Kurumbacity East and Vasavilan East.

In 1990, about 100,000 people got displaced from Valigamam North and some are remaining in camps still while some are staying with their relatives. If no high security zone has been declared by the Government in Valikamam North, why can the people not be allowed to go and resettle in Valikamam North? Several schools, hospitals and the Palali Training College are said to be under the so-called high security zones. I kindly request the Government to take early and immediate steps to resettle the people in the Valikamam North area.

The people who were living in the Eluthumadduval East and Eluthumadduval West have not yet been allowed to go and resettle in their own lands. In Vadamaradchchi East particularly under Maruthan Kerny Divisional Secretary's Division, people from the following areas have not yet been allowed to resettle: Nagar Kovil South, Nagar Kovil North, Kudarappu, Vetrilai Kerny, Kaddaikadu, Kevil, Mulliyan and Chundikulam. All these people are being detained in a camp called Ramavil Camp at Meesalai. There are about 2,000 people who want to go and resettle in those areas. In the Mullaitivu District, out of 28,473 families consisting of 112,056 persons, only 53,361 persons have been resettled and the balance half of the population have not yet been resettled.

In the Mullaitivu District, people have been allowed to go and resettle at Vattapalai area, but the people from Keppapulavu have not yet been resettled and the people from Vattapalai are having fields and cemetery in Keppapulavu. Why is it that the Army is not allowing these people to resettle in the Keppapulavu area? In

Mandaithivu, almost all the houses are being occupied by the Navy Officers. About a hundred families are living in makeshift huts for the last 10 to 12 years.

These Emergency Regulations affect the media freedom as well. What happened to the procession of the UNP at Borella? Thugs with clubs assaulted and damaged the cars of the UNP MPs. This was done in the presence of a DIG and police officers from Borella. Why has the Police not arrested these thugs?

Further, within the last two years, 27 media men including Mr. Lasantha Wickrematunge were killed and the Government should take responsibility for this. What happened to Mr. Pradeep Ekneligoda who was abducted about three months ago? Is he living or dead? A senior officer of the UN has said that the ICRC or the UN officials were not given access to see 5,000 former militants. I kindly request the Government to release the names of all persons who are in custody to the press. I think the Emergency Regulations are being used only to continue to keep these people in prisons or camps.

The JVP knows well as to what happened to several youths in the 1980s. Several bodies of young persons between the age of 16 and 20 years were floating in the river. Since the Emergency Regulations are responsible for the illegal arrest, abductions, extrajudicial killings, arrest by white vans and to muzzle the media freedom, we do not want the Emergency Regulations to be extended every month. When the late Mr. Premadasa became the President, though there was an internal war at that time, he did not make use of the Emergency Regulations to rule the country.

Thank you.

I think this issue is of concern to all of us, and we need to discuss this in practical terms. But, we also need to look into the past, to learn what went wrong and ensure no repetition of such wrongs. The history of Emergency Regulations in this country teaches us that there have been two types of Emergency: an Emergency that provides protection to the citizens and an Emergency that increases violence and suffering. Such violence is used not only by enemies of the State but by State Forces too. Sadly there were governments in the past, though not in the last 20 years, that used Emergency Regulations in a manner that played into the hands of terrorists.

It is not surprising, Sir, that the JVP should propose this Motion and it should not be surprising if the UNP also supports this. We know in 1979, when the Prevention of Terrorism Act was introduced, there were few terrorists and the then Government increased that number dramatically. They used violence not only in terms of Emergency Regulations but, also otherwise as we saw as

in 1981 and in 1983, when there were attacks on Tamils all over the country.

They went further. By proscribing the JVP in 1983, they drove that party underground, where it thrived on violence. Sir, in the late '80s, the stage was set for a game of atrocity snap in which the UNP and the JVP competed to terrorize the population.

So, we must be glad that the UNP and the JVP are committed to limiting the use of Emergency. Like lunatics who have learnt to take the right pills, they know that they both need to be placed under restraint at the right time. Unfortunately, one of the problems with lunatics is that they think they are models for the world at large. But, sane people like this Government do not need to take pills and they do not need to place themselves under restraint. This Government has shown that it can use Emergency Regulations judiciously, to restrict terrorism and to eliminate it from these shores, but without causing through abuses an increase in sympathy for terrorist activity as happened in the late '70s and '80s.

It is sad that the Members of the ITAK support this Motion because they too were victims of the increase in terrorist activity caused by the antics of the Jayewardene Government. Crucial for the future is the question of trust. I know that the ITAK Members feel that their trust in successive Sri Lankan Governments was misplaced in the first 40 years after Independence. They have reasons for this belief but they should recognize that this Government too has reason for its own lack of trust namely, the support - implicit and explicit - given to a monstrous terrorist movement by politicians who should have known better. I am also deeply sad to say - I am sure it was a slip of the tongue - that an Hon. Member who spoke today referred to Mr. Prabhakaran as a national leader and I do hope that ITAK will make it absolutely clear that they have no truck with terrorism at all.

But, I believe it is our duty to forgive the aberrations of Members of the TNA in the days when they claimed that the LTTE were the sole representatives of the Tamils and when they seemed to excuse violence and terror. That terror was directed against their own leaders and it must have caused trauma to see people like Mr. A. Amirthalingam, Mr. V. Yoheswaran, Mr. Sam Tambimuttu and Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam killed when they dared to stand up against terrorist tyranny. It is because of our awareness of that brutality we now feel that we must work together with them in good faith. But, we also cannot ignore the other Tamil parties who worked and stood up against the LTTE.

So, this pluralistic approach, Sir, is important since we must realize that those who succumbed to pressure once may do so again. Unfortunately, though this country is largely free of separatist and terrorist forces, we know they lurk unforgivingly in other parts of the world. Most

1691 1692

governments have understood the dangers of terrorism, but there are people with a simplistic approach who believe that terrorism can be excused. Such people are more nave than wicked but they still exist. If I might quote from a recent European Union Terrorism Situation and Trend Report, it states:Although the LTTE has faced considerable setbacks in Sri Lanka, its vast global network and strong control over the Tamil diaspora and various Tamil associations with structures of fund raising, procurement and propaganda is till very much active and firmly in place.

So, Mr. Presiding Member, while some European politicians and I am sorry to say, some diplomats flirted with terror, the security establishments were categorical in their opposition to terror and we must be grateful to them. But, we are still not entirely certain that their political masters have learnt the lesson that you cannot touch pitch and not be defiled.

Sir, the price of liberty is constant vigilance. Whilst such threats remain abroad and receive encouragement from all sorts of individuals and institutions, we cannot relax the Emergency Regulations altogether. We relaxed some of its provisions last year and I hope more will be relaxed shortly, but my Friends in ITAK must realize that we need to protect from further suffering those who have returned to their homes from which the LTTE forced them to move.

We have to protect from further intimidation and forced recruitment, the youngsters we are now rehabilitating and reintegrating. And, we also have to protect from threats and even assassination, the Tamil politicians who are fully involved once more in the democratic process like my Friends who are now in the House.

Unfortunately, the forces of evil and terror have unlimited funds, they still have the ears of politicians and diplomats who should know better. We are aware that they continue with efforts to destabilize whilst we try to restore normalcy. So, we remember the failure to condemn them in the past. We know how thin morality is. We know the world at large gives into intimidation and terror. If we are to preserve our unity and work towards the prosperity of all our citizens, we have to remain vigilant ourselves. We found that Emergency Regulations helped us to stop terrorist activity, and we cannot now afford to allow any disruption of the process of returns. Of course, we owe it to our fellow citizens to ensure that there are no abuses of these Regulations, and we must make sure that problems can be raised and remedial action taken in case of abuse.

It would be good if the Emergency Regulations could be lifted altogether. We must all work towards that end.

I am glad in particular that ITAK made clear a willingness to cooperate with Government rather than engage in confrontation. The confrontational approach of the main Opposition, that seemed to lend support to those elements in the diaspora that incline towards violence and separatism, is perverse and regrettable. In that regard, we have to be more indulgent to Members of the former TNA, and recognize they have to be cautious. But, I can only urge that they minimize their dependence on their erstwhile friends; that they recognize that Government too has to be cautious but that in the end, we must work together in good faith if we are to overcome the terrors of the past.

Thank you. [. . 6.21]
