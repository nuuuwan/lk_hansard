: .. : REPORT OF THE PANEL APPOINTED BY SECRETARY-GENERAL OF UNITED NATIONS: STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS () . . ( ) ( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for your indulgence in permitting me to make a Statement on behalf of the Government on the Report of the Panel appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the relationship between Sri Lanka and the United Nations system.

May I begin, Sir, by pointing out that this not a Report of the United Nations. To call it a UN document or a UN Panel is a basic misnomer. This is only a private initiative on the part of the Secretary-General. The Secretary-General has selected three persons in whom he has confidence and he has asked these persons to advise him on certain matters: international best practice, comparative experience and process-related issues. The Secretary-General of the United Nations has repeatedly emphasized that this is only an Advisory Panel - it has no investigative power; it is not a fact-finding body. This Panel has now submitted its Report to His Excellency Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations. It

does not have any formal nexus with the UN or any UN body. I would like to make that point with emphasis at the very outset, Mr. Speaker.

I would also like to say that this Report has been carefully studied by us and we find ourselves unfortunately not able to agree with the Report with regard to any of the matters discussed in it. I will explain to this august Assembly very briefly what the reasons are, why we cannot accept this Report.

In the first place, Mr. Speaker, this Report does the gravest possible almost irreparable damage to the very delicate reconciliation process that the Government has put in motion. It is our intention to put behind us, the pain and the anguish of the past. The wounds are now healing. We do not want to exacerbate tensions. Unfortunately the Report accentuates the dividing lines between the Sinhala and the Tamil communities. It revisits certain incidents in a spirit of rancour and acrimony. It does not help the healing process. This is a time of rapprochement. Regrettably, the Report sets about its task in a manner that is detrimental to this sensitive reconciliation process that is now underway in our country with a dawn of stable peace.

It was also be pointed out that the process followed by the Panel is fundamentally flawed. In as many as five places in the Report, they state categorically that they have not embarked on any investigation nor do they have the authority to investigate. Having insisted on that, they then come to the conclusion that there are credible allegations against the Government of Sri Lanka. How can you come to the conclusion, Mr. Speaker, that there are credible allegations without investigating? How have they investigated? In a grossly unfair manner, in a manner that does violence to basic norms of procedural fairness and basic justice, they tell us that they have spoken to people that they consider trustworthy. They have been consultations within the UN system. Some of the people who made these representations have asked that the representations be treated with utmost confidence. The Panel then tells us that they consulted the office of Legal Affairs in the United Nations system and they have now decided to characterize almost all the representations, which they received as strictly confidential, with the result that nobody in the world can have access to this material for a period of 20 long years.

They are saying they have found credible allegations on the basis of material which is shut away from the scrutiny of the human eye. We do not know who has made these representations. We do not know what the content of these representations is. But, they are using this material. There is an impenetrable wall for 20 years. Nobody on this Panel can have any information about the sources, the nature and the impact of whatever it was. We do not know whatever it was that was said to the Panel. I have yet to come across, Mr. Speaker, any

37 38

process which has so flagrantly and cynically violated the basic norms of rudimentary justice. It is also abundantly clear that the report is prejudiced from beginning to end. The Panel describes the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam as a most disciplined and nationalist Tamil organization. The very first sentence in the report is, I quote:

The war in Sri Lanka ended tragically, amidst controversy.

When I quoted that sentence to a foreign dignitary, that person asked me, Tragically for whom?" Certainly not for the people of Sri Lanka. The Panel is of the opinion that the war ended tragically. Is it because the wrong side won the war? Why did the war end tragically? Is that a dispassionate, objective, a fair appraisal of the situation?

I do not intend to burden the House. But, the report is replete with examples of palpable bias and prejudice. The report is also flawed in the sense that the Panel travels far, far beyond its mandate. It has been set up to advise the Secretary-General of the United Nations. But, it proceeds to provide gratuitous advice to the Government of Sri Lanka on a wide range of matters, which pertain exclusively to domestic policy. The Panel has taken the liberty to comment on our court system, the role of the Attorney-General, public order and constitutional issues, when none of these matters fall within the ambit of the mandate that the Secretary-General has given to the Panel.

Now, having said that, Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize something else. The Report was submitted to the Secretary-General. I spoke to the Secretary-General by telephone last Sunday from Oman. We had a very cordial conversation. Now, the Report was submitted to the Secretary-General and the Secretary-General in due course published the Report. At the time of publication, Mr. Speaker, the Secretary-General made a very important statement. He said, This Report has been submitted to me. I am not proposing at this time any further action in the absence of any request by the Government of Sri Lanka and in the absence of any authority conferred upon me by the Member States of the United Nations through the proper organs of the UN system", by which he means principally, the Security Council. So, that is a public statement by the Secretary-General. He has said that very clearly, Sri Lanka has not approached me; the Member States have not made any request on me". And, there the matter rests. That was the clearly articulated position of the Secretary-General at the time he brought the report into the public domain.

As far as the Government of Sri Lanka is concerned, Mr. Speaker, we make a very fundamental distinction between the Panel and the United Nations. We are Members of the United Nations. We have been Members from the inception of the United Nations and we take very

seriously our rights, our responsibilities and our duties to the UN system.

We are a member of the world community; far be it from us to entertain any thought of living in isolation in the contemporary world. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, we will, of course, work with the UN system; we will share information with them; we will communicate with them; that is our duty and that is very much in the interest of the people of Sri Lanka. For that reason, I will write to the Secretary-General giving him some information that he requires at this moment. We are communicating with the Secretary-General of the UN system. In my communication, on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka with His Excellency the Secretary-General of the UN system, I will indicate what we have done up to now since the cessation of hostilities; what do we propose to do in the future; what is the trajectory that we envision. In that regard, I would like to emphasize to this House that the accomplishments of His Excellency the President and the Government of Sri Lanka during the last few months go far beyond the national situation.

We have done things; we have achieved things which have brought about stability and tranquility in the entire South Asian region. It is not only this country, important as it is. As an example, Sir, I would like to refer to the security of sea lanes. I do not have to emphasize that very often in contemporary world history, at the end of such a conflict, there is a period of deep turbulence, of disorder and it takes a long time measured normally not in years but in decades to come back to anything approximating to normalcy.

Take the situation in Cambodia. After the cessation of hostilities, the proliferation of small arms and the destabilization that came about as a result of that for a very long period. But, we were able to ensure that the problems of that kind did not arise and in particular, I would stress the security of sea lanes in this region. Two weeks ago, there was an international Conference that was held in Dubai to consider very acute problems connected with piracy in the Gulf of Aden and in large areas of the Arabian Sea. Sri Lanka was represented at that Conference. But, ferocious as the LTTE was, it was described by no less than the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States as the most ruthless terrorist organization that the world has known. Notwithstanding that reality, the Government of Sri Lanka was able to handle this enormously-complex situation in order to ensure the security of sea lanes and the inviolability of transnational commerce in the Indian Ocean close to the shores of Sri Lanka and in the Bay of Bengal.

We have also achieved very considerable success with regard to matters connected with refugees. Had there been an influx of refugees into other countries, particularly to South India there would have been consequences of very considerable magnitude.

[ () . . ]

2011 03

When I represented Sri Lanka and addressed the Plenary Sessions at the last Shangri-La Dialogue held in Singapore in June last year, the then Minister of Defence of Australia, Senator John Faulkner complimented Sri Lanka for the manner in which we had dealt with problems connected with refugees.

The House is aware that there was an election in Canada yesterday and the results will be known today. In the last government, the Minister in charge of Immigration, Mr. Jason Kenney referred to the need to tighten very significantly Canadas laws relating to immigration.

The Foreign Minister of Thailand discussed with me at length in Bangkok, problems arising from ships originating in the southern part of Thailand, in Songkhla and proceeding across the Pacific to the shores of Canada. We discussed these matters. He suggested that I should come back to Sri Lanka and summon the representatives of the countries in question. I summoned the representatives of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Canada and Australia and we had a very fruitful discussion, which led to some tangible consequences. So, in all these areas, we have achieved a lot. I must also mention that we have done everything that we can and we have achieved considerable success in preventing collaboration among terrorist groups. The House is aware that terrorist groups do not act in isolation; they act in concert, but we saw to it that problems of that kind with Al-Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Taliba and so on did not arise. So, these are matters that the United Nation system should be made aware of.

Then, as far as developments within Sri Lanka are concerned, I will inform the Secretary- General in considerable detail what we have accomplished up to now within the remarkably brief span of less than two years. Mr. Speaker, it is a very touching human story. Look at these children wielding arms, child soldiers. Today, we have rehabilitated them. They have been exposed to programmes of vocational education. One hundred and forty of them have been successful at the G.C.E. (Advanced Level) Examination. As a former Vice-Chancellor of one of the largest universities in Sri Lanka, I am proud that two of them are today receiving education in the medical faculties of universities within our country's tertiary education system.

We have revived the economy of the North. Sir, one single bank has lent as a large sum as Rs. 13,000 billion for entrepreneurial activity in the Northern Province. This means, generation of employment and the resuscitation of the economy. All of this has happened within so short a period. Almost 500 Tamil-speaking Police officers have already been recruited in the Northern Province and it is the intention of the Secretary of Defence to continue this with accelerated vigour in the weeks and months to come. As far as Internally Displaced Persons are concerned, we started with the figure of 297,000 and it is now down to

less than 10,000 and even that number keep going to their homes, coming back and they are not permanently resident in the camps. There were 11,500 ex-combatants initially and as I said, we have rehabilitated them all, but the hard-core against whom judicially receivable evidence is available.

Mr. Speaker, the high security zones are shrinking. Victoria Road in Jaffna has been opened. The Government will relax some of the Emergency Regulations now in operation, not in response to external pressure, but in a spirit of spontaneity because the national interest requires this. As the need for these regulations becomes less and less, we will scale them down, not to abolish them overnight - that is not a practical policy - but we will rule them back progressively.

Then, we have also taken away restrictions on fishing. That was a regrettable necessity at that time to protect Sri Lankas shores and in particular, our naval personnel. But, fishing is now revived as a means of livelihood in the North and we are receiving requests from companies in Thailand, Japan and Malaysia to come here for fish processing - filleting. That has become a major source of interest for that region.

We are engaged in a political dialogue with political parties representing the minority communities. We have had five rounds of talks so far. The next round will be held on the 12th of May 2011. Mr. Speaker, we are now moving into the substantive stage. We have discussed conceptual issues. We have discussed our broad approach and now we are getting down to the nitty-gritty. So, we expect that tangible results will emerge from that process and it is being handled in a very methodical and systematic way.

So, these are the matters that I will bring to the notice of the Secretary-General as to what has been achieved so far. What about the way forward? We will also have to tell the Secretary-General what we plan to do in the near future. I will tell the Secretary-General that we have to await the final report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. When I was in London last month, I had discussions with the British Government. I told them, But, surely you cannot prejudge the Commissions Report. You must await its outcome; you must await the report and study it objectively and dispassionately. I was told that there can be no conceivable argument about that. That is obvious. How can you comment on a report before the report has seen the light of day? You must wait for the report, study it, give your mind to it and do so honestly and in a spirit of sincerity. How can you argue about that? But, here we have, Mr. Speaker, the bizarre situation of this Commission being rubbished in the most preposterous way before it has submitted its report. The United Nations system is founded upon the premise that

41 42

countries must be encouraged to deal with their own problems in keeping with their cultural traditions and values. We have every confidence that the LLRC will make a contribution of lasting value in this regard and that expectation is amply justified by the work that they have done so far. They submitted their interim recommendations within two months and the Government, in a prompt response, appointed the Inter-Agency Advisory Committee headed by the Attorney-General and consisting of the Secretaries of seven Ministries centrally involved in the implementation process. So, I will tell the Secretary-General that the LLRC is continuing its work and its report is expected shortly. We must await that report. How can you pre-empt it? How can you prejudge it? If at all, there must be a benevolent presumption. Hillary Clinton, the Secretary of State of the United States had a meeting with me in May, last year. Actually, not as a meeting with me but when both of us addressed the media together she said, - these are her words, not my words - The Sri Lankan Commission holds promise. This was said by the Secretary of State of the United States. It holds promise. Then, how can the LLRC be dismissed in this cavalier fashion? We think that that is only indefensible.

Then, Mr. Speaker, I must say a word about some of the criticisms that have been made. We have been told that there has been some form of recognition of the Panel. That is certainly not correct. When the Attorney-General and the then Secretary to the Ministry of External Affairs went to New York, they went for a specific and limited purpose. There was no meeting separately with the Panel. They went and met the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon. That is the usual procedure to discuss matters of detail. They followed up with a meeting with his Deputy, the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Lynn Pascoe. It was at that meeting with Mr. Lynn Pascoe in his office that the three members of the Panel joined. The purpose of that discussion was to make the UN system aware of the work that was being done by the LLRC. They had to know. It was in our interest to let them know. Had we not done so, the criticism would have been, How do you expect them to know if you do not tell them? And, then they would have had every justification for not referring to it, for not recognizing it because they have not been informed of the work of the LLRC. So, they had to be informed. Had we not informed, the people who are criticizing us now will make the more cogent criticism, Why did you not tell them? If only you had told them, they would have taken this into account. So, you are remiss, you are at fault, in not bringing this to their notice. There is no question of implied recognition. In the Report itself, the Panel says that they would have liked to come to Sri Lanka. They say that it is not essential for their work but it would have been helpful. They would have liked to come but they were not able to

come because the Government of Sri Lanka did not permit them to come under those circumstances. So, they themselves admit that Sri Lanka did not recognize the Panel. We never did so at any time. The Government of Sri Lanka is engaging in a very vigorous campaign abroad to present our point of view, to raise our voice, before the international community.

I will be travelling to India on the 16th of this month for meetings with representatives of the Government of India. A few days later, on the 24th of this month, I will travel to Beijing for similar meetings. In India, I will meet my counterpart, the Hon. Shri S.M. Krishna and in Beijing I will meet the Foreign Minister of the Peoples Republic of China. On the 26th and the 27th, together with several of my Ministerial Colleagues, I will be travelling to Barley, Indonesia for the Meeting of Non-Aligned countries. That will be a very useful opportunity for us to interact with the Foreign Ministers of these countries, most of whom would be gathered there. Last week, I visited the Sultanate of Oman for discussions with the Foreign Minister of that country. I found a very favourable response. The Sultanate of Oman is a Member of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the views that we expressed will be made known to the Gulf Cooperation Council. So, we have here a very energetic campaign to bring Sri Lankas point of view with regard to this matter to the attention of the world.

In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell the House that this is one of the matters that need to be dealt with in an atmosphere as far removed from partisan political controversy as possible. Of course, we can disagree about matters within the country, the thrust and parry of party politics is an essential feature of the representative democratic system. But, every now and then, one comes across matters which would have to be dealt with from a different perspective and at a different level. Here, we have issues which go to the very heart of national well-being. It is not a question of the interest of one political party pitted against another political party, and we, for our part as a Government, Mr. Speaker, have every confidence that the rich traditions of this country, the whole reservoir of experience that we have accumulated over the decades put us in a very strong position to deal with this challenge with courage and fortitude and I have not the slightest shadow of doubt that Members of this august Assembly, irrespective of political affiliation, will join hands with us in dealing with this situation in the interest of Sri Lanka as a whole.

I thank you, Mr. Speaker. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

: "" . : " " . PRIVILEGE : REFERENCE TO HON. MAVAI S. SENATHIRAJAH AND HON. SURESH PREMACHANDRAN BY MAJOR GENERAL MAHINDA HATHURUSINGHE AT AN INTERVIEW WITH "TAMILMIRROR" WEB EDITION ( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Hon. Speaker, it may be pertinent for me to raise this question of Privilege after the Hon. Minister of External Affairs and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition made two important Statements in this Assembly. This Privilege Motion may show the reality in this country.

Sir, in a recent interview given to the TamilMirror web edition, Major General Mahinda Hathurusinghe, the Security Forces Commander of Jaffna, has named the Hon. Mavai Senathirajah and myself as persons who are working towards creating another war and has cited our statements calling to reduce the presence of the army in Jaffna. These statements have all been made in the course of the debates in Parliament and as such, are covered by Privilege of Members of Parliament. Major General Hathurusinghes statement in this regard seriously undermines and challenges the Parliamentary Privilege of Members to be able to speak freely without any fear or favour.

That statement of Major General Hathurusinghe has also to be viewed in the light of the subsequent event at which my Secretary, Mr. Annalingam Uthayakumar, was attacked at Atchuveli in Jaffna on 27th April, 2011. Prior to the assault, on 24th April, 2011, some Sri Lanka Army personnel in uniform went to my house at Kattapirai, Kopay South, Kopay and inquired from the police personnel guarding my house as to my whereabouts and also asked whether I usually come to Jaffna along with the MSD personnel. The next day, that is, on 25th April, 2011, again some army personnel in uniform went to my office at Point Pedro Road, Jaffna and made similar inquiries about me and also wanted the details of the persons who occupy the office.

2011 03

Thereafter, on 27th April, 2011 at about 4.00 p.m., when my secretary was travelling on his motorbike with a pillion rider, as he got on to the main Atchuveli Road, four men on two motorbikes stopped him. He saw one of them reaching for a pistol and being frightened that he was going to be shot at, he got off his motorbike and ran. Two of the assailants chased him and beat him with large iron clubs. My secretary had then got on to the middle of the road and stopped a Sri Lanka Central Transport Board bus and other traffic, but he was continuously assaulted severely. They then got on to their motorbikes and left. My secretary was taken to the Atchuveli Hospital immediately and then transferred to the Teaching Hospital, Jaffna, where he is receiving treatment now.

This incident had happened after I raised a matter in Parliament on the 7th of April, 2011 at the Debate on the extension of the state of Emergency. The matter I raised was in relation to the said interview given by Major General Hathurusinghe.

I trust you would appreciate that that trend poses a grave threat to myself as a Member of Parliament who exercises my right of expression and take immediate and appropriate steps, including action against Major General Hathurusinghe for breaching the Privilege of a Member of Parliament in the performance of his duties. Sir, please give this the required notice under the Standing Orders. Thank you, Sir.

( - , ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, at this crucial time of economic development in Sri Lanka, our Government will continue to take every progressive measure to facilitate investment, manufacture and exports. Despite effects of the global recession, Sri Lanka has shown great resilience by continuing to enhance the value of its exports.

According to the latest statistics, Sri Lankas export earnings showed the highest ever annual value of US Dollars 8.3 billion in 2010 with an increase of 17.3 per cent, while the export earnings in December 2010 alone recorded the highest ever monthly value of US Dollars 968 million. Export earnings in January 2010 continued to increase sharply from US Dollars 471.7 million to US Dollars 813.4 million a year ago with an increase of 72.4 per cent. Similarly in February too, exports rose by 36.8 per cent which amounted to US Dollars 860.3 million. This trend establishes a salient fact. It shows that we are on the right track to achieve our 2015 export target of US Dollars 15 billion and even beyond. Sir, this is not an easy task. There will be numerous challenges beyond our control as we embark on this journey. These challenges are both from the domestic and external environments. What is important to note is that our Government, under the able leadership of His Excellency the President, continues to open new avenues in drawing foreign investment for manufacture, services and overall export sectors of our growing economy.

As part of Sri Lankas broader strategy on export development, diversifying of our current export basket further, encouraging value addition, finding new international markets, developing our market access

capabilities, strengthening supply chains involved and enhancing Sri Lankas competitive edge in the international marketplace are of great importance. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in consultation with all relevant stakeholders, has developed a sound strategic plan for export and industrial development with particular emphasis to small and medium enterprises to strengthen Sri Lankas competitiveness.

Sir, in this context, I am happy to inform this august gathering that the Sri Lanka Export Development Board will be launching a most anticipated event by all our exporters, Sri Lanka Expo 2012, to be held in March 2012. This milestone exhibition will showcase Sri Lankas new export capabilities to international buyers. This event is part of our firm belief that an approach of sustained diversification of export products and markets will ensure new international opportunities to Sri Lanka thereby further enhancing our strength to achieve overall economic and social prosperity that will be shared by all Sri Lankans when Sri Lanka achieves the status of "Wonder of Asia" as envisaged by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Sir, the 2012 event will be a very innovative occasion targeting international buyers. It will attract a considerable number of new and potential buyers from around the world, especially emerging markets. At the same time, our Ministry has hosted a number of foreign business delegations, all of which showed unprecedented enthusiasm in partnering with Sri Lanka. Further, visiting ministerial-level delegations to Sri Lanka too have continuously endorsed Sri Lankas current economic potential confirming that we are on track to achieve our envisaged economic targets. I am happy to state that the industrial sector also reported a healthy 8.4 per cent industrial productivity growth in 2010. Improved performance food and beverages, rubber-based products, textiles and garments coupled with increased performance in the construction sector industries led to this growth. The high growth in food, beverages and tobacco products too was a key contributor.

We have established the North Regional Industry Service Centre in Vavuniya to facilitate the needs of the Industrialists in the Northern Province. We have initiated a plan to establish industrial zones in Vavuniya, Mannar, Batticaloa and Stage 2 of Trincomalee, and initial work has been completed.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, let me now turn to the subject of introducing a new payment method under the Import and Export (Control) Act. Apart from the usual payment methods of letters of credit, payment in advance, Documents against Payment - DP-, Document on Acceptance - DA -, this new payment method under open account will specially facilitate the category called "export-oriented companies" and even the cash flow in the countrys current account as well.

The proposed amendment introducing open account payment method therefore will ease financial burden specially on large-scale manufacturers who depend on

85 86

imported inputs for their production. They are now able to import their required inputs other than motor vehicles on a credit line that extends to as far as 180 days.

Since there is no upper limit defined on the value of a particular import shipment, I have no doubt that this would be a welcoming development to the manufacturers and they will import inputs of a larger value from now on. The introduction of this new facility clearly demonstrates our Governments continued commitment to address the needs and concerns of our importers, manufacturers and exporters thereby enabling them to be a driving force in the next phase of our economic growth.

Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. S. Shritharan. Before he speaks, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. R. Yogarajan to take the Chair?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Presiding Member, I was expecting the Hon. Minister for National Languages and Social Integration to be present in the House so that I can raise an issue about the Bill that we are discussing today. The Bill is titled

()" in Sinhala. The same Bill, in English and Tamil, should read Regional Development Bank (Amendment) and

()" . But, those two Bills are titled Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bank (Amendment) in English and () in Tamil. This mistake has not been done here; it has been done sometime ago when they first passed the Act of regional development banks. This, I feel, is infringing on the privileges of the Tamil population as well as that of the Tamil Members of Parliament. We see this type of thing happening in the country all the time. Many of the banks and other commercial institutions create certain brands for their products and they advertise mainly creating those names in the Sinhala language, using them in Tamil and English in the same way.

But, however, in Parliament, we have always followed a tradition where the name of each Bill and every Resolution is translated into the language concerned.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, to be very fair by the Hon. Minister, I think you are aware, he is taking a keen interest and is very particular about translations, particularly Sinhala into Tamil.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Being keen or being sincere is not the issue, Hon. Presiding Member.

( ) (The Presiding Member) I understand. I just expressed a word on behalf of him.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) What I am raising is, it is an issue that has to be looked into. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Exactly. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) A person who does not know Sinhala, reading the words "Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bank (Amendment)" would not understand anything.

( ) (The Presiding Member) I agree with you. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) So, this is an infringement of our rights. These are the small things that go to create all the problems in this country. That is why I raised this issue, not because of anything else. We call Sri Lanka in Tamil and we say Sri Lanka in English. That is the proper name and it has to be propagated to the world as "Sri Lanka". That is different. But, here you are describing a bank as a regional development bank and that should be reflected in the name of the Bill we are presenting to Parliament.

Coming on to a more substantial issue, the regional development banks were created for a particular purpose. In this country, we have several types of banks: we have commercial banks; we have special banks like the regional development banks; we have housing banks, but we still do not have an import-export bank like many developing countries do.

Each of these banks has a duty to the people. The Government has certain motives for creating these different types of banks. The Housing Development and Finance Corporation was converted into a commercial

101 102

bank. But, it is a specialized bank. The duty of the HDFC is to fund housing. Similarly, we have the National Savings Bank. That is to develop savings in the country.

In the same way, regional development banks were created for the purpose of regional development, where the bank operating its headquarters in the particular region would be aware of the needs of that region. Each region has a special need. If you take the Kandurata Development Bank, that has a special need. That understands that cultivation is an important aspect of the economy of the up-country. So, they are supposed to finance that type of operation. Similarly, in the North and the East, trading is a very important aspect. Agriculture also plays a big role there and in the North-Central Province, cattle farming and milk production are important aspects. So, the regional development banks were created with special emphasis on the needs of those regions.

This Government has now merged all the regional development banks into one national bank. But still, we have to look at the culture of those regional development banks. However, all decisions are again going to be centralized. There have always been complaints from the regions that they have to look up to Colombo for most of the development needs in the regions. The regional development banks played a role to support the regional economies of the country and today, we are amending the original Act to say that the headquarters of the Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bank can be in the District of Colombo or in any part of the country. So, this again is centralization of banking that was meant to be regional, which is not a very positive thing.

Further, generally speaking of the banking system in this country today, until recently, the banks were charging an exorbitant interest rate of 3.25 per cent per month on credit cards. I must commend the Government for reducing that interest rate, by compulsion, to 2 per cent on credit cards. However, His Excellency the President summoned all the banks in the country one day and told them that the interest rates had to be reduced to 14 per cent. The banks agreed to it because it was a directive from His Excellency the President. They quickly went back and reduced the interest rates they paid to their depositors. Maybe they reduced the interest rate on lending to a few prime customers, but within months, that interest rate has gone up again. Today, again commercial banks are lending money for trade and industry at a rate between 18 and 22 per cent. But, they have not changed the interest rate on deposits. These deposits are made mostly by pensioners or retirees, who deposit their lifelong savings and live on the interest they get from that. Those banks have made the life of those retirees unbearable because of the low interest they earn from the deposits they keep in the banks. However, the banks have now increased lending rates and with the gap between the

interest rates on deposits and lending exceeding 10 per cent, the banks are declaring profits worth Rs. 5 billion to Rs. 6 billion each year.

Why is the Government allowing this exploitation? Is it because, as the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne pointed out, the Government is now investing heavily in the private commercial banks, that they are allowing this to happen? The Government has to be fair, not only to the borrower but also to the depositor. Today, when the banks are charging between 18 to 22 per cent from their borrowers, they have a duty to pay higher interest rates to their depositors who live on the income from these deposits. The better way to do would be for the Government to state or direct that the difference between the average deposit rate and the average lending rate should be a specific amount; maybe 5 per cent. I have spoken in this House once before and said that the difference in the deposit rate and the lending rate is to service the customers of the bank. Through the difference in the interest rates, the bank is to generate income for providing services through the banks.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The Hon. Joseph Michael Perera is not coming. So, there is 10 minutes left.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Do you take the responsibility? Otherwise, he will come and -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Give me only two more minutes, please. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Okay. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The interest rates should be regulated so that only the difference that is required is fixed and the banks are supervised in such a manner that they do not charge exorbitant rates from their borrowers or pay low interest to their depositors.

Now, I wish to dwell on the issue of the 2 per cent cess to be charged from telecommunication operators or telephone companies.

2011 03

The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara speaking in this House said that the TRCSL will regulate the rates and there would not be an issue of this 2 per cent being passed on to the customers. However, any revenue to the company has to come from the customers who use their services. Hence, if the operation of the telephone companies become difficult, they would have to pass on the extra 2 per cent to the consumers though it may not be stated in the Bill that they provide the customer as the cess to be paid on the turnover. But, it would anyway have to come from the customers. I wish to point out especially because the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara said that the regulator will not allow the rates to be increased. Unfortunately, in this country today, the regulator is not regulating the highest amount that the telephone company can charge but they have put a ceiling or a lower minimum price that the regulator should charge from customers at Rs. 1.00 per minute on any telephone call. As we all know, there has been cut-throat competition between the telecommunication operators and there was a feeling that they would reduce their rates so much that none of them will be viable in the future. So, the regulator has said, not that the telecommunication companies cannot increase their tariff, but that they cannot reduce their tariff below Rs. 1.00 per minute. Hence, the question of the regulator insisting that the telephone company has not raised the rates, does not arise in this situation today.

Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . . [. . 5.57]
