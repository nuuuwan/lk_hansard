22 . 25 ? position . Former Deputy Minister of Finance, you know that each country likes to position itself. Today, Myanmar is trying to get into the world because they know that there is a low-cost production area in Asia. So, Myanmar is trying to fill that bill. Aung San Suu Kyi, their Leader of the Opposition, has been released. They are bringing their legal standing up to the international level; they are bringing in British Laws; they are bringing in media freedom. So, they are trying to position themselves as a low-cost production base. That is the most important thing.

Look at India. They are trying to reposition themselves by depreciating their rupee, taking advantage of the regional competition. For having reduced the value of their rupee by 16.2 per cent by October - today, the depreciation has reached up to 22 per cent - being the worst currency in Asia and being the third worst currency in the world, is India stupid? Are they not having a foresight about the future or an insight into what is happening? They are repositioning themselves. Then, look at China. Today, they trying to ensure there is depreciation of the yuan because they know that before too long there will be countervailing duties on them.

Look at Europe. Today, they are having splits over their thinking of the Eurobonds. So, as a result, they are repositioning themselves. Instead of having a strong euro, they want to have a flexible, competitive euro.

Look at the 2G scam in India today. The Indian Government is not protecting Dayanidhi Maran, who has been caught for engaging in corruption; they are exposing it. They are not allowing corruption to halt the development. judge . . , . 40 , . .

we have to reposition ourselves. . . . Then, we have to be transparent; the Judiciary must be independent; media must have freedom; corruption must be eliminated; accountability must be brought about, stemming it from Parliament and also we have to ensure that democracy thrives. , . , . .

You have brought the expropriation Bill before Parliament. You must have a sense of responsibility as to these types of things that are dampening the spirit of investors. You must ensure the media freedom. You must ensure that the judiciary is free. You cannot expect investors to come into this country if you have problems of this nature. So, basically all what I want to do is, ensure -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, this morning the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake produced a letter purported to have written by the Hon. Prasanna Ranathunga to His Excellency the President imputing improper motives which is against the Standing Order No. 84 (viii). He said very clearly to the House that he is tabling this letter. But, he has not tabled this letter which means he is perpetrating a deception in the House. I want you to confiscate this letter and send it to the CID to find out the veracity of it, Sir. Otherwise, we will not be doing justice by the Hon. Chief Minister. And, how did he take this letter from the Presidential Secretariat must also be investigated into. Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) I am explaining the matter, Sir.

( ) (The Chairman) Yes, as your name was referred to in this House, you can given an explanation.

( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) Hon. Chairman, there was no malaise in it; there was no effort to tarnish anybody's name. We put the facts before the House for three reasons. One is match fixing. There was an inquiry, which we have confirmed. The second was, there was a fund-raising exercise for a hostel for cricketers, which was another reason why we have brought it up in this House. The third was, playing World XI matches by the Hon. Member who is present here. This was discussed and the House was presented with true facts. If you are not permitting me to give my side of the story, I will take up another opportunity to raise it somewhere else but the facts remain true. We have never said anything with malaise. We have given the facts and facts are stubborn. If the Hon. Member wants to clarify his position, show his honesty or integrity, there is a forum: he can go before the Hon. Minister of Sports, place his cards, present his case and clear his name. He is using this

[1.18 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Mr. Presiding Member, I am glad that I am able to make some reflections on the Budget for 2012, when the Votes on the Ministry of Finance and Planning is being taken up. The Hon. Amunugama, a little while ago, said that the Opposition did not present a big picture about the Budget and I am going to respond to that criticism.

We know that this Budget has largely been focused, like the past two Budgets, on infrastructure. This Budget is taking the country away from being a social welfare State. An Hon. Minister also alluded to the fact that taxes have increased but that they are indirect taxes rather than direct taxes. That is true, which means that the ordinary people of this country are having a higher tax burden than those who could actually pay a lot more as taxes.

I also endorse and agree with the view the Hon. DEW Gunasekara, Chairman of the COPE expressed today, particularly that there is a breakdown in Government institutions and the reason for that is the inability to hold professionals and managerial class in government institutions due to lack of adequate pay. This Government is embarked on an economic policy, which is a State capitalist economic policy. It is such an economic system which requires a State managerial class too and it is very evident from the investigations of the COPE, that unless we are able actually to retain the brainpower within the system, sooner or later these institutions which are breaking down will break down at a much bigger rate.

If we were to analyse the economy over the period of time from 2005 to 2010, we could say that there has not been a huge structural shift in the economy. This is a high-consumption economy; nearly 80 per cent of our GDP is for consumption. It has hardly changed from 2005 to 2010. We also see that there is a slight change in investment, from 26 to 27 per cent of GDP; virtually, there is no change. If you look at the savings rate, it has changed from about 17.9 to 18.7 per cent of GDP in those five years which again is a very, very slight change. If we look at the exports in the country as a percentage of GDP, it is alarming that from 32.3 per cent of GDP five years ago, today it is only 16.7 per cent. So, it has really worsened and rings an alarm bell. That is why there was a necessity for an adjustment in the exchange rate which this Government did and I will come back to that later.

If we look at this economy, the trend in investment is about 27 to 28 per cent. Therefore, we have had 8 per cent growth in the last year, virtually without additional investment. That is because we have an economy which is coming out of a war. There has been a slack in the economy and that slack has picked up. For example, if you take the hotel industry, they had 30 to 40 per cent occupancy and now they have 80, 90, 100 per cent occupancy, which is a good sign where we have been able to get an 8 per cent growth without much additional investment. If we are to sustain the investment at 8 to 10 per cent, we will have to get now an additional investment.

Today, the Hon. Members of the Government side talked of the economy in a very complacent way, but I want to tell this august Assembly that there are signs of storms on the horizon and you need to wake up out of your complacency by looking at the facts. It is also necessary to point out that the Managing Director of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, who was in Lagos just two days ago, had urged the developing countries to shore up their defences, especially their foreign exchange reserves, and not to be complacent about it. She warned that at least six countries in the Eurozone will probably be downgraded in the next few weeks. She said that banking contagion in the financial sector can come very quickly to the developing countries. There will be a fall in trade with a drop in commodity prices in 2012 and going beyond that, there could be a fall in Foreign Direct Investment which a country will so badly need if it is to sustain a GDP growth rate of more than 8 per cent. Sir, this is what the IMF Chief had to say about it. We need to see that the investment rate moves from 26 or 27 per cent to 33 or 34 per cent of GDP. That requires US Dollars 3 to 4 billion annually being invested in the Sri Lankan economy or you have to have productivity increases in this economy.

The ratio of incremental capital output to US Dollar is 4:1. So, it is not a very efficient economy. In other words, you have to invest four US Dollars to get an output of one US Dollar. So, you need a huge investment. The Government policy of public expenditure is capped at 6 to

7 per cent of GDP because of borrowing requirements and fiscal management. So, what actually is the way forward? The way forward is that the Government must get out of borrowing and spending. The Government must get out of dissaving in the economy. The Government is relying heavily on foreign remittances to come in.

It is almost a matter of pride that women in our country go overseas as housemaids and send increasing amounts of dollars into the country. While we salute those who work overseas, we do not want them to be exploited for US Dollars 150 or 200, and women work in very harsh conditions also. We do not think that as an appropriate Government policy.

We need to see our exports increase and we need to see structural reforms in the economy which will increase productivity. We need to see higher Foreign Direct Investment and private investment in the economy. It is only by that method that we can actually sustain the economic growth. We know that the Government continues to spend on infrastructure but it is not spending on the social sector. Education and health sectors are the biggest victims of what has happened. Since I have dealt with that in an earlier speech, I will not go into that in detail just now.

We pride ourselves that the Government debt is only 75 per cent of GDP. You say that it has come down from 100 per cent. But, actually there is a debt burden which the country does not recognize. We have a growing pension liability. We have an ageing population and we are not recognizing that debt liability. We have 485,000 pensioners in this country. We pay out Rs. 99 billion for pensions annually and a few thousand rupees per pensioner each year. But, the real rate is about Rs. 9,500 on an average. The nominal rate may be higher. That is about Rs. 16,000 or Rs. 17,000. But, if we were to deflate those future pension payments and look at maintaining at least the real increase in the GDP for pensions - because they are the people who have served the country for long and need to be taken care of in the evening of their lives - we see that this is not being computed. A pension could be either funded or it could be unfunded like the pay-as-you-go system. We know that the farmers' pension scheme was launched some years ago and through the Farmers' Pension Act, No. 12 of 1987 the Treasury gave some money out in June 2011. It previously also gave some money out. However, the Treasury had to suspend the payment with effect from October or November. There were more than nine hundred thousand farmers on this scheme. Hundred thousand farmers were receiving their pensions. Today, that pension scheme has been put on hold. That makes us suspicious that the payment of pensions that public servants get and the private sector people are expecting to get may not actually materialize because the Government has not recognized that liability.

3150 3151

There are people who have entered the working system at the age of 25. They have 30 years of work-life and they might live till they are 75 or 80 years old. So, they have another 20 or 30 years of post-retirement period. We know that the pension payments are about 1.8 per cent of GDP and if you multiply 1.8 per cent by 50 years, the debt liability or the liability on the pensions is going to be about another 75 to 85 per cent of GDP. That is the magnitude of the problem. That almost doubles the Sri Lankas debt to GDP ratio from 75 per cent to 150 per cent. Some people say that some countries recognize it and others do not, but, I do not care which country recognizes it and which country does not. Even the IMF needs to recognize it, because, it is a future liability that we have. Therefore, we must see that we have a proper estimation of our liabilities. This is like a ticking time bomb and therefore, we need to take note of this ticking time bomb.

I would also, Hon. Presiding Member, like to make some comments on the recent devaluation of the rupee. The Minister of Finance came into this House and made an announcement about devaluing the rupee by 3 per cent. Sri Lanka had a fixed exchange rate regime in 1948 and we know that Section 73 (1) of the Monetary Law Act provides that it is for the Governor to determine and certify the parities of the Sri Lankan Rupee with foreign currencies. It further provides that the parities so decided will be published in the gazette. So, if we have a fixed exchange rate, then, the Monetary Law Act specifically says that the new parities have to be mentioned by gazette. But, what did we find? Although this is the domain of the Governor of the Central Bank, the Finance Minister comes to the House, gets up and says, I am devaluing the rupee. I really want to know whether we have a fixed exchange rate system or a floating exchange rate system or what kind of an exchange rate system do we actually have? Section 73 (2) of the Monetary Law Act provides for instance in which the Governor may desist from determining and certifying the parities of foreign currencies. This is only when the Governor is of the opinion that it is inexpedient to determine and certify the parities with respect to the Sri Lankan Rupee of foreign currencies in accordance with Section 73 (1).

Sir, we have a choice. Do we have a market-driven exchange rate or do we have a fixed exchange rate? If it is a market-driven exchange rate, I repeat that it needs to be gazetted. If it is a market-driven exchange rate - as the Central Bank often wants to claim- then, why did the Finance Minister has to make an announcement in the House about devaluation? We want to know this. Before devaluation, we frittered away about US Dollars one billion that was defending the Sri Lankan currency and after making a new announcement in this Budget, we are now beginning to fritter away hundreds of millions of US Dollars that is defending the new exchange rate. This is a

frittering away of reserves of the country. Many speakers from the Government Benches today were complacent about the reserves of the country. They were giving various numbers - seven billion, eight billion, nine billion and different numbers. But, what we must not forget is that most of those reserves are borrowed reserves and do not reflect the real economy of the country. Therefore, we need to have a flexible exchange rate to make our exports more competitive. I mentioned it a little earlier and some Hon. Members who walked in later may have missed this, that the exports as a percentage of GDP from 2005 to 2010 is almost half - it was 32 per cent plus and 16 per cent today. We also do not agree with the way this is being done - moving from one artificial exchange rate to another artificial exchange rate. Why is this so important? In 1997, when there was the Asian crisis, economies of East Asia were growing like our economy but they were heavily borrowing in foreign exchange. They had their currencies pegged to the US Dollar like we are trying to manage our currency. They tried to liberalize their capital accounts at the same time like we are trying to do it. We see a recession building up in our major markets in the US and in Europe and we see a particular scenario developing, which could develop into a crisis as the world economy and our trading partners go into crisis. I am rally calling for the Parliament to look into the management of this exchange rate policy of the Government because the Central Bank is mismanaging the policy. The exchange policy is being mismanaged by the Central Bank.

Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to speak about another area, which has been of considerable concern to the public of this country and that is to do with the EPF - the Employees Provident Fund. The EPF is organized through a dual control system. The administrative aspects are with the Commissioner of Labour while the management of the fund is vested in the Central Bank and in the Monetary Board of the Central Bank. When you visit the EPF website, it says that it is there to provide peace of mind to those who are investing in the EPF. I do not know about peace of mind, I know that their minds are in pieces because of what the Government is actually doing. Millions in the workforce are depending on their EPF to live the rest of their lives in retirement. What is the role of the Central Bank? It is to use the EPF monies and to invest it safely, reliably and to get the maximum return possible for its members. Therefore in order to ensure that they fulfil their duties of making safe investments, an Investment Committee has been established. This Committee consists of the Deputy Governor in charge of the EPF as the Chairman, the Assistant Governor in charge of EPF, the Superintendent of EPF, the Additional Superintendent of EPF and the Deputy Superintendent overlooking the Accounts and Fund Management Division of the EPF Department. The Committee has an investment policy statement and an investment securities guideline for EPF and they meet on a regular basis. If I might digress for a moment, I would

3152 3153

like to congratulate the new Assistant Governors of the Central Bank, after reading in the newspaper today of their new appointments. But, going back to the management of the EPF, they are supposed to meet regularly and analyse the EPF. But, Hon. Presiding Member, the point I want to make is this: the EPF is about a trillion rupees now. We know that in 2009, only about 1.5 per cent or something like that was invested in the stock market. In the following year, - 2010 - nearly 5 per cent was invested in the stock market. Hon. Members have countered by saying that it is a small amount of money. The fact is not that it is small or big, it is more than Rs. 43 billion in the year 2010. But, I am concerned about the return because it is the money of the working classes of this country. It is the ordinary man who sweats it. It is his money that has been put. If you look at the return on that portion, it is - ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I have more time than that. ( ) (The Presiding Member) The other Members have taken from your time. The Chief Whip has agreed -

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) But, officially I have 25 minutes, Sir.

( ) (The Presiding Member) But, that has been taken on the instruction of your - ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) We extended Parliament by half an hour because we have already -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Okay, you carry on, I do not want you to waste time.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I waited patiently from morning for that time and I want the full time, Hon. Presiding Member.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, the time is always monitored and governed by the Chief Whip. When he says, we have to give him time. The Chair is - ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I am only asking for the allotted time, Mr. Presiding Member. I have been allotted 25 minutes and I ask you to please permit me to speak for that 25 minutes. ( ) (The Presiding Member) No. It has been taken away on the instruction of the Chief Whip, I am telling you. I am reminding you. -[Interruption.] Hon. Member, you must also learn the Standing Orders. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I am just asking you only for my time, not for anything extra. Give me the 25 minutes that was allotted to me. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Please do not waste your time Hon. Member, you carry on.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Therefore, those who have invested in the stock market have got less than 4 per cent. If you look at Government Securities, there was a 14 or 15 per cent return. Look at the Employees Trust Fund, in 2009, they gave a 12 per cent return. In 2010, they gave a 26 per cent return. But, the EPF gave less than 4 per cent. It clearly requires an inquiry. Why has it failed in giving the real return? Why is the ETF better managed than the EPF? Some people try to hide behind the fact by saying that this is short-term and long-term. Whatever term it is, it cannot give such low returns. Therefore it needs to be investigated. We know that according to Article 148 of the Constitution, Parliament has complete authority over finances and Parliament has to debate finances. It also states in Article 151 that Parliaments approval is needed even in expenditure and that is why we are raising these issues.
