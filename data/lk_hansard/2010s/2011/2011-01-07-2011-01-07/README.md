: : CIVILIANS OF MANDAITHIVU : RESETTLEMENT

asked the Prime Minister, Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs :

(a) Is he aware that -

(i) Mandaithivu has been unofficially declared as a high-security zone by the Sri Lanka Navy;

(ii) the Navy is occupying all the houses belong to the civilians at Mandaithivu;

587 588

(iii) and hundred families are living in the small shift houses at Mandaithivu?

(b) Will he state as to when they are allowed to go and resettle in their own houses at Mandaithivu?

(c) If not, why? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Speaker, I answer this Question on behalf of the Prime Minister, Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs:

(a) (i) Mandaithivu has not been unofficially declared as a high-security zone by the Sri Lanka Navy under any circumstances. Civilians living in the Island have the freedom and opportunity to travel without road barriers and to engage in normal livelihood. Navy is vigilant over the movements which are done in the night.

(ii) Forty two (42) out of Seventy two (72) dilapidated houses in that Island are utilized by Sri Lanka Navy as well as private ownership has been confirmed for Eighteen (18) houses from those, and the Navy is using those houses according to their consent.

(iii) Due to the convenience in engaging in fishing activities, approximately a hundred families are living in small shift houses in this Island, similar to other islands. They are living in those only because of the convenience in engaging in fishing activities and not due to the utilization of their houses by Navy.

(b) Necessary steps have been taken to build Naval Brigade Headquarters close to the security zone B in Mandaithivu Island through the Divisional Secretary of Wailanee, and within two (2) months after officially assigning that land to the Navy, action will be taken by the Navy to release the existing premises of Naval Brigade Headquarters for the usage of the general public.

(c) Not applicable. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Speaker, I want to ask a Supplementary Question. I went there in January 2002 also, when I was a Member of Parliament and the same situation prevailed there. So, when do you think these houses can be given back to the people in Mandaithivu by the Navy?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I have given a clear reply. The Navy is working according to a clear schedule. Hon. Member, your

question is based on the assumption that Mandaithivu has been declared a high-security zone.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) That is the reason why they are not allowed to go there and resettle in their houses.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, that is incorrect. That is the assumption on which you are building your Supplementary Question.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Are you accepting the position that there is no declaration of a high-security zone?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yes. So, the few houses which have been taken for activities would be released as soon as the Navy starts building the Headquarters.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Minister, it is not a few houses. I went there and I saw that about a hundred houses are being occupied by the Navy.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, there are no 100 houses. I think there is an error in the calculation. All fisherfolk have temporary houses because it is seasonal.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Those are not temporary houses. I went and saw the place myself. The houses are being occupied by the Navy officers.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) That was in 2002. You went there in 2002. When did you visit last?

589 590

2011 07

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) I went there in 2002. But, I made inquiries from the Grama Niladari of the area last month.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Speaker, I visited Mandaithivu two months ago. If you want I will take you there.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Yes, I will come with you.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Okay. Then you can count the number and then you will accept that the number that you are referring to is wrong.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) I met the Grama Niladai of the area last month and he told me that 100 houses are being occupied by the Navy.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) This is how you mislead the country and mislead the media also.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) We never mislead. Please withdraw that word.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I am sorry. I do not agree with you. We have double checked on this. I take responsibility on behalf of the Minister. The facts are very clear, Hon. Speaker.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) But, I hope the houses are released to the people as early as possible.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yes, please join me to go and count the number of houses.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) You must withdraw the word, "mislead".

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, it is once again the same situation. Now, these are the national assets of the country. These assets have been given to providers without following tender procedures. If you run through the taxes paid by the companies, you will see that you have not collected more than Rs. 20 million. So, would you, instead of taxing the consumer, ensure that you tax the companies that make unconscionable profits and see that such monies are utilized for the benefit of the country, Sir?

. , . .

Hon. Speaker, now I have explained in Sinhala the basic background pertaining to the Amendments that we propose to move to the Offensive Weapons Bill, which makes it easier for those who have been charged under this particular Act to seek bail from the Provincial High Courts in their respective Provinces and address the issue of laws delays. Of course, the present applications that are pending before the Court of Appeal in Colombo after the enactment of this piece of legislation may have to be referred back to the High Courts of the Provinces and that, I am sure, could be administratively attended to by the Chief Justice and the President of the Court of Appeal. Be that as it may, while this particular piece of legislation is easing the inconvenience that many people have been subjected to, particularly those who have been charged under the Offensive Weapons Act, and who have been remanded, and have had to incur heavy expenses in coming to Colombo to seek legal assistance, we also propose to implement certain schemes which will enable speedy disposal of cases. As a matter of fact, in 1989 by the Amending Act, No. 16, the Judicature Act was given powers to create judicial positions, known as recorders and masters.

1989 16 . , . . . . , , .

613 614

2011 07

We are proposing to introduce this segment of judicial officers, who would function both in the Magistrate's Courts and the District Courts as recorders and masters who would be attending to all the pre-trial procedures. +

The calling cases as well as dealing with various other matters would be done by this new segment of judicial officers, whom we propose to engage shortly with the concurrence of the Judicial Service Commission. The earlier amendments sought these appointments to be made by Ministers. That would have been in conflict with the independence of the Judiciary. Therefore, it is now proposed that the Judicial Service Commission recruit these judicial officers and they be placed in a particular level of judicial officers' categories so that pre-trial issues could be disposed of very expeditiously. A few days ago, I had a lengthy discussion about this issue with a delegation of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka led by one of our former Attorneys-General, Mr. Shibly Aziz, Presidents Counsel. They too have indicated their support for the implementation of the new scheme.

I am also somewhat fortunate that as I took over this Ministry, by the Budget that was passed in December last year, a handsome sum has been allocated to deal with laws delays. A sum of about Rs. 450 million has been set aside to be spent over a period of three years to get rid of laws delays. So, we are in the process of identifying a variety of new schemes through which cases that are pending for a long time in our courts of law could be disposed of.

As I mentioned earlier, Sir, the setting up of the Civil Appellate High Courts in the provinces have, to a great extent, eased the burden in our superior court structure in disposing some of the pending cases. Administratively, the former Chief Justice has taken a decision to refer cases which had been pending up to the year 2000, back to the Provincial High Courts. Still, in the Court of Appeal, there appears to be a large backlog of almost 6,000 cases and it would be useful for us to, in discussion with the Chief Justice, refer back a further lot of cases, which may be still pending in the Court of Appeal so that we can ease its burden.

In time to come, it is also proposed, in discussion with the Opposition, to amend further provision even in the Constitution of our country so that we can increase the number of judges, if necessary, as we can see that this large backlog does not suffer due to shortage of judges. As a matter of fact, the establishment of new Provincial Civil Appellate High Courts by an Amendment to the Judicature Act that was passed a few years ago has certainly been of immense help. But, in the mean time, there are certain other anomalies that have cropped up because there is a "leave to appeal" provision that lies with the Supreme Court and there again, it is saddled with a large number of cases which are piling up as "leave to appeal" applications from the Provincial Civil

Appellate High Courts, and therefore, that matter too needs to engage our attention.

Also, Sir, we are engaged in setting up new courthouses. With the conflict coming to an end, with the war coming to an end, it has become convenient for us to establish - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You said new courthouses. Is it about courts martial or about genuine courts that you are talking of, because you and I were fighting - ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That is a matter which is pending - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We, you and I, were fighting on behalf of the judicial system. We appreciate that at least you have been appointed as Minister. Could you ensure that courts martial and such bodies are brought under the courts system rather than anything else? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That interpretation of - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am only assisting you because I know when you are on that side it is difficult to say certain things that you said when you were on this side. So, I am helping you. If you are - ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I have been good enough to allow you to go on interrupting me on this issue for so long. Let me tell you, this issue is a matter pending before court. Whether that issue has been concluded or not, that is, whether the courts martial are a part of the court structure, it would be a subject of litigation before the Supreme Court. Let us leave it as it is. But, as for the courthouses, they come within the ambit of my Ministry. So, as the courts martial are not within the ambit of my Ministry, I could only speak regarding courthouses and those matters are for - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, Sarath Fonseka, who is in jail, had gone through a court martial.

615 616

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Now, let me conclude my arguments on this matter. - [Interruption.] Mr. Speaker - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We are talking about Sarath Fonseka, not about you, Hon. Azwer. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

We are also in the process of setting up a few more High Courts and as a matter of fact, we propose to set up new High Courts in places like Tangalle, Kuliyapitiya - the Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam will be quite happy - Mannar, Mankulam as well as in Matale. In fact, we have had some difficulty in identifying the necessary premises to have these High Courts established. So, once we have those premises made available to us, we would be in a position to start work on those High Courts as well.

At present, there are 37 Criminal High Courts functioning in Sri Lanka. These Criminal High Courts would now have that segment of bail applications, which come under the Offensive Weapons Act, referred to them in order to resolve those issues. Therefore, this is an Amendment which seeks to make it easier for litigants to process bail applications coming under the Offensive Weapons Act in their respective provinces without having to travel all the way to Colombo and hire lawyers in Colombo.

Of course, as I have mentioned earlier, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka has also been very cooperative in trying to implement some of these things and, as a matter of fact, it has been the policy of our Ministry to re-demarcate the jurisdiction of courts in this country in a manner so as to enable a litigant to access the court of law within a 20-kilometre radius, as far as practicable. In keeping with that guideline, we have now set up almost 65 new courthouses. Among them, there are new Magistrate's Courts, new District Courts as well as Circuit Courts. Some Magistrate's Courts sit as Circuit Courts in several areas. As a matter of fact, I have assured the Hon. Pon. Selvarasa, who is here, that I would start a Circuit Magistrate's Court in Kaluwanchikudi. He came and saw me a few days ago and I have taken steps immediately to have a discussion with the Chief Justice and the Judicial Service Commission. The Chief Justice was good enough to send an officer from the Judicial Service Commission to Kaluwanchikudi. He went and inspected the courthouse presently occupied by the Special Task Force. The STF of the Police is occupying the earlier courthouse in Kaluwanchikudi. We have now informed the Ministry of Defence that we would like to have that building back. We have told the STF that they need not move out of the premises and they can occupy the surrounding buildings.

That would be to even provide sufficient security for us, if necessary. So, we only want that particular building, which has all the infrastructure necessary for a courthouse. This is a matter that the Hon. Selvarasa brought to my notice and I immediately acted on that and we are going to start that Circuit Court as soon as the Defence Ministry releases us that premises. Hopefully, that will be done very soon.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

Similarly, we are about to start a Circuit Magistrates Court in Eravur as well. There is an abandoned courthouse. We are trying to take over and repair it so that we can start the magistrates court proceedings as a Circuit Court in Eravur as well. That will serve the Police Stations of Ayithiyamalai, Eravur and Karadiyanaru. So, these three police stations can now go before the Eravur Circuit Magistrates Court, so that they do not have to travel all the way to Valaichenai or rather to Batticaloa to attend to their court work.

Similarly all over the Island, new courthouses are being set up and we must also concede that this has become possible because the country has been rid of terrorism. In the past, I for one, who had been an official negotiator with the LTTE know the difficulties that we faced as negotiators when the LTTE parallely started setting up their own courthouses. That created a serious difficulty and there was apprehension among the people. There had been various efforts that had been made to make the LTTE see the reality that this sort of parallel courthouses and police stations is a futile exercise. But, the LTTE unfortunately never saw the justification of the Governments arguments. As Government negotiators, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, myself and others who negotiated with the LTTE could bear witness to the amount of trouble we went through in order to convince them that they should not persist such an unnecessary intransigent attitude towards pursuing peace.

Therefore, we must be thankful to His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa for having brought this war to an end and having eradicated terrorism and it has been made possible for us now to set up courthouses in every nook and corner of this country. We have already sent to the Government Printer, the new set of regulations, which set out the jurisdictions of different courts in the country and that has been prepared in accordance with this particular guideline, that a litigant will not have to travel beyond 20 kilometres as far as practicable in accessing a courthouse. That new jurisdictional gazette notification setting out areas of jurisdiction for courts all over the Island has already been sent to the Government Printer. We also propose to print copies of that gazette and distribute them

617 618

2011 07

to the members of the legal fraternity, the lawyers, judges and various other interested individuals who may want to have a copy of the new areas of jurisdiction that has now been sent for gazetting.

Mr. Speaker, I do not want to take much of your time. This is one step that we have now taken. I would of course want to elaborate on the other schemes that we would like to introduce in order to get rid of laws delays. I had a lengthy chat with the officials of the Government Analyst's Department. The delay in the report of the Government Analyst is one reason for various cases to get dragged on, particularly under the Offensive Weapons Act. So, I have had an initial chat with the Government Analyst to see that these reports do not get inordinately delayed as that would result in these cases kept pending for a long time. Now, if you go to our courthouses - most of our practicing legislators are quite aware of this - there are two matters that very frequently crop up in our courthouses. That is, they will move for " ", then for "reports of the Government Analyst". So, for both these matters, they start moving for dates. This is a common occurrence in our Magistrates Courts these days, even on issues pertaining to getting the Attorney Generals advice on a variety of matters. In fact, we are also fortunate to have a President, who had himself been a practising lawyer in both the lower courts and the higher courts of this country. The other day, in a casual chat I mentioned to him of the desirability of recruiting Assistant Superintendents of Police who would have sufficient knowledge of the law, that is, lawyers to be recruited to the level of ASPs, so that they can take over prosecution in most of the areas. In our courthouses today, court sergeants in most areas are not sufficiently knowledgeable in the law and every other mundane matter is referred to the Attorney General for advice. If we have people with sufficient experience, lawyers who have had some particular period of experience before a court of law, they could easily prepare those plaints and charge sheets, which need not be referred to the Attorney General for advice for every occasion. This is another matter that has now engaged our attention, so that we will try and see whether we can strengthen the Police Department. As a matter of fact, the other day when I met the President casually when the IGP too was present, he immediately told the IGP, "Why do you not attend to the Hon. Minister's matter, so that we can recruit some experienced lawyers as Assistant Superintendents of Police, so that they can attend to some of this work and these type of delays that occur in the courtrooms could be minimized?" Therefore, I must say, we are fortunate to have a President who himself is a lawyer and who understands difficulties. It has become a priority of this Government to try and get rid of laws delays in our courthouses and we have already set in motion, certain programmes so that cases will not be pending too long before our courts of law. As a matter of fact - [Interruption.] Hon. Karunanayake, I can allow you to interrupt provided you do not make it - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, thank you very much for that point. [Interruption.] - But, again he was taken. Please look into as to how can you ensure that misuse does not take place, because as soon as they are caught, they go and introduce this particular thing. I know - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, you can interview the Attorney-General and his lawyers can meet the Attorney-General - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) They rejected this, Hon. Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) It is not for me to get people released from remand prison or from courts of law. It is up to the chief prosecuting officer of the Government, the Attorney-General who would be - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Why do you not make - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Then, you can make the necessary application before a court of law and convince the Judge that it is a frivolous application; surely the courts and the judges are quiet independent today. [Interruption.] But, the only thing is, we are now putting in place certain procedures so that we can make use of this handsome allocation that has been made available to our Ministry to be utilized in a manner, so that we could expeditiously dispose of cases which have been pending for a long time. As a matter of fact, as soon as the court vacation started, I got the Secretary, in consultation with the Judicial Service Commission, to inform all the Registrars in the courthouses in our country to send us data pertaining to pending cases so that we could analyse, age-wise, what is happening to each case. An age analysis of cases could be made and then we can find out as to how we could make an intervention to try and minimize the delays in disposing these cases and as a pilot experiment we have taken the Colombo District Courts. There are about eight District Courts in Colombo and when we analysed, there appeared to be more than 800 cases which have been pending for more than 10 years. So, those cases, we felt could be identified, and we could recruit even retired judges to sit over the weekends in the courthouses. The courthouses are free over the weekends. We can recruit those judges on a contract given under the Judicial Service Commission and ask

619 620

them to dispose of those cases. Those matters and suggestions have been made to the Chief Justice and in due course, these procedures will put into practice, so that we will try and expeditiously dispose of cases, which have been pending for a long time.

In order to ease the inconvenience that is caused to the litigants in many areas, we are now setting up courthouses in several places including the North and the East, particularly in the North. New courthouses are coming in a variety of areas and I would soon have the pleasure of going and opening those courthouses, hopefully along with the Chief Justice, so that we can get the writ of this Government to run in every nook and corner of this country with the war coming to an end. Thank you very much.

It is an absolutely concocted story. It has never happened. The President has not even given a phone call to the Chief Justice. He must withdraw that.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Deputy Speaker, most of the time what the Hon. Azwer says can be irrelevant. But, this time it is very relevant. - [Interruption.] No. This time it is very relevant. May I say this, Mr. Deputy Speaker? The Hon. Azwers point of Order is very relevant. The Hon. Member is going beyond the rules of Debate in this House. This issue of speculation about the particular spat between the Chief Justice and the President is totally a figment of the imagination because I have checked.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Mr. Deputy Speaker, they are disturbing me.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) No.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) This has to be expunged.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, I have given a ruling. Whatever that is contrary to the Standing Orders will be expunged; those will not be allowed. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Mr. Deputy Speaker, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem has forgotten the fact that the judicial power of the people shall be exercised by Parliament through courts. " ." There is a duty cast upon us to see whether the judicial system works effectively. It was all over the internet. Everything cannot be wrong. There are messages coming from abroad. The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva answered that in Parliament. My position is that the Hon. Chief Justices office must deny it. If they deny it, we will accept it.

Then, Sir, I wish to refer to the kangaroo court, the court martial. Who were the three judges who heard the case? They were three Major Generals whom Mr. Sarath Fonseka had punished when he was the Army Commander. Therefore, this kangaroo court has violated the first principle of natural justice, that is, the judges presiding must not have any animosity or anger towards the accused. Secondly -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Thank you. Give him more time.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Rauff Hakeem was not tough for a very long time. Hon. Hakeem, you fought for the Seventeenth Amendment; you fought for the rule of law. I want to ask you finally, what are you going to do about the situation in Jaffna today? There are hundreds of abductions, murders and killings. These are the problems that you have to face. You may say in this House that the situation in Sri Lanka is okay. But, what is important is not what we think about Sri Lanka, but what the international community thinks about Sri Lanka. The President wants to make Sri Lanka a hub for knowledge. Today, we have become a hub for human rights violations; we have become a hub for abductions and killings, but no inquiries

are taking place. Those are the matters which you must address. Do not waste your time putting up buildings and colour-washing them.

I want to tell you that today, in Russia, the leaders of the country have influenced the Russian Supreme Court and they have doubled the sentence given to a political opponent. Thirty seven investors have been pulled out from Russia. There is no rule of law there.

Investors come here and you nationalize their properties. So, where can they go? This Government has a history of nationalization. You nationalized the Ceylinco Group, the Waters Edge, the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, LMS et cetera. So, it is your duty to see that the rule of law is upheld. Yesterday, I met some officials of the BOI at a function and they told me that the biggest problem is the rule of law. There is one law for the Government and another law for the Opposition; one law for the Government supporters and another law for the Government opponents. So, this is the situation in Sri Lanka today. Every month Bills are passed in Parliament but all of them are politically bias. When you were with us, you appeared on a television programme and were outspoken. Can you remember that? But, you have forgotten all those things now. I hope you will remember some of the good things that you learnt from us. And, we are quite sure that you will again take a step before the next election because we know that your natural place is on this side. Anyway, we will support you and wish you all the best.
