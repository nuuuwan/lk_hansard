QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE I

HOLDING OF FREE AND FAIR ELECTION IN NORTH

( )

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, the second round of the Local Government Elections, which includes the elections for local authorities in the Jaffna Peninsula and Vanni is scheduled to be held on the 23rd of July, 2011. In 2009, in the immediate aftermath of the defeat of the LTTE, when conditions of security had not yet reached normalcy, elections were held for some of the local bodies in the North. The conduct of these elections was far from satisfactory. Armed groups operated openly. The police did not take action on the complaints made by the candidates of the Opposition parties. The administration became a part of the election campaign. Only the armed forces stayed out of that election campaign. Hon. Speaker, I think we must thank our Colleague, Mr. Sarath Fonseka, for having upheld that honourable tradition at that time.

Anyway, now this election is to be conducted under conditions of normalcy. Therefore, the duty of conducting elections rests on the Commissioner of Elections, his officers and the police. The maintenance of peace and enforcement of election laws is the sole responsibility of the police. Nevertheless, the events of the last few weeks have shown the inability of the police to inquire into complaints of election law violations. The election laws are observed in the breach. There are daily complaints regarding intimidation, violence and abuse of Government machinery.

Complaints have been received that officials, not only from the North, but also from other areas of the country have become a part of the election campaign of several Ministers. These are reported in electronic and print media. There are daily news items of tractors, water pumps, agricultural apparatus, sewing machines and fishing nets being freely distributed by the Ministers and their officials.

( ) (The Hon. Karu Jayasuriya) Chicken and goats also. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Chicken and goats are also being distributed, according to our Deputy Leader. This is a serious breach of law. The officials are also interfering with the Opposition party candidates. Recently, one of our candidates was threatened by a Government official. A complaint has been made to the police. The JVP has complained that the army is interfering with their election campaign. Yesterday, I had a complaint that a security force personnel had torn down the posters of the Opposition parties and pasted the posters of the UPFA. As I mentioned at the beginning, never before had the army got involved in political campaigns. I must say, none of the previous commanders allowed it. What is happening now is a dangerous trend. For the first time, elements of the security forces are also involved in the election campaign. This is in addition to the armed groups that are acting with impunity. There are a number of complaints daily of Opposition candidates being intimidated, stoned, threatened and assaulted. A wreath was placed at the doorstep of one of the candidates. The complaint made by the Hon. Suresh Premachandran, TNA Member of Parliament, which was also raised in this House has so far not been investigated.

The incident of a beheaded carcass of a dog being placed in the house of one of the candidates has shocked Jaffna. The vehicle of Hindu God Vairavar is a dog and therefore, it is most unlikely that this despicable act would have been done by a Tamil. The finger points at an obvious different direction.

There is also an incident which occurred on the 18th of July in Chunnakam, where the army had forcibly jumped on to an election propaganda stage and removed the microphones on the basis that it was past 10.00 p.m., which was the time prescribed in the permit. If that was so, it should have been the function of the police and not the army. I am sure, Hon. Speaker, you and I have experienced this. When we had run up against the time limit, the police gave us extra ten minutes and then got us to conclude the election campaign rally. Why was the police not used in this case?

Hon. Speaker, these elections are taking place at a critical time. The TNA is currently engaged in talks with the Government aimed at achieving a political solution. The Joint Communiqu between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Government of India emphasized on a political solution built on the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. We have stated that the UNP will support the outcome of these talks. The Government is also discussing with the TNA the possibility of

1203 1204

2011 21

appointing a Parliamentary Select Committee. The future of this will, to a large extent, depend on what happens at the local authority elections in the North. Therefore, it is not merely an election limited to selecting members to the local authorities. The success or failure of the ongoing political process depends, to a large extent, on the manner in which this election is conducted. It is an election which will have an impact on the country. This is why it is important to hold free and fair elections in the North.

Therefore, I would like to ask the Prime Minister, what action the Government is proposing to prevent these acts of intimidation in the last few days of election and what measures will be taken to ensure that the polling on 23rd July is free and fair.

[. . 2.29 ] ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by the Hon. Leader of the House. Tyronne and I both, came to Parliament in 1977. I had taken oaths as a lawyer and joined the party in 1972. At that time, Tyronne had just left the Official Bar. He had worked in the Attorney-Generals Department. He was well-known for leading the prosecution in the Pauline de

1217 1218

Croos case. Thereafter, he practised in the Private Bar and then joined us in 1974. He became the organizer for the Moratuwa Electorate after the death of Ruskin Fernando.

Tyronne was always interested in politics from the days he was in the Oxford University itself. I got to know him only after he joined the UNP and was organizing the Moratuwa Electorate. In 1977, both of us got elected as Members of Parliament to the Second National State Assembly. I became the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was a back-bencher. After I gave up the portfolio of Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs upon being appointed a Minister, Tyronne succeeded me and worked under the Hon. A.C.S. Hameed, who was then the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Tyronne always had an interest in foreign affairs; I would even call it his a hobby. He followed what was happening. That interest was there. That was the reason why I made him the Minister of Foreign Affairs in 2001 when I became the Prime Minister. During that period, Tyronne was responsible for the development of the Moratuwa Electorate. The Leader of the House mentioned about the new bridge which connects Panadura and Moratuwa. I know the opposition he had to build that. Then, of course, we have the cricket stadium.

He was also instrumental in getting many housing schemes there. He intervened with the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranasinghe Premadasa and ensured that flats and the housing schemes were put up there. I remember working with him to ensure the development of the schools in the Moratuwa Electorate and finally with his help, we located the Apprenticeship Training Institute in Moratuwa, within the boundaries of the Ratmalana and Moratuwa Electorates. He took a personal interest in the development of the Moratuwa Electorate. What it is today is due to the late Hon. Tyronne Fernando. Tyronne was also the Minister of Legal and Prison Reform. He was also responsible for information and broadcasting. Then, he had a stint in the Opposition where he sat in the Front benches. He was always a good debater and finally he was in this House as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He left our party and joined the SLFP subsequently.

Tyronne was very interested in cricket. That is why he became the President of the Board of Control for Cricket. Those days, Hon. Speaker, the position of the President of the Board of Control for Cricket was an honorary one. People like Tyronne had to spend out of their pockets. They did not make any money. Even from the Tyronne Fernando Stadium that was built, I can assure you, that he did not make a cent. Unfortunately, cricket has come to such depths that we wish that there were gentlemen like him. Certainly, Tyronne played his part in ensuring that the Sri Lankan Cricket Team was prepared for the World Cup 1996. He wrote a book on it. Arts and literature was also another strong point with him. We know him as a film producer and the books he wrote ranged from

political issues to sports and he even wrote a novel. Of course, as usual his books were based on international affairs and the UN.

Tyronne led a good life. Outside politics, he had varied interests and there were many discussions that we had on all topics. We must at this stage remember Tyronne, for the contribution he made in developing the Moratuwa Electorate as well as the contribution he made to Sri Lanka politics, specially international affairs. I would like our sentiments to be conveyed to the members of his family.

Thank you.

( - ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake - Minister of Public Management Reforms) Hon. Presiding Member, I would like to associate myself with the Vote of Condolence on the late Hon. Tyronne Fernando, who I personally knew very well. He was a man of integrity and honour and also he was a very close friend of my father, the late Hon. Gamini Dissanayake. I remember him coming to my house at No. 20, Fifth Lane, in the early 1970s. I was a small boy then, but I remember him coming and talking for endless hours with my father because at that time they were a part of a young group of MPs who were instrumental in reviving the fortunes of the United National Party. He was a Member of the co-intellectual group of the United National Party that effected the policies of the 1977 victory.

Unfortunately, this is something that I cannot understand. When I look upon the life of the late Hon. Tyronne Fernando, I felt that he was undone by the 1977 formation of the Cabinet because I feel that he was one person who should have got a Cabinet slot. He had to wait till 1989, that is a period of almost 11 - 12 years, to get into the Cabinet.

1221 1222

So, when you look upon the abilities of the late Hon. Tyronne Fernando, given the fact that he was a barrister; given the fact that he was an Oxford graduate, certainly I felt that he should have come into the Cabinet at a much earlier time. Therefore, his contributions could have been much more towards the country and the United National Party, if this break was given to him.

Also, the Hon. Tyronne Fernando that I knew, was a man of principle; integrity; the honest politician who always spoke the truth within and outside the party. His letter to the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, after he was rebuked by the United National Party by not being given a slot in the National List, stated the facts as they were, about the affairs of the United National Party. Henceforth he joined the Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa and gave immense strength to the President to prosecute the war. In that sense, he was a pragmatist; he was a nationalist and a patriot.

Also, as the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka, he was able to administer the affairs of the Board in a very upright manner. As the Hon Ranil Wickremasinghe stated, he never succumb to money. As you know, after 1996, there were so many issues in the Cricket Board. But, during the tenure of the late Hon. Tyronne Fernando there were no scandals; there were no corruption issues. So, he was able to carry on the affairs of the Cricket Board in a very honest and upright manner honouring the great names of the Presidents of Cricket Board like His Excellency J.R. Jayewardene, my father the late Hon. Gamini Dissanayake and Mr. F.R. Senanayake.

So, I would say that for me as a young politician, the Hon. Tyronne Fernando embodies a certain calibre of politician: a gentleman politician; an honest politician; a politician who spoke the truth from his heart. These are qualities that we, as young politicians must try to emulate.

Therefore, it is an honour and a privilege for me to associate myself with this Vote of Condolence. The Hon. Tyronne Fernando will always be in our hearts as a person who did a lot of service to the Moratuwa Electorate and also to the Colombo District. Therefore, I would like to pay homage to him and as a Buddhist, may he attain Nibbana!

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you. I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by both sides of the House on the death of the Hon. Tyronne Fernando.

I may also add a few words. I too had the opportunity

of having a very close association, affinity with the late Hon. Tyronne Fernando. When he was the Minister of Foreign Affairs, he nominated me to represent this House at the Golden Jubilee Celebration of Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace. I also remember attending his first meeting when he took to politics at modera in Moratuwa and had the opportunity of integrating with the former Attorney-General A.C.M.Ameer, QC.

The Hon. Tyronne Fernando had always been very keen in informing me of cricket matches whether it be Test or ODs in Sri Lanka and elsewhere and he would always invite me to the box to sit along with him. So much so, he even nominated me to distribute prizes to the winners at cricket matches at the Moratuwa Tyronne Fernando Stadium and also at Rangiri Dambulla Stadium.

I shall direct the Secretary-General of Parliament to make a Minute of today's Proceedings and send a copy thereof to the members of the bereaved family.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Madam Chairperson, a genial, gentle and gentleman politician, that is how I would describe the late Hon. E.L.B. Hurulle.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! .

, .

, () , . Whereupon THE HON. (MRS.) CHANDRANI BANDARA JAYASINGHE left the Chair and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER took the Chair.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I was just beginning my eulogy on the late Hon. E.L.B. Hurulle. He was soft-spoken. He walked without hurting even an ant on land. His association and affinity with his fellow beings were highly elated. Anybody who knew and came across the late Hon. E.L.B. Hurulle never believed that he was a politician, never believed that he was a Minister and never believed that he was a great man. He was so simple and so humble. If a politician of this era wants to learn a lesson of simplicity, geniality, gentlemanship, he can very well follow the footsteps of the late Hon. E.L.B. Hurulle.

When we were young doing politics, we heard about Hon. E.L.B. Hurulle. After the 1956 Election we thought he was a great revolutionary. We wanted to see in the House, a fire-eating politician and a great orator. But, when we came to the Gallery and watched his performances, we went home satisfied that even out of the eight Members in the Opposition at that time - , - he was a man with a simple demeanour and a serene personality but could meet giants in the legislature at that equal level. He had deep in him that much of courage, boldness and foresight. He was far-sighted, all right.

Then, Sir, in the 1956 Election, together with the late Hon. M.D. Banda from Maturata, he played an important role that Erskine May would like one to perform in a Parliament. He was so simple but he was robust. He brought before Parliament all the problems of the country by way of Oral Questions. Here we have to learn this lesson from the Hon. E.L.B. Hurulle. I watched him very closely from the Gallery those days. My habit and hobby

was sitting in the Gallery and listening to great politicians of that period with my cousin Dr. Harris Z. Dean. He asked Supplementary Questions precisely according to the Standing Orders. He never deviated from them - you can ask three Supplementary Questions basing on the reply given to the original Question. He did not deviate from it, nor did he beat about the bush. That is a lesson that we, the present Parliamentarians must learn, as I always point out to some of my Colleagues in the Opposition. What was the end result? The Hon. E.L.B. Hurulle won the hearts of the people by spotlighting their grievances in a lucid form.

He won the confidence of the fellow parliamentarians. The Speaker liked him; everyone else liked him and we liked him. That was Hon. Hurulle par excellence. When he was appointed as the Minister of Communications, we used to have several meetings with him. At that time the Minister of Labour, Employment and Housing was the Hon. M.H.Mohamed. Together with him we used to visit him and talk to him. He was invited for every Muslim function because everybody liked him. It is when he was Minister of Communications, he had a large area to cover, not only in the field of transport, but also in aviation.

There was a time when the late Hon. Dudley Senanayake started the agricultural revolution to grow more food. The late Hon. Hurulle as minister at that time was instrumental in importing mini Mokes to this Island. They were distributed among the farmers for agricultural pursuits. Then, I happened to be an officer at Air Ceylon at that time and he was the minister. Later I came to join Hon. Mohamed seconded for service. Air Ceylon in itself was a large aviation establishment. It was during his time, I remember very well at that time, the Nord and the Trident Aircraft carried all passengers from Colombo to right across the country; to KKS, to Batticoloa, to Ampara, to Galoya, to Trincomalee and at one point of time to Weerawila also.

I think today, Sir, we have to take a leaf out of this and start domestic flights. That will be very helpful for the people who are coming from abroad, tourists, Parliamentarians and others. Those days parliamentarians used to come to Air Ceylon. They bought air tickets to KKS from Colombo. That helped them a great lot.

Hon. Hurulle also introduced a novel system what was called the Japanese system of paddy growing, yielding a big harvest. He was called the

. He went to the village. He rehabilitated tanks. He had a very good knowledge about the country's irrigation system. He was well aware of the grievances and the hardship of the farmers as well. Then, Sir, the momentous period came in his life and our lives, when he was appointed the Minister of Cultural Affairs. Mention was made about the Cultural Triangle which he initiated and got it declared a world

heritage - . He went to several countries and was instrumental in the revival of cultural activities not only concerning the Buddhist and Sinhalese, even the Hindus, Christians and the Muslims.

The most significant event as far as we the Muslims are concerned took place, when late Hon. Edwin Hurulle was the Minister of Cultural Affairs. The stupendous task of translating the Holy Quran into Sinhala for the fist time in Sri Lanka was completed during this period. Help and assistance readily came from the then Prime Minister, Hon. Sirimavo Bandaranaike. I remember, Sir, Razik Fareed, the Life President of the Moors Islamic Cultural Home and his three joint secretaries, Mr. A.H. Macan Markar who was also an MP in this House earlier, Mr. A.I.L Marikar and Mr. M.H.M. Kamil.

They also created record at that time for being joint secretaries for 42 long years of a movement in our country This is the first time in Sri Lanka such a thing had happened.

There was a great English scholar, Mr. A.I.L. Marikar, who helped the group of translators approved by the late Hon. Hurulle - Alhaj Moulavi M.I. Abdul Hameed (Noori), Moulavi A.C.M. Lafir Alim Sahib, Alhaj Moulavi Shahul Hameed and also Mr. Pinoris Wickramasinghe - who helped to release the Holy Quran in Sinhala and made arrangements to have it launched at Temple Trees. That was one of the most significant features in the late Hon. E.L.B. Hurulles life. The Muslim community will never forget that. He was also given the greatest honour of Deshamanya for all his splendid services. He then became a diplomat and was sent to Australia. He did his job very well as was said here. Then, Sir, even as the Minister of Cultural Affairs, , , . . . . . . . .

He was also appointed the Governor of the North-Central Province. That land he knew like the lines of the palms of his hands. He helped those farmers and other people to uplift their standards of living.

His beloved son, Mr. Themiya L.B. Hurulle, is a very good and close friend of ours. I established a close friendship with him during his late fathers time. Themiya himself was a fine character as was his beloved father.

He is genial, friendly and truthful. We had a Science Exhibition in the railway station which was a novel thing to Puttalam. Mr. Themiya Hurulle initiated and inaugurated that in the Puttalam Railway Station when I was a Member of Parliament for Puttalam. Sir, that friendship is still continuing.

Sir, at this moment, we remember the late Hon. E.L.B. Hurulle for all what he had done for this country and for all the communities - the Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims, the Hindus and the Christians. Today, we feel sad that we lack people of that calibre who are patriotic and loyal to his own country. When I met him in his later life he agreed with me saying, You did the correct thing by joining President Mahinda Rajapaksa and he also appreciated the work that had been done.

Hon. E.L.B. Hurulle was a distinguished Member of this House for 24 years and 18 days. May he attain !
