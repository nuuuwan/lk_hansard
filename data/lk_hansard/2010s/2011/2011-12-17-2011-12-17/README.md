( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I have the pleasure in presenting the Report of the Select Committee to Discuss the Heads of Expenditure of Ministries selected from the Budget Estimates of 2012.

According to the Motion approved by this House on 8th November, 2011, the Heads of Expenditure relating to 21 Ministries had been selected for consideration by the Committee appointed by you on 9th November, 2011. I thank the Hon. Speaker for appointing me as the Chairman of this Select Committee with 20 other Hon. Members of Parliament representing all political parties, in which exercise I am sure, I was able to keep the trust and confidence reposed on me by this House.

Seven meetings of the Committee were held from 11th November to 14 th December, 2011, out of which five were set apart to consider the Annual Estimates of the 21 Ministries and discussions were held from 10.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. each day.

The discussions at these meetings were very pleasant and cordial, different from a debate in Parliament, where all the key officials of the ministries and departments under the ministries participated and provided all required

2535 2536

2011 17

information. They were also able to answer all the queries raised by the Members of Parliament in a very fruitful manner.

This procedure of discussing Annual Estimates at a Select Committee before the Committee Stage has proved very successful and productive as Members were able to obtain clarifications and resolve a number of outstanding issues. This is the second occasion after 2008 where the Annual Estimates were discussed at a Select Committee.

I thank the Hon. Ministers to whom the subjects and functions under the selected Ministries were assigned, for their presence and for the valuable contributions they made. I appreciate the contribution of the Members of the Committee as well as all the Members of Parliament who were present at the meetings of the Committee in discussing various issues. Of the Members of the Committee, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, the Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha, the Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena, the Hon. Lasantha Alagiyawanna, the Hon. John Amaratunga, the Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera and the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara participated at most of the discussions. The summary of attendance of the Members of Parliament is given in Appendix 3 of this Report.

I also appreciate the contributions made by the Secretaries to the Ministries and other key officials who were present at the meetings and thank them for making exhaustive presentations at the beginning of each session.

The services of the officials of the Treasury who were present at all the meetings to assist us in providing all necessary information are also appreciated. I am pleased to note that the services rendered by the Assistant Secretary-General, the Parliament Secretariat and the Office of the Leader of the House in this endeavour were extremely efficient.

As a recommendation of the Committee, I suggest that this procedure be adopted in respect of more Ministries from next years Budget. We also suggest that the recommendations made by this Committee in this Report be monitored and followed up in the respective Consultative Committees by the relevant Ministers. I wish to urge the Hon. Members to ensure greater participation at the meetings of the Select Committees as it is the only way to make this exercise more fruitful and productive.

I thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity.

Sir, I move,

That the Report of this Select Committee be printed. , . . Question put, and agreed to.

. . Ordered that the Report be printed.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Sir, I am submitting the English version of the Report and we will be distributing the Tamil and Sinhala versions also to the Hon. Members of Parliament. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, we have set apart a separate day, which is the 20th for the Debate on this Report. The Oppositions comments on the Report will be presented to the House on that occasion. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Thank you.

That is, to present a Motion with regard to the COPE Report that was tabled in this House. There were a series of establishments that were loss-making. As regards certain recommendations, I suggest that a select committee be appointed in order to ensure that these matters will not be repeated. Sir, to brief it, please give me one minute.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have not given any notice under Standing Order No. 23 (1) to the Secretary-General of Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No, Sir, there is no notice necessary. May I read that Section, with respect?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, certainly.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Standing Order No. 23 (1) states, I quote: Notice of questions or motions shall be given in writing, signed by the member giving the notice and addressed to the Secretary-General. Such notices may be handed over to the Secretary-General at any time when Parliament is sitting........

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Exactly, so. Hon. Member, up to now, you have not given notice.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I am giving it now, Sir. I am in the process of giving it. When the Sittings are going on, I have the right to give it.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you can give notice even when the Parliament is in Session but you have to give notice first and then make that statement.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, this is the notice that I am going to give now.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Sir, he is making a little bit of mischief in the morning.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I am making this application in the interests of both the Government and the Opposition.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) The Deputy Leader of a Party cannot behave like this. You must be more responsible

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Article 148 of the Constitution is very clear.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Certainly, you could do so by giving notice first. There is a procedure stipulated very clearly.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I will hand over the notice now, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) No, no. You should hand it over to the office. That is the procedure.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, the whole country is concerned about what has been disclosed in that COPE Report.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I do not know what matter you are going to raise in the first place. But, you have to follow the proper procedure and submit it. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes, Sir. I am asking for a Select Committee to -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You submit your request in writing and then raise it.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) My Honourable Friends request is out of order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You can certainly say it but submit your request in writing.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) You have a lot of problems.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I have it in writing here.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Then, you submit it to the Secretary-General of Parliament and then raise it.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) So, in the process of submitting it, I am trying to show why are you not - [Interruption.] Is there anything wrong, Sir? - [Interruption.] Is there anything wrong? There is nothing wrong in it. Now, Sir, I will just mention the cause as to why we are asking for it? That is all. This is nothing personal, Sir. This is for the benefit of both the Government and the Opposition. Under Article 148 of the Constitution, we are vested with the control over public finance.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Follow the procedure. You cannot just get up and move Motions like this.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Just give me one minute, Sir. I just only want to say what I am going to hand over. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) No, no.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) So, hand it over.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Just give me one minute, Sir. What I say is, to look into the - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) No, no. All these must be expunged from Hansard.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) You cannot discuss anything in advance.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) - [Interruption.] - who are responsible for the mismanagement of the institutions involved in fundamental activities.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Okay, you can submit it now, Hon. Member.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I will just finish, Sir. Just give me a second. To prevent continued occurrences of these losses, recommend what action should be taken in the first instance to punish these people who are responsible for it, and to determine what steps should be taken to recover - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) How can he raise a Motion without giving proper notice?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Okay. You submit it.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) - [Interruption.] This is abuse of procedure.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You submit what is in writing.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Sir, we will move onto the next item of the Agenda.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am very happy that you gave me the opportunity to raise this privilege question when I met you in your Chamber. Sir, I am referring to the Parliamentary Scholarship Board, which is an institution created by Act No. 22 of 2002. Now, Sir, I raised this question sometime ago and there was no response unfortunately, and I told that the Board is neither doing anything for the benefit of the scholars nor any service to Parliament. Therefore, Sir, this must be abolished. Also, there is a highly politicized person who is the Chairperson

2569 2570

of this Board, Mrs. Priyanee Wijesekera, who is being appointed to the Executive Council of the United National Party. She is involved in party activities, Sir. This must be abolished and she must be sent home.

Sir, I would warn this House that even in future when persons are appointed to this type of institutions - it is an institution created by Parliament - one must be careful not to appoint such politicized persons.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) We understand that the Parliamentary Scholarship Board is a white elephant and the Hon. Speaker has already given a directive to the Secretary-General of Parliament to take steps to abolish that.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Thank you, Sir, for that. As I told you, the second question is, " " Sir, this is a matter concerning the Rights and Privileges of every Member. Yesterday, the Hon. Sampanthan cried out aloud mentioning a certain name, " LLRC ". "" front page . . , . The minor staff is doing a great job and it has been taken away by the - [Interruption.]

Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Deputy Speaker, may I rise to a point of Order on certain areas of the COPE Report? I was informed as a Member of the COPE that there are certain misleading statements that had been uttered and as a result there is a rectification of that. Sir, firstly, I ask how can Members of the COPE issue such statements - ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, then what is a point of Order, if it is not a point of Order?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Points of Order are specifically stipulated in the Standing Orders - [Interruption.] You may raise that matter at the Committee. Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran, you raise your matter of Privilege.

: . " " "" : . "" " " PRIVILEGE : PUBLISHING OF UNDELIVERED SPEECH OF HON. E. SARAVANAPAVAN, MP, IN THE "SUDAR OLI" AND "UDAYAN" NEWSPAPERS

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran - Deputy Minister of Resettlement) I would like to bring to your kind attention and necessary action the following news item which appeared on the front page and on page three respectively in the Tamil dailies, Sudar Oli and Uthayan of 14th December, 2011. The said news item reported under the heading Due to political influence judiciary in the North interferes with the freedom of the press, Saravanapavan, MP said in Parliament", incl uded the following undelivered texts:

Suspicions are aroused among journalists in the North whether the judiciary interferes with the press freedom because of political influence. If this trend continues in the North, the press freedom may become questionable".

In total, anybody can attack Tamil media personnel and the only thing the attacker needs to confirm iswhether the attackee writes against the Government.

The above texts were not included in the speech delivered by the Hon. E. Saravanapavan at the Committee Stage Debate on the Ministry of Mass Media and Information held on the 13th December, 2011. However, Sudar Oli and Uthayan published the above texts as delivered by the Hon. E. Saravanapavan at the Committee Stage Debate on the 13th December, 2011.

I reliably learn that this practice of reporting a speech as delivered in Parliament, whereas only a part of it was actually delivered, has been continuing for sometime now.

Please take necessary action against the publishers or the editors of Sudar Oli and Uthayan for violating the agreed rules of the Standing Orders of Parliament. Copies of the relevant press clippings and the video recording of the Hon. Members speech, as delivered in Parliament, are attached for your perusal. Thank you.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Leader of the House, I request you to submit a Motion, enabling the Hon. Speaker to refer this matter to the Committee on Privileges.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Okay, Sir.

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda - Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development) There were not only these, but also some other incidents. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Also, Sir, take steps to repeal the Scholarship Board.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Steps are being taken to repeal that. The Hon. Speaker has taken notice of that and has already directed the Secretary-General in that regard. We accept the fact that it is only a white elephant to draw salaries and give benefits to its employees. - [Interruption.] A Bill has already been drafted to abolish that.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, you have one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I have 20 minutes. ? Okay.

As I am running out of time I want to touch on the Sri Lanka Export Development Board, which comes under your Ministry. The major challenge is to develop exports. I know some work is being done and I know that there is a good Chairman in the Export Development Board. He is a capable person and I see a lot of good work being done. I also read in the newspapers the other day that 2012 is going to be the year of exports. I wish the Export Development Board and the Hon. Minister well, because I think that is the right direction for us to go.

The export policy must be considered carefully. The fact of the matter is that exports as a percentage of GDP has fallen from about 30 to 17 per cent in the last 10 years or so. In fact, the trade deficit has increased dramatically. The pressure on the rupee, therefore, is enormous. As a matter of fact, the trade deficit for the year 2011 is estimated to be something close to US Dollars 8 billion. Therefore, there needs to be an appropriate policy to ensure that you can increase exports -

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Hon. Member, I am here.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I know you are here, Hon. Minister. ( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, you have taken two extra minutes. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Yes, I will wind up. So, the issue then is about the diversification of exports. We remember that under the late President Premadasa, the 200-Garment Factory Programme was initiated. Now, the entire export sector is dependent on apparels. Good! I am not saying it is bad. But, that is not good enough. If you look at the apparel sector, there has been a lot of backward integration. There are textile manufacturing companies; elastic manufacturing companies; accessories and so on. Now, what we need to do is to move beyond exports. Diversification is the need of the hour. So, I am asking the Hon. Minister, "What is happing to diversification; what has happened to the IT-BPO industry and where is the growth?" After the HSBCs Call Centre was set up near Parliament, we have not seen any big real investment coming into the IT-BPO sector. I know there are companies like Amba Research, Stax and all that, but they are still small companies. We have not seen large two-three thousand seat companies come up. All what I am saying is that you need to diversify your exports.

The last point I want make because I am running out of time is about the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, which also comes under your Ministry.

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce)

. . rose. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Minister, you can reply later. We must realize that Indias middle class is growing almost exponentially and the market in India is over one billion people as opposed to a 20 million market here. So, you must take into consideration the positives and the negatives of the CEPA and move on with it, Hon. Minister. You know that it is stuck. It has been stuck since 2008. When we started -

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) The UNP people should also extend their support for this. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Thank you, Hon. Minister. We are not pulling your leg. We have been very supportive. Only three or four individuals are pulling your leg.

( ) (The Chairman) Please wind up. You have taken four minutes in excess.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Those have to be dealt with. Thank you.

( ) (The Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. Douglas Devananda. Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Basheer Segu Dawood - Deputy Minister of Co-operatives and Internal Trade) Hon. Deputy Chairman, when the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva was speaking in this House as the first speaker, he said that both the Minister in charge of the subject, the Hon. Johnston Fernando, and the Deputy Minister were not here. But, I was sitting here and it shows that the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva does not know who the Deputy Minister of Co-operatives and Internal Trade is. - [Interruption.] Sir, he does not know who the Deputy Minister of Co-operatives and Internal Trade is.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) You were with us.

2617 2618

( ) (The Hon. Basheer Segu Dawood) Yes, I was with you. We were everywhere. That is our politics.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) You are nowhere. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Basheer Segu Dawood) Who told you that we are nowhere? We are with the Government; we are with His Excellency the President; we are working together and we are producing something and giving it to our community.

[5.15 p.m.] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, at the outset I would like to mention that the "Review of the Activities 2011" of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been tabled and distributed to all Hon. Members of Parliament. It contains the performances and activities of the Ministry, the institutions coming under its purview and a general review of the respective sectors. It also mentions the future plans, the projects and joint ventures undertaken by my Ministry in collaboration with the private sector.

His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa presented the Seventh Budget of this Government on Monday, 21st November, mainly focusing on socio-economic infrastructure development and relief to the poor. He, in his first term of office, stood firmly to eradicate terrorism from the country, and against all odds, succeeded in achieving it. His second term of office is dedicated to improve the economy of the country and make Sri Lanka a trading hub and the "Wonder of Asia". It is really a continuation of the economic development programme introduced in the 2010 Budget.

Despite the economic growth being around 6 per cent from 2005 to 2009, it could reach around 8 per cent in 2010 and 8.2 per cent in the first half of 2011. What is striking is that the inflation which stood at 5 per cent in October 2011, is significantly lower than the growth rate. In that light, it is important to note that in 2010, the industrial sector was able to record the highest sectoral growth of 8.4 per cent contributing 28.7 per cent to the GDP. In the first two quarters of 2011, it recorded a 11 per cent and a 9.5 per cent growth respectively. Percentage-wise, it was above the national growth. In the first quarter of 2011, export earnings expanded significantly by 54.3 per cent, while the industrial exports indicated an increase of 63.8 per cent, that is US Dollars 2,078 million. This shows that the industrial sector has played its part in this economic revival. On the same day the Budget was presented, the Central Bank announced that Sri Lankas GDP growth for 2012 would be around 9 per cent, which I believe, is a very positive sign. I am confident that the industry and commerce sectors too will make their respective contributions.

2705 2706

This years Budget is also focused towards export development and a key contribution of the Budget is the rupee devaluation, which increases our export competitiveness and drives the economy towards achieving the Governments target of US Dollars 20 billion export earnings by 2020. If I may quote His Excellency the Presidents own words for the reason behind this move, As our country has experienced the strengthening of the exchange rate, in the backdrop of those countries that are competing with our country, as well as our neighbouring countries have depreciated their exchange rates significantly. Together with the wide ranging tax concessions for various private sector undertakings announced in this Budget, the devaluation of the rupee will give a further boost to our export manufacturing sector. My Ministry is also supporting cost-saving initiatives at the manufacturers' side. In December this year, the Productivity Division of my Ministry has commenced a nine-month project for private-public partnership model to make 16 private sector industries become energy efficient.

I should also stress that we should not depend only on cost competitiveness to sustain our export growth. We should also strive to build our export brand name in international markets, by developing unique selling propositions. My Ministry is focusing on those lines and during the year under review the Sri Lanka Cinnamon brand and Pure Ceylon Tea brands were launched. Similarly launching of the Ceylon Blue Sapphire and geographical indicators for tea is planned next year. Other top gainers in the industrial sector are rubber finished products, food, beverages and tobacco, non-metallic mineral products, leather products and wooden products.

The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has formulated five-year plans for the industrial sector as well as the textile sector to streamline the set targets for a highly value-added, knowledge-based, internationally-competitive and diversified sector with a highly skilled workforce. Based on that, the Ministry and the institutions coming under it are conducting a variety of programmes in collaboration with the private sector, academic institutions and chambers. They are basically conducted on public-private partnerships. Product sectors and thrust areas have been given much emphasis by focusing on value addition, high productivity, product diversification and branding, in view of capturing high returns while conquering high-end markets and in turn reducing imports..

Sir, among our exports, textiles and garments have contributed 39.5 per cent to the total export earnings and have increased by 27.4 per cent, despite the withdrawal of the GSP Plus facility, showing the high quality of our garment products.

Sri Lankas export products and services which amounts to Euros 1.7 billion to the EU is about 29 per cent of Sri Lankas total exports. Garments and the textile export to the EU, which amounts to more than Euro 1 billion is 55 per cent of the total value of Sri Lankas exports to the EU. I am pleased to announce that the US GSP programme, which came to a temporary halt at the end of 2010 has now been extended till the end of 2013 and the US President is expected to sign the Reauthorization Bill into law shortly, thereby giving additional stimulus to our export efforts.

As a major stepping stone to achieve our export target of US Dollars 20 billion by the year 2020, I am pleased to announce that a mega export show of international scale called Sri Lanka Expo 2012 will be held in Sri Lanka after 15 years, the theme of which is Partnering with the Hub of Asia. I am pleased to announce that this event has now been elevated by the Government to a national event and it will now be coordinated by a powerful Cabinet-appointed Ministerial Committee and also a high level official Committee.

Now, it is clear that in order to increase and improve the balance of trade in favour of us, expansion of exports alone is insufficient. The strategy of import substitution if practised effectively, will not only develop our industrial sectors but also reduce our import expenditure. This is another area that is focused in this Budget. In taking into account the needs of the new development era in Sri Lanka, the 2012 Budget has emphasized on import substitutions, foreign investment and development of industries such as pharmaceuticals, cement, steel and iron, tyres, rubber-based products, textiles and apparels, milk powder and dairy-based products and sugar and sugar-based products.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, we have identified a number of challenges in the export sector. The first is that we are now compelled to demonstrate much stronger export growth statistics than ever before. Secondly, that any economic growth trend, however promising, cannot go on indefinitely. Thirdly and the most important challenge is adapting to the greening process of our manufacturing and agro sectors since going-green and eco-friendly manufacturing has now become not only fashionable and profitable, but also essential. I believe that such a two- pronged approach will greatly help us to maximize the 2012 Budget Proposals aimed at spurring exports, through the current system.

This 65th Budget of the country has granted incentives for investments at all levels, especially since SMEs consist of more than 75 per cent of Sri Lankas industries and enterprises. I must mention here very categorically, Hon. Deputy Chairman, that this 2012 Budget is the most SME-friendly Budget this country has seen in the recent times. His Excellency the President has rightly recognized the valuable contribution of the SME sector to

2707 2708

[ ]

2011 17

Sri Lankas economy, which help bridge the growth disparities across the provinces.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, though more than 75 per cent of our industries are SMEs, they are handicapped by a lack of knowledge and inability to innovate, lacking funds and are in dire need for modernization here. I am glad to inform this House, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and especially the National Enterprises Development Authority coming under my purview and which focuses on SMEs, have extended the fullest support to uplift our SMEs.

My Ministry has also allocated Rs.64.14 million in 2011 for the "Kantha Diriya" and special projects relevant to the handloom sector SMEs. Furthermore, the Pro-Food Pro-Pack Exhibition and the packaging exhibition which my Ministry is conducting along with the private sector associations has allowed special concessions and sponsorship for SME pavilions for their benefit. I am therefore glad to say that my Ministry has been successful in bringing Private-Public Partnership model to the SME sector as well. I am also pleased to inform the House of a related development, that is, upto September this year, 5,993 new companies were incorporated under the 2007 Act by the Department of Registrar of Companies under my Ministry. By the end of September this year, 24,823 companies have been re-registered.

My Ministry works very closely with the universities and academic institutions to facilitate the industries. The establishment of the die-and-mould centre, rapid prototype machine in the Moratuwa University are examples. The die-and-mould centre is currently servicing the industrialists in many ways and is also a profit-making venture. Another development that took place during the year was the designing of geo-textile weaving machine for coir in collaboration with the Moratuwa University for the benefit of the coir sector. Since the designing part has been completed, the Ministry is taking steps to expand the project. In September, my Ministry has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Moratuwa University to set up the first technology incubator for the Electrical and Electronic Industry in Sri Lanka.

Another area where our Ministry is active, is assisting the local industries in the field of human resource development in areas where professional and technical development programmmes for technical staff who have no access to such facilities; my Ministry through its Sectoral Advisory Committees, assisted them by facilitating foreign training for them.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, I am pleased to inform you that from the year 2008 to 15th July, 2011, the total new private sector industry registrations with my Ministry is 294. These 294 new private sector firms which registered with my Ministry also revealed that they invested a total of US Dollats 247.15 million, generating 23,508 new

employment opportunities. It should be noted that many new private sector industry units of smaller scale might also have started operations without registering with the Ministry or expecting to register later and therefore the number "294 firms" and "23,508 new employment opportunities" may not show the bigger progress and therefore I believe that the real numbers could be higher.

The incentives of Rs. 300 million to Rs. 2.5 billion for large industries is especially welcome by my Ministry as it will complement our efforts in developing industrial zones across the country. I particularly welcome the proposals to develop manufacturing of pharmaceuticals in Sri Lanka as a Strategic Import Replacement Enterprise by granting tax holidays for investment in pharmaceutical production.

Sri Lankas expenditure on pharmaceutical products has been increasing up to around 11 per cent annually during the last few years. Six local pharmaceutical manufacturers are already active in Sri Lanka and the demand shortfall is met by imported products from more than 300 international manufacturers. The Government spends around US Dollars 140 million annually on medicine alone.

I am happy to announce that supporting the vision of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, my Ministry has identified pharmaceutical manufacturing as a key industry in its five-year plan and I am pleased to inform you that we have already begun the preliminary work on developing the countrys first pharmaceutical manufacturing zone under the chairmanship of our Deputy Minister. The product output from the pharma zone will help to fulfil the domestic medicine demand and also to stabilize the price volatilities in our market, thereby helping our consumers greatly. I wish to announce that this dedicated zone, which will initially cater to the domestic market, will not only make pharmaceutical products, but will also be expanded to produce medical equipment. I believe that investors do not have to worry about such issues as potential price control measures on pharmaceuticals since the buyback agreements with manufacturers, subject to the provisions of each agreement, will minimize volatility that could affect producers.

Sir, despite renewed recession fears especially in Europe and the US, this year we continued to make steady progress in international trade. I am pleased to inform the Hon. Members of this House that on the international trade front, together with the Department of Commerce under my Ministry, we have made new advances. Receiving business delegates from the US and holding another round of TIFA, renewal of trade ties with the Middle-East, continuation of our ongoing trade focus on South Asia through SAFTA, enhancement of our efforts further towards China and Japan, the successful joint economic cooperation efforts with Pakistan and a

2709 2710

new Memorandum of Understanding on Machinery Manufacturing Cooperation with Vietnam, which facilitates bilateral research and development, stand out among the highlights of 2011.

Sir, I am pleased to inform that we renewed trade ties significantly with three Middle-Eastern countries this year, following my official visit to those countries in May, 2011.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Minister, you have only two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Sir, please give me another five minutes as there are not many speakers.

The Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement signed in 1998 is now playing a significant role in our bilateral trade. The Department of Commerce had issued 4,371 Certificates of Origin under the ISFTA from January to May, 2011, when compared to the 4,112 in the same period in 2010.

The Ninth Meeting of the United States-Sri Lanka Trade and Investment Framework Agreement - TIFA - Council was held in November, 2011. Since it was signed in 2002, TIFA has been the primary forum for bilateral trade and investment discussions between the two countries. It is planned to hold the next TIFA Council meeting in late March, 2012, to coincide with the Sri Lanka Expo 2012, in Colombo.

The South Asian Regional Trade Grouping is gaining importance though trade between most of the countries are low since they manufacture and export similar goods since its formation in 2004. Today, China has become an important market for Sri Lanka and under the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement, Sri Lankan exporters have been able to enter into the Chinese market.

China is the second largest supplier of goods to Sri Lanka. In this context, I am happy to inform you of our successful participation at the Fourth South Asian Countries' Business Forum and Trade Fair held at Kunming this year, significantly contributing towards the enhancement of bilateral trade.

Sir, the ongoing economic co-operation efforts between Sri Lanka and Vietnam were greatly strengthened by the many MoUs and agreements signed in October between the two countries. My Ministry was proud to enter into the MoU on Machinery Manufacturing Cooperation, which facilitates bilateral research,

development and training and the parties will also facilitate their respective private sector companies to work with each other.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! Hon. Minister, your can table the rest of your speech. ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Sir, please give me two more minutes, I will conclude.

The "Mahinda Chintana" policy documents - Mahinda Chintana,- Towards a new Sri Lanka of 2005 and Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future of 2010, as stipulated, present a comprehensive approach towards a dynamic and evolving industrial sector with strengthened commercial activities in navigating the countrys future on a secure and sustainable path.

Sir, I am pleased to say that the 65th Budget is a very forward-looking instrument focused not only on the commerce and industry sector of Sri Lanka, but also on the development of all sectors of the country, while ensuring adequate support for the disadvantaged groups in our society.

I would also like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere gratitude to His Excellency the President for rendering support and assistance and resettling the internally displaced persons expelled in 1990. Such cross-cutting efforts will, no doubt, result in achieving the positive outcomes envisaged in the "Mahinda Chntana" vision for Sri Lankas rapid and inclusive development.

Finally, I wish to extend my special thanks to my Secretary, Mr. Tilak Collure, and the other officials in my Ministry and all the divisions, departments and the statutory bodies under it for their commitment to work towards achieving the targets set out in our five-year Plan, guided by the development framework of the "Mahinda Chintana" vision.

Thank you. [. . 5.39] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Johnston Fernando - Minister of Co-operatives and Internal Trade) , .
