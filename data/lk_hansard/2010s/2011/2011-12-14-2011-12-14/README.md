On page 1 of the "Daily Mirror" of today, the General Secretary of the UNP says, I quote:

"Announcement about new UNP leader on Sunday

The official announcement regarding the appointment of a new UNP leader will be made at a Working Committee meeting on December 18. Party General Secretary Tissa Attanayake said the names of 19 new members to the party's apex body was finalized on Monday night. He said announcements would also be made for the appointment of two deputy leaders, a national organizer and the party chairman on the same day."

Sir, I hope and wish that the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe will remain in his position so as the Opposition Whip. We are worried because we have reached certain agreements at the Party Leaders' Meeting in relation to the conduct of the Budget Programme till the 21st. If by chance there is a change, we have to change that Programme which will affect not only the UNP and the Government but the whole country. So, we do not want to do that. That is why I raised this. I hope that there would be no change - a change could be made by the Party and that is not our business. Since this is an important matter I brought it to your notice.

Hon. Speaker, repeated assurances have been given in this Parliament particularly after crushing of the LTTE, that the Government will effectively be meeting the challenges and accusations of the international community. From 2009 up to now, the Hon. Minister of External Affairs and his co-Minister, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, have been going abroad and after coming back, they have been assuring us saying, We have met the arguments of the international community and we could safeguard the integrity, sovereignty and the reputation of Sri Lanka. But, it appears that these assertions are not quite correct, Hon. Minister. When the UN Committee against Torture met from 31st October to 25th November, 2011, they issued a statement. Since I do not have time to read the entire thing, I will read a relevant portion of it. In The Sunday Times of 27th November, 2011, it is stated, I quote:

The Committee also asked the Government to act against enforced disappearances by ensuring that the cases of enforced disappearances are thoroughly and effectively investigated, that suspects are prosecuted and those found guilty punished with sanctions proportionate to the gravity of their crimes and those who have suffered harm as the direct result of an enforced disappearance have access to information about the fate of the disappeared persons be adequately compensated.

This is the most important part. I quote:

The Committee also expressed concern at reports that human rights defenders, defence lawyers and other civil society actors, including political activists, trade unionists and independent media journalists have been singled out as targets of intimidation, harassment, including death threats and physical attacks and politically motivated charges.

Hon. Minister, it was just last month that this was published. So, it appears that the campaign you have had for the last two years using the international media experts has had no effect. This is the latest report about Sri Lanka. So, I would like to know what you are going to do with regard to this.

Then, Hon. Minister, I read in the newspapers that when some Ministers go abroad, particularly to the UN - it is not you - I think it is the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe has always been talking of an Action Plan for Human Rights in Sri Lanka. It is very funny because I remember in 2007, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe referred to a roadmap. We have never seen these things. Hon. Minister, will you produce the Action Plan for Human Rights in Sri Lanka today because we have never seen it. Earlier, he spoke of a roadmap. We did not see that also. So, I hope that the Hon. Minister will give a copy of that Action Plan. I have been trying to get it from various sources for the last several days but no one seems to have a copy of it. So, I do not know whether this is another effort by the Government to hoodwink all those who are interested in human rights in Sri Lanka. But, this is not going to help you because the international community has given you time because of the assurances given by your Government. So, before the Debate is over, I hope

the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe will produce this Action Plan, as we would like to see that.

Now, the LLRC Report is out. We are glad that it is out because when the UN Report was out - Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, you can remember because you were in Parliament.- what did the UNP say? The UNP said, Let there be an internal investigation. That is what the UNP said. You would recall what the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, making a statement in Parliament, on that day said. He said, Let there be an internal investigation as requested by the UN Committee. That is what we asked. Then, on that day - [Interruption.] There is a Report on Sri Lanka which had been tabled in the UN Human Rights Committee. That is a Report on Sri Lanka. That has been circulated. Sir, the Hon Karu Jayasuriya asked for an internal investigation on this Report and then he was shouted down. He was not even allowed to speak. He was called a traitor when he asked for an internal investigation by us - by our police, by our CID and by our judges and he was shouted down. But, now what does the LLRC - the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission - Report say? It says the same thing.

Though the Report is not yet out, I would like to read from the The Sunday Times of 20th November, 2011, which is a reliable newspaper. It states, I quote:

"The Final Report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) will ask the Government to investigate incidents that may have occurred during the final stages of the war..."

What the LLRC Report states is: "to investigate incidents that may have occurred during the final stages of the war". So, this is what the LLRC states and this is what the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya and also the UN then said. Now, are the members of the LLRC traitors just because they have asked to investigate? But, when we mentioned this, we were shouted down and we could not talk in Parliament. So, I would like to know what you have to say about this.

Now, you say that you will implement the Report of the LLRC. Sir, one year ago, last September, the LLRC submitted an Interim Report. Did you implement a single provision of that Interim Report? Now, you say you are going to implement the LLRC Report. But, the Interim Report had several recommendations with regard to the treatment of detainees, law and order, land, illegal armed groups and language. It is one year since the Interim Report was put out. Have you implemented a single proposal of the Interim Report recommendations of the LLRC? You have done nothing. You have given assurances, you have appointed commissions, you buy time but at the end, you did nothing. So, I do not know whether this will help you with the international community because they know what the Government is appointing commissions; taking time but not implementing the recommendations of the commissions.

1971 1972

What has happened to the Udalagama Commisssion? The Government appointed the Udalagama Commission to investigate serious acts of violation of human rights. What did the Government do? The Government closed shop after 2009 and up to now, we do not know what has happened to the Udalagama Commission and the report is not yet out. So, I would like to ask the Hon. Minister, how will you implement the Report of the LLRC when you have not even implemented the Interim Report of the Committee?

Now, with regard to the UN report, we do not know what happened during the last stages of the war because the Opposition Members were never informed, not even the Leader of the Opposition was ever informed as to what was taking place. So, we cannot comment about what happened during the last stages of the war. In any democratic country, normally the Leader of the Opposition or the Opposition parties are taken into confidence and told that these are the steps that are being taken with regard to the war but nothing of that nature happened here. So, we cannot comment. But, there are allegations about civilian casualties.

There is another part, Hon. Minister. You have not still answered that. The other part of the UN Report does not deal with the war. It deals with the serious human rights violations committed by the Government from 2005. You have not answered that part. Disappearances: the white van syndrome; killing of media people; abductions; setting fire to media institutions; oppression of the judiciary - all those questions demand an answer. We will not support the allegations that in the last stages of the war 40,000 people died. There is a question mark over that. Of course, some Government Ministers have said that 7,000 died, 8,000 died. We do no know. But, the fact of the matter is, with regard to the other part - the accusations made against the Government about the serious human rights violations from 2005 - you have not given an answer. We are only interested in that. How many people have disappeared? How many Members of Parliament have been killed? Then the white van syndrome, and the setting of fire to media institutions. Have you answered those in Parliament up to now?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) To whom are you - [Interruption.] You cannot blame all in the field. Are you a Sri Lankan or an American? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) They maybe Tamils but they are Sri Lankan citizens. I am speaking on behalf of the Sri Lankan citizens.- [Interruption.] We would like to know from the Minister as to when he is going to reply that part of the allegation, because the entire world community is waiting for an

explanation of that. The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris said the other day - I think on the day of Presidents Vote - that we are trying to internationalize everything. , .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) , .

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . . , . . , . It is a real shame. Hon. Speaker, our cricketers have complained to the international community and the ICC that their salaries have not been paid. Why is that? Are they traitors? No. It is because they have not been paid and they have no place to go. . ? They do not have a place to go.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) They have gone to South Africa.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , .

It is a shame when our cricketers go - [Interruption.] They have not only appealed to the ICC, they have appealed to the South African Cricketers. It is a shame. This is what Dilshan said in South Africa. This is a matter for the country. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You are a very good lawyer - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Why do you get angry? Kindly listen to this. This is for the country; this is not for the UNP.

Hon. Chairman, I have an article here with me which states, "Sri Lanka skipper, Tillakaratne Dilshan thanked the South Africa counterpart, Graeme Smith on Wednesday amid signs that most of the salaries owed to the touring team had not been paid". They have

1973 1974

complained. Dilshan has complained to the South African Captain - [Interruption.] It is a shame. Dilshan has called for an intervention from the South African camp to get their salaries.- [Interruption.] So, these are the people - [Interruption.] Again the article states, "Sri Lanka staged the World Cup but went bankrupt. Heavily indebted Sri Lanka Cricket has been unable to pay national players. The Country finished runners-up with co-host India - "

This is the situation. So, why are you blaming us? Why are you blaming the people who have lost their loved ones. Our Sri Lankan Cricketers are going to the international community because they do not have faith in you, Hon. Minister of External Affairs. They are complaining to the ICC. At least take a cue from this and correct yourself. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Chairman) , . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, can I have five more minutes ? We will sort it out. ( ) (The Chairman) 5 ? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Yes, yes. ( ) (The Chairman) 2 . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, on Human Rights Day, in Sri Lanka several people had disappeared. Lalith Kumar Weeraraju, a human rights activist had disappeared in Jaffna. Sir, there is another question. You say that the Leader of the UNP, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, is always taking these matters to the international community. Sir, when he met the UN Secretary-General last time, what did he say? He said, Give the Government time. He could have said, Do not give the Government time. When the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe met the UN Secretary-General, he said, Give the Government time to submit a political solution. We want to submit a political solution. We have always been for devolution. We have always supported extensive devolution. When the Hon. (Prof.)

G.L. Peiris was a Minister of the Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas Government, he was for a union of regions. Then, when he was with the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, he was for a federal solution and he drafted that. So, you have been always for devolution and I have always been for devolution. So, why do you not bring a set of proposals? During the Presidential Election it was Thirteen Plus and now it is Thirteen Minus. That is the reality. So, when the Leader of the Opposition went to the UN Committee, he never let down the country. He did not try to take political advantage. He said, Give the Government time to submit a political solution". He was found fault for saying that by the members of his own party but he said, Give the Government time.

So, you have not answered the questions asked by the UN Committee. From 2009 up to now, not a single person who had disappeared has been compensated and their loved ones are crying for justice and fair play. So, how are you going to face the UN Committee in March? I do not want to call it, "The Ides of March". I know you will go this time and say that the LLRC Report is out. I know what you will say. You will say, Give us time to investigate". You will say that and I wish you well but the fact of the matter is, the matter is not going to end there. You will get time. But, some day or other in the future, you will have to sit down and answer these accusations, and that time is not far away. Sir, for the sake of the country, we do not want to make the Tamil problem an issue, to win elections.

We want this solved because the United National Party is a party of all communities. It is not like the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. The UNP is a party of Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims. So, we want a solution and we will support the Government for a solution and I hope the Hon. Minister will reply to the queries I have raised. Thank you. [10.16 a.m.] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera - Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare) Hon. Chairman, it is with humility that I address this House on the Votes of the Ministry of External Affairs. I must thank the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella for making my speech easier. Since I am speaking after him, I thought I might have to take some time to reply him. But, his speech has nothing to be replied. So, I can now go on with the speech that I have prepared to make in this House.

The Ministry I head, the Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, was a part of the Ministry of External Affairs, till it became a fully fledged

1975 1976

[ ]

2011 14

Ministry. Last year, we were a part of the Ministry of External Affairs, though now we are not in it. I, myself, am a shishya of the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, Minister of External Affairs. I cut my Minister's teeth, working under him as Deputy Minister of Ethnic Affairs and National Integration. I continue to learn from him.

Though my Ministry is not organically in the Ministry of External Affairs, I consider it a part of it. Foreign employment can only be conducted with the closest association and collaboration of the Ministry of External Affairs. That Ministry provides the overarching framework of policy towards States, within which, foreign employment operates. Therefore, while I was fulfilling my responsibilities in my portfolio, I had plenty of opportunities to reflect on External Affairs.

There are some fundamental realities, we, as a small nation, have to realize. To my mind, these are:-

(1) No one owes us a living. We have to earn our living by hard work and strategic thinking;

(2) We are a small Island. We have to work with countries lying in ever-widening circles. The first requirement is to have membership in each of these circles. If we are not already in any of these circles, we must make every effort to enter and stay in them. It does not require much expertise to close doors, but, it requires skills of a high order, to get them opened;

(3) Having entered these circles, it is paramount that we work with each of the countries in a spirit of friendship following a policy of fellowship and partnership. Within these circles, countries could have differences among themselves, but it is not advisable to get involved in these squabbles in a spirit of partisanship. It will be as disastrous as getting involved in a marital spat between husband and wife. It is a well known fact that in the SAARC region, India and Pakistan have their differences, which had burst into three wars. But, the leadership is to ensure that we, as a small nation, work with each of them, understanding their difficulties.

I have spoken of many "ships" today - membership, friendship, fellowship, partnership and bi-partnership. These are so many "ships" that this House may be excused for thinking that we are debating the Votes of the Ministry of Shipping. No. But, there are undesirable ships in the interstate relations, that of brinkmanship. Brinkmanship maybe practised by large states, like it happened in the Cuban crisis of 1962, where the political acumen of Khrushchev prevented an atomic war. Brinkmanship is certainly not a preferred weapon of choice, for a small Island like Sri Lanka nor is it of showmanship. We had an example of showmanship in the 1980s under the UNP, when they insulted India as a cow and a calf. Sri Lanka paid dearly for this infantile foreign policy abuse.

While following the many "ships" in wise foreign policies for Sri Lanka, she needs to adopt an issue-based response to problems which arise. Sri Lanka has a firm policy of supporting the Palestinian cause, searching for a homeland of her own. Sri Lanka is unwavering in its stance of support, despite the many advantages which would flow, if different policies were followed. Similarly, Sri Lanka is firm in her support to Iran, seeing that she is encircled on all sides by armed enemies, some equipped with atomic weapons and missiles.

We feel Irans pain and sympathize with her. Irrespective of the opposition of powerful antagonists of Iran, we cannot accept the proposition that those who are not with us are against us. We cannot formulate policies to ingratiate ourselves with those who are following inappropriate policies.

Iraq is another case where our policies of support for her were clear. Iraq was invaded, without UN authorization, on the spurious grounds that there were weapons of mass destruction. The only discovery was the existence of weapons of mass deception. The consequence of the Iraq War was, 115,000 dead, an uncountable number injured and a cost of US Dollars 3 trillion to the US Budget. This expenditure was one of the main knock-on causes for the developed countries current financial woes.

The foreign policy challenges faced by Sri Lanka today are of a kind not faced by her earlier. It is a case of how to cope with the disenchantment of entrenched anti-Sri Lankan forces caused by Sri Lankas victorious fight against terrorism. The Ministry of Defence waged a successful war to unite the country. The Ministry of External Affairs has to fight a successful battle to keep it that way. The Ministry of Defence was in war-war; the Ministry of External Affairs is in jaw-jaw. The preferred weapon of the Ministry of Defence was hardware; the preferred weapon of the Ministry of External Affairs is software. For successful governance, both are required.

Has the Ministry of External Affairs been successful? I say, Yes, definitely, yes. It had to jaw-jaw those who continued to run down the only successful attempt to eliminate terrorism in the entire world. On the positive side, it had to work through friendships and partnerships to develop the country. Tangible evidences of the results are seen everywhere. China donated the Arts Centre to be opened tomorrow at a cost of Rs. 3 billion. Japan provided funding for the first ever expressway, the first of many such development projects. South Korea provided the Convention Centre in Hambantota. In 2013, Sir, we will be having the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sri Lanka. Mr. Chairman, you are now the President of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. There was a strong South African delegation here last month. We had Her Excellency Sheikha Lubna bint Khalid bin Sultan Al Qasimi, Minister for Foreign Trade of the United Arab Emirates visiting us last month.

1977 1978

At this very moment, we are having the Qatari Prime Minister in Sri Lanka. The Vietnamese President was here two months ago. There was a European Parliamentary group here just two weeks ago. There was an Australian Parliamentary Delegation here just one month ago. So, everybody is very friendly towards Sri Lanka and that is because of the fact that Sri Lanka has been adopting the right foreign policy.

Problems faced by Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the successful conclusion of the war are unprecedented. The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, his able Deputy Minister, the Hon. Neomal Perera and their team in the Ministry of External Affairs had to work on the diaspora to convince them that there is indeed a new beginning for the Tamil people. I agree that the Tamils had been disenchanted. Changing them requires patient coaxing. We see the first results. In Malaysia, there is a sizeable Malaysian Tamil population, who were originally from Jaffna. They have done well there. The second richest man in Malaysia is of Jaffna Tamil origin. I visited many of their homes recently in Malaysia and their wealth could not be believed. All of them were united in wanting to build Sri Lanka, where many have their uncles still in Jaffna. There are 17 Tamil organizations in Malaysia, Hon. Sampanthan. The High Commission of Sri Lanka in Malaysia, under the guidance of the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, brought these organizations together into one body called the FOMSO. They visited Sri Lanka recently and have spotted a number of investment possibilities. They will be visiting Sri Lanka again on the 19th of this month. All this was due to the patient persuasion of our High Commission in Malaysia under the guidance of our Minister of External Affairs. Just yesterday, His Excellency the President met a business delegation form Qatar, organized by our Ambassador in that country under the guidance, again, of the Hon. Minister of External Affairs. They promised an immediate investment of US Dollars 1 billion and that was just the beginning.

The Ministry of External Affairs is responsible for maintaining the external position of Sri Lanka as much as the Central Bank is responsible for maintaining the external value of he rupee. Both these efforts require policies of finesse and nuance. One policy suitable for one place or State may not be appropriate for another. Policy formulation in the Ministry of External Affairs requires judgment and balance undertaken by an individual with discernment. The needed moment has got the needed person. The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris is an individual with enormous cerebral endowment and of scintillating verbal felicity. Sri Lanka is extremely fortunate indeed to have him as the Head of the Ministry of External Affairs, ably assisted by the Hon. Neomal Perera at this crucial juncture in her history.

Before I conclude, Sir, I want to comment on a few statements made by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella today. In opening the Discussion for the Opposition, what did the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella do today? He not only insulted

our Cricket Captain, but also indirectly put forward what the UNP is wishing for this country. What he said was, "In March, you will have to go before the Human Rights Commission and I know what you would say. You would say, 'We want time'." He further said, "But, that would again not solve the problem". What the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and the UNP want is not to solve the problem. What they want is the problem to go on. What the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and the UNP wanted was exactly what the Canadians wanted regarding the next Commonwealth Conference. It was only one or two countries that did not want the Commonwealth Conference to be held in Sri Lanka, but all the other 54 countries, in one voice, said, Well, we want the Commonwealth Conference to be held in Sri Lanka. It was the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris who said, just last month, in this House that there were 15 countries, the representatives of which got up one by one saying No, the Commonwealth Conference should be held in Sri Lanka. So, it was only one or two countries like Canada, ably supported by people like the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, which did not want the Commonwealth Conference to be held in Sri Lanka, nobody else.

( ) (Hon. Members) Well done, well done!

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) So, that is exactly what he implied in his speech today. I just remember the placards that the UNP Members of Parliament were holding on the day His Excellency the President was presenting the Budget. Those carried the word "shame!" I am telling you, look at your own placards. It is a shame on you to go against your own country.

At last, let me finish, Sir, by saying that the issue the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella raised in this House about T.M Dilshan, the Cricket Captain was wrong. Our Cricket Captain and the cricketers never asked the South African cricketers to support their issue over salaries. Graeme Smith, the South African Cricket Captain, on his own, raised this matter and Dilshan thanked him for raising it, not that Dilshan asked him particularly to support them. So, as usual, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and the UNP are twisting words, not only to their own gain, but also to the gain of their masters who are working against Sri Lanka.

So, I am telling the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella that, before the end of the Discussion, it is his duty to get up in this House and apologize to T.M. Dilshan, our great Cricket Captain for insulting him and our cricketers, who are doing very well in South Africa today.

Thank you, Sir.

[10.29 a.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Chairman. I am happy to partake in this Discussion on the Ministry of External Affairs.

A countrys external policy, Sir, must be in the national interest. I think that is fundamental. It is inevitable that a countrys external policies will be a reflection of its internal policies or its domestic policies in a multiethnic, multilingual, multicultural and pluralistic society such as Sri Lanka is. If a countrys domestic policies are fundamentally flawed, it is inevitable that its foreign policy will be skewed, distorted and consequently based upon expediency rather than on a mature well thought out foreign policy. That would be, Sir, the theme of my speech today.

I wish to begin by examining Sri Lankas present status on the international scene. Never before has Sri Lanka been hounded as is happening today. Defending itself has become its main function. We have antagonized and unfortunately alienated, at least as of now, several liberal democracies who were once our close friends and who had much respect for us. This has happened because of the policies we follow domestically in relation to our own people, all Sri Lankans, whether they be Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims or any other. We advance two arguments to justify the policies we pursue. The first is that we are a sovereign nation. We have an absolute right to do whatever we wish within the territory of our state and no one can question us. The second is that the LTTE has been the villain, continues to be the villain and is solely responsible for all that has happened in Sri Lanka. All our trials and tribulations are attributable solely to the LTTE.

I will deal, Sir, with the second point first, pertaining to the LTTE. The criticism levelled against us by a wide section of the international community - not merely countries, but also by reputed international human rights organizations - is sought to be projected as inspired by the rump of the LTTE within the Tamil diaspora, and therefore unworthy of credence. It is conveniently forgotten that not very long ago, these international human rights organizations, the same organizations, Amnesty International, International Crisis Group, Human Rights Watch, International Commission of Jurists, the University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna) - a domestic organization - were the most virulent critics of the LTTE and its violations of human rights and that such criticism enabled the Sri Lankan Government - the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, the then minister of foreign affairs - to have the LTTE banned, proscribed, in many countries the world over, the USA, India, the UK, Canada, Australia, the European Union and other countries, crippling the LTTEs activities in regard to

fund raising, in regard to the purchase of arms. In fact several of these countries shared vital, extensive intelligence with the Sri Lankan Government in regard to the LTTE, particularly, India. Some of these countries even helped Sri Lanka to fight the war against the LTTE and all of them played a significant role in the ultimate decimation of the LTTE. I do not think that Sri Lanka can, with any sense of responsibility, deny that reality. How on earth can it ever be believed that these very same countries and organizations are today being inspired by the rump of the LTTE within the Tamil diaspora as is claimed by the Sri Lankan Government? The truth is that for whatever reason, today many prominent LTTEers are working in collaboration with and in cahoots with the Sri Lankan Government. This is not something which you can deny. It is true that sections of the Tamil diaspora are active. But can it be believed that these countries and these reputed international organizations are thoughtlessly influenced by the Tamil diaspora? I must say that vast sections of the Tamil diaspora are quite responsible and want the problem in this country to be resolved through dialogue in a peaceful way. Of course there were two fundamental matters on which these countries and organizations were quite specific and in regard to which they continued to be engaged with the Sri Lankan Government. The first was that the Tamil civilians should be protected to the maximum extent possible when military operations were carried out against the LTTE. What would be meant by this is that the attack should not be reckless, should not be indiscriminate and should not be disproportionate given the fact that there were over 300,000 Tamil civilians in this conflict area. This is not to minimize the onerous military responsibilities the Sri Lankan Government undertook, but to emphasize that the rules of law had to be maintained nevertheless. And the second was that the core causes, the core issues of the conflict should be addressed in keeping with the legitimate aspirations of the minority peoples and that there should be a political solution which would be acceptable.

Now, I do not think, Mr. Chairman, adopting a xenophobic attitude, looking upon persons in the international community who express their concerns in regard to the issues I have just outlined as being harmful would do you any good. The international community was not responsible for the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact being signed. The international community was not responsible for the Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact being signed. Those were entered into by national leaders of great stature. But, they were abrogated by you. It is because those Pacts were abrogated that you had to sign the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement subsequently. If you renege on the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement which I think you are preparing to do - I hope not - there will await you some other Agreements which may cause you even more concern than what you say the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement is causing to you at present. Is it not a fact Mr. Chairman, that Sri Lankas foreign policy is skewed, distorted and

1981 1982

based upon expediency? Because in regard to the two issues that I have identified, as the concerns of the international community - on the first the Sri Lankan Government has defaulted and defaulted miserably and if I might say so, on the second dispute, though the LTTE is no longer an impediment and the maximum possible cooperation is being extended from the Tamil side to the Sri Lankan Government and though two and half years have lapsed since the conclusion of the war and though bilateral talks between a Sri Lankan Government delegation and a TNA delegation have taken place for almost one year, the Sri Lankan Government has not delivered in any tangible way. There has only been a process but no substance has been achieved as yet and that is not something about which anyone of us can be happy. I want to assure this House that as far as the TNA is concerned, our contribution will continue to be constructive.

Before I deal with the position taken up by the Sri Lankan Government on the question of sovereignty as a blanket cover for anything it does, I wish to deal with the question of human rights, violation of international human rights laws and international humanitarian laws which clearly is - currently the Achilles heel of the Government. I shall to do so, without going too much into the past. I would start with the period immediately prior to the commencement of the war to set things in proper perspective. I think I need to do this as this is the main reason for the Governments continuing dilemma. I wish to quote what the former Secretary-General of the UN, His Excellency Kofi A. Annan has said in the Foreword to A Compilation of the International Instruments on Human Rights, issued by the United Nations recently.

This is what His Excellency Kofi A. Annan said, I quote:

Human rights are the foundation of human existence and coexistence. They are universal, indivisible and interdependent.

And they lie at the heart of everything the United Nations aspires to achieve in its global mission of peace and development.

He further said,

"Since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the General Assembly in 1948, Governments have discussed, negotiated and agreed upon many hundreds of fundamental principles and legal provisions designed to protect and promote an array of civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights"

Sri Lanka is a signatory and has acceded to several international Covenants and Treaties and has undertaken legal obligations to respect and protect human rights. Sri Lanka is a party to all the Core Human Rights Treaties. Sri Lanka has entered into these Human Rights Treaties on its own accord and is bound to satisfy the obligations these Treaties place upon Sri Lanka. It may well be said

that Sri Lanka has willingly accepted international external scrutiny of the manner in which it conducts domestic affairs, as far as they relate to the subject matter of these treaties which it signed and acceded to.

I wish to refer Sir, at this point to certain salient factors to demonstrate the true situation in regard to human rights in Sri Lanka. A Commission of Inquiry was established in November 2006 to investigate sixteen serious identified violations of human rights. One, pertained to the murder of five Tamil students in Trincomalee. Another, pertained to the murder of 17 aid workers in Muttur all Tamil speaking; 16 Tamils and One Muslim. Yet another pertained to the killing of some Muslim youth in the Ampara District. And yet another pertained to the killing of Sinhala civilians in the course of an attack at Kebithigollewa in the Anuradhapura District.

An International Independent Group of Eminent Persons comprising of 11 eminent persons from different parts of the world, the Chairman of which was former Chief Justice of India, Mr. Bhagawathi was appointed to oversee the working of the Commission and to ensure that the Commission performed its functions pertaining to investigations into human rights violations in keeping with international norms and standards. After functioning for some time the IIGEP decided to terminate its mandate. I will not go into all the reasons that they mentioned for wanting to terminate the mandate. It is a long list of reasons that they gave. I will refer from the public statement they made to their ultimate conclusion after they had outlined the several reasons for coming to the conclusion and this is what they stated. This confirms the IIGEP's apprehension regarding the absence of political will and the institutional inability of Sri Lanka to conduct human rights inquires in accordance with international norms and standards.

Having outlined several reasons that is the ultimate reason they gave for terminating their mandate. I must also mention at this point of time that a Witness' Protection Bill was brought to Parliament. The Second Reading had taken place but for some mysterious reason that Witness Protection Bill was abandoned. When the IIGEP was functioning in Sri Lanka, I think the question had also been raised with them in regard to the need for the Government to take extreme measures pertaining to activities by armed groups and what the impact of such action could be on human rights.

In the course of the public statement the IIGEP made when they terminated their mandate and before their departure from this country, this is what they stated. I quote:

All Members of the IIGEP are keenly aware of the security situation presently prevailing in Sri Lanka. The Government is faced with an insurgency in which the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) conduct their hostilities through ruthless methods, not sparing

1983 1984

2011 14

the civilian population. Sections of popular opinion suggest that human rights and respect for the rule of law should take second place to measures necessary to repel these hostilities. The IIEGP rejects this opinion. There is no conflict or incompatibility between the successful conduct of military and security operations on the one hand, and respect for the rights of citizens on the other. Indeed it should be emphasized that respect for human rights, and the conduct of military operations in strict accordance with international humanitarian law, are powerful weapons in the struggle against dissident forces and terrorism in that they help to earn the trust and support of the civilian population. Moreover, they are essential to morale and promote a culture of professionalism and self-respect within the police and armed forces.

To the extent that emergency conditions may require special state measures derogating from certain peacetime rights, these must be publicly announced, enacted in law, and justified in terms of necessity and proportionality. Summary executions, massacres, disappearances, wanton destruction of property, and forcible transfers of populations can never be justified. No efforts should be spared to uncover responsibility, including recognition of command responsibility, for such actions. The IIGEP has, however, found an absence of will on the part of the Government of Sri Lanka in the present Inquiry to investigate cases with vigour, where the conduct of its own forces has been called into question.

Sir, you see this statement was made by the IIGEP before the final stages of the war, in 2008. But, the IIEGP has referred to the very acts, which today constitute the violations of international humanitarian law amounting to war crimes - the indiscriminate killing of people; the forcible transfer of populations; the destruction of property - and the IIGEP had expressed its opinion, its well-considered opinion in regard to what would happen if the war was conducted in a reckless, indiscriminate and disproportionate way.

The Commission of Inquiry did investigate the violations of human rights pertaining to the five students and the 17 aid workers in Mutur. One of the features was that suddenly the evidence being recorded through teleconferencing was stopped by the Commission of Inquiry. There were witnesses who had gone abroad because they had no protection, they were not in the country, they were not able to testify and their evidence were being recorded through teleconferencing, but suddenly that was stopped. The report of that Commission in regard to the inquiry they conducted if it was ever submitted was not made public. Everything came to an end in a mysterious way. Not merely was the violation of Human Rights with impunity, a continuing phenomenon - a domestic process commenced with much fanfare, even with a measure of international involvement died, I might say, was in fact killed. Would it be reasonable in these circumstances, in this background, to place any faith whatever in any domestic process? Can any reasonable human being be expected to place any faith in any domestic process in the context of what happened to this Commission of Inquiry which functioned under international supervision? Are these not the questions that the international community is raising? Are these not the questions being posed to the Sri Lankan Government on the basis of what is happening in Sri Lanka?

The two UN High Commissioners for Human Rights in recent times - the first one was Madam Louise Arbour,

a retired judge of the Supreme Court of Canada and the present one is Madam Navaneetham Pillay, a retired judge of Supreme Court of South Africa - have consistently passed strictures on the Sri Lankan Government in regard to its conduct on Human Rights. Madam Louise Arbour came to Sri Lanka some years ago. She made a public statement to the effect that the human rights situation in Sri Lanka had become so deeply ingrained with the culture of impunity that strong measures were required to eradicate that culture of impunity and she wanted to set up a UN presence in Sri Lanka to monitor human rights. The Human Rights Commission by virtue of its miserable performance had been degraded to status B from status A and in the international body of Human Rights Commissions, it had only observer status. But, the request by Madam Louise Arbour that there be an international presence of the UN in Sri Lanka was rejected. If that had been accepted, all the troubles you are facing now may not have occurred, you may have been advised to avert them and you may have yet fought the LTTE successfully without committing all the human rights violations. Madam Navaneetham Pillai has passed several strictures with regard to Sri Lanka even at the time the war was being conducted - I will not quote here because of the lack of time. Frequently she has made statements in regard to the various violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law that was being committed by you while the war was being prosecuted. Can we honestly say that they were not justified in saying what they said?

The war was fought and we know what happened during the war - I will not talk at great length about it. It was said to be a war without witnesses. Nobody wants to seek revenge. I want to make that perfectly clear, but the truth must be ascertained. It was a war without witnesses, that does not appear to be quite so now. There are questions being raised by the international community. - [Interruption.] You had a duty to comply with the obligations that you had undertaken under International Treaties and Covenants which you had signed and which you had acceded too. You have defaulted in complying with those obligations which you undertook to conform with. That is the problem that you are facing. You are unable to answer the queries for the simple reason that you have agreed to conform to your obligations and you have not, quite clearly, conformed to them. The UN Secretary General came to Sri Lanka some days after the war was over. There was a joint communiqu issued by His Excellency the President and the UN Secretary General. There was an Expert Panel appointed comprising of three persons of international repute, one of them was in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa.

The other was a retired Attorney-General of Indonesia whom you had chosen to put on your International Independent Group of Eminent Persons. He was the second person appointed by the President to the IIGEP

1985 1986

and the third was a reputed lawyer and also an advisor to the UN. They published a Report in April this year. They said that there were credible allegations of violations of international humanitarian laws and international human rights laws amounting to war crimes and that there was a need for both a domestic and an international investigation into that question. You paid no heed to their Report; you never engaged with them with regard to their Report; you never dealt with any matter in that Report. You merely attacked the personnel who constituted the Commission of Inquiry. There was a meaningless reaction on your part; there was no rational reaction on your part. I think Sri Lankas interest- [Interruption.] Please do not disturb me. I beg of you to please sit down. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Azwer, please do not disturb. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, my time should not be taken. I am running short of time.- [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The soldiers were maimed. Hon. Sampanthan, you must be fair.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, please - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, this time - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Chairman) Please do not disturb. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, with great respect - [Interruption.] Sir, I will not let that time be taken from mine. It has to be taken from the Government side.

So, this is the position. I think a great harm - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Azwer, you can reply to him later.- [Interruption.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake - Deputy Minister of Health) See, what had happened in Kebithigollewa. Innocent people were killed.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, I think great harm has been done to Sri Lanka by the way in which the Sri Lankan Government dealt with the Report of the Expert Panel appointed by the UN Secretary-General. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) .[ ]

( ) (The Chairman) . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Now, we have the LLRC Report - Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission Report - submitted by the LLRC appointed by the Government of Sri Lanka. It is the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission Report. The lessons must be learnt on the basis of the truth being ascertained. There can be reconciliation, there can be genuine reconciliation only if the truth is ascertained. I will not speak about the LLRC Report. I read in the newspapers that His Excellency the President will present the report in Parliament and he will make his own comments about that Report and explain that report to the country. I think in deference to His Excellency the President it is my duty not to speak about that report right now, though we have been observing all that has been going on, and above all we have our own opinions in regard to various aspects of that whole issue, and the whole process. I will not comment on it now. I will only say that whether it be lessons learnt or whether it be genuine reconciliation, the fundamental requirement is that the truth must be ascertained and lessons must be learnt and there can be genuine reconciliation only on the basis of the truth being ascertained.

Now, Sir, I move on to the question of sovereignty which I said I would deal with a little later. Sovereignty has been defined in our Constitution under Article 3. It

1987 1988

[ . ]

2011 14

states, In the Republic of Sri Lanka sovereignty is in the people and is inalienable. It is in the people not in the Government and it is inalienable. It further states, Sovereignty includes the powers of government, fundamental rights and the franchise. If you do not observe fundamental rights and if you do not respect franchise and you do not accept the sovereignty vested in all the people and which is inalienable you yourself are eroding the sovereignty which you claim to preserve and protect. Sir, I will during the discussion of sovereignty and its implications like to read to you and to the House certain paragraphs from the Eighth Memorial Lecture on the death of the Hon. (Dr.) Neelan Tiruchelvam delivered by Mr. Gareth Evans, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia and subsequently the President of the International Crisis Group. Sir, this is what he said in the course of the lecture on the issue of sovereignty. It sates, I quote:

|This leads directly into my subject tonight: the limits of state sovereignty and the proper role of the international community in responding to catastrophic human rights violations - genocide and other mass killing, large scale ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity - occurring within the boundaries of a single country. There is a widespread concern that involvement of countries in the affairs of others, and in particular the involvement of developed countries in the internal affairs of developing ones, has not always been principled or consistent in the past. It is an article of faith around a good deal of the global South that Article 2(7) of the UN Charter is to be read as an all-embracing prohibition when it says that Nothing should authorize intervention in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Sampanthan, you have taken 40 minutes now. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, I have got 45 minutes because it was agreed that the balance five minutes will be given to me. .So, I will most respectfully ask you to give me that time. Sir, I will finish.

It goes on to say, I quote:

"It is understandable that sovereignty should be a very sensitive subject indeed with the many states who gained independence during the decolonization era - states in all cases proud of their new identity, in many cases conscious of their fragility, and generally inclined to see the non-intervention norm as one of their few defences against threats and pressures from more powerful international actors seeking to promote their own economic and political interests."

The point is - They went on saying like that. The matter was discussed. Then on question of the responsibility to protect, what is popularly called R2P, there were certain reports submitted: one by the Secretary General and one by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty called the ICISS and based on the reports the biggest conceptual contribution of the Commission was, that it identified matters that needed to be addressed.

Eventually, Sir, there was a resolution passed, with more than 150 members voting in its favour where R2P was adopted, the responsibility to protect, the right of the international community to intervene in situations when the local state itself has failed in its responsibility to protect its citizens was recognized. In other words, the first duty is on the part of the local state, the country concerned to protect its citizens.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, now you have finished the second three minutes also.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) If that is not done then the duty is cast upon the international community, and the international community, must perform their obligations. That in fact, Sir, was the decision arrived at.

I will finish my reading. Now, it is in the last paragraph Sir.

It further states, I quote:

"The short point, which cannot be repeated too often, is that R2P is not about protecting everybody from everything. It is about protecting men, women and children from large-scale killing, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity - either occurring now, or imminently feared likely to occur, or readily capable of so occurring if a situation deteriorates through want of effective preventive action."

- [Interruption.]I thank you Sir. But, Sir, I think we must in this House bring an end to this buffoonery. I can call it nothing but downright buffoonery when elderly people stand up in this Parliament and disturb people who are speaking and one who is on his feet. You should name such Members and you can remove them from the House.

( ) (The Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. DEW Gunasekara. You have 12 minutes. [ ] . .[ ] , . [ ]

[11.27 a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me time to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of External Affairs. It is a very important Ministry that reflects international perspectives of the country and is in the hands of the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris.

Today, the country is looking at how the world reacts to Sri Lankas actions. I am happy to follow the Hon. DEW Gunasekara but I am sad to hear a Communist Member speaking of foreign policy as if he is in the 1970s, even before the Great Wall was demolished. He says that foreign affairs is in the hands of two or three countries. Either he is having amnesia of convenience or he does not keep abreast of todays world conditions. He talks of BRIC as the new world order. He forgets that the US plays a pivotal role. He forgets that the EU has 27 members and is expanding. He forgets that Japan is the biggest donor. He forgets that Sri Lanka is located next to India and he also tries to circumvent political realities when it comes to the question of international treaties. Shouting in Parliament does not make the international community fear. We need to reflect matters that are brought to our attention, give a direct answer as to why we rebut them rather than making a big noise just to score points and protect your Ministry from the next Cabinet reshuffle.

Hon. Minister, you have a difficult task on your hands and you have an able Deputy Minister. Your original base is the United National Party, which as you all know, has the finesse in running governments. It is not our intention, just because we are from the Opposition, to take to task

1993 1994

matters that are of great importance, to the country. This is not your country; this is not my country; this is our country. So, do not for a moment think, since the power has been bestowed on you, to run the way you would like and castigate the Opposition just because we are opposing you today. Remember, we have a right, as well as you, to protect our motherland and take it to a better tomorrow.

We call upon you, Hon. Minister, to tell us the policy of the Government. At the end of the day, your foreign policy should be, to be a friend with all and enemy with none. But, you seem to be having a hallmark; you take our best friends just because they say that you are doing something wrong, as enemies and make friends out of enemies.

At this particular moment, the world is going through a turmoil, a turbulence. Many countries are faced with economic dereliction. If we, little Sri Lanka, think that we are insulated against these problems, that is the biggest mistake that we make. You cannot alienate external affairs from economic activities. Today, in the European Union, the United Kingdom is taking a strategic decision to move out of the euro agreement simply because they want to protect their financial interest. They are resorting to this task forgetting about external dimensions on that and David Cameron had numerous difficulties in doing so. So, do you think that we can fight with the European Union against their decision?

We are asking you, Hon. Minister, if the Ministry of External Affairs has been protecting this country, why have we been isolated from the world community? Look at the last attempt that you all made in St. Kitts to be the host for the 2018 Commonwealth Games. You boasted that you have 40 countries who basically supported you in the Non-Aligned Movement. Hon. Minister, 70 countries had voted and if 40 of them were in your favour, why did you get only 27 votes? Just because it is the Commonwealth Games, it does not mean that the External Affairs Ministry has no hand in that. Your job is to ensure that the foreign community is with Sri Lanka at every given moment. I am telling this to you because you are the External Affairs Minister. If you had been the Minister of Sports, I would have told you about going to St. Kitts and losing the vote. So, Hon. Minister, you have got to carry the bad brief of the Government. When you project our county, at every given moment you must ensure that every attempt that you are making is for soliciting assistance for us. That must be there. You got 27 votes out of 70 and that means 43 were against you. If you are so popular as you say, then you must get the opportunity to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

Look at the Labour GSP. The European Union told you, "Please ensure that you implement the Constitution". You are trying to show as if the Opposition is trying to take you to task. Breaching of human rights becomes an

absolute disgrace for the country. If you say, "No", please get up and defend that. Look at Sarath Fonseka who won the war for us and eradicated terrorism. He is today in jail and the very people who exploded bombs are Ministers in your Government. What about KP who was caught in Malaysia and brought as a fugitive here? He is not even on bail. Then, look at what happened to Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra, who was a close confidant of the President.

Today, he is not living with us. What action has been taken against the suspects? Is that the human rights that your Government is trying to show the world? Do not try to bluff the world. You can fool some of the people all the time and all the people some of the time but Hon. Minister, you cannot fool all of the people all the time. You are a competent Minister and you have a competent Deputy Minister but you have an incompetent Government. So, that bad brief has to be defended by you. We, as Opposition Members in Parliament, need to expose these type of things. When it comes to Labour GSP, we told you that if you had basically protected the Constitution, none of these problems would have happened. When something has been done against you, no amount of effort taken for remedial action would help to overcome the problems created. If you did not amend the Seventeenth Amendment through the Eighteenth Amendment, half the problems would not have been there. If you allow the normal course of action to be taken instead of bringing your police and your private security company, none of these problems would have been there. If you had given democratic rights to labour unions instead of upsetting them, none of these problems would have been there. If you basically upheld the International Treaties and Covenants that you are basically supposed to accept as a dignified country, you would not have had the problems that are there. You are just trying to show that you are trying to talk of the Tamil problem but do nothing to them. The Tamils are an integral part in our country. The social fabric of our country is enriched by the Tamils and Muslims and the Sinhalese are there to support that. Do not take them in a piecemeal fashion. You take them when required and then shove them into a corner. Do not try to bring committees into this House just to appease the Geneva Convention, which is to be held in March. Ensure that you walk the talk. It is not that you have got to take action to address the Geneva Convention in March. How many people who should be in jail are not in jail? How many people who should be out of jail are in jail? That is what is happening. I mentioned KP. Why is he given protection when he should be in jail? Where are the 19 ships that you were talking of? Where are the billions of rupees that have got to be taken? Ensure that you confiscate them. Instead of taking over underutilized assets, take these monies and ensure that you use it to develop Sri Lanka. The Minister of External Affairs is silent on that. You have to take action and when you do not, the international community looks at us and says, "why are they giving special treatment to these barbaric people?"

Hon. Minister, look at the Millennium Development Goals Fund. When you and I were Ministers, we managed to get this. Now, to the Millennium Development Goals Fund, you say that there are no human rights violations. But, there are certain areas where you have got to ensure that communication activities are not hindered. Websites are being blocked. When there is something against the Government in websites, then those websites are blocked. But, what about the other things that are going on? When there is something against the Opposition, then nothing happens. So, Hon. Minister, you must be able to take criticism in its proper spirit. It is not that we are opposing for the sake of opposing. But, when there is a matter of integral importance, we will stand and fight against it however much the odds are against us. But, we have got to defend Mother Lanka and we will do that without any fear or favour. That is what we expect from you.

Hon. Minister, we lost the Commonwealth Games. I am just recalling from memory. We lost the opportunity to represent the ICG where we were a member amongst 23 Member States. Why is this happening?

( ) (The Chairman) , . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , 13 . . - ( ) (The Chairman) 80 . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I was talking of the Millennium Development Goals that we have missed out and of the websites that you are blocking.

Look at what happened to your friend and my friend Mr. Lasantha Wickrematunga? No action has been taken so far. What happened to Prageeth Ekneligoda? You are basically politicizing issues. These people are dead and gone; nobody speaks of them. You are going to have the Geneva Convention in March. Then, you suddenly call the TNA for talks. Remember, the UNP also plays a pivotal role in finding a solution to the ethnic problem. We are not going to be passive Members expecting you all to put horse deals and be silently supporting. We will never obstruct any prospective development activity between the Government and the Tamil community. But, remember, the United National Party has a pivotal role to play in that and we will ensure that that basically

integrates the Sinhalese, the Tamils and the Muslims and brings them under one umbrella. That is what the Right Honourable D.S. Senanayake thought of when we got Independence.

So, please ensure that you quicken these things. Do not address these issues just to Geneva because of human rights there. Do not try to wave around Mr. Sarath Fonseka and say, yes, we are releasing him in February or in April. Ensure that you take it in the correct perspective. Can you bring KP into custody and then release Mr. Sarath Fonseka? Can you do the same thing to Pillayan who exploded a bomb outside the Dalada Maligawa or to Karuna Amman who gave leadership to that and who is now a Minister in your Government? If you can pardon them, why can you not pardon Mr. Sarath Fonseka? Your Minister, the Hon. Rauf Hakeem, is telling the family members of Mr. Sarath Fonseka, "Get him to ask a pardon". What fault has Mr. Sarath Fonseka done to ask a pardon? The Minister, Hon. Chandrasiri Gajadeera, is saying that Mr. Sarath Fonseka is getting proper food. He gets the same food that the other prisoners get. The international community is looking at you and asking why a special treatment is given to some guys who have basically been robbing the country and exploding bombs and not to people who protected democracy with love for the country. Hon. Minister, I do not want to take much time. Ensure that we treat India, our closest neighbour, with respect. They have always been talking of a settlement brought in to the vexed problem, which is the ethnic issue. Ethnic issue does not apply to Tamils only. The Muslims are there and the Sinhalese are there. It is not just saying, take this or not. Everybody wants an honourable way of living. Do not try to impose something just to show the world that you are talking with them. Ensure that that comes through your heart. Do not force them. That is what the Tamils are asking; that is what the Muslims are asking and that is what we, as the UNP, are watching at. There are going to be four more meetings before the end of the year. Do not think you can try to basically convince one aspect. There are other aspects also. We are not going to be silently watching you all fooling the world. What we want is a genuine attempt to solve this problem, once and for all. Do it in a depoliticized manner. When Tony Blair solved the problem in Ireland, he did not castigate the Opposition or try to take undue advantage from them. He said, The Opposition helped us; the Government is supporting that; let us put something which is behind us and talk of the unborn future. That is what is expected of you all. Every Minister who gets up in the House talks of His Excellency the President. No Minister can talk without Mahinda Rajapaksas name being mentioned.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You cannot talk about Ranil Wickremasinghe. What can we do?

1997 1998

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, can I just have an extra minute? ( ) (The Chairman) I have already given you three extra minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you very much, Sir. - [Interruption.] Look at the spirit in which the Hon. Speaker works, not like the jackasses

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

who are there.

( ) (The Chairman) I have already given you three minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I said that because I want to mention your dignified manner. You, one of Presidents brothers, take the command in this House. Look at the Ministers. They cannot speak without saying, .Every word has to be vomited from that. Even the President does not want such obsequiousness going on. All he says is, tell what is good for the country. The people who are obsequious only try to ridicule the Government, instead of trying to take it forward. That is not what is expected. If you listened to the speech made by the President on the 4th of February, he said, please ensure that you have constructive criticism". Do not just sing hosannas for dinner. That is what he says. Listen to what he says, instead of just getting up and trying to be another jack-of-all-trades.

So, Hon. Minister of External Affairs, all I want to say is that there should be no interference in the Foreign Service. There are career diplomats. The 65 : 35 ratio has now been turned to 60 : 40 due to politicization. Ensure that you bring the career diplomats so that they will have a better tomorrow.

You paid US Dollars 3.2 million to Bell Pottinger.You are denying that they made the statement for the President. They officially came here. I have here with me the coloured document they produced, which consists of

48 pages. They have given you the way forward. They have said how to engage the Opposition. The Ministry of External Affairs was asked to write the speech to the United Nations. I was informed that you were also asked to write the speech and Bell Pottinger was also asked to write. Out of the three, they selected that. Are they denying it? They have got the slides to show that they did everything. So, we are not opposing that. It is the right of the President if he feels that a foreigner can do it better than a local. But, why are you basically saying, . Ministry of External Affairs . , ; . .

( ) (The Chairman) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . When I asked a question from the Hon. Neomal Perera, he said that the Ministry of External Affairs did not basically pay US Dollars 3.2 million. Yes, it was paid by the Presidential Secretariat and the Agreement was with Mr. Lalith Weeratunga. But, in the process, what happened? There were certain figures that were reduced and put on to the Central Bank, when they went on the Commonwealth bid. What a mess it has made. These are tax payers money. You have paid US Dollars 3.2 million and kicked them out. But, the same plan is being put into action by incompetent and inept people. So, this is why you, as the Minister of External Affairs, get the flak of it. When you are outsourcing, please ensure that they do what is good for the country. Take competent people; there are enough of competent people. Take the Opposition into confidence. Do not only target human right activities in Geneva. We are there to defend you. But, give us an opportunity to ensure that we defend Mother Lanka.

Thank you.

[11.43 a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Hon. Chairman, it is a great pleasure for me to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of External Affairs and to work with the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, the Minister.

When the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake was speaking on the Votes of this Ministry, he talked about getting the services of foreigners. I would like to remind him that there was a foreigner advising the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the then Prime Minister who was heading the Cabinet, and do you know what happened at that time. - [Interruption.] I do not want to go into details. There was a foreigner sitting in the Cabinet, which did not happen earlier in Sri Lanka. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and the Hon. R. Sampanthan were talking about the diaspora. So, I do not want to talk about it. The Hon. DEW Gunasekara replied to it promptly and the Hon. Dilan Perera replied to the statements made by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella.

We talk about His Excellency the President because we are going with the policies of the "Mahinda Chintana."

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Chairman, before I proceed on to the speech that I had in mind, I would like to start by giving a reply to the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake who spoke a little while ago, and referred to the fact that most of the Government Members speak about His Excellency the President. Of course, we speak about our President. We speak about our President because we are proud of him. We are proud of what he has done for this country; we are proud of him for eradicating terrorism from this country; we are proud of the development that he has brought about for this country and we are extremely proud of where he has placed Sri Lanka in the world map today. That is why - Hon. Ravi Karunanayake before you leave the Chamber - I would like to say that we are very proud of him and we would continue to mention about His Excellency's achievements.

Hon. Chairman, I was listening to the speech given by the Hon. R. Sampanthan, whom I respect a lot as a very

2003 2004

[ ]

2011 14

senior statesman and a senior politician in this House. But, I am saddened to see one aspect: the Hon. R. Sampanthan is walking a very tightrope. My perception, Hon. R. Sampanthan, of where you are, is between the Government and the diaspora.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) This was started from the - ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, if you would be kind enough to sit and wait, you can listen.

Therefore, Hon. Chairman, I am sorry to say that the Hon. R. Sampanthan is bound to fall from the tightrope that he is walking because he must understand the compulsions of the people of Sri Lanka. Hon. Sampanthan, the speech that you made in this House today, was not on behalf of the Tamil community of this country. In my mind, it was on behalf of the international community, whomever you represent.

Let us look at the history of foreign affairs in Sri Lanka, a short history. From the time of the late Mr. J.R. Jayewardene, we have followed a policy more tilted towards the West, or may I say, an absolute tilt to the West. We slighted India; we forgot about the rest of the region and we forgot that we need specific relationships with regions in the world. Today, with globalization coming into play and the world being complexed, we have to identify which regions we are going to have a strong relationship with.

When we look at the immediate past, during the Government of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, when he was the Prime Minister, we saw how a foreign nation came and got involved in the domestic issues of our country and how that country, Norway, basically succeeded in connivance and in cahoots with the United National Party in territorially disintegrating this country and in geographically parting this country through a Ceasefire Agreement.

Hon. Chairman, I remember when His Excellency the President met the Right Honourable Tony Blair at Chequers, there was one thing that the Hon. Tony Blair stated to us. That is, Sri Lanka has done two fundamental mistakes: one is getting a third country involved in solving a domestic problem and the other is the fact of geographically segregating the country. I can see the Hon. Sumanthiran nodding his head and smiling at me. I am sure you agree with what I have said. Irrespectively, the Hon. Sampanthan also mentioned that there is an intensified approach from the Government in terms of fighting for our rights. Of course we do have. Ask yourself why we have that situation. A lot of Members of

the Opposition in this House have forgotten the fact how all these started. It was none other than Sarath Fonseka who brought up the White Flag issue, for which he has been sentenced by a court of law. That was the commencement of all this, followed by the Darusman Report. The Hon. Sampanthan, very ably and amply demonstrated facts about the Darusman Report.

Sir, let me remind you of one thing. In Chapter 52 of the Darusman Report, it very clearly states that they have taken upon evidence and information from around 4,000 people; that they do not want to divulge the names and the details that they have found and that they have no capacity to verify whether they are true or not. But, at the same time they go on to say, Sir, that Sri Lanka should be crucified; that accountability should be enshrined; that the Sri Lankan President must be taken to task. On what? Hon. Sampanthan, you being a leading lawyer and a statesman - [Interruption.] when you read it you can find it out for yourself - you must understand that law of evidence applies to these things. How can we crucify or hold someone accountable when what they are accusing of is not available? That has to be made available in the first place.

Following on - [Interruption.] Hon. Sampanthan, may I please have my time? I did not disturb you one second. Thank you very much - there is a road map of the LTTE or what is left of the LTTE. This road map still exists, and it is stronger than ever before. I would also have to say, quite shamefully, that there are certain Sri Lankan individuals who travel to particular countries, particular institutions, propagate and instigate matters against the State of Sri Lanka. Taking into consideration the global situation that exists today, the Middle-East is in turmoil, Libya and Syria are in a crisis situation, Pakistan and USA are having new issues now, to the extent that US drones went and shot 24 Pakistani military officials. Certain countries in Europe are going through an era of decadence. I may recall, Mr. Chairman, what the French President Nicolas Sarkozy told the Prime Minster of Great Britain, Right Honourable David Cameron, last week. He said, Please allow us to mind our own affairs. You do not have to tell us what we need to do. We know what to do. Please mind your own affairs in Britain and we will mind our own affairs in France.

That is exactly what we have been saying Mr. Chairman. That is what the learned TNA Members on that side cannot understand. We have the right to find solutions to our own affairs. You do not have to go and subscribe to the ICC or the Amnesty International. The United Nations Human Rights Commissioner is not the President of Sri Lanka; he is not the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka; he is not the Leader of the Opposition of Sri Lanka or the Leader of the TNA. She has a right to do her job, true enough. But, we are a sovereign nation. When it comes to protecting our sovereignty and territorial integrity, I think you and I both agree on that fundamentally. That is what has to be practised. If what is

2005 2006

preached is put into practice, we can solve this problem without any issue.

Moving on, Mr. Chairman, look at Sri Lankas foreign policy in todays context. We follow our foreign policy based on non-aligned principles. Today, we have an excellent relationship with all the regions. If you take the SAARC region, the ASEAN region - which was neglected by us - the Middle-East, the Latin American countries, Eastern Europe, today His Excellency the President and the Minster of External Affairs, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, have been in a position to bring back Sri Lanka into the map. If you look at the past five or six years of our governance, more than 380 dignitaries have visited this country. Our interactions with those countries have increased. The economic aid that we have got has increased. All this is because we respect the other countries as it should respect us. Every country should respect Sri Lankas territorial integrity. Every country should respect Sri Lankas sovereignty and we shall reciprocate that. But, we will not permit our sovereignty and our territorial integrity to be undermined or we shall not compromise that at whatever extent. That is the reason why the majority of people of this country has voted us for power. Thank you.

( ) (The Chairman) The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, please. You have 25 minutes.

The best way to create a good atmosphere, or a working environment, is to pay the players. Every penny they are owed, get them paid. If Sri Lankan cricket wants to move forward, positively, and in

harmony with the players, then youve got to make sure players are paid on the dot.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, your time is over. Please wind up.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) . Sir Colin Cowdrey lecture . - . . , .- He stated in that lecture, I quote:

to consolidate and perpetuate their power, they open their doors to of the administration to partisan cronies that would lead to corruption wanton waste of Cricket Board finances and resources.

.. .

I quote:

For a country to progress, in sports and in all other fields, we need more and more free thinkers. After all; Sangas speech has enough and more for the young and incorrupt to learn and improve their thinking - because he 'spoke'.

Free speech is a core principle in a democracy, which we have unfortunately failed to protect up to its expectations in recent times. The speech is the seed for thinking and change that this country needs to re-establish even the right to speak. It is a basic tool to fight corruption and establish good governance."

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I will wind up.

Finally, he went on to state, I quote:

It is now for others to speak up to make it a signal for the masses to achieve shared fashion of democracy, even at great personal risks. By this, the country can think of a collective joy and ambition - a representative society and true democracy.

I thank you.

, .. . . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, I am very happy to take part in this Adjournment Motion. It is a well-thought Adjournment Motion moved by our Friend, the Hon. Y.G. Padmasiri. Sir, the project to develop 1,000 secondary schools is very much commendable. This is to be implemented by the Ministry of Education. This makes way for a great revolution in the field of education in Sri Lanka. Developing 5,000 primary schools concurrent to the aforesaid programme is also very much welcome and appreciated by all educationists in this country.

We, in this House, request the Hon. Minister of Child Development and Womens Affairs to pay attention to develop two preschools as model preschools. That is what the Hon.Y.G. Padmasiri wants. He wants pre-childhood development centres for each primary school in the proximity of the proposed 5,000 primary schools, to train preschool teachers in keeping with the new education plan and to provide basic physical resources required by those schools with a view to making this noble task more successful.

The other day, there was a conference convened at the All-Ceylon YMMA in Dematagoda, by the All-Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference, which is the oldest educational organization in this country. This was founded by the late S.L.M. Shafie Marikkar, who was the Principal of Zahira College at that time. When he started this organization, he was the Chairman of the Executive Council of the All-Ceylon Muslim League.

Sir, forms have been filled by 67 Muslim schools regarding the development of 1,000 secondary schools and they like to fall in line with it and be involved with it. I think these 67 Muslim schools will be taken in 2012, and 700 of the 1,000 schools will be absorbed into this system. The rest will be absorbed in 2013. All the Muslim schools and principals have given their full approval for this system. The Conference was chaired by Dr. Hussain Ismail, and our well-known educationist Mr. S.H.M. Jameel made a very comprehensive speech detailing what the school principals should do. There is some reservation in the minds of people because certain principals think that the identity of the Muslim schools will be lost after the formation of these 1,000 secondary schools. The development of these 1,000 secondary schools is a well-planned programme initiated by the Hon. Minister of Education at the instance of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Even in the "Mahinda Chintana", it is stated in detail that a proper place must be given to women and children. I am very happy that such a talented and capable Minister like the Hon. Tissa Karalliyadde, who hails from the backwoods of Medawachchiya - which was represented for about 43 years consecutively by the great leader of Rajarata, the late Hon. Maithripala Senanayake, a kinsman of him - is in charge of the portfolio of Child Development and Womens Affairs. The attention he is paying towards empowerment and welfare of women and childcare development in this country, is appreciable. So, it is in that spirit that my Friend, the Hon. Y.G. Padmasiri has moved this Adjournment Motion today because we have to start everything from the cradle.

Mr. Presiding Member, you were a judge, an ambassador and also a governor and today you represent this House as a distinguished Member of Parliament. So, I am very happy to see you chairing the House today. As you know, the Muslims have a system of religious schools called Madrasas. Children of 3 to 6 years are sent to Madrasas, which functions by the side of each Mosque. By this, they will be able to have a basic knowledge of the Al-Quran. Similarly, I would like to recommend that system, Sir, even to the Buddhists and Hindus because if children are sent to such religious schools, when they reach the age of 5 or 6 years, they will be able to have a basic knowledge of their religion. In the case of Buddhists, they can teach their children the Dhamma. The Buddhist Theosophical Society that was started by Colonel Henry Steele Olcott had a plan. I do not know what happened to that system over the years. Only the Daham Pasal system still exists. There is also the Muslim Daham Pasals called Ahadiya schools and so are the Hindu religious schools that function at their own denominational centres. So, if a child is sent to such a school and when the child attains the said age, he or she will be fully conversant with his or her religious background and they will also learn what is right and what is wrong. So, that is a very good system. I would like to recommend that system even to other religions. Even the educationists have recommended that system. This is what the Hon. Member says in his Adjournment Motion. We must also have the preschools which fall in line, as I said earlier, with the former Madrasas system. If we can have such a system, when the children reach the age of three or five years, they will be able to finish half or the full of the Holy Quran and they will have a knowledge of Arabic too.

Mr. A.M.A. Azeez, one of the greatest educationists, a Senator and the former principal of Zahira College, a distinguished personality who came from Jaffna was very much interested in the Madrasas type of schools. He was instrumental in propagating the teaching of Arabic and Tamil languages in the country. In that manner, we can form one nation.

We saw in the morning how the Hon. Sampanthan completely assailed aside from the mainstream. I think he

2133 2134

spoke in the morning on behalf of the Tamil diaspora. The script of his speech would have been sent all over the world by now. But, we are a self-respecting nation. We owe obedience to this country and we are truly loyal to this country, "" - Sri Lanka - "Sailan". ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Azwer, please try to wind up your speech now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay, Sir. Therefore, I would only say that the implementation modalities of the 1,000 schools must be explained to the Muslim teachers. It has already been done by the All-Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference to allay their fears, if they have any. The identities of the Muslim schools must also be preserved because there are religiously important days like in the month of Ramadan when Muslim schools are closed and it is compulsory for male Muslim students to attend the Friday prayers.

So,when the fears are allayed everybody, will fall in line with it. When certain steps were taken by Dr. Alhaj Badi-uddin Mahmud, who is hailed today as one of the greatest Education Ministers of this country, people had fears. They did not fall in line with his thinking But, today he is a great man hailed throughout by all the communities. So, I commend the Adjournment Motion that is moved before the House by the Hon.Y.G. Padmasiri and I thank him very much on behalf of the Muslim community as well as all religious communities.

Thank you very much.
