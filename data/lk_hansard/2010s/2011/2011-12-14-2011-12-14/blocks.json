From 2009 up to now, the Hon. Minister of External Affairs and his co-Minister, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, have been going abroad and after coming back, they have been assuring us saying, We have met the arguments of the international community and we could safeguard the integrity, sovereignty and the reputation of Sri Lanka. But, it appears that these assertions are not quite correct, Hon. Minister. When the UN Committee against Torture met from 31st October to 25th November, 2011, they issued a statement. Since I do not have time to read the entire thing, I will read a relevant portion of it. In The Sunday Times of 27th November, 2011, it is stated, I quote:",

We have never seen these things. Hon. Minister, will you produce the Action Plan for Human Rights in Sri Lanka today because we have never seen it. Earlier, he spoke of a roadmap. We did not see that also. So, I hope that the Hon. Minister will give a copy of that Action Plan. I have been trying to get it from various sources for the last several days but no one seems to have a copy of it. So, I do not know whether this is another effort by the Government to hoodwink all those who are interested in human rights in Sri Lanka. But, this is not going to help you because the international community has given you time because of the assurances given by your Government. So, before the Debate is over, I hope",

In Malaysia, there is a sizeable Malaysian Tamil population, who were originally from Jaffna. They have done well there. The second richest man in Malaysia is of Jaffna Tamil origin. I visited many of their homes recently in Malaysia and their wealth could not be believed. All of them were united in wanting to build Sri Lanka, where many have their uncles still in Jaffna. There are 17 Tamil organizations in Malaysia, Hon. Sampanthan. The High Commission of Sri Lanka in Malaysia, under the guidance of the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, brought these organizations together into one body called the FOMSO. They visited Sri Lanka recently and have spotted a number of investment possibilities. They will be visiting Sri Lanka again on the 19th of this month. All this was due to the patient persuasion of our High Commission in Malaysia under the guidance of our Minister of External Affairs.

What they want is the problem to go on. What the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and the UNP wanted was exactly what the Canadians wanted regarding the next Commonwealth Conference. It was only one or two countries that did not want the Commonwealth Conference to be held in Sri Lanka, but all the other 54 countries, in one voice, said, Well, we want the Commonwealth Conference to be held in Sri Lanka. It was the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris who said, just last month, in this House that there were 15 countries, the representatives of which got up one by one saying No, the Commonwealth Conference should be held in Sri Lanka. So, it was only one or two countries like Canada, ably supported by people like the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, which did not want the Commonwealth Conference to be held in Sri Lanka, nobody else.",

This has happened because of the policies we follow domestically in relation to our own people, all Sri Lankans, whether they be Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims or any other. We advance two arguments to justify the policies we pursue. The first is that we are a sovereign nation. We have an absolute right to do whatever we wish within the territory of our state and no one can question us. The second is that the LTTE has been the villain, continues to be the villain and is solely responsible for all that has happened in Sri Lanka. All our trials and tribulations are attributable solely to the LTTE.",

The criticism levelled against us by a wide section of the international community - not merely countries, but also by reputed international human rights organizations - is sought to be projected as inspired by the rump of the LTTE within the Tamil diaspora, and therefore unworthy of credence. It is conveniently forgotten that not very long ago, these international human rights organizations, the same organizations, Amnesty International, International Crisis Group, Human Rights Watch, International Commission of Jurists, the University Teachers for Human Rights (Jaffna) - a domestic organization - were the most virulent critics of the LTTE and its violations of human rights and that such criticism enabled the Sri Lankan Government - the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, the then minister of foreign affairs - to have the LTTE banned, proscribed, in many countries the world over, the USA, India, the UK, Canada, Australia, the European Union and other countries, crippling the LTTEs activities in regard to",

In fact several of these countries shared vital, extensive intelligence with the Sri Lankan Government in regard to the LTTE, particularly, India. Some of these countries even helped Sri Lanka to fight the war against the LTTE and all of them played a significant role in the ultimate decimation of the LTTE. I do not think that Sri Lanka can, with any sense of responsibility, deny that reality. How on earth can it ever be believed that these very same countries and organizations are today being inspired by the rump of the LTTE within the Tamil diaspora as is claimed by the Sri Lankan Government? The truth is that for whatever reason, today many prominent LTTEers are working in collaboration with and in cahoots with the Sri Lankan Government. This is not something which you can deny. It is true that sections of the Tamil diaspora are active. But can it be believed that these countries and these reputed international organizations are thoughtlessly influenced by the Tamil diaspora? I must say that vast sections of the Tamil diaspora are quite responsible and want the problem in this country to be resolved through dialogue in a peaceful way. Of course there were two fundamental matters on which these countries and organizations were quite specific and in regard to which they continued to be engaged with the Sri Lankan Government. The first was that the Tamil civilians should be protected to the maximum extent possible when military operations were carried out against the LTTE. What would be meant by this is that the attack should not be reckless, should not be indiscriminate and should not be disproportionate given the fact that there were over 300,000 Tamil civilians in this conflict area. This is not to minimize the onerous military responsibilities the Sri Lankan Government undertook, but to emphasize that the rules of law had to be maintained nevertheless. And the second was that the core causes, the core issues of the conflict should be addressed in keeping with the legitimate aspirations of the minority peoples and that there should be a political solution which would be acceptable.",

There were witnesses who had gone abroad because they had no protection, they were not in the country, they were not able to testify and their evidence were being recorded through teleconferencing, but suddenly that was stopped. The report of that Commission in regard to the inquiry they conducted if it was ever submitted was not made public. Everything came to an end in a mysterious way. Not merely was the violation of Human Rights with impunity, a continuing phenomenon - a domestic process commenced with much fanfare, even with a measure of international involvement died, I might say, was in fact killed. Would it be reasonable in these circumstances, in this background, to place any faith whatever in any domestic process? Can any reasonable human being be expected to place any faith in any domestic process in the context of what happened to this Commission of Inquiry which functioned under international supervision? Are these not the questions that the international community is raising? Are these not the questions being posed to the Sri Lankan Government on the basis of what is happening in Sri Lanka?",

Madam Louise Arbour came to Sri Lanka some years ago. She made a public statement to the effect that the human rights situation in Sri Lanka had become so deeply ingrained with the culture of impunity that strong measures were required to eradicate that culture of impunity and she wanted to set up a UN presence in Sri Lanka to monitor human rights. The Human Rights Commission by virtue of its miserable performance had been degraded to status B from status A and in the international body of Human Rights Commissions, it had only observer status. But, the request by Madam Louise Arbour that there be an international presence of the UN in Sri Lanka was rejected. If that had been accepted, all the troubles you are facing now may not have occurred, you may have been advised to avert them and you may have yet fought the LTTE successfully without committing all the human rights violations. Madam Navaneetham Pillai has passed several strictures with regard to Sri Lanka even at the time the war was being conducted - I will not quote here because of the lack of time. Frequently she has made statements in regard to the various violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law that was being committed by you while the war was being prosecuted.

It further states, Sovereignty includes the powers of government, fundamental rights and the franchise. If you do not observe fundamental rights and if you do not respect franchise and you do not accept the sovereignty vested in all the people and which is inalienable you yourself are eroding the sovereignty which you claim to preserve and protect. Sir, I will during the discussion of sovereignty and its implications like to read to you and to the House certain paragraphs from the Eighth Memorial Lecture on the death of the Hon. (Dr.) Neelan Tiruchelvam delivered by Mr. Gareth Evans, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia and subsequently the President of the International Crisis Group. Sir, this is what he said in the course of the lecture on the issue of sovereignty. It sates, I quote:",

There is a widespread concern that involvement of countries in the affairs of others, and in particular the involvement of developed countries in the internal affairs of developing ones, has not always been principled or consistent in the past. It is an article of faith around a good deal of the global South that Article 2(7) of the UN Charter is to be read as an all-embracing prohibition when it says that Nothing should authorize intervention in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State.",

DEW Gunasekara but I am sad to hear a Communist Member speaking of foreign policy as if he is in the 1970s, even before the Great Wall was demolished. He says that foreign affairs is in the hands of two or three countries. Either he is having amnesia of convenience or he does not keep abreast of todays world conditions. He talks of BRIC as the new world order. He forgets that the US plays a pivotal role. He forgets that the EU has 27 members and is expanding. He forgets that Japan is the biggest donor. He forgets that Sri Lanka is located next to India and he also tries to circumvent political realities when it comes to the question of international treaties. Shouting in Parliament does not make the international community fear. We need to reflect matters that are brought to our attention, give a direct answer as to why we rebut them rather than making a big noise just to score points and protect your Ministry from the next Cabinet reshuffle.",

Just because it is the Commonwealth Games, it does not mean that the External Affairs Ministry has no hand in that. Your job is to ensure that the foreign community is with Sri Lanka at every given moment. I am telling this to you because you are the External Affairs Minister. If you had been the Minister of Sports, I would have told you about going to St. Kitts and losing the vote. So, Hon. Minister, you have got to carry the bad brief of the Government. When you project our county, at every given moment you must ensure that every attempt that you are making is for soliciting assistance for us. That must be there. You got 27 votes out of 70 and that means 43 were against you. If you are so popular as you say, then you must get the opportunity to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games.",

You are a competent Minister and you have a competent Deputy Minister but you have an incompetent Government. So, that bad brief has to be defended by you. We, as Opposition Members in Parliament, need to expose these type of things. When it comes to Labour GSP, we told you that if you had basically protected the Constitution, none of these problems would have happened. When something has been done against you, no amount of effort taken for remedial action would help to overcome the problems created. If you did not amend the Seventeenth Amendment through the Eighteenth Amendment, half the problems would not have been there. If you allow the normal course of action to be taken instead of bringing your police and your private security company, none of these problems would have been there. If you had given democratic rights to labour unions instead of upsetting them, none of these problems would have been there. If you basically upheld the International Treaties and Covenants that you are basically supposed to accept as a dignified country, you would not have had the problems that are there. You are just trying to show that you are trying to talk of the Tamil problem but do nothing to them. The Tamils are an integral part in our country. The social fabric of our country is enriched by the Tamils and Muslims and the Sinhalese are there to support that. Do not take them in a piecemeal fashion. You take them when required and then shove them into a corner. Do not try to bring committees into this House just to appease the Geneva Convention, which is to be held in March. Ensure that you walk the talk. It is not that you have got to take action to address the Geneva Convention in March. How many people who should be in jail are not in jail? How many people who should be out of jail are in jail? That is what is happening. I mentioned KP. Why is he given protection when he should be in jail? Where are the 19 ships that you were talking of? Where are the billions of rupees that have got to be taken? Ensure that you confiscate them. Instead of taking over underutilized assets, take these monies and ensure that you use it to develop Sri Lanka. The Minister of External Affairs is silent on that. You have to take action and when you do not, the international community looks at us and says, \"why are they giving special treatment to these barbaric people?\"",

Hon. Minister, I do not want to take much time. Ensure that we treat India, our closest neighbour, with respect. They have always been talking of a settlement brought in to the vexed problem, which is the ethnic issue. Ethnic issue does not apply to Tamils only. The Muslims are there and the Sinhalese are there. It is not just saying, take this or not. Everybody wants an honourable way of living. Do not try to impose something just to show the world that you are talking with them. Ensure that that comes through your heart. Do not force them. That is what the Tamils are asking; that is what the Muslims are asking and that is what we, as the UNP, are watching at. There are going to be four more meetings before the end of the year. Do not think you can try to basically convince one aspect. There are other aspects also. We are not going to be silently watching you all fooling the world. What we want is a genuine attempt to solve this problem, once and for all. Do it in a depoliticized manner. When Tony Blair solved the problem in Ireland, he did not castigate the Opposition or try to take undue advantage from them. He said, The Opposition helped us; the Government is supporting that; let us put something which is behind us and talk of the unborn future. That is what is expected of you all.

Even the President does not want such obsequiousness going on. All he says is, tell what is good for the country. The people who are obsequious only try to ridicule the Government, instead of trying to take it forward. That is not what is expected. If you listened to the speech made by the President on the 4th of February, he said, please ensure that you have constructive criticism\". Do not just sing hosannas for dinner. That is what he says.

There were certain figures that were reduced and put on to the Central Bank, when they went on the Commonwealth bid. What a mess it has made. These are tax payers money. You have paid US Dollars 3.2 million and kicked them out. But, the same plan is being put into action by incompetent and inept people.

All the Muslim schools and principals have given their full approval for this system. The Conference was chaired by Dr. Hussain Ismail, and our well-known educationist Mr. S.H.M. Jameel made a very comprehensive speech detailing what the school principals should do. There is some reservation in the minds of people because certain principals think that the identity of the Muslim schools will be lost after the formation of these 1,000 secondary schools. The development of these 1,000 secondary schools is a well-planned programme initiated by the Hon. Minister of Education at the instance of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa.",

    "text": "Mr. Presiding Member, you were a judge, an ambassador and also a governor and today you represent this House as a distinguished Member of Parliament. So, I am very happy to see you chairing the House today. As you know, the Muslims have a system of religious schools called Madrasas. Children of 3 to 6 years are sent to Madrasas, which functions by the side of each Mosque. By this, they will be able to have a basic knowledge of the Al-Quran. Similarly, I would like to recommend that system, Sir, even to the Buddhists and Hindus because if children are sent to such religious schools, when they reach the age of 5 or 6 years, they will be able to have a basic knowledge of their religion. In the case of Buddhists, they can teach their children the Dhamma. The Buddhist Theosophical Society that was started by Colonel Henry Steele Olcott had a plan. I do not know what happened to that system over the years. Only the Daham Pasal system still exists. There is also the Muslim Daham Pasals called Ahadiya schools and so are the Hindu religious schools that function at their own denominational centres. So, if a child is sent to such a school and when the child attains the said age, he or she will be fully conversant with his or her religious background and they will also learn what is right and what is wrong. So, that is a very good system. I would like to recommend that system even to other religions. Even the educationists have recommended that system. This is what the Hon. Member says in his Adjournment Motion. We must also have the preschools which fall in line, as I said earlier, with the former Madrasas system. If we can have such a system, when the children reach the age of three or five years, they will be able to finish half or the full of the Holy Quran and they will have a knowledge of Arabic too.",

The identities of the Muslim schools must also be preserved because there are religiously important days like in the month of Ramadan when Muslim schools are closed and it is compulsory for male Muslim students to attend the Friday prayers.",
