We did not know about the UN. He is the one who told us the way. - [Interruption.] There is a difference. . 1989 . , ? If he could speak in 1989, what is wrong in any Member of Parliament or any other organization speaking about it now? But, there is a difference. In 1989, those who died were Sinhalese. Now, in this situation, most of the people who died were Tamils. . . ? . [ ] . That is the difference. [ ] In 1989, when the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa was speaking about disappearances, he was a hero. Why? Because those who

1299 1300

2011 07

disappeared were all Southerners and Sinhalese. Now, he never speaks about disappearances and if anyone speaks about abductions, they are all traitors. Why? Because most of those who died were Tamils. That is the truth. So, it cannot go on like this. The international community seeks accountability for all the people who died during the last so many years in Sri Lanka. The Government may not understand it. But, we have a serious situation on the international scene. Firstly, there was no accountability for the people who died in the last months of the civil war. - [Interruption.] Hon. Speaker, We have signed all the international covenants and human rights laws. So, if we have signed those, we must abide by them. You cannot say that human rights is a Western concept. . ? What is happening in Egypt? Most countries in the Middle East, where there is unrest, are all American-backed governments. If you take Egypt, Tunisia, Bahrain and Syria, all were American-backed governments. But, the people have risen. They have risen against tyranny. - [Interruption.] People are fighting for human rights; people are fighting for democracy; people are fighting for media freedom. -[Interruption.] . . . ? . . [ ] . .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Presiding Member, thank you for giving me this opportunity. I am glad to speak at a time when you are in the Chair. It gives me a greater freedom to express my views without too much interruption.

Today, we are yet again discussing the extension of the state of Emergency. Month after month this Parliament debates this issue. So far, every time the Hon. Prime Minister moves the extension of the state of Emergency, he cites the same reasons; reasons which are contrary to the pronouncements that the Government has made, that war has been brought to an end, that the LTTE has been totally defeated, that terrorism has been eradicated from this soil, that the other countries in the world must look at Sri Lanka and learn from our example and so on. Having said that, the Government, month after month, extends the state of Emergency and says that there are various efforts being made to undermine the unity, the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of the country. The reasons that are given are, that these efforts

1355 1356

2011 07

are being taken outside the territorial limits of Sri Lanka. I would like to ask the question, "How does the state of Emergency or the promulgation of the state of Emergency in this country, within the territorial limits of Sri Lanka, help you in combating efforts that are taken outside the country?" So, the state of Emergency being extended month after month has nothing to do with any actual threat to the sovereignty of the country.

The state of Emergency is being used for various other purposes and that is why we have constantly opposed it and voted against it. For instance, polls are postponed under the state of Emergency. That is totally ultra vires the powers that are granted by the Public Security Ordinance, which authorizes only acts that are a threat to the national security or acts that are necessary to preserve essential supplies being made to the community. Postponement of elections is certainly not one of those. But, I am more concerned about the state of Emergency being used to continue a military administration in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of this country, particularly in the Northern Province. The civil officers and the civilian administration are in place. All officers are occupied but they have absolutely no power. Every decision is supervised by military officials on the ground. This afternoon, as the Debate opened, the Hon. Suresh Premachandran, explained how certain military officials are even making threats against the Hon. Members of Parliament quite openly in the public realm.

Now, the Government certainly must not tolerate that type of thing and I hope that what has been said with responsibility in this House will be taken note of. But, a more despicable thing happened this afternoon. It was not somebody saying something outside the House but the Hon. Murugesu Chandrakumar

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

made some threats within the precincts of this Chamber. He pointed to us and stated that if we fan the flames of nationalism, it is a natural consequence that threats will come our way and we must meet those. Now, that is a threat. That is a threat that we must take seriously, particularly in the background of an attempted assassination on a fellow Member, the Hon. S. Shritharan, who is here in the House.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member are you not violating the Standing Orders by referring to the conduct of the Hon. Murugesu Chandrakumar?

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am not referring to his conduct.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Also, when you refer to a threat of assassinating another Member, it is a very serious charge. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I did not make that charge against a Member of this House. I said, "In the background of an attempted assassination, such utterances in this House have to be taken very seriously".

( ) (The Presiding Member) If there is anything against the Standing Orders, it will be expunged.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) And, if this continues, Sir, I will have to withdraw what I said right at the beginning, that we are glad that you are in the Chair.

We are engaged in constructive conversation with the Government. The whole country knows about it. We are engaged in a structured dialogue for the settlement of the political issue, the national issue and we are engaged in that with all honesty to find a solution within a united country. Today, I wish to state quite categorically to the whole country that we are honestly engaged in this effort. But, there are many spoilers and it is a matter of regret that some of them are actually from the ranks of the Government who, from time to time, raise various concerns as they call them. They construct straw men who are not actually there and then proceed to destroy them, in the process of undermining this particular engagement that the Tamil National Alliance has with the Government of Sri Lanka. We have been given a mandate by our people that cannot be questioned not at one election, not at two elections but even the recently concluded Local Government Election confirmed the 100 per cent trust that our people have placed in us. Our people have not placed that trust in us for nothing. They wish that we be their representatives, we voice their concerns and take forward their concerns and that is a legitimate responsibility that we must discharge and that we shall do.

I am raising some concerns with regard to conduct of certain Members of the Government in seeking to undermine this process. That will not create a conducive

1357 1358

atmosphere for the continuation of these talks. The country is also aware that we have raised many immediate concerns of our people with regard to resettlement, with regard to their livelihood, with regard to reconstructing their dwellings and so on. These discussions have gone on for a while. We have raised the issue of long-term detainees, almost 1,000 of them for over 10 years; some up to 15 years. We raised concerns about persons being held in detention without their identities being made known and even the International Committee of Red Cross being denied access to them.

I am glad that the Hon. Deputy Minister is here. He himself in one of these Debates said that he found a youth who had been incarcerated for 13 long years and that youth does not know why he is still in prison.

Some of these concerns have been raised and the Government tries to resolve them. The country knows that there is a proposed resolution whereby the parents and the next of kin of these people could actually find out whether their children are yet alive in these camps or whether they are no more. But, even after we arrived at that kind of settlement, still it has not been implemented to date. We hope that in the coming days it will bear fruit and we will be able to actually implement that agreement that we came to with the Government. The point that I am making is that even though there are assurances given by the high level Ministerial Committee appointed by His Excellency the President, they are unable to implement them. It is a matter of concern. It only means that some of these spoilers are rather powerful and are able to, notwithstanding the fact that very senior Ministers and the former Prime Minister are part of this delegation -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have exhausted your time. So, please wind up your speech now.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay, I will wind up now. The former Prime Minister was also included in this delegation and they gave assurances but none of them have been implemented up to date. So, today, I am appealing to His Excellency the President and the Government that you need to change this situation. If you are sincere about settling this issue that has gone on for over 60 years and if you are sincere in your efforts to rebuild the lives of these people whose lives have been devastated by war, you need to change this. I would also like to assure the country that we, as the representatives of the Tamil people who have been duly elected, are fully willing to participate in such a process. That hand of friendship that we have extended must be clasped and we need to move forward genuinely in this

effort, and for the reason that my time has run out, I will conclude my speech.

Thank you, very much. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you, Hon. Member. You are a disciplined Member. The next speaker is the Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah.
