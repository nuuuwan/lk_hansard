Hon.Deputy Speaker, it is with a sense of elation and satisfaction I rise in this House today to second the Motion moved by my Friend, the Hon. Shantha Bandara.

The whole nation is heaving a great sigh of relief by the removal of the Emergency Regulations. Emergency Regulations are brought from time to time when there are certain disturbances in the country which the normal law is unable to control. This happened during the riots

181 182

[ ]

2011 07

of 1915 and martial law was imposed by the British Government at that time. When the Sinhala Only Act was to be passed there were disturbances and to control the situation Emergency Regulations were imposed. After the assassination of the Hon. S.W. R. D. Bandaranaike, during the JVP struggle and then again during the LTTE terrorism Emergency Regulations were brought in. Sir, even though we had the Emergency Regulations, nobody felt it. All the roadblocks were removed. People were free to move from North to South, East to West and to the up-country. They were able to engage in trade.

Sir, I want to point out that in April, 1956 a significant turning point in the political history of this isle occurred. That was the landslide victory of the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna, which was the coalition of the SLFP led by the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and the Viplavakari Lanka Samasamaja Party of Mr. Philip Gunawardena together with other progressive forces in the country. It was decidedly a watershed in the political fabric of that area. As a senior wag commented recently in a newspaper, this coalition was committed to transforming this country into the Switzerland of the East. The foreign policy of being independent and non-aligned, committed to peace, nevertheless dedicated to protecting the countrys national integrity and sovereignty, reigned supreme in the minds of those leaders. The country was no longer tied to the West but sought friends from all over the globe.

We still remember very well that at a time when there was a football team to visit Sri Lanka from Russia, the then Prime Minister, Sir John Kotelawala, put a stop to it. That was the one-sided, lopsided, foreign policy that that Government followed. But after Mr. Bandaranaike, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa has been following the middle path and we have friends all over the world. The Mahinda Chintana - Sir, I have the copy here - I want to say in this House today that it overshadows and goes beyond the scope of the Magna Carta of 1215 which Lord Denning described as the greatest constitutional document of all times - the foundation of the freedom of the individual. Sir, this Mahinda Chintana has spelt out its progamme of bringing about peace and prosperity to this country and the total development to the whole country. It is not only a philosophy, a concept, but it also could be implemented for the welfare of the nation. The determination of our President who hailed from the village of Medamulana to overcome all obstacles in his path in taking this country to the next level will continue to prevail until and after all goals are met. That is the aim. We will march forward. We are not deterred. Undeterred we will go forward. Our President Mahinda Rajapaksa has ushered in a new epoch, especially after the conclusion of the war in May, 2009, when the scourge of terrorism was wiped out forever.

We have printed a book of him because this charithaya, this character -

. , , . "" , . . . ! , , '' - , - . Our President has brought in legislation to enable him to visit and address this august Assembly. ! Executive ; Legislative . executive . , Executive - . . He has thus debunked the misconception of the people that he is aloof from the Legislature. His Excellency the President was with the peoples representatives here. He walked in majestically and announced the lapse of the Emergency Regulations.

Specific world bodies affected by the curse of terrorism now wonder how our President was successful in crushing this malady in all its forms. Ban Ki-moon met our President during the last UN Sessions in New York - we were also there - and suggested that our President assumes the leadership of Asia. Ban Ki-moon told our President across the table, You have got the biggest mandate of the people and you are a shining leader in the Asian Continent.

We should be thankful to him for lifting the Emergency Regulations paving the way for a more relaxed environment contributing towards the peace process. The irony of it all is that those who attempt to teach us democracy and the various paths to achieve peace are the very sources who practise terrorism via covert and overt means. Double standards have become the order of the day. We shall not submit to any such threat, be it local or foreign.

I have here with me an article published in the front page of Daily News dated 06th September, 2011. This gentleman, Thomas Hammarberg, the Council of Europes rights Commissioner has told a revealing story. This article states, I quote:

Thomas Hammarberg, the Council of Europes rights commissioner, accused governments of being deeply complicit in illegal activities carried out by the US over the last 10 years, since the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.

"In attempting to combat crimes attributed to terrorists, countless further crimes have been committed in the course of the US-led global war on terror. Many of those crimes have been carefully and deliberately covered up.

Another shocking report in Daily News of 06th September, 2011 states, I quote :

Julian Assange, the founder of whistleblower website, Wikileaks has harshly criticized Western news outlets for distorting information, describing them as liars.

This is how international people challenge the world media. The local media should know this and the local media should report this.

This article further states, I quote:

Media organizations that proudly tell the public that they seek the truth are liars, Assange said in a lecture delivered by video conference on Thursday during the opening of an Info Trends event in Sao Paulo, Brazil.. Assange finally pointed to the collapse of Western institutions and questioned the claim that the West is ruled by law.

There is lawlessness everywhere. Economies are collapsing everywhere in the West. We are surviving here but bombs are going off in Holy mosques in Islamabad, Pakistan in the Holy month of Ramadan, . Today an explosion has occurred in New Delhi. Today in the whole world, if there is a country where a bomb does not explode, it is our sweet, serene Sri Lanka. We can be proud of it, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

This article further goes on to state, I quote:

The people believe that there exists a rule of law in the West.

That is what Julian Assange says. It further states, I quote:

The rule of the law is collapsing. The basic structures of the Western governments are falling. He pointed out.

, , . . . , . . . . [3.29 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today we are debating an Adjournment Motion brought in to commend or thank His Excellency the President for withdrawing the state of Emergency. This so-called withdrawal of the state of Emergency is the biggest fraud in this country. It is not a national fraud but an international fraud. We are hoodwinking the whole world that we have withdrawn the state of Emergency without changing even a speck in the administration of this country. Is this what you all are commending in this House? Unfortunately, none of your senior Ministers are here to thank his Excellency the President for withdrawing or doing away with the state of Emergency because it has been brought back through the back door.

211 212

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, all the senior Ministers were here but at this moment they are in various Committees. There are Committees going on. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Hon. Azwer-[Interruption.] Whenever the state of Emergency was proclaimed or it was brought in for debate, the Senior Ministers were the people who were here promoting it. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) They were here. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Today, they are not here to thank His Excellency the President. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) They were here. -[Interruption.] You were not here.[Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please!

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You say that the state of Emergency has been withdrawn. But, you are bringing into force Regulations under the Prevention of Terrorism Act after two years you have rid this country from terrorism. The Prevention of Terrorism Act was brought in 1979 because there was a movement that could jeopardize democracy and create a situation of unrest. Today, you say that you have got rid of terrorism but you are reverting back to the PTA - Prevention of Terrorism Act - to continue the Emergency situation in this country. Under the Prevention of Terrorism Act that you are now going to use to continue with the current situation, you have more powers than the powers that you had under the Emergency Regulations. The state of Emergency itself was thought to be a draconian piece of legislation but it was provided that the state of Emergency be approved by Parliament each month within 14 days of the Proclamation being made. So, you are removing that but bringing into effect a more serious piece of legislation.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) It is under judicial supervision. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is not under judicial supervision. It's supervision is very much less than under the Emergency Regulations. -[Interruption.] No, under the PTA, if a person says that someone is indulging in an unlawful activity, that is enough.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) But, the judiciary has to say, Yes. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, it does not have to. Under preventive detention, you can hold him up to18 months without producing him to a court of law. -[Interruption.] No, not necessarily. Under preventive detention, you can hold him up to 18 months. -[Interruption.] Go back to the PTA and see, Hon. Minister. You are a person who always stood for the liberty and the rights of people and of the minorities. You were never against the suppression of rights. But today, because you have become a Minister, you have been forced to support and to say that this PTA is less harmful than the Emergency Regulations. It is not true. There is no judicial control. There is no need to give reasons for arresting a person under the PTA. You only have to say, He was indulging in an unlawful activity. This unlawful activity can be a very innocent breaking of the law, but that is sufficient to hold a person under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Under preventive detention, you can hold him up to 18 months without producing him before a judicial officer.

You are also going to use the Prevention of Terrorism Act to continue the high security zones. When there is no terrorism and when you have got rid of the LTTE, you must, after two years at least, give the opportunity for those people who have suffered for 30 years to live in a reasonably free manner in their own lands; in their own areas.

But, you are going to use the PTA to bring regulations to continue the high security zones. How fair is it? You are also going to continue to hold some of those persons who are in your custody today - some of them without trial and indictment. You are going to continue to hold them using the PTA and by bringing additional regulations. Is this fair? This is what I am asking. We have to go back to a status where all people in this country can live again peacefully without any fear that they will be arrested or that they will be subjected to any sort of harassment.

213 214

2011 07

A simple thing was this "Grease Yaka" phenomenon that we had in this country. We had the "Grease Yaka" phenomenon not only in the North but also in the South. We had several incidents where people who lost confidence in the police, surrounding police stations and creating havoc around police stations. I do not approve of surrounding police stations and intimidating these police officers. We know very well that a police station is supposed to overlook over 30,000 to 40,000 people. But we have only around 30 men in a police station. It is wrong to surround them and intimidate them. But when people lost confidence in the police or the armed forces then they rebelled and showed their anger by surrounding these police stations. This happened for over a month. But when did the Government decide to go harsh on those people who were surrounding these police stations? They did it when "Grease Yaka" phenomenon appeared in the Jaffna Peninsula and the people there rebelled against the forces. There over one hundred people were arrested. They were sent to remand prison. They were brought before the courts. The judge ordered the examination of these persons who have been arrested by a Judicial Medical Officer. What does the reports of the Judicial Medical Officer proclaim? They say that all these people have been severely assaulted with the bottom of the boots of police officers and the butt ends of the guns that the police officers were carrying and they had many injuries on their bodies.

Why did you take such a harsh attitude when the people in the North lost confidence in those police officers or the army, whereas you did not take such a harsh action in any of the other areas? Subsequent to the incident in Jaffna, you took a tougher stand all over the country and you have brought this "Grease Yaka" phenomenon to some sort of a control today. But, the people in Jaffna are still under stress. They are being harassed. They still live under fear because they are unable to protest as they will be dealt with very severely. Is it because that they are Tamils? This is the difference. This is the difference that Hon. Suresh Premachandran was trying to point out about which the Hon. Minister also commented. Please understand the reaction of the Tamil man to this whole set up where over one hundred people were arrested and had been badly assaulted . The police and the army being arms of the Government in their areas is severely affecting their mindset and that is the reason we have had problems in this country in the past and by repeating such actions you are going to extend the division between the two communities in this country for a long time to come.

Today, there is a Gazette Notification which has been tabled under the Prevention of Terrorism Act for the appointment of the Commissioner-General of Rehabilitation, Emergency (Administration of Local Authorities) Regulation, No. 06 of 2011 and Emergency (Administration of Local Authorities) Regulation, No. 07 of 2011. If you needed Emergency Regulations for doing all this, why did you come and say, there is no need for

a state of Emergency and we are withdrawing it ? You could have well said, no, there is a need for certain things to be done in this country or you could have even admitted that during this transitional period you really need Emergency laws. But, what did you say? You said, there is no need for Emergency. Why did you say it? You thought that the international community is putting pressure on you on the Emergency laws, so, you will remove it on paper but you will bring it back through the back door and nobody would notice it. It is not true. The whole world knows you. They understand what exactly you are trying to do better than you yourself. So, do not try to hoodwink the whole world. It is not possible. You can bury your head in the sand but everyone else is not going yo bury their heads in the sand to believe what you are saying. This is the position.

The Hon. Suresh Premachandran was pleading that there has to be a political solution and only that can solve the issues in this country. What do we do? We have had several documents prepared to bring a political solution to the issues in this country. But, what do you bring? You bring a Parliamentary Select Committee. What does the TOR of the Parliamentary Select Committee say? It does not talk of an ethnic problem. The President was more frank when he appointed the APRC. He said that he appointed the APRC to evolve an indigenous solution to the issues of the North-East people. So, if he could admit it then, why is he not admitting it today? During the APRC sessions, there was somebody who said, if Prabhakaran can be killed and the LTTE is eliminated, then that will be good. I said in that APRC discussion that, on the day that Prabhakaran is killed and LTTE is got rid of, the APRC will not be sitting further. It happened. We were not even given one month after the 19th of May, 2009 to complete the process of the APRC. We were always urging the APRC to go faster to complete the process so that there can be a document during the war which would have compelled the Government, maybe to accept it and go forward. But, it was delayed. So many other proposals were brought in. The full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment was suggested. All these happened, but the APRC document itself was delayed. We came to conclusions, we finalized a document and it was presented to His Excellency the President by the Chairman of APRC, the Hon. (Prof). Tissa Vitarana. He was the showpiece of the Government. Whenever anybody talked of the war, they said, We also have a parallel peace process through the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana." He was the showpiece whenever any foreign dignitaries came to this country. But, what happened? The President put the APRC Report probably into the waste-paper basket. My good friend Nizam Kariapper and I had to bring out that document to the public domain. It has reached the hands of all people who are interested in bringing a fair solution to the ethnic problem in this country.

I am sure there are many Members in the Government who feel that this can be a fair solution to the issues of the

215 216

Tamil people and to the ethnic issue in this country. But you are now talking about reinventing the wheel through the Parliamentary Select Committee. But, even the Parliamentary Select Committee only talks of unity; it does not talk of a problem or a solution to overcome the problem that we have in this country.

So, under these circumstances, if this Government believes that by withdrawing the Emergency Regulations alone they will meet the needs of the international community based on the report of the Panel of Experts who were advising the Secretary-General of the United Nations, then you are sadly mistaken. These Emergency Regulations you withdrew and bring all of them through the Prevention of Terrorism Act and then you expect the international community to think that you are sincerely attempting to bring normalcy back to this country. It is not true. There are so many other questions that have been raised in the UN Report that you have to answer. You have a load of Ministers going to the UN. There will be so many officials. But I do not know whether the world is going to believe you, trust you or give you any room to operate in the future. Thank you, Sir.

[3.48 p.m] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I wish to join the proposer of this Adjournment Motion in congratulating the Government for having brought the state of Emergency to an end. The state of Emergency has been in existence, except for a very brief period, for almost 30 years. It is indeed a matter of relief for everyone concerned that we have seen the back of the state of Emergency in this country. But when we look at the arguments from the Opposition today, it appears that they are accusing the Government of continuing with the conditions of Emergency even after its lapse by resorting to various other means.

As the Minister of Justice, it is my bounden duty to place before the House the situation as of today as to the post-Emergency period and what steps we have taken. Sir, as you know, the Emergency Regulations had to lapse on the 30th of August, 2011 since His Excellency did not refer those Regulations for extension by Parliament. In this regard, however, it was envisaged that the following areas would have to be preserved even after the E m e r g e n c y R e g u l a t i o n s h a v i n g l a p s e d .

The first was to ensure that the pending investigations and proceedings arising from arrests made under the

Emergency Regulations for which provision was made under the Emergency Regulations be kept alive.

Those who are lawyers on the other Side know that in any event, the provisions of Section 6(3) of the Interpretation Ordinance can be made use of to argue that even after the Emergency Regulations have lapsed, the past operations of anything duly done, any offence committed, any right, liberty or penalty acquired, any action, proceeding or thing pending or incompleted at the time the Emergency Regulations lapsed, maybe carried on and completed as if there had been no such repeal or lapsing. But to make it very clear, we have taken this step in order to preserve this status quo for the time being to ensure that we will complete the pending investigations and proceed to take action accordingly.

The second is, to ensure that the detention orders made under the Emergency Regulations in respect of those persons under detention be continued. The third is, the proscription of the LTTE to be continued. Then, the last is, the rehabilitation process of surrendees which was covered under Regulation 22 of the Emergency Regulations also to be continued.

Here again an anomalous situation will arise, since there are a large number of LTTE surrendees who were surrendered to the armed forces are still in the rehabilitation camps. Even the position of the Commissioner-General of Rehabilitation would have to come to an end with the lapsing of the Emergency Regulations. Therefore, it would not be prudent or nobody could imagine that we could right away wind up this whole process. There are people who are undergoing various types of training in the rehabilitation process; several batches of them have already been released, and within a maximum period of 24 months all of them have got to be released in any event. This has happened in the past during the JVP insurrection in the 70s. There had been a similar provision where the rehabilitation process continued. Thousands and thousands of them - some of them are already in Parliament too - have gone through this process. This is done with an idea of creating conditions of normalcy without endangering national security and that is why these Emergency Regulations have been promulgated as of 29th of August, 2011 by Gazettes and if necessary those Gazette Notifications can also be tabled. These steps have been taken as a temporary measure to complete the ongoing process of detentions that have already been there at the time the state of Emergency lapsed, to continue to complete the investigations and also to hold those who surrendered until their period of rehabilitation is over.

I want to assure this House on behalf of the Government that we do not want to prolong this indefinitely. We want this whole process to be brought to an end. People have to enter their normal lives. We are now in the post-war period where wounds have got to be healed. So, the purpose of the Government is to complete

217 218

[ . ]

2011 07

this process as it has happened in the previous occasions, not only in this country, in many other countries. So, there is nothing abnormal here though the Opposition makes it out as if we are still continuing with the abnormal conditions of the state of Emergency.

I am sure those who will speak after me would certainly pick holes in my argument. But what I am talking about is the spirit of the Governments intentions in having promulgated four new sets of Regulations under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. As a matter of fact, some of the UNP Members who spoke were talking in the same vein. But when we had signed the Ceasefire Agreement with the LTTE in 2001, similar Regulations had to be promulgated under the PTA in order to maintain the status quo in certain matters.

Therefore, this is not something entirely new that this Government has invented in order to continue with certain harsh conditions which prevailed under the Emergency Regulations. That part of it I want to make very clear. Having said that, I may now speak a few words in Tamil.

[4.28 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Presiding Member, this is a Motion to thank His Excellency the President for doing away with the state of Emergency and I would have thought that the Government Benches would be replete with Members competing with each other to speak on this Motion even for a short period of time to thank the President for what

227 228

he had done. But, it is a sorry spectacle that the Government Benches are almost empty; there is no one to speak on behalf of the Government. Even for the previous speaker, word had to be sent for him and he rushed in at the last moment to commence his speech. This is a reflection of what the Government itself thinks of this Motion. The Hon. Members of this House on the Government side know very well that there is nothing to thank His Excellency the President for although he announced in this House most solemnly on the 25th of August 2011- these are his words - I am of the opinion that the state of Emergency need not continue any further. Conditions for the extension of the state of Emergency are no longer necessary and therefore, I have decided to do away with the state of Emergency.

Now, if that be the case, all Regulations that were made under the state of Emergency, under Part II of the Public Security Ordinance should have lapsed on the 30th of August 2011. In fact, on the 25th of August 2011 itself, a Motion should have been passed in this House bringing the state of Emergency to an end. But, that was not done and a week later, by operation of law, the state of Emergency lapsed. There must be a meaning for allowing the state of Emergency to lapse. All that fanfare for which His Excellency the President visited this House and the contents of this Motion that has been proposed by the Hon. Member for Kurunegala District is to thank His Excellency the President for bringing the Emergency to an end and that must mean something. It cannot just be mere words; it cannot just be on paper, but sadly, that is the situation. The Government itself is quite aware of that and that is the reason for their level of enthusiasm today in this House.

What does bringing the state of Emergency to an end mean? As I said earlier, all Regulations made in that effect will come to an end. But, if one is to look at the situation as it is extant today, that is not what has happened. Having allowed the state of Emergency to lapse, meaning Part II of the Public Security Ordinance is no longer in effect, yet, several of those Regulations that were made under the Public Security Ordinance, usually called ERs-Emergency Regulations- are now being made under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act No. 48 of 1979.

There are four Regulations that have been listed in the website of the Government Publications Bureau. I mentioned this yesterday in this House and I asked responsible Ministers to tell us at least today when this Motion is debated, the state of affairs with regard to those four Regulations. Only one of those has been placed in Parliament today. There are four Regulations that are listed dated 29th August, 2011, numbered: 1721/02, 1721/03, 1721/04 and 1721/05. Of those, only 1721/03 has been placed before Parliament today. The Hon.

Minister of Justice, when he spoke said, "Some regulations have been made and if you want, we can make them available." "If you want, we can make them available" - what kind of a responsible statement is that? Should the Parliament not be made aware of these very serious Regulations, Regulations that seek to cover up, Regulations that actually in effect continue the existence of the state of Emergency as it obtained prior to its lapsing on the 30th of August, 2011, should they not be made known at least to this Parliament? Why have those three Regulations not been placed even after eight days? That is because the Prevention of Terrorism Act, particularly Section 27, which provides for such Regulations to be made, does not envisage these Regulations. It is wholly outside the purview of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act to make Regulations such as these.

Take for instance one of those, which has been placed before us, the appointment of a Commissioner-General of Rehabilitation. I said this yesterday as well. Two days after His Excellency made this solemn promise in this House, he signed a Regulation under Part 11 of the Public Security Ordinance appointing a new Commissioner-General of Rehabilitation. Now, a Commissioner-General of Rehabilitation has been appointed, yet again under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Rehabilitation Orders were made previously under Regulation 22 of the Emergency Regulations that provided for a two-year maximum period of rehabilitation. These persons were taken into custody in May, 2009. Even if the full term of rehabilitation period had run, in May 2011 those Rehabilitation Orders would have lapsed. But, yet, we have over 5,000 people still held, said to be under rehabilitation. Hon. Minister of Justice spoke volumes here saying, "What are we to do with them? They are still being trained. There are vocations being given." But, you cannot do that. It is illegal. Two years is the maximum period of Rehabilitation Orders that can be made under Regulation 22 of the Emergency Regulations and that also has now lapsed. Prevention of Terrorism Act does not envisage making of Rehabilitation Orders. I will tell you why.

Prevention of Terrorism Act is one of those obnoxious pieces of legislation that the world has frowned upon for moving away from the ordinary law, moving away from time-honoured principles of criminal justice. One of those is, confessions that are made to a police officer that are made advisable in the course of legal proceedings. But even when a confession is sought to be produced against an accused, that is subject to a voir dire inquiry in the High Court to check the veracity or to check the voluntariness of that so-called confession. Now, Rehabilitation Orders are made in respect of persons who are supposed to have surrendered themselves. In the very nature, the act by a person who says, "I was involved in acts of terrorism, I am now surrendering myself" is a confession but, that is not subject to any judicial scrutiny.

229 230

[ .. ]

2011 07

Now you are seeking to bring Regulations to regulate Rehabilitation Orders. I demonstrated earlier that the maximum period has lapsed in May this year, still you are promulgating those Regulations. But those very Regulations are obnoxious to the other provisions of this Act which require confessions to be made to a police officer not below the rank of an Assistant Superintendent of Police. Those supposed confessions being challenged in the court of law, in the High Court in the voir dire inquiry, at least there is some judicial scrutiny with regard to the voluntariness of those confessions. But in respect of the lapsed Regulation 22 under the Public Security Ordinance, there is no judicial scrutiny. Somebody is supposed to have confessed to have committed some offences, but there is no judicial scrutiny as to its voluntariness and that person is locked up for two years and in this case, illegally, for longer than two years. How do you sustain this?

In this state of affairs, this august Assembly is being invited by my Hon. Friend to thank His Excellency the President. What for? When the ground situation makes no difference; when the ground situation is demonstrably illegal, why should we thank His Excellency the President? His Excellency the President two days after making that pronouncement, goes and acts under the Emergency Regulations. There were discussions here with regard to the Public Security Ordinance. We all know that the Public Security Ordinance is in force. It is Part II that is brought into operation by the declaration of Emergency and then if it is not extended it lapses after one month. We all know that. Then Part III contains Section 12 and another Section with regard to curfew and so on. The point is not the apparent legality of calling out the armed forces through the Regulation which has been placed before us today. That is not the point. The point is, if it is true that His Excellency said in this House that there is no condition necessary for the extension of the state of Emergency anymore, then why has he acted under Section 12 of Part III of the Public Security Ordinance and called out the armed forces to maintain security? Why has he done that? Now by doing that, on the ground, there is absolutely no change. It is the three forces that are maintaining security in the whole of the country and by bringing those Regulations that have lapsed under Part II through the backdoor as it were, through Section 27 of the Public Security Ordinance, in fact you are continuing with the same state of affairs that prevailed prior to 30th of August, 2011.

So, for an act such as this, for an act that takes the people of this country and the people of this world for a ride, I do not think we need to thank anyone because this is a duplicitous conduct of saying that you are doing something, on paper showing that, but in effect, in actual fact, having the same effect, identical effect to what obtained previously. Nobody needs to be thanked for that. If anybody is responsible for such duplicitous conduct, he needs to be condemned for such a conduct and that is what I propose to do now; condemn the conduct of

whoever who is responsible for trying to show the world - there may be reasons, September Assembly is on - but the world is not fooled by such acts. They can see what is happening. What do these armed forces do? My Colleague, the Hon. Premachandran explained that in detail. When the Hon. Minister addressed us at Uthuru Mithrayo I asked him why are you then sending the army to attack us?

What happened to the army who attacked us - five Hon. Members of Parliament - on the 16th of July? Nothing has happened. We were there when thirty to fifty soldiers in full uniform attacked our meeting. They are still unable to identify them. What happened to the soldiers who went into the houses of 102 persons in Nawanturai a day after a demonstration, at 1.00 a.m. in the middle of the night, assaulted and broke their bones? There are people with fractured bones who are still in the Jaffna Hospital. Why is that happening? Two days thereafter, in Kokuvil, again there was a brutal attack on civilians. There were 12 Muslim people affected in the attack in Nawanturai. Hon. Presiding Member would like to know that. Now, why are these things happening?

All these solemn words are spoken - Six hundred of them are coming here; you go there and we come here and we are all friends. But then, why are you unleashing this brutal force to go into the houses and beat up men, women and children like this? Why are you doing that? You go to the hospital and see those people. They did not beat themselves; they did not fracture their own bones. The army did that. Now, you come here and thank his Excellency the President for lifting the state of Emergency. What a foolhardy thing is this exercise today in this House? It is an act that means nothing either on paper or on reality. It is an act that in reality seeks to fool the world and you are inviting this august Assembly to thank the person responsible for that. No, Sir, we will not do that.

Thank you very much. [.. 4.44]

. . . . , . . , . . .

I must here express my surprise at the Hon. Members of the Tamil National Alliance who spoke before me making the type of criticism on this very happy occasion when the Emergency Regulations have been removed. We know what happened when the rule of Emergency existed. There were sections of people who tend to misuse the rule of Emergency. This process has been going on even after the end of the war. We have to accept the fact that as a result of the intense conflict that we have had for nearly thirty years, there is a whole culture that has been developed. That is a culture of the gun, which has created a new situation in our country where there are increasing acts of violence not only related to the activities connected with the war but also related to the other activities of the society in general.

Therefore, it is in this context that we have to view His Excellency the Presidents decision to remove the Emergency Regulations. Even though the Emergency Regulations have been removed, one cannot expect that the culture of violence will disappear overnight. The culture of violence which has become ingrained in our society is going to take time - even after the return of normal governance - to finally disappear in all its forms.

235 236

It is my hope that that will happen. But it cannot be expected that it will happen overnight.

In the situation that is prevailing today we have to accept the fact that the various forces that precipitated the war situation, the separatist movement and the resort to terrorism, these forces have not completely disappeared. That ideology has not completely disappeared. That is still prevalent not only within our country but even outside. For instance, among certain sections of the Tamil diaspora there is that type of thinking prevalent. They are still talking of establishing a separate State in Sri Lanka. There is a Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam, the TGTE, which has actually declared a Transnational Government for Tamil Eelam and elected a Prime Minister. It is trying to carry out a campaign. Unfortunately, there are certain elements in Tamil Nadu who are supporting that. There are also certain elements in other countries who are supporting that movement. Therefore, it is in that context that we have to view what is going on.

Now, once the state of Emergency is removed, when those forces of terrorism are still present both within our country and outside, there are certain elements which are operating on that basis in society today within the country as well, and these are some of the forces which have to be kept in check. So, the Government had to resort to public defence regulations and at the same time Prevention of Terrorism Act Regulations and formulate appropriate Regulations to see that those forces of terrorism, those remnants and elements that are trying to reactivate that movement are kept in check. That is why the PTA has been resorted to and various Regulations are being framed within that framework to try to make sure that these terrorist forces do not arise as a threat once again in our country.

So, I think, we have to view this in that context and I would like to remind our Hon. Members of the Tamil National Alliance that there are also other forces, international forces and imperialist forces, who have come up on the basis of divide and rule and those are the forces which would like to see our country divided. They would like to have a separatist force becoming victorious on our soil; they would like to see conflict going on, so that their armament can be sold here. These forces are also operating and they are, as we know, carrying out a public campaign on the basis of human rights violations to try to arraign various sections of our Government and this includes the Head of our Government. So, these forces are also operating. Here, in Sri Lanka, I think it behoves us to try to get together to defuse the situation and try to bring back normalcy without picking holes in every move towards the return of normalcy.

I was very sorry that the Hon. Sumanthiran referred to events well before this Emergency rule has been put

aside, events of the past, to say that there is violence going on and that there maybe some association with certain elements in the armed forces. But, as I said there are some elements, who during the period of the Emergency rule tend to misuse the Emergency rule. The fact that they did so will diminish now that the Emergency rule has been taken away and done away with. So, I think we have to accept this.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, you will have to wind up now. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) Give me two more minutes, please. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Please wind up within a minute. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) Okay. I would like to say, Mr. Presiding Member, rather than trying to find fault with the movements that are going to defuse the situation to make a more favourable environment for the restoration of human rights and the restoration of democratic rights, rather than doing that be critical of that. I appeal to the Tamil National Alliance and the Opposition to be supportive of the direction in which our society is moving. Within that movement, we must try to reach agreement among ourselves and try to solve our problems to work towards a political solution. So, when there is a Select Committee set up in Parliament, then everyone should participate in that process in a constructive way so that we ourselves can solve our problem and make sure that people outside do not put their fingers into this and spoil the soup. I think if we view it in that way, everyone -both the Government and the Opposition - all sections of our community will be happy at the fact that the state of Emergency has been put to an end this month.

Thank you very much. [.. 5.12 ]

( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Deputy Speaker, in speaking on this Motion I should perhaps start by saying that I do not think the way it has been put quite expresses the enormous relief in this country at having got rid of the need for Emergency Regulations, in fact at the removal of an Emergency situation in Sri Lanka. This has happened after a very long time. Even though in the past forty years we have sometimes had brief alleviation of Emergency Regulations, we knew that the Emergency situation still continued, and very soon the Regulations were reintroduced.

So the fact that this Emergency is now lifted for good is a most welcome. But I also think it is important for us to remember the need to make sure that terrorism does not arise again. It is for that reason that, unfortunately or otherwise certain regulations have been introduced under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. However, I agree with the last speaker from Jaffna who mentioned that we all hope the Prevention of Terrorism Act will also be lifted soon. Because we have to remember that the genesis of that Act in 1979 was unfortunate. It was accompanied by excesses of the part of the then Government which led to an increase of terrorism rather than a reduction. I think it is important therefore that, in our usage of the Act, we make sure that it prevents and does not exacerbate tensions, it prevents terrorism and does not allow it to expand.

However, having said that, I think we need to remember that for the future there is a need for greater Regulations, given the rise of terrorism worldwide. In the West you have things like the Homeland Security Act. We need to rethink our whole security situation and make sure that laws are introduced that are justiciable but that still make very clear the need to guard against modern methods of terrorism.

Recalling the speech of the Hon. Member of the Opposition from Jaffna, we need also to keep in mind the fact that in a context of uncertainty it is important that we, all of us together, try to build up the situation of trust that the last speaker just mentioned. I have never made any secret of the fact that I think the Prevention of Terrorism Act was introduced wrongly in 1979, it was applied wrongly, and the then Government of President J.R. Jayewardene exacerbated the terrorist situation which could have been dealt with much better, if only President Jayewardene acted in the way the present President is acting, by assuring better development not only of infrastructure but of opportunities to all citizens in all parts of the country. Instead, he just used a heavy hand without trying to develop the country and without allowing the people of that region to participate in the developmental process as this Government is trying to do. But I think we should also remember that some of the politicians of those days, unfortunately the Members of TULF, were not tough enough about the burgeoning terrorist movement of the time. You have to remember that it was in those days that Tamil policemen, Tamil politicians were ruthlessly shot in Jaffna, and while I am sure the present Membership of the TNA would absolutely abhor such actions they should not be frightened to say so. It was partly because of the fears, perhaps not justified, that the Tamil politicians at that time were encouraging terrorist movements that the State at that stage reacted in what I think was a very heavy-handed fashion.

I think it is vital that in the future we do not make that same mistake. Therefore, I think it is particularly important that people like the Hon. Member who just spoke, who has at his disposal a newspaper, uses that to raise issues rather than making threats of further terrorism which I am afraid some politicians occasionally use. I think it is very important that everybody abjures the use of terrorism so that we on the side of the Government can very quickly alleviate all the extreme measures that had to be introduced, if we are to prevent the tragedy of the last 20 years hitting this country again.

Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Thank you.
