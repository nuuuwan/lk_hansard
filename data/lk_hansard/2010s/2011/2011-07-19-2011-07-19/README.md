Mr. Speaker, I would like to add a few words to what

919 920

2011 19

the Hon. Leader of the House said. Sir, Standing Order No. 31(6) states, I quote

A question must not refer to any matter which is under adjudication by a court of law or to any matter on which a judicial decision is pending.

Then, Standing Order No. 32 (1) states, I quote:

Mr. Speaker shall decide whether a question is or is not admissible under these Standing Orders and may disallow any question .

Sir, although this case has been filed elsewhere, the persons concerned are citizens of Sri Lanka. That is very important. As the Hon. Member pointed out, the Minister and certain Members had been allowed to express their opinion on earlier occasions. Now, Sir, the House has brought this matter to your notice. You are the custodian of the rights and the privileges of all the Members of Parliament.

Sir, even a person of the calibre of Erskine May who is the authority on Parliamentary Practice and Procedure, has also underlined the fact that the rights given to the Members of Parliament in the House of Commons cannot be questioned elsewhere and even if that has been done elsewhere in other territories, it has no bearing on the Proceedings of the House. Therefore, Sir, my contention is that essentially a matter which is sub judice has been brought to your notice when you are presiding over the House today.

As mentioned in Standing Order Nos. 31(6) and 32 (1), Sir, you will not have the power or the right to allow this question to be raised in Parliament thereby casting aspersions on the character and conduct of the Hon. Members of this House. That is against national interest. That applies not only to an Hon. Minister in this House but also to the Hon. Anura Dissanayake as a Member of this House. Therefore, Sir, my contention is that this question cannot be allowed to be raised in this House today.

Thank you. ( )

, sub judice rule applies only for a criminal case. There is no criminal case in any part of the world on this, certainly not in Sri Lanka or anywhere else. It is the sub judice rule that we are talking of. Sub judice rule applies to a criminal case because a persons liberty can be at stake and that is also very narrowly defined, if you look at the Ruling given by the former Speaker, the Hon. M.H. Mohamed somewhere in 1990 or 1991. I think you were also a Member at that time, Sir. So, the sub judice rule first and foremost applies only to a criminal case, not to a civil case. Secondly, it cannot apply to a case outside Sri Lanka. Even if there is a civil case in Sri Lanka, if there is a case filed in Sri Lanka in regard to the hedging issue, we can discuss it here. But, if you go and file action in Sri Lanka against the person responsible under the Public Property Act, then, it is a different matter, we cannot discuss it. But, as long as you discuss it here, then it is certainly a matter of concern and I do not think a discussion in any other court of law can be brought up under sub judice rule, even a criminal case. So, sub judice rule applies only for criminal cases, not for civil cases, and that is for criminal cases in Sri Lanka, not elsewhere. . '' '' . '' '' .

Yesterday, a very important question came up in the House of Commons: the issue of the telephone-hacking scandal, and Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks have been summoned before a Select Committee of the House of Commons, which will sit at 1.30 p.m. today. Rebekah Brooks was arrested and bailed out. Then, they took up the issue that she cannot come before the Select Committee to give evidence because she has been arrested by the police. But, the Select Committee has said, No, she must come before us.

Hon. Speaker, if you watch the BBC at about 7 oclock, you can see her being questioned also. I am talking about the sub judice rule in England. Today, it is being applied very restrictively in the case of Rebekah Brooks ex-CEO of News International. What has happened? They said, No, Rebekah Brooks must come before us and she would be questioned before us with TV cameras on, so that the whole country would see what is happening.

Another Committee has summoned the former head of the police who had resigned. If you apply that criteria, half of our Cabinet will have to resign.

: : DEBT CONCILIATION ORDINANCE: REGULATIONS [. . 2.05]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Sir, I move,

"That the Regulations made by the Minister of Justice under Sections 6 and 10 of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance (Chapter 81) read with Section 63 of the said Ordinance and published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1689/18 of anuary 21st, 2011, which were presented on 21.06.2011, be approved".

Hon. Speaker, today, the matter before the House is to approve the amendments to the Regulations under the

929 930

Debt Conciliation Ordinance. I will briefly explain the basis of these Regulations: it is purely to enable the Chairman and the other Members of the Debt Conciliation Board have their payments increased as it has been last revised in 2005 and more than five years have lapsed since the final revision. Presently, the Chairman and the Members of Debt Conciliation Board are undergoing great difficulties since the payments that are made for the services that they are rendering, is very inadequate. Therefore, it had been proposed that we do increase the payments for attendance at Meetings from Rs. 600 to Rs. 1,500 for the Chairman and from Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,000 for the other Members, and their travelling allowance also be increased to Rs. 750 for the Chairman and to Rs. 500 for the other Members. Similarly, to have a combined allowance of Rs. 500 in case they engage in duties outside their residence as per Section 12 of the PA Circular No. 6/2006.

I believe this is a very non-controversial increase since this Debt Conciliation Board is performing a very important alternative dispute resolution function in this country. As you may know, Mr. Speaker, this Department itself was established by the Debt Conciliation Ordinance, No.39 of 1941. We have almost a 70-year history of this Debt Conciliation Board functioning in order to provide relief to indebtedness to those people who have mortgaged their property by way of security in order to obtain a loan and are subject to unconscionable rates of interest. If they seek some redress, the application before the Debt Conciliation Board enables them to summon the creditors as well as the debtors and attempt reconciliation between them.

This issue, as I told you, has a long history. We find that recently in 1999, in addition to what had already been taking place under the Debt Conciliation Ordinance, transfer deeds executed purely for a loan transaction has also been brought in because it was observed that there were many finance companies and other non-banking financial institutions resorting to this ruse of taking properties on an absolute transfer basis in order to avoid applications being filed before the Debt Conciliation Board and for them to easily repossess those properties. This was also looked into and that amendment in 1999 enabled even the transfer deeds executed in favour of a transaction which involved a loan transaction, could also be brought under the Debt Conciliation Ordinance.

So, we find that the Debt Conciliation Board has been entertaining applications. If you take a record of what has been happening during the year ending 31st December, 2010, we find that in addition to the 622 pending cases, there had been another 374 cases filed and during that period, almost 437 cases had been disposed of; either they had been rejected outright or some reconciliation entered into. So, the performance of the Debt Conciliation Board

is very satisfactory, considering the fact that it performs an important alternative dispute mechanism in the country.

In fact, the issue of alternative dispute resolution is gaining currency all over the world and in addition to the Debt Conciliation Board, we have the system of Mediation Boards regarding which I brought an amendment a month or two ago to this House, which sought to expand the jurisdiction of the Mediation Boards. Earlier, it was disputes only up to a maximum value of Rs. 25,000 that could be brought before the Mediation Boards. It was expanded to include any transaction up to Rs. 250,000 to be compulsorily sent for mediation. Now, that has resulted in a certain degree of cases that are going before the normal courts of law for resolution being now referred to Mediation Boards.

So, as a matter of fact, Hon. Speaker, this issue of alternate dispute mechanisms have to be further explored and as a matter of urgency our Ministry is considering even introducing judicial mediation. I would soon be bringing in amendments to the Civil Procedure Code before the House to enable even the judges to sit as mediators before trials are taken up, so that the normal adversarial proceedings in a court of law could be avoided and speedy justice would be dispensed with through our court system. So, that being the case, Hon. Speaker, I commend these Regulations to the House and expect that we will have them passed. Thank you.

[. . 2.14 ]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity to contribute to the amendments to the Regulations under the Debt Conciliation Ordinance that has been brought forward by my Colleague, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem. It is nothing but timely that we are talking of debt conciliation when the entire country is in a debt trap - nationally created and internationally administered - at the moment. So, on that particular basis, my first point, Hon. Minister, is why have you not looked at the debt trap the country is in, before you look at anything else? Now, you might say that there is no international perspective to this. But, all what we want to do is, from the Oppositions point of view, bring out certain salient facts that are affecting our countrys future.

Hon. Speaker, just a little while ago you made a reserved comment saying that you would look into the

sub judice matter on hedging. You are well aware that we foresaw the hedging scam in this country in September, 2008. It was visibly seen but the Cabinet of Ministers was forced by a Government official from the Central Bank saying that this was the advantage that the country would get, if by chance, the innovative approaches of hedging were utilized. Hedging, as is known, is a gamble. When the matter was going on positively, you had the Minister saying -

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Minister, what is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) My Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, is attempting to enter into the same debate on the matter that the Hon.
