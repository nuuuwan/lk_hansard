( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Deputy Chairman, 99 per cent of the people of this country - if you do a survey you will find it and so many people have done it - have said that Mr. Sarath Fonseka should immediately be released.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Sir, can you ask them to allow the Hon. Member to speak? They can reply later. Sir, his point is that the Prisons Ordinance does not make provision for political prisoners like Sarath Fonseka. It is only for people who are convicted of normal offences. Where are you going to keep political prisoners? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Okay. Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, you continue with your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, please give me two or three minutes extra.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) I can only give the time allotted to you. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) They are disturbing me. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, please sit down. Do not disturb.- [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Deputy Chairman, there is an element of doubt in the judgment given in Mr. Sarath Fonseka's case because one judge has said that he is totally innocent. So, in a situation like that, the Minister can intervene. One judge has said that he is innocent. - [Interruption.] So, the Minister can intervene and use his powers under the law to give Mr. Sarath Fonseka a pardon. Please do that. You will be remembered.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, it is important that we, in todays Discussion, concentrate on some of the advances that have been made in the recent past, particularly when it comes to judicial administration and in introducing and implementing new sets of legal reforms to strengthen the judicial sector in this country. In that regard, I must at the very outset, thank His Excellency the President for having considered some of the alternate dispute resolution mechanisms that have to be strengthened and for having provided in the Budget, a proposal to set up an International Neutral Arbitration Centre in Sri Lanka. As a matter of fact, this Government and its policy of treating this country as a hub for a variety of different activities, such as maritime air as well as commercial and knowledge hub, a combination of all these factors, would certainly be strengthened by trying to transform Sri Lanka into a place where we can have a very neutral international arbitration centre. As a matter of fact, countries in the region like Singapore and Hong Kong have developed this service industry, the international arbitration industry, into a multi-billion dollar earning sector. Therefore, this is a very timely move by His Excellency the President. On the advice of our Ministry he has included this proposal to set up an International Arbitration Centre in Colombo and this, as you all know, is a fast-improving alternate dispute resolution mechanism. Therefore, I would like to thank His Excellency the President and the Ministry of Finance and Planning for having considered this proposal and having included it in the Budget.

Furthermore, three acres of land has been allocated close to the Supreme Court Complex, in the former BCC Company land, to set up a complex in which we will include the International Arbitration Centre, as well as the courthouses which presently are situated - particularly the original courts - the District Courts and the High Courts, if possible the Magistrates Courts together with also the Attorney-Generals Department and the Legal Draftsmans Department. I believe this new court complex should ease the space constraints that we presently are faced with in Hulftsdorp. As we all know, the Superior Court Complex where even my Ministry is situated, is housing the Superior Courts, that is, the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, whereas, the District Court of Colombo, the High Courts which have been set up - the Civil Appellate High Courts as well as the Commercial High Courts - are all housed in colonial court buildings in Hulftsdorp, which are now becoming

1411 1412

2011 09

white elephants when it comes to maintenance purposes. Therefore, it is time that we convert those premises into a heritage building area and provide modern facilities for courthouses in the City of Colombo. Therefore, I must thank His Excellency the President for having allocated three acres of land as a Budget Proposal to set up this new court complex where a variety of other institutions will also be accommodated. I propose to set up a steering committee involving the heads of all these institutions, so that we will plan out and execute this proposal to set up a new Court Complex in Colombo.

Having said that, Hon. Deputy Chairman - during the limited time available to me - since a Delegation of Australian Members of Parliament are in the Gallery today, I must very particularly say that our Ministry is very thankful to the Australian Government in assisting us to bring out a Sentencing Policy Act, which we would be presenting to Parliament early next year in order to fulfil an important need that was felt badly throughout the history of our legal and judicial sector.

Indeed, we are grateful to the assistance rendered by the Department of the Attorney-General of Australia in formulating the policy background to this law. Once this law is introduced, there will be a firm guideline to be followed by the judiciary in imposing sentences and punishments so that the process will assume a unique uniformity throughout the courts of the entire country. We have also taken certain other important initiatives to strengthen the judicial sector, particularly when it comes to disposal of cases. In fact, His Excellency the President, in his Budget Speech, referred to the laws delays and the need to address the issue of laws delays and have generously-provided funds to the Supreme Court, in order to see that the laws delays are minimized and certain action is taken to expeditiously dispose of cases that are piling up in our court system. Towards that, Her Ladyship, the Chief Justice is giving leadership to try and improve the facilities in the Court Houses, particularly digitizing our procedures in the courthouses, computerizing the court registries and also the hearing in our court system. In that regard, I believe we will soon be able to also introduce the new amendments that are sought to be introduced to the Civil Procedure Code, where we will be able to introduce certain novel schemes such as the judicial mediation and we will be also having another tier of judges called Master of Rolls and Recorders who will be functioning, both at the levels of Magistrate's Court level and the District Courts level, where they would be able to handle the pre-trial issues and ease the pressure on the trial judges, which will go very much towards easing the pressure in our court system and towards expediting the disposal of cases.

In that regard, I must also thank our Secretary, Mr. Suhada Gamlath and his team for having painstakingly working day and night with a variety of legal experts to try and finalize the reforms in that regard. And, I am sure early next year, I would be able to introduce those amendments to the Civil Procedure Code, which would certainly be a revolutionary change in our system which will embody some of the features that were

there in the original AJL - Administrative Justice Law - which was a controversial law at that time, but, subsequently it was felt by the legal fraternity that certain features of the law would have certainly improved the backlog situation in our court system.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! Hon. Minister, please, wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, I am in the process of winding up, Hon. Deputy Chairman. There is a variety of issues to which I have to respond. There had been a few issues raised about prisoners being given pardon. There was a request by my learned Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, that I recommend a pardon to General Sarath Fonseka. There is a procedure that we follow in our Ministry. If at all, we are to recommend a pardon, a request has to be made by the prisoner or his family and if that request is made to my Ministry, certainly this matter will be considered. Having said that, I will conclude my remarks.

Thank you. [. . 11.45] .. ( ) ( .. - , ) (The Hon. D.M. Jayaratne - Prime Minister, Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs) , 6,50,000 . 6,50,000 5 30,00,000 . 1972 . , . . . , . .

Sir, there is a letter written by Mr. Somapala Gunadheera. He is a very senior Public servant who held

1447 1448

[ ... ]

2011 09

the position of GA, Trincomalee, for a long time. He has gathered some experience by being in the Eastern Province. He is a Sinhalese officer but worked in the Eastern Province to the satisfaction of everybody. I would like to quote a paragraph from his letter. This is what he says, I quote:

It is that knowledge of Tamil that helped me later to work among the Tamil residents in the jungles of Thennamaravadi, Tirumangalai and Sampur without the help of an interpreter, when I was GA, Trincomalee. I am aware of several other Sinhala GAs of the North who acquitted themselves with distinction despite the accident of their birth. Similarly language was no bar to Tamil GAs who worked in the South with remarkable success. Sivagnanam of Hambantota and Sivanandan of Matara and Galle come readily to my mind.

However the crux of the matter is not linguistic competence. To my mind, the decision to exchange GAs between the North and the South is one of the most far-sighted policy initiatives taken of late. Exchange of envoys is a symbolic gesture of bilateral

amity. Such exchange is bound to bridge the yawning gap between the North and the South with cross cultural fertilization. The leadership training gained through the initiative is bound to generate remarkable understanding and rapport between

the communities. Speaking for myself, it is my direct association with he North and the East that has created in my heart the deep concern and sympathy for the lot of the Tamils, which is reflected in the articles published in my ethnic Confrontation and National Integration in Sri Lanka.

He is the gentleman who has written the book, Ethnic Confrontation and National Integration in Sri Lanka. Such an experience has been acquired by this officer, a Sinhalese officer working in Trincomalee and now he advocates the appointment of these officers irrespective of community differences.

[3.13 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Mr. Presiding Member, I have to congratulate the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils for its endeavours to defeat its own objectives, than any other Ministry. After the end of the war, in order to hoodwink the people and the international community, in the month of December, 2009, the Consultative Committee on Local Government and Provincial Councils approved a national policy on local government and promulgated same by Extraordinary Gazette No. 1632/26 of 18th December, 2009. This was ratified by Parliament in the month of February, 2010. In this policy, the Government declared several noble objectives and commitments towards regional and local governance. What is happening to these policy objectives? What is happening to the much- advertised local government reforms? Whenever a crisis occurs, the Government makes announcements about devolution, local governance, regional governance, autonomous local governments and all such pompous statements. What is actually happening now?

After 1987, so much of noise was made in this country about devolution, empowerment and strengthening of second and third tiers of governance structures. What does the Budget provide towards these objectives in its Proposals? Ever since the Provincial Councils Act and the Pradeshiya Sabha Act were introduced in Parliament, the Finance Commission has not been able to properly assess the financial needs of the second and third tiers of

governance structures and provide adequate funds for their function and service delivery. Continuously, the Government Budgets ensured that the second and third tiers of governance structures get only around or less than 1 per cent of the total Government expenditure. In the Budget for 2012, the Government has allocated only 0.09 per cent of the total recurrent provision and 0.06 per cent of the capital allocation to the other two governance structures, namely, the entire provincial councils and local governments. What a ridiculous scenario? Does the Government have a real commitment, an intention and capacity to solve the ethnic problem if this is the treatment and respect it gives to the devolution process and local governance?

The Finance Commission is constituted according to the constitutional provisions. It has to perform its constitutional obligations. If it does not perform its constitutional obligations, we do not need to have a Finance Commission. If the Finance Commission is not able to discharge its constitutional responsibilities, who is undermining its functions? I am sure the Finance Commission is fully aware of the governance structures of this country and the governance responsibilities shared among the three tiers of governance structures, namely, central government, provincial councils and local government. It cannot function to defeat the objectives of the Government and the Constitution towards devolution and local governance. I am sure the Finance Commission does not constitute of a bunch of ignorant people. It would have given its recommendation at least to a reasonable extent. If so, does the Treasury have administrative authority to overrule the recommendation given by the constitutional authority? Can the Treasury cut down the recommendations made by the Finance Commission? If we have a constitutional provision, we have to honour it. The question is, how can you insulate the Finance Commission from the unconstitutional interferences made by the Treasury if it does exist? Or, we have to educate the different apparatus of the Government to work towards the same constitutional objectives.

The rulers of this country have trained the entire arms and institutions of the Government machinery to become devolution hostile. There is no regard to the rights of people to good local governance in this country. The Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils which is supposed to take the mantle to fulfil the noble objective of local governance and regional governance is totally insensitive and lethargic in this connection or they do not have the diagnostic ability to identify the disease that has plagued the governance structures in this country.

We may have to appoint another MBBS doctor as the Secretary to the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils. We do not see any tangible improvement in the capacities of the second and third tiers of governance structures over the past several years.

1485 1486

His Excellency the President in his Budget Proposals pronounced that he will continue with the strategies that will undercut the authorities of the provincial councils. The Government is not prepared to allow the provincial councils to take over their roles and responsibilities. Consistently, this year too the Budget has provided broader access to the national ministries to function in the sectors of agriculture, livestock, fisheries and sports. This is in addition to the financial provision made to the central ministries for subjects such as education, health, elders welfare, provincial roads, water supply, irrigation et cetera devolved to the provincial councils. This is how the national Budget is used as an effective instrument to undermine the devolution process and destabilize the country.

I submit to this august Assembly that in order to give a chance to the provisions of the Constitution to become operational in practical terms, the Government, instead of giving with one hand and taking it away with the other, should develop the capacities of the provincial councils to take over the development responsibilities without weakening them. We are yet to see credible signals and real commitment of the Government towards devolution. The Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils only aids and abets the other institutions in eroding the legitimate powers of provincial councils and local governments. We have never heard from the Minister any advocacies to protect the rights of the provincial councils and local governments. After providing less than 1 per cent of the total budget, how can one claim that provincial councils are white elephants? If you go through the Budgetary provisions for this year, you can identify a number of other white elephants in the Government.

Of course, whatever money the provincial councils get, however meagre they are, when compared to the total expenditure of the Government, it is also public money. It should be used in a purposeful way. I do not know whether the funds given to the Northern Provincial Council are properly utilized. According to statistics, the Northern Provincial Council is the least-fund utilized Provincial Council in the country as of July, 2011.

Sir, in our country, rumours are often founded on some facts. I wish to mention some of the stories that go around in Jaffna. The reason for the underutilization of funds is said to be the total interference by the Governor in the financial procedure. He has downgraded himself to the level of an imprest accountant and a certifying officer. I heard that departmental heads and the ministries have to get permission from the Governor for release of imprest on account of any work done according to an approved plan. He has to give the okay to make payments to the contractors. He often calls for meetings with contractors.

We have heard folk stories of a chieftain called "Mahadena Muththa. He is notorious for his mockeries. We have heard that he cut down trees, demolished structures in his way and et cetera. In todays context, this type of activities will be considered an encroachment into the affairs of others. The Governor of the North has constructed a luxury bungalow at a cost around Rs. 100 million for his use in a public trust property. He has also demolished a part of the parapet wall around this property and so on. This Army Major-General who used to demolish the properties of others and occupy them without anybodys permission earlier, continues his practice even now without considering any civil desires.

I would urge the Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs to stop this type of mockery done by using public funds and common properties without the consent of the people. I understand that the management of the property that I am referring to, namely, the Jaffna Old Park, has to be streamlined according to the Trust Ordinance in order to stop the misuses in future. The Governor also runs his bungalows in Kilinochchi, Vavuniya and Colombo, all out of public funds. He has engaged seven vehicles, including luxury ones, for his official purpose. Against technical advice, he ordered 16 heavy-duty air conditioners for Jaffna Weerasingam Hall and those were just fitted and kept for months and later removed and handed over to the Jaffna Hospital. Can the Governor appropriate some of the money voted by Parliament for provincial capital works, divert it to the capital work of a line ministry without the approval of the Parliament?

There is some procurement muddle, I hear. There are also rumours that the Governor of the Northern Province procured thousands of bicycles and sarees for give-away at exorbitant prices, more than the market rates, during the last Local Government Elections. The latest complaint is that the Governor directly interferes with the Secretaries of the Pradeshiya Sabhas. His Coordinating Secretary, a Major, who takes virtually all important administrative decisions in the Provincial Council, has placed orders for library books to the tune of about Rs. 30 million without properly following procedures in the selection of books, selection of suppliers et cetera. The personal staff of the Governor has put up a three-floor mansion and ordered for a luxury vehicle out of his personal income. No staff officer is close to the Governor due to his uncivil bullying approach. They are treated as sentry point soldiers, issued with sudden transfer orders, frequent admonitions and castigations. In fact, most of them will leave if they get a chance. This is the state of affairs in the Northern Provincial Council.

Sir, you are aware that after a very long period of time there were Local Government Elections in the North. There is a new generation of local level leaders, who need to be educated on local governance. The elected members need to be trained. The Provincial Department of the Local Government has been instructed not to train any Local Authority member.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, there is only one more minute left for you. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, please give me another minute. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Yes, I will give you a minute. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Thank you. These Local Authority members are the peoples representatives who have the legitimacy to run the Councils affairs. Most of them are TNA Members and therefore they should not be deprived of taking part in the process of local governance. They are not invited for any official functions. They are not supposed to be consulted in any matters that affect the people. This is the level of respect and recognition the elected representatives command in the Northern Province. This is how the people are set against the Government. How could there be reconciliation if these types of conditions prevail? This is the state of affairs of local governance and provincial governance in the Northern Province.

Sir, the Governments objectives for regional imbalance could be achieved only if the resources and authorities are granted to the next tiers of governance structures. The financial proposals and policies pronounced in this Budget are not going to take us anywhere in the direction of good governance, peace and prosperity in the country as declared by His Excellency the President.

Thank you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) In Kalmunai, I think there is a suboffice.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) That suboffice belongs to the Tamil people. - [Interruption.] That suboffice was established especially for the betterment of the Tamil people in that area. There are two Divisional Secretaries' Divisions: one is for the Muslims and the other is for the Tamils. I think it was established a long time ago, about 15 years back. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) We are prepared to consider it provided it serves the purpose of the people. But, setting up of Divisional Secretaries' Divisions on a communal basis is not the policy of the Government. I should tell you that. There was a team of officials who went and visited the area recently and their view is that the area is too small for a Divisional Secretary's Division. Anyway, if you insist on that, I can look into that. . ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) But, in the Ampara District, there is a Divisional Secretary's Division called Lahugala with only six Grama Niladhari Divisions. In Batticaloa, the Koralai Pattu Central is with only six Grama Niladhari Divisions. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) I need not tell the Hon.

[4.08 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Presiding Member, I am grateful for this opportunity to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration amongst others. In fact, my one complaint is that, not enough allocation has been made for the work of this extremely important Ministry. In the Budget Speech, His Excellency the President made clear the seminal contribution to national development of the activities associated with this Ministry and I can only hope that its work does not suffer from a shortage of resources.

In one sense, limitations on the funds allocated to the Ministry should not be a problem, because its work should be conducted by other ministries too. For instance, with regard to National Languages, a greater responsibility lies with the Ministry of Education. Given the continuous failure of our education system over the years to promote bilingualism, let alone the trilingualism that His Excellency requires in fulfilment of his vision for a prosperous, pluralistic and united Sri Lanka, there is also need for more work by the Ministry of Higher Education.

1501 1502

Given the need for better co-ordination in this regard, I hope that the recommendation in the Committee deliberations on the Ministry of Human Resources, to establish a Consultative Committee and a co-ordinating mechanism between the various ministries concerned, will bear fruit. It should be noted that the Ministry of Public Administration is also involved in this, given the important role that the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration should play in this regard. Some years back, when I first got involved in public life in an executive position, as Head of the Peace Secretariat, I noted to my line management that there would be no possibility of sustainable peace unless we developed a much more effective administration with better skills of communication as well as planning.

Every day that passes convinces me of this more and more, and unless we develop appropriate skills, and initiative in middle management as well as elsewhere, the excellent proposals in the Budget will come to nought. I hope that the Ministry of Public Administration, as well as the Ministry responsible for public sector reforms, will fast forward plans in this regard and ensure effective implementation.

To return to the particular question of communication skills, since we have so many Ministries to work in this area, it might be argued that we do not in fact need a Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration. But, it is precisely because those Ministries have not effectively pursued practical programmes in this regard that we need a Ministry like this to propose innovations and ensure at least pilot programmes. It could, for instance, ensure the development of new teacher training models, given that in the near seventy years since J.R. Jayewardene moved his fatal motion that straitjacketed our students in monolingualism, State institutions have failed to produce sufficient teachers for the national languages. Of course it is our rural schools and our rural children who have suffered most because of this.

At the height of the colonial period, good schools and good teacher training institutes were a monopoly of the various churches. But, in order to pursue equality of opportunity, visionaries such as Colonel Olcott and Arumuka Navalar did not destroy what was effective, rather they built up similar institutions to provide benefits to others. I believe, since it would be difficult for the Ministry of Education to move quickly in this regard, given the destructive mentality of many of those who claim an egalitarian outlook, that the Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration can, in fulfilment of its mandate, encourage associations like the Buddhist Theosophical Society or its modern day equivalents to take a lead in this regard. Even better, it could perhaps encourage joint ventures, where students of different communities could learn and learn to teach subjects

essential to the modern Sri Lankan world, such as English, spoken Sinhala, spoken Tamil, Mathematics and Science, under the guidance of mentors representing different religious outlooks working together.

Such institutions, at appropriate levels, could also assist with the catch-up education that is so badly needed in areas previously afflicted by conflict, but also in rural areas in the rest of the country. Such education, leading to basic qualifications in useful subjects, to include vocational and aesthetic subjects, would provide qualifications for Government employment, whilst enhancing earning capacity for those seeking foreign employment.

This is particularly important in a context in which many bright youngsters do not have the basic qualifications to apply, for instance, to the Police, in which it is imperative that we enrol youngsters of different ethnic groups. Courses that would include physical training and leadership skills, conducted under the aegis of religious leaders, would provide an ideal foundation for the disciplined and energetic youngsters who should contribute together to national security.

Sir, I believe it is essential that a Ministry like this one, entrusted with such important responsibilities for our national life, should think outside the box, and develop initiatives that will fulfil its objectives imaginatively and comprehensively. Mechanisms to develop more and more better translators, to facilitate youngsters meeting and working and playing together, to promote creative cultural productions as well as social service projects implemented together, all these should be thought of and refined and implemented through the officials of this Ministry working together with and inspiring other officials.

I have dwelt at length on new ideas, and I hope that some of these at least will be considered, so that this Ministry will have the impact it requires and deserves. But, I should note too, the sterling commitment of the Minister and his Secretary and their officials, and the excellent work they have done in promoting confidence in the North by their work in providing documentation, their efforts to ensure that the National Language Policy is followed by all Departments including Parliament itself, their teaching programmes through their National Languages Institute and others. But, these seem drops in the ocean compared to the enormous work that needs to be done. So, I hope very much that the Ministry will also work on new imaginative programmes on the lines described and ensure that the other Ministries that need to be productive in this regard are inspired to work towards the results specifically entrusted to this important and invaluable Ministry.

Thank you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon R. Yogarajan. You have 20 minutes.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Presiding Member, I rise to speak today on the Votes of the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs, the Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration and also the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils. The Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs has initiated the process of re-demarcating the boundaries of the Divisional Secretaries' Divisions, which is very essential and they should be more rationally divided so that there would, in the future, be a better and clearer administration, which is a necessary thing. We commend you for initiating this process.

However, the most important issue that I wish to take up here is the division of the Nuwara Eliya District into Divisional Secretaries' Divisions. Nuwara Eliya has a population of 700,000 people as declared per the 2002 Census but only five Divisional Secretaries' Divisions. It is a pity that no one took any interest in providing the services necessary for the people in this district in a proper manner by delimiting the Divisional Secretaries' Divisions in such a way that the people could approach their Divisional Secretaries' Divisions without much difficulty.

The Nuwara Eliya Divisional Secretary's Division has a population of 206,000 persons. From Kandapola up to Talawakele, there is one Divisional Secretary's Division with a distance of about 50 kilometres from one end to the other. Similarly, the Ambagamuwa Divisional Secretarys Division, from Ginigathena up to Talawakele is again about 50 kilometres in distance. So, this will be corrected, I believe, once the present delimitation committees conclude their process of delimitations. In this process, there have been consultations taking place with political parties and civil society organizations at the district level. The need to divide the Nuwara Eliya and Ambagamuwa Divisional Secretaries' Divisions has been an accepted fact. It has now been proposed by some of the political parties in the district and by civil society organizations in the district, that it should be done based on the population of the Divisional Secretary's Division. The practice in the country generally is that, any area where there is a population of 40,000 to 50,000 persons is divided into one Divisional Secretarys Division. On this basis it has been suggested that the Nuwara Eliya Divisional Secretarys Division, which has a population of 206,000 people, be divided into four units namely; Nuwara Eliya and three other divisions based in Nanuoya, Agarapathana and Talawakele. I feel this suggestion by the political parties and civil society organizations is fair because I think a

population of 50,000 is quiet reasonable. But, the preceding speaker, the Hon. Selvarasa, pointed out that there are Divisional Secretary's Divisions with a mere population of 6,000. So 50,000 is not too much. However, there were some Members and I believe my good Friend, the Hon. Navin Dissanayake was also present at those consultations and he was suggesting only two Divisional Secretaries' Divisions for Nuwara Eliya and two for Ambagamuwa.

I plead with the Hon. Navin Dissanayake that it would become more administratively -

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake - Minister of Public Management Reforms)

. . rose.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes, please go ahead.

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) We did have a meeting in Nuwara Eliya about two weeks ago and the original formula was for two. But, we had a very consensual approach and now we have agreed to three.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Why not four?

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) The Tamil parties were proposing three. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) They were proposing one for Nanuoya also. Then, when you were insisting on two, they compromised for three. But, if you would come along and if we can have four for Nuwara Eliya -

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) I was insisting on two.

1505 1506

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) If you would come along with our suggestion and accept four as you know the district so well, it would be good. Nuwara Eliya, Nanuoya, Agarapatana and Talawakelle would be ideal to house the offices of these four Divisional Secretaries Divisions. ( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) Hon. Member, I was the one -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Four would be ideal, I believe, and I would request you to reconsider your decision. If you consent to it, I am sure all the others would consent. In fact, the representative from the UNP, Mr. Piyasiri, the Provincial Council Member was present. He also suggested four. ( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) No, no.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) He did.

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) Can I rectify that?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes, please do. ( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) The original formula was for two. Then, the Tamil parties came up with three. So, we agreed and went along with three. Mr. Piyasiri proposed four but the majority of the Tamil parties including Mr. Sathasivam and Mr. Radhakrishnan together with Mr. Thondaman wanted three. So, we agreed to that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) There has been a written request submitted for four Divisions for Nuwara Eliya and four Divisions for Ambagamuwa. If you could agree to that, I am sure the Tamil parities would not have any objection. It will be very conducive to have these Divisions in these four towns. I am sure you would agree.

We should look at it not as Tamil parties or Sinhala parties. We should look at it as an administrative exercise to maximize services to the people. Thinking in that direction if you would consent, I am sure we could have four Divisions for Nuwara Eliya and four Divisions for Ambagamuwa. I am glad that you intervened. I gave way because I believe that it is only by consensus and discussion that we could achieve it. If we could have discussed it outside and agreed, it would have been even better.

Similarly, for Ambagamuwa again with a population of 202,000, it has been suggested that it be divided into four units with Ginigathhena, Hatton, Norwood and Maskeliya as the four centres around which these Divsional Secretaries' Divisions should be formed. In fact, the need for these four units has already been acknowledged by the Pradeshiya Sabhas. Each of the Pradeshiya Sabhas have offices or suboffices in the four places that I mentioned here.

Further, there has been a suggestion that the Kotmale Divisional Secretary's Division be divided into two units with one office in Kotmale and the other around Pundaluoya. Similarly, a suggestion that Walapone and Ragala be made two divisions has also been, I think, accepted by consensus.

In Kotmale, there is a population of 96,000. Divide it into two and with about a population of 48,000, it would be an ideal Divisional Secretarys Division according to all other accepted constitutions in the other areas of the country. Similarly, Walapone with a population of 106,000 and with Ragala and Walapone being two divisions, it would make it ideal not only for administration but also to meet the aspirations of the people in that area.

Sir, then I would like to speak about the State sector employment. I have been talking about this issue several times now.

But, I see a positive sign from the Government. I have always said that the State Sector employments in 2001 was calculated - I do possess a document from the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs & Administrative Reforms. This is a letter issued by the then Secretary or written by the then Secretary to the Attorney-General regarding the implementation of Public Administration Circular No. 15/90, which provided for recruitment only on the basis of competitive exams and also included a basis of ethnic ratio for recruitment. This was challenged in the Supreme Court only for promotions and the promotion that was pursued was considered null and void because it was on a basis of ethnic ratio. But, the process of recruitment itself was not stuck down by the Supreme Court. The Government opted not to implement that Circular at all, including recruitment. But, today, your Government has accepted that recruitment can proceed because you have started implementing PA

1507 1508

2011 09

Circular No. 15/90 in the Eastern Province. If I am to tell you why it is implemented only in the Eastern Province and not in the rest of the country, it may look bad. Maybe you want to correct the ratio of the population in the Eastern Province to tally with the Public servants in the Eastern Province and you feel it is good to implement PA Circular No. 15/90 in the Eastern Province. But, are you not discriminating the rest of the Tamil people in the country? And, if we go to the Supreme Court, under Section 12 of the Constitution and say that we are being treated unequally in the rest of the country whereas the people in the Eastern Province are being differentiated again, then, I am sure the Supreme Court will have to rule either that Circular No. 15/90 should not be implemented in the Eastern Province or that it should be implemented all over the country. We do not want you to stop any affirmative action that you are taking in the Eastern Province to favour someone. At the same time - ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara - Minister of National Languages and Social Integration) In the Eastern Province, it is proceeding. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, Sir, it is not proceeding. It has been implemented for the last two years in the Eastern Province but you have not implemented it in the rest of the country. If you would accept that it would proceed and will be implemented in the rest of the country for all recruitments, then the process of recruiting SLAS officers through a special examination only in the Tamil language, then you are giving them a special affirmative action to proceed to appoint about 70 SLAS Officers in the Tamil medium. But, if you have this Circular No. 15/90 implemented, there would not be any need for a separate examination in the Tamil Language. This also would assist you. Today, we find that the percentage of the Sinhala persons only in Public Sector employment has risen from 91 or 92 to 94 per cent. Now, you are endeavouring to teach Tamil -

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Hon. Member, are you referring to the recruitment in the Administrative Service?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, not in the Administrative Service, but in the entire Public Service. All three minority communities together comprise 25 per cent of the population. Their share of Public Sector employment is only 6 per cent. And, it has come down from 8 per cent in 2002 to 6 per cent today. Under those circumstances, you have to teach more

people the Tamil language for them to serve the other 25 per cent of the Tamil-speaking people. Instead, if you give a fair opportunity for the Tamil-speaking people to enter the Public Service, it would definitely make it easier for you. If this policy had been followed from 1990 as envisaged by the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, by now you would have solved two-thirds of the problem.

A generation is 30 years. With the new generation it would have all been on par. In fact, in the Ambagamuwa Divisional Secretary's Office, there are 70 officers. There is only one officer who can speak Tamil, whereas 70 per cent of the population in the Pradeshiya Lekam Division is Tamil-speaking. So, Hon. Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs and Hon. Minister of National Languages and Social Integration, we have to look at it not as an ethnic issue or a communal issue but look at it as an administrative issue. Are you providing the services required by these people in full or not? If you are failing in providing those services, then you have to make the amendments that are necessary.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) We have begun to correct this situation. As far as the Administrative Service is concerned, in 2009, not a single Tamil-speaking officer has passed the examination. You are quite aware of it. In order to correct that situation, now we are holding a separate examination.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I acknowledged that. But at the same time - ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) We are recruiting 60 SLAS officers from that examination. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) This is only for SLAS officers. If you implement Circular No. 15/90 for the Public Service -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Now, I would like to tell you this. For the first time in 2010, we have recruited 323 management assistants. Then, in 2011, we recruited 480 management assistants in the Tamil medium. Likewise, we are increasing the number of Public servants who are being recruited.

This happened because for about five years no recruitment was done from among the Tamil-speaking people. Now, we are doing that. So, in another couple of years, I hope we could bring about a balance.

1509 1510

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Hon. Minister. But, if you feel it is fair to implement the Public Administration Circular No. 15/90 in the Eastern Province, how would it be unfair -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) I admit one thing. I confess that it has not been done on the proportional basis you assert. What I say is, the recruitment has been made purely on merit.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes, on merit. Now, you are going to take those 60 SLAS officers on merit, but from the Tamil medium. So, once you implement the PA Circular No. 15/90, then out of the total number you are recruiting, a certain number would go to a particular group of community. Within that, they would have to compete for a place on merit.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) But, the only question is whether the members of the community you are referring to, have sat for the exam.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes, they should have sat for the exam. It is true.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) That qualification should be there. But, I doubt whether -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Right. Now, you are providing a special gateway for Tamil-speaking persons to get into the SLAS on and off and at your discretion. But, make it a system so that it is there for everyone. If you can do it in the Eastern Province, why can you not do it in the rest of the country?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) It has not been done in the Eastern Province; this is not something that has been done in respect of the Eastern Province. As far as the SLAS officers and the administrative assistants are concerned, there is no separate system of recruitment for the Eastern Province. It is purely on merit.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Minister, I can submit to you the Gazette Notification by which the Governor of the Eastern Province has called for applications. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) That is for Provincial Council recruitments. I am referring to the Central Government recruitments. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) But, the Central Government has recommended to the Governor of the Eastern Province to use PA Circular No. 15/90. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only one more minute. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I was talking about the language. You are making efforts to bring trilingualism into the administration. You are training officers from among those who are already employed in the Service for them to serve the public in the Tamil medium. What I was suggesting was that people from a particular community be recruited into the system. There was a meeting presided by the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva when he was Minister of Healthcare and Nutrition. They were to recruit midwives and nursing staff to be trained in the Tamil medium to serve in the estate hospitals that were being taken over. There was a suggestion that only Tamil persons be taken from all the provinces - ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Give me one more minute, Sir.

( ) (The Presiding Member) You have already taken an extra minute.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) With this point, I will finish my speech, Sir.

There was a proposal from the Director-General of Health Services of the Southern Province - as the Tamil people in that area know Sinhalese - as to whether they should not recruit Sinhalese for those positions. The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva very rightly said, "Not only the language, but their culture is also important.

So, you reserve the recruitments for those hospitals even in the Southern Province to the Tamils". That was a very generous decision he made, for which I appreciate and commend him.

If that type of attitude can be entertained by the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs, I am sure that would remove 90 per cent of the causes for all the problems in our country. I hope the Hon. Minister would accept that and think of looking again at the Public Administration Circular No. 15/90, which is not considered unconstitutional now, but only for the Eastern Province. It is not unconstitutional for the rest of the country. So, kindly implement it.

Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Navin Dissanayake. You have 10 minutes. [. . 4.37]

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Hon. Minister, I need just one clarification. I want to know whether you can implement the Tamil Language (Special Provisions) Act. Can you do that?

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Yes, I think we are moving towards that. Hon. Member, as you know, the Tamil areas are presently governed and administered in the Tamil language. In those areas, the courts function in Tamil, the offices function in Tamil and the administration in general keeps all the records in Tamil.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) This is not done in the Ampara and Trincomalee Districts.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) No, I am not talking about districts. ( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Not only that, if you send Sinhala officers who do not know Tamil, how can they implement this?

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) I will come to that matter later. I will come to the points that you have raised. Firstly, it is not district-wise, it is the Divisional Secretary's, area-wise. The language provisions are applicable on the Divisional Secretary's, area-wise. Some are - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) According to the Regulations, the Tamil language is to be used in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, for transaction of all Government and public business and the maintenance of public records.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) What does it say? ( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) The Tamil Language (Special Provisions) Act states that the Tamil language is to be used in the Northern and Eastern Provinces for transaction of all Government and public business and the maintenance of public records.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) I agree that that particular Act states, ....the Northern Province and Eastern Provinces... but in practical terms, the entire Northern Province may be administered in Tamil but certainly not the Eastern Province, because a large number of Sinhala Divisional Secretaries' Divisions are there. So, we have to make adjustment in order to govern and administer those areas in Sinhala. That is the practical adjustment.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Are you administering the areas in the hill-country where there is a Tamil majority, in Tamil ?

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) I will come to the situation in the hill-country. What I am presently saying is, in all the Divisional Secretaries' Divisions in the Northern Province, administration of justice and keeping of records are done in Tamil. Similarly, in the Eastern Province, the Divisional Secretaries' Divisions, which are declared as Tamil Divisional Secretaries' Divisions are also administered in Tamil and the records are kept in Tamil. Then, in the Sinhala Divisional Secretaries' Divisions, it is different. Even in the Muslim Divisional Secretaries' Divisions, it is in Tamil. The judicial proceedings are also in Tamil. Therefore, we have been able to get that going as far as we are concerned. That is how we stand presently. But, we are only, as I said, two and a half years away from a 30-year protracted war. There had been a very sharp distancing of communities during this period which even brought about antagonistic feelings. Now, we are trying to remedy it; we are trying to cure it.- [Interruption.]

Now, you are talking about the ethnic ratio in employment. We are taking steps towards that. It is only two and a half years now since the war ended and these will not happen overnight, not even in one year. It will take two to three years for this to happen.

In regard to the SLAS exam, you admitted how the Hon. Minister went out of his way and had it in order to recruit Tamil officers.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! Hon. Minister, we have a large number of Heads to be passed.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) In those circumstances, I cannot speak further.

ADJOURNMENT

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , " " .

. . Question proposed.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Now, the Adjournment Motion to be moved by the Hon. Tharanath Basnayaka. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) What is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) This Adjournment Motion is sub judice. There is a case pending before the courts on this matter. Standing Order No. 84 (vi) states, I quote:

No member shall refer to any matter which is under adjudication by a court of law or to any matter on which a judicial decision is pending."

1579 1580

2011 09

The case No. is: 1674 and a charge sheet has already been filed and the case is pending in courts. So, I do not think that the Hon. Member can take up this Motion in the House today. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the gist of the Motion is, "What action has been taken in respect of the assault on Mr. Rajpal Abeynayake?". What has been asked by the Hon. Member in this Motion is about the action that has been taken in this regard. So, the Government has to reply. We are not going to discuss the merits of the case. The Government will reveal as to what action has been taken. The fact that there is a court case is different. But, we are not going to discuss the merits of this incident - I mean we are not going to go into - as to who did this, who is responsible and all that. Therefore, the Government can respond to this. This does not attract that particular Standing Order the Hon. Member has brought before you. It is not sub judice because we are not going to discuss a substantive issue in that fashion. ( ) (An Hon. Member) The Hon. Members Motion is not sub judice. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Hon. Deputy Chairman, the second paragraph of the Motion says, I quote:

" , ."

In fact, it is not correct to take up this Motion. You see, a case has been filed; a case number is also given and already bail has been granted to the suspect. You are talking about the merits of the case. When this Motion is taken up, the Members will talk about the merits of the case. It is very clear. The Government does not need to answer this. There is a case number and the case is pending before the courts. Therefore, it is sub judice. All what the Government can say is that there is a case; the suspect has been produced and he is released on bail. What more can the Government say on this? - [Interruption.] It is sub judice.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Hon. Deputy Chairman, if there is anything that is sub judice in the speeches made, then, you are entitled to remove that from Hansard or warn the Members not to refer to matters which would become sub judice or which will affect the administration of justice.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) If there is anything sub judice, those portions will be expunged from the speeches of the Hon. Members. Hon. Tharanath Basnayaka, now you can move your Adjournment Motion.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Can I read this section again, Sir? - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) No, I have already given the order. Hon. Tharanath Basnayaka, you carry on. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, just give me one minute. I will just try to explain this. Standing Order No. 84 (vi) states, I quote:

No member shall refer to any matter which is under adjudication by a court of law to any matter on which a judicial decision is pending.

So, this matter is under adjudication by a court. Therefore, this is very clear. If you allow this, -

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) No, not any matter - [Interruption.] You have to understand this. We are not referring to the matter under adjudication. All the Hon. Member wants to know is, what action has been taken in respect of this assault. That is all.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) That means, we can talk about any case -

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) No, we are not talking about the case. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) I am raising this issue; I have given you the case number, a matter is pending before the courts and already the suspect is released on bail. This is what the Hon. Member is asking. - [Interruption.] So, the Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees can give a ruling on this.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you cannot discuss facts of the case; you can only discuss the action. Hon. Basnayaka, you can carry on with the Motion.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, this is a Debate on the Adjournment Motion. If a Member is speaking, his speech must have substance. What he is doing is, reading out a list of names, which is against the Standing Orders. Sir, you cannot allow him to go on like this. He can join the Department of Archaeology - he will be given a good job there, I think - not to act as a Member of Parliament. Shame! Where are the UNP and the JVP Members?

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, you carry on.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) - .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) My foot! Sir, he says that the President is responsible for that. Sir, either he must withdraw that or it must be expunged. - [Interruption.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Now, I call upon the Hon. Minister to reply. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the Hon. Minister will give me a few minutes to speak.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Five minutes will be enough for me. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay, there is time.

Sir, unashamedly, Rajpal Abeynayake, who is a renowned journalist and an award-winning media personnel, was attacked. Some names of media personnel have been mentioned. Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala, I am also a journalist. I started my life as a journalist in the Thinakaran newspaper of Lake House. Sir, I am only asking this. Leaving aside the case; leaving aside the fact that the assailant is evading arrest by the police, about 50 lawyers, most of them green lawyers, are going and pleading for them. None of the people have the audacity to - [Interruption.] point of Order ?

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, what is the Hon. Member talking about? The person has been released on bail. The Hon. Member is leading somewhere else; either he has gone mad

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

or he does not know what he is talking about. - [Interruption.] There are no facts. He is making remarks, which are utter rubbish. Sir, that is sub judice.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! If there is anything against the Standing Orders, that will be expunged. Hon. Azwer, you carry on.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Rajpal Abeynayake is still in the General Hospital, in Ward No. 6. The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella and I went there. - [Interruption.] Where are those people? That is what I am asking. Have the free media personnel got a conscience? I am asking you. ? Fort Railway Station ? ? ?

Sir, I bring to your notice another matter. According to Chapter 78 of the Prisons Ordinance, a convicted prisoner cannot talk to the media; he cannot even gesticulate. That is exactly what Sarath Fonseka is doing daily. He is violating all the Ordinances and Regulations; he launches into a tirade against the Government and the President. I ask the Hon. Minister to bring that to the notice of the Hon. Minister of Justice and the Commissioner-General of Prisons and stop that. If that is allowed, all the prisoners - they are asking us - must also be given the right and the liberty to speak out. He has been convicted. What can we do? That was a court judgment, Sir.

Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Now, allow the Hon. Minister to reply. ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella - Minister of Mass Media and Information) , .
