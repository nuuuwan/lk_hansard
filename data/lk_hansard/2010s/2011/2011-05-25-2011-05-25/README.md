... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , ? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Standing Orders are very specific that once the Members enter the House, they have to resume their seats. As was said by Erskine May and very well practised in the House of Commons, any Member who wishes to speak and catches the eye of the Speaker first, can speak. It is against the Standing Orders for any Member to stand in the House when he does not speak. And, there is a parade-like demonstration in this House today, which is also against the Standing Orders. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, give me one minute. You must ask them to withdraw and hold an inquiry as to how these placards have been brought into the House. It is a very serious matter. It sets a bad precedent. You have to hold an inquiry first into the conduct of the Leader of the Opposition. We thought he defeated President Premadasa. But, it is not so. His brain is like that of a child.

Azwer) He is referring to an Hon. Member of this House. I ask whether he is referring to the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa, Member of Parliament.? It that is so, it must be expunged. He must withdraw that. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . [ ] . , . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) , . ? If he is referring to a Member of the House, then that must be expunged. He cannot do that. He is referring to the conduct of a Member, which is not allowed under the Standing Orders.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. You have five minutes.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I was so surprised to hear that a person of the calibre of the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga speaking in the way he just did, brought credit to the country as a cricketer, but if he would do well to cleanse his heart of malice and hatred, that would do him good. I know his father, the late Hon. Reggie Ranatunga very well. When Arjuna was playing cricket, I used to send his scores across the Floor to his father. At that time, I was responsible in asking the then Speaker, Hon. Anura Bandaranaike to get a television set installed in the restaurant for those people to watch cricket. That much of interest we showed towards cricket. When Arjuna was batting, Sir, I was in the commentary box not only here, even in other countries. I like this game of cricket very much. . , , ; . . , one of the greatest achievements is the building of the Suriyawewa Stadium. The Suriyawewa International Cricket Stadium is a

masterpiece in architecture. What is he speaking today about this? I should remind him that unfortunately he could not win the election that he fought to become the Chairman of the Cricket Board. He got only two votes; not even his own Club, SSC, voted for him. That is your plight. That is your fate. What can we do? You know how very friendly I was with your late father.

Sir, he made a remark about me, which is against the Standing Orders, which I could not hear properly. Please make an order to expunge that from the Hansard.

I was one who was much privileged to watch the First World Cup played at the London Oval in 1975. It was during that match that Dulip Mendis and Sunil Weththamuni got injured.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Okay. That is not a point of Order. Hon. Azwer, you can carry on.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is playing foul, Sir, today and it is very unfortunate. I feel sorry for him. He cannot patiently listen. He brought credit to the country, no doubt. But, "cleanse his heart of malice and hatred, that would do him good". That is what I said.

Sir, when I was watching the Sri Lanka-Australia World Cup at the London Oval, with Azahim Mohamed and Amar Kamil Present Special Commissioner of Colombo, Dulip Mendis and Sunil Weththamuni got injured. I have got some very exclusive pictures taken at that time and I think they are not available even in our media offices today. The Hon. Stanley Tillekeratne, the Speaker at that time and the Hon. Minister of Sports, the Hon. K.B. Ratnayake visited the grounds to see that match. You know the interest I have as far as cricket is concerned. Sir, on this occasion, I must pay a tribute to the memory of that great man, the late Hon. Gamini Dissanayake. It is because of his valiant efforts that we were given the ICC status.[ ] . ? . ? , . [ ]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you have one more minute. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I must allow time for the Hon. Minister to reply. Sir, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa,will go on record as one President who helped greatly to develop cricket in this country. Three international cricket stadia were built and developed within a short period of time. Suriyawewa was a place where ganja plants were grown. The President built one of the most magnificent cricket stadia or the master pieces in the whole world. It is one of the best stadia in the world. You ask from knowledgeable people, even Tony Greig had eloquently praised about the Suriyawewa Stadium, the R. Premadasa Stadium and the

Pallekele Stadium. We have produced great men like Muttiah Muralitharan. I pay my tribute today in this House to Kumar Sangakkara and his team for winning the runners-up cup in India. Sir, in cricketing parlance we say, "it is through a whisk that we lost the World Cup this time". The amount of interest the President is showing towards cricket is highly commendable. It is Arjuna Ranatunga who must praise the President, not anyone else because he knows what cricket is. I pay, as I told, our tribute to the late Hon. Gamini Dissanayake. He made us gain the ICC status. We also have produced great men in other sports. Remember, Mr. M.J.M. Lafir, the person who brought the First World Championship to Sri Lanka.

The other day His Excellency the President himself made use of the opportunity at a Group Meeting to pay a compliment to our new Minister of Sports, the Hon. Mahindanada Aluthgamage for all the efforts he had taken to make the World Cup series a great success in our country.

I would once again say that Hashan Tillakaratne must reveal the names of those people whom he says were involved in match-fixing. Otherwise, he will be playing a foul game. If he is clean, why should he hide the names? He is in the dock now. Now, it is the time of our Hon. Minister to speak.

Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage - Minister of Sports ) , . . . . [ ] , 75 105 . 105 30 ; 15; 15; 15; 10; 20. 105 . . 105 . 75 . -- , . . . , . , , , . . . . .
