: : PRIVILEGE : REMOVAL OF POLICE PERSONNEL FROM DRIVING VEHICLES OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION ( )

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I must thank you for giving me this opportunity to raise this matter of Privilege. This is a matter pertaining to the facilities provided for the Leader of the Opposition. I hope you will take this up with the Hon. Speaker and with the Government because there are seven of us who are officers of Parliament, starting from the Hon. Speaker, yourself, Deputy Chairman of Committees, my Colleague on the other side, myself, the Chief Government Whip and the Chief Opposition Whip. The facilities for five of us are provided through Parliament on a decision taken by the Government. When I was the Prime Minister up to 2004, there were police personnel specially trained to drive my vehicle. When I became the Leader of the Opposition, being the normal practice, those drivers were also made available to me together with the vehicles made available by Parliament, other than one Benz vehicle that was made available by the Presidents Office.

Now, it is a well-established practice that there are trained police personnel who are made available for VIPs in addition to the President and the Prime Minister. Former presidents have had this facility. The late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar too had that at one time when he was in the Opposition. There were other former Prime Ministers to whom the same facility was given. This practice has also been approved by the Police. Now, my security officer has been informed by the Police Department that the permission of the Inspector-General of Police should be obtained for police personnel to drive vehicles and they cannot drive any vehicle other than the vehicles belonging to the Police Department.

I think this is a rather absurd position because I know that for the former Inspectors-General of Police, for DIGs and others, there were police personnel to drive their vehicles. There are many other officials also who have them. But, I am now in a very peculiar position because except for one driver provided by Parliament, the others who drive my vehicles are from the Police Department. I have no other person to drive my vehicles. I may have to

55 56

2011 06

go back to three-wheelers if the Hon. Speaker and the Government are not willing to provide me with vehicles. This is setting aside the facilities of the Leader of the Opposition, which have been agreed to by parties and it has even been confirmed by letter dated 7th May, 2004 where the Director, MSD, has granted permission in keeping with this practice. So, I am in a very difficult position unless the Police gives me vehicles. I shall have to return the car that the Presidents Office has given me. I have even used my own private vehicle at my own expense as a backup vehicle because one of the vehicles given by Parliament is really more in the repair garage than in my own garage. So, I can change all that if the Police gives me vehicles and I will be more than happy to use them. But, as it stands now, my point is this: the facilities given to the Leader of the Opposition can be changed, if at all, by talking to him or if the Government does it, but you cannot have an official deciding on it. As from time to time when IGPs change and directors change, I cannot be running here and there. I especially asked the Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, who is the official of Parliament, to write to the Inspector-General of Police, which he did on the 10th of August, 2011 but he has not yet received a reply. Therefore, I would like this matter to be taken up with the Government. If the Government is taking away this facility, at least give me a three-wheeler; an official one. I thought I should tell this to the Hon. Speaker and the Government so that you could give me a reply next time.

I faced a rather odd situation when I went down the Southern Highway after having received the permission of the Secretary, Ministry of Defence. The MSD said, "If any policeman drives a vehicle on that highway, he will be removed". I said, "No, I cannot stop in the middle of the road; you had better go and I will sort it out later". There are some issues on the highway also that will be taken up later. I think the highway requires the highway patrol and not the traffic patrol. There are many things to be done. I mean, this is a rather absurd position where officials do not reply and I have to raise it in this House. It should never have happened. But, since we have come to that stage, I thought that I would I put it on record.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I will refer this matter to the Hon. Speaker and let him take appropriate action. I believe the Government should look after facilities of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and protect him.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Before too long, you will be able to getting the same benefit.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Thank you very much for that comment.

The Government has been consistently and demonstrably committed to ensuring the countrys long-term security and stability; conditions essential for achieving peace, socio-economic development and prosperity. The countrys transition to a post-conflict phase, characterized by a peaceful process of normalization and development, is a visible result of that commitment. Consequently, the Government endeavours to incrementally strengthen national law enforcement institutions and processes in the interest of future peace, security and stability. As such, the proposed Bill specifically has as its objective, the establishment of a permanent National Police Academy dedicated to developing the professional knowledge and skills of police officers through advanced training and education.

There is a need to curb organized crime of growing sophistication, and the security risk posed by such crimes, both nationally and transnationally, has led law enforcement agencies of many developed and developing countries to become more specialized and sophisticated in terms of concepts, organization, technology, training, education and operations. Similar advances are taking place in the sphere of general policing thus contributing towards reducing both crime and the fear of crime within communities. Taking these factors into consideration, long-term sustainable measures as in part-proposed by this Bill, are being instituted by the Government with the objective of improving the overall capacity of the Police Service to perform its multifarious duties associated with the prevention, detection and investigation of crimes and offences. These measures are consistent with the current international best practice in terms of institutional design, professional ethos, objectives, and functional specialization.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is envisaged that the proposed Academy, inter alia, would be endowed with expertise from various fields relevant to policing such as law, criminology, investigation, public security, public relations, forensics, information technology and management. Furthermore, based on its statutory corporate structure, objective and functions, it is expected that the proposed Academy would gradually develop the capacity to cater to the special training and educational needs of various other law enforcement agencies in addition to that of the Police Department.

[3.09 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the lawmakers of this country today are debating the National Police Academy Bill in the midst of a crisis of lawlessness that has plagued the administration of the Police. As I begin, the Hon. Minister of Justice looks in my direction. He is the one who, at the time he spoke from his conscience, stated very clearly that everyday the rule of law is broken in this country. On Monday, the 4th of October, 2011, just two days ago, we heard of the drowning - I repeat drowning" - of a suspect in the Bolgoda Lake while he was in Police custody during what the Police called a "scuffle" between them and the suspect. How many times must such tragedies be endured? We can only recall the horrific and macabre scenes played out in public in broad daylight of the drowning in the Bambalapitiya Sea of Balawarnam Sivakumar, a young mentally unstable man after he was forced deeper and deeper into the water by the Police Officers, assaulting him mercilessly with clubs. Just last week, the killing of Gayan Rasanga by the Police in Dompe while he was in Police custody, provoked the local community to protest outside the Police Station. Some months ago, Roshan Shanaka, another young man of 22 years, was killed when Police opened fire on protestors in the Free Trade Zone in Katunayake. In the North and the East, police brutality is a way of life. Public protests that have erupted all over the North and the East in response to the widely-believed involvement of the Police and the Armed Forces in the "Grease Devil" saga, have been met with violent retaliation from the authorities; a number of people have died and scores more badly injured. Some of the assaults were not only brutal but also designed to humiliate and degrade the citizens, the one particularly in Navanthurai.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, recently we have even witnessed the assaults of individuals by Police officers within court premises. I again ask that the Hon. Minister of Justice should take note of this. Inside the court premises, after a suspect was not even named in the report filed by the Police and after the learned Magistrate told him that he was no longer required to be in the court premises, as he walked out, just outside the Court room, in the precincts of the court premises, he was badly assaulted; he was stripped half-naked and dragged out while lawyers and other public were watching and while the judges who were presiding in those courtrooms could hear the screams and the scuffle. It was after this incident, the members of the Jaffna Bar took the courageous action to protest against this assault and did not appear in court for a week.

Sir, we must also not forget the fact that today the Sri Lanka Police is predominantly a Sinhala institution. The word predominantly is a very mild term to describe this. Out of its estimated 84,000 strength - that is the

number given in the website - only a paltry 1,143 officers are Tamils. That also was after the recent recruitment of 669 policemen as mentioned by His Excellency the President during his speech at the UN General Assembly very proudly. Those 669 Tamil policemen have been recruited making a grand total of 1,143 but he did not say that this number is out of a total strength of 84,000. It does not even touch 2 per cent and before this last recruitment, it was below 1 per cent. So, that is the situation we have. At the higher echelons, the situation is even worse. There are not even 10 Tamil officers in the Senior Officer Grades.

Sir, the Tamil National Alliance has for many years now raised the plight of young Tamil women and men who are victimized by police brutality. One example is the practice of extracting confessions through torture, a medieval practice that has contributed to the brutalization of the collective psyche of the Tamil community. This practice has been encouraged, Sir, by Section 16 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which departs from the regular law that statements made to any police officer is inadmissible as evidence in a court of law. This departure from the time-honoured general principle is embodied in the Prevention of Terrorism Act which was enacted in 1979 as a temporary provisions Act, only for six months. It still remains in our statute books after the "Temporary Provisions" was removed by an Amendment, but the title of the Act still reads, "Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act", the one enacted in 1979 and still exists as a law on our statute books carrying the title, "Temporary Provisions Act", having all these draconian provisions which empower the police to extract confessions. And, I must say this. This provision that makes it possible for statements made to a police officer to be made admissible in a court of law has resulted in the Police gradually losing their capability, their capacity to investigate crimes, because now it is so easy to extract the confessions and that alone is evidence before the court of law. So, even today after the grand announcement that the state of Emergency has been allowed to lapse, this draconian law called the Prevention of Terrorism Act is allowed to continue to exist and with it continues police brutality to obtain confessions. What is striking is a mere blanket impunity with which these assaults on citizens are carried out. How many police officers have been convicted of these crimes against the citizenry that we entrust them to protect? How many have been convicted of torture? How many have been convicted of murder? The answer tragically is that not more than a handful and many of which are overturned in appeal.

I recall an incident in this regard. When the Law Department in the Jaffna University was commenced, I was asked to deliver a guest lecture on the Legal Systems in Sri Lanka. After I finished the lecture, there was only one question that was raised by a student there. The question was, How come the suspects in the Bindunu Wewa murder case who were all found guilty

81 82

by the High Court have been released by the Supreme Court? Technicalities of law apart, that was a fact. Even if the rarest of cases that are taken to court and some person in authority like the police, is charged with an offence in a showcase trial to the world, and even if that person or those persons are found guilty, eventually they get off on appeal.

The message that successive governments have sent to police officers when crime after crime and wave of crime after wave of crime go uninvestigated and unpunished, is very clear. That is, that they will never be held accountable for their actions. They have understood this message very clearly and so we have to live with this impunity in our times. That convenient and very often incredulous fanciful alibis can be trotted out to a powerful citizenry. The victims end up never receiving justice.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the violence and brutality unleashed with impunity on our citizens does no flattery at all that aspires to be governed by the principles propounded by the Lord Buddha. On the contrary, the use of police as a tool of repression is a throwback to the colonial era. I heard the Hon. Ministers here responding to the Hon. Chief Opposition Whip, when he referred to the objectives of the Police Ordinance when the Police was commenced, saying that those were ", that those were "White Man's time". This is exactly the point that I am making. This is a throwback to the colonial era where the governors and the governed were clearly defined and were distinct. The Public Security Ordinance which has been used so perversely against the citizens of this country, time and again, was a colonial piece of legislation designed to ensure control over the so-called natives by the Governor General. It is a great shame that such repressive laws remain in force.

Sir, the violence being perpetrated against our citizens today is evidence of a deeper malaise afflicting the country at all levels. It is not just the police and this is a point I want to make very pointedly. All these examples that are being given are not intended to show only the police in a bad light. That is just a depiction of what has happened to the entire country. The problem of impunity is not limited to police brutality. Violations of the law at all levels are tolerated; even when Ministers tie Public servants to trees, it is tolerated; even when Ministers go and do the work of the UDA which must be done after proper authority obtained from the Magistrate to demolish unauthorized structures, it is tolerated. Impunity has become a way of life and particularly that of this Government and the Hon. Ministers in this House, can only listen to this and agree with me.

With reference to the administration of the Police, the Constitution explicitly mandates the establishment of a Provincial Police Force. That is a constitutional provision.

All of us in this House have sworn allegiance to the Constitution that we will uphold and protect the Constitution. The Constitution states that there must be a Provincial Police Force for each province and I quote from the Constitution:

Section 12:1 of Appendix 1 to the Constitution states, I quote:

......the preservation of public order within the Province and the prevention, detection and investigation of all offences (except the offences specified in the Schedule) and subject to the powers of the Attorney-General in terms of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, the institution of prosecutions in relevant Courts in respect of such offences."

Further, Section 11:1 states, I quote:

"The D.I.G. of the Province shall be responsible to and under the control of the Chief Minister thereof in respect of the maintenance of public order in the Province and the exercise of police powers in the Province as set out in this Schedule."

Which province in this country has a Deputy Inspector-General of Police who is answerable to the Chief Minister of that province? This provision in the Constitution was introduced as far back as 1987 and to this day we blindly walk the corridors of this House; we take the oath of allegiance time and again to uphold and protect the Constitution and not one province yet has implemented this provision of the Constitution. So, there you have impunity. Impunity is not only committing a crime and not be worried about its consequences; impunity is intentional violation of the Constitution as well. It is not only this Government - I must be quick to add - but successive Governments since 1987 have conducted themselves with impunity and have intentionally violated the provisions of this Constitution that I have just highlighted with regard to the Provincial Police Force. Today, not a single one of these provisions of this Constitution relating to the administration of the Police to the Provincial Councils system has been implemented. The Government has exposed itself to the charge, as I said, of intentionally violating the Constitution and yet impunity reigns. If we are a society governed by laws and not by men, how can this continuing systemic violation of the Constitution be permitted unchecked?

Once again, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, impunity and a lack of accountability even at the highest levels of Government, as I demonstrated with examples, subvert the expressed will of the people. It is no surprise therefore that impunity has crept into all aspects of the functioning of the Police. Police brutality is only one manifestation of this impunity. But, the Police are not always the perpetrators of impunity. In recent times, the public has borne witness to the naked political interference with our system of law and order. We have watched with disdain as charges in the law courts, - this again is another matter for the Hon. Minister of Justice to take note of - charges framed have been withdrawn because of politically influential personalities.

83 84

There is a discussion now going on as to whether death penalty must be imposed for persons who are accused and found guilty of child rape. Yet, we have a situation in this country, not too long ago, of a politically influential person who was an accused in a case of statutory rape and his charges being withdrawn.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Member, you have only two more minutes.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We have also then seen the deployment of the military to perform the tasks of the Police and that has obviously demoralized the Police. This practice is very dangerous. As someone once said, there is a reason why you separate the military from the Police. It is because the military fights the enemies of the State while the Police serve the people of the country. And, if the military does the work of the Police, then tragically the enemies of the State tend to become the people of the country and we have seen this being demonstrated, time and again, particularly in the North and the East of this country.

With regard to this Bill that is before us, there is just one matter that I want to highlight and wind up, and that is with regard to the Board of the Management of the Academy. The Bill states that, "the Secretary to the Ministry of the Minister, who shall be the Chairman." How do you ensure the professional independence of the Police force when you appoint a political appointee like the Secretary as the Chairman?

Today, it is a well-known fact that every secretary to a ministry is a political appointee. A political appointee to be the Chairman of this Academy is what you are going to do through this Bill. In the case of the present Secretary, it is even worse. Not only is he a political appointee but he is also relative of powers that be; a clear violation of good governance rules. So, although we support the establishment of a professionally-run National Police Academy, which is a good thing, at the core of it or at the head of it, appointing a political personality will undermine even this institution as has the political interference done to the entire police force of this country.

Thank you. [3.29 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I had intended to speak on the principles of this Bill, but after having heard the speeches before me, it may be worthwhile to

spend some time responding to some of the suggestions and the arguments made. I do not think I want to engage in the game of atrocity snap that the Hon. Chief Opposition Whip began because it would be only too easy to refer to problems with the Police at the time when he was a very junior Member of Parliament who, of course, was not able in those days to protest against the excesses.

But, listening to the speech of the Hon. Member on the National List from the TNA, I think what we are missing is a historical perspective on the role of the Police. I was glad that he mentioned that the role of the Police for a long time in this country, indeed from the day the Police was set up, was as a tool of Government to oppress the people of the country. That is why I thought that the rather facile distinction he made between the military and the Police was out of place. Unfortunately, we know that the role of the Police, not only in this country but in many other countries worldwide has contributed to excesses and it is the role of the Government, the legislature and the institutions such as the Police Academy to reduce these abuses as much as possible.

I think we in Sri Lanka have suffered much because of the events of the last 20 or 30 years. Of course, I have a certain sympathy for the Hon. TNA Member because much of the institutionalization of police abuses took place with regard to ethnic tensions, not only in the '50s and '60s but most appallingly in the early '80s. None of us can forget that perhaps the worst instance of Police being used as a political tool was in Jaffna in 1981 with the attacks on Members of the TULF and the burning of the Jaffna Public Library. But, though Police officers were held to be the tools, the actual inspiration came from Ministers in the Government. That institutionalization continued over the next few years because when the courts found against the Police for the violation of human rights, Government had absolutely no qualms whatsoever about promoting the police officers concerned and indeed paying their fines. It made it very clear that with abuses such as in the "Pevidi Handa" case and in the violation of the rights of the mother of the then Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Rudra Rajasingham, Government thought it was perfectly okay that rights had been violated. Those institutionalized problems are things that we have needed to address, but it has been difficult.

The Hon. Member referred to the paucity of Tamil policemen and of course, this is a matter of enormous concern.

But, I wish that occasionally he would try to look at the positive side of things. It is very easy to spell out percentages. But, even he can realize that noting the number of Tamil policemen have doubled in the last few months is another way of expressing the same statistic. Of course it began from a terrible low. This was not the fault of Government, nor was it has fault, since he, perhaps alone, amongst the Members of his party cannot

85 86

be associated at all with the excesses of the LTTE in the days when it unfortunately dominated Tamil politics. And, he must be aware that it was the killing of Tamil policemen that inhibited Tamils from joining the Police.

I know this perfectly well in that in 2007, when I began my work at the Peace Secretariat, one of the first things I agitated for was the increased recruitment of Tamil policemen. Indeed the Government had started it already. It had opened the new Police College in Kallady in the Eastern Province. Seven hundred and fifty Tamil policemen passed out. I asked whether I could publicize this fact and I was told, Please do not use their pictures because they will be the subject of the LTTE threats and perhaps even killing.

Indeed, when we tried to continue with the recruitment of Tamils, there were a very few applications and of course some of my rather myopic NGO friends said, No, no, Tamils do not want to join the Police. But the answer was very simple. It was because they were frightened of what the LTTE might do to them. This is now crystal clear because one of the great successes of the destruction of the LTTE is that the minute the LTTE was removed as a threat in Sri Lanka, - even though I am afraid some people are trying to resurrect it abroad - the number of applications to join the Police on the part of our Tamil fellow citizens increased dramatically. I hope very much then that my TNA Friend will encourage such matters and not continue to spell out dichotomies that we must all work together to get rid of. In this context, it is worth remembering that while abuses of the Police as well as abuses by the Police have occurred, it is incumbent on all of us to make it clear that this has a very little to do with ethnic tensions.

When we welcomed the visit of the United Nations Special Representative on Torture, he issued a very helpful report with very practical suggestions as to how the situation might be improved. He made it very clear that torture was not, as some people in the LTTE and their supporters suggested, an instrument of ethnic oppression, rather it was much more prevalent in other parts of the country.

In this respect, we have to remember, although we cannot for a moment condone it, that in addition to legal provisions that will make it absolutely clear that torture should not be tolerated, we have also got to improve training. For many years, I used to argue that our military had improved considerably from the situation in the '80s because of deliberate training, because of increased understanding of what it means to be a national military officer working in a context of rules, and it is for that reason that we can continue to be proud of the record of our military in fighting a very brutal terrorist organization.

But the Police had greater difficulties and the Police officers with whom I discussed this when I chaired a Committee on improving the human rights situation with regard to the Police, pointed out that Police training had been neglected in the last 10 or 20 years, not only with regard to human rights training but with regard to professional training. As the Hon. Member suggested, the Police must be better investigators, better interrogators and better prosecutors as well. When I looked at what he pointed out on what seemed the low rate of conviction - though I should note that it was not so very different from that in other countries - we gathered that one of the reasons was the lack of training in things like prosecutions. The senior police officers pointed out that when young police officials are not trained in interrogation, and do not have the senior detective course that they the seniors had been given, they might resort to other techniques.

I think it is important that we have this National Police Academy. It aims not only at professional development but also the soft skills that we have introduced so successfully into all military academies in Sri Lanka where officers have to think, have to communicate effectively with the citizens amongst whom they serve. I think it is vital that the Police Academy, which I hope we will all support today, will help to professionalize our Police in a way that we have managed so successfully with the military. We have to understand that in the modern world, the role of the police is also increasingly sophisticated and the dichotomies that the Hon. Member before me suggested are no longer valid. Their role is enormous. They have to be trained well and I hope that we can all support this Academy.

I beg your permission, Sir, to table* the speech I made about the actual content of the Academy and the way it can contribute. Thank you.

. . [3.54 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I think no country in the world could exist without a police force. The first principle in governance is the establishment of a police force. We were governed by the British Raj. They had their police service. At a time like the 1915s, they brought Gurkhas from India and quelled the riots in this country, because there were insufficient police officers in service. So, the Police Service is very unique and, I should say, a sacred service at that. They help to maintain law and order in the country. They arrest people who commit various crimes, are disobedient and break the law of the country. They even help politicians in so many ways. I should emphasize the fact here, Sir, that politicians cannot exist without a police force. That is a cardinal principle.

There can be shortcomings anywhere - in the Police Service, in the Government Service or in the political organization, like what is happening in "Sirikotha" today. "Sirikotha" is in tatters, divided into 60 pieces, and there is no leader to lead the party. When something happens there, when there are fisticuffs in "Sirikotha" between one division and the other, one gang and the other, whom do they seek assistance from to save them? It is the police force. Police officers have to go and maintain peace even in Sirikotha. Therefore, you cannot totally condemn the police force.

Our good Friend, the Hon. Sumanthiran was talking about impunity. He is talking in impunity. There are some people who allege that there are troubles in the North. Whom would they call for assistance and help ? Is it not the Police force.

Sir, we have had very distinguished officers as the Inspectors-General of Police. We always respect and honour the police uniform. That has to be maintained and observed, otherwise there will not be discipline in the country.

There is a Police force in and around the Parliamentary Complex too. They search us when we enter the Parliament. We know at various times, some Opposition Members resort to bring in scurrilous literature, boards and banners surreptitiously, stealthily. Who checks them? If anybody would resort to bring a bomb here, who would go and check them? Is it you, the Hon. John Amaratunga or I? No, it is the police force.

93 94

The Hon. John Amaratunga is here. I must remind him this. When he was the Minister in charge of the police - I have my respect for him - who sat on the OICs chair in the Borella Police Station? . . [ ] . [ ] . . .

Sir, they were talking about giving promotions to police officers. I know, "Tanki Hameed" was very much instrumental in protecting the late President J.R. Jayewardene here and when travelling abroad. His promotion was denied.

We had an SSP, Mr. M.M. Abdul Majeed from Pottuvil, who later sat with us in this House. He still laments, he cries, because his promotion was denied and even the past payments were not paid by the United National Party Government although he belonged to that party and served it loyally. That is the way they treated the Police force in this country.

Then, we have in this Parliament about 288 police officials led by Mr. Lalith Leelaratna, who has a good record of service. He has been serving in this Parliament for five years. There are also about 35 women PCs and three sergeants. I want to ask -" , " . . . . , . , . [ ]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) No, I cannot. Please wind up your speech in one minute.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Now, Sir, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition comes here and asks for police officials to drive his vehicle. The President is not asking, the Prime Minister is not asking and not a single Ministers driver is a police official. Why is it that only the Leader of the Opposition is coming and asking for that? Sir, it is very well that he is going in a three-wheeler these days.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. John Amaratunga.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) He is misleading the House. The simple reason is that the Hon. Leader of the Opposition was given specific

permission by the IGP in 2004 to use a police official as his driver and subsequently also he got permission for that. This Member cannot cast these aspersions like that. It is all wrong.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) Hon. Azwer, in 2004, where were you? Were you in the UNP or PA?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The Hon. Azwer is making false allegations. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Azwer, you carry on.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, young police officials are frightened to go and serve the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe. What can we do for it? Do not blame the police officials for that. Now, the Police Service is a separate service. They have their discipline. You cannot break it. Police drivers are police drivers and not drivers of politicians. Let it be the Leader of the Opposition, ex-Police Chief, the Hon. John Amaratunga or anybody else. Therefore, Sir, - , ?

That is my Ruling if you are not disciplined. You cannot defy the Order of the Chair. -[Interruption.] Hon. Member, will you kindly leave the House? I have already given the Order. Please take him out of the House. Order, please! Standing Order No. 74(1) states, I quote :

"Mr. Speaker, shall order members whose conduct is grossly disorderly to withdraw immediately from Parliament during the remainder of the day's sitting..."

I observe the grossly disorderly conduct of the Member and request the Member to withdraw immediately from Parliament. If the Member is not obeying, I suspend the House for 10 minutes.

, . 5.50 .

. . 5.50 , . . Sitting accordingly suspended till 5.50 p.m. and then resumed, MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER in the Chair. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Rauff Hakeem, please.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Deputy Speaker, with all this commotion in the House, how much of time am I left with? ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You have 10 minutes.

[5.52 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Thank you very much. Mr. Deputy Speaker, we progressively witnessed the Debate in this House descending from the sublime to the ridiculous. It is quite unfortunate that tempers flared and heat was generated over some comments made by the Opposition. Be that as it may, may I also say that it was quite a mischievous

129 130

attempt to cast aspersions or to bring disrepute to His Excellency the President who, perhaps, in the entire history of the world, well into his second term is enjoying almost 96 per cent popularity in this country. If an attempt is made to mischievously cast aspersions on His Excellency the President, it is natural, sometimes, that could not be tolerated by the Government Benches.

With those comments, may I say that with all Members exchanging various points of view, at least we must dispassionately look at the very purpose of this Bill in trying to bring in some better training and education to our Police force in the country. It is also high time that the United National Party realized that they cannot throw stones from glass houses and that there has been enough. If at all, anybody is to point fingers, they must take a fair share of the blame for what has happened in the deterioration that has crept into our police force. - [Interruption.] I do not want to get into any arguments on that issue. But, I must say that the Government is anyway making a sincere attempt to remedy the unfortunate deterioration that we have seen in the recent times in the Police force. It is true that the issues concerning custodial deaths of certain detainees is a matter of concern to the Government and the issues concerning impunity is something that we will address with earnestness.

We are a responsible member of the international community and we are bound by all the covenants and the conventions that govern the rule of law and therefore we have enacted the necessary legislation to give effect to some of these lofty ideals for which this Government is committed to. For instance, we have the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Act, No. 22 of 1994 and similarly, we have also enacted the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Act, No. 56 of 2007 and these are attempts that this Government made very sincerely to show our commitment to improve the conditions of rule of law in this country. It is unfortunate that at certain given times we face situations as we faced in the recent past in many places, which were referred to in the House. Therefore, there is an attempt to address the issue of impunity, if at all it appears on and off, and if there are instances where custodial deaths take place, the judicial system, which is a vibrant system , would look after that aspect of it . But, in order to see that it is possible for the judiciary to address these issues, we have put in place the necessary legislation and the administrative measures so that these matters could be gone into.

Sir, the role and the functions of the Police Force in the context of the criminal justice system cannot be underestimated. The Police play the earliest and perhaps the most vital role in ensuring the strength and vitality of any criminal justice system. The contours of its independence and efficiency shape the rule of law in any

society. Therefore, it is timely that we have brought in this piece of legislation to see that the Police Force is given that necessary training and higher qualifications in trying to become a very effective and forceful Police Force though sometimes the functions of the Police Force when it comes to law enforcement and law and order, appears to be at odds.

We saw in recent times certain incidents where in law and order situations, there had been mishandlings and that had been addressed by the administration in the shortest possible time and quite effectively so that similar mistakes will not be repeated. We must bear in mind that if you look at what is happening today in New York, Spain and many parts of the world, even the developed world is not immune to such problems and that has to be handled with maturity. Therefore, in order to see that the proper training is given to our Police Force, it is indeed very important that we bring this Legislation today.

In fact, the Hon. Sumanthiran speaking on behalf of the TNA mentioned about the lack of Tamil-speaking officers in the Police Force. A sincere attempt is now being made to improve these conditions and make the Sri Lankan Police a truly a multiethnic Police Force. This process has now begun and the situation has much improved when you compare the situation to that of two years ago. Certainly, from the point of view of the Ministry of Justice, we have also attempted to bring in the necessary support to assist the Police, even in matters when they have to prosecute cases in the North and the East. In the Northern and Eastern Provinces which are Tamil-speaking areas, to assist the Police in increasing their efforts to file cases and prosecute criminal matters before our minor judiciary, we have taken a decision to translate the Criminal Procedure Code, the Penal Code and the Evidence Ordinance - the basic pieces of legislation that are required in criminal matters - into Tamil immediately and that sufficient copies be made available to the Police officers in the North and the East so that they can ensure that this language policy of the Government is also implemented in our judicial system in the North and the East.

Things may be far from perfect as it is today but certainly improvements will be made in the coming years so that we will do away with this impression that the multiethnic character of the Police is unsatisfactory, considering the numbers that are there today in the Police force.

Then, we have taken a decision to re-demarcate the judicial boundaries in order to facilitate more efficient handling of cases and also to reduce the distance that Police officers have to travel in order to access a courthouse and similarly from the point of view of the public too, we have made necessary arrangements to see that they will not have to track long distances in order to get to a courthouse. These are being implemented as it is.

Then, of course, the long period of Emergency rule in this country, which has fortunately come to an end, has also had its own impact on the efficiency of the law enforcement machinery in this country. People have got used to the Emergency provisions and to the shortcuts that are available and when they are required to file cases under the normal law, that type of training is still lacking.

Therefore, our Ministry and the Police Department would certainly address these issues and I am sure, that when an academy of this nature is setup, it would enable us to put our heads together and build up the necessary curriculum and the academic background for us to try and have a very effective institution in place.

With those comments, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I wind up my speech.

Thank you.

, Hambantota Harbour is an unsuccessful venture - Loyds refuse maritime insurance . :

Loyds of London, the British insurance and reinsurance company has rejected maritime insurance related to Hambantota harbour.

Loyds have stated that the situation of the harbour would encourage forming sand dunes due to the large amount of sand that deposits in the harbour daily. They also point out ships could get damaged due to the number of rocks that exist in the sea nearby and also point out that surf is rough throughout the year in the area.

The government of Sri Lanka has asked the Chinese company which is carrying out constructions of the harbour to remove the large rock at the entrance to it. However, that Chinese company has pointed out that removal of the rock would endanger the whole Hambantota town. They have also pointed out that removal of the rock would cost about hundred times more than what was spent for the construction of the harbour.
