( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You have been in Parliament. I have been in Parliament for the last 30 years. We know how often dredging around Parliament has been done. But, it was not a success. When a high-tide situation comes up, Parliament gets under water. That is why this solution has been implemented, which was in the original plan of development of the Capital City .

, . We must take steps to reforest all catchments of main rivers, large, medium and small reservoirs, so that we can see clear water and not the brown, silted water, we see now. We will lift up our groundwater table and minimize degradation of soil. I would like to draw the attention of the Department of Agriculture or the chief instrument to the importance of setting up a soil conservation division to minimize further destruction of soil and water. . ; . , , . In Sri Lanka, rainfall is the primary source of water. The mean annual rainfall is around 1,800 mm with areas such as Hambantota and Mannar receiving only about 900 mm and some areas in the hill-country receiving about 5,000 mm. The total amount of water received in the form of rain is around 100 billion cubic metres per year. Out of the total water received by the Island, around 40 to 60 per cent escapes to the sea as run-off. , , '' '' .

established, Sir, and every CBO will become a member of that Trust so that certain services will be provided to them by that.

Sir, I have a very important matter to raise. At this stage, I wish to refer to a serious matter which has caught the attention of the public and caused grave consternation in certain sections of the community, particularly among the Catholic and the Christian community. I refer to the arrest of Sister Eliza of the Missionaries of Charity Order of Nuns on unsubstantiated allegations. The matter arises from a raid committed by the National Child Protection Authority - NCPA - at Prem Niwasa Childrens Home situated at Rawatawatte, Moratuwa maintained by these nuns - consequent to an anonymous telephone call. The NCPA seems totally unaware of the Missionaries of Charity or the work they are engaged in. The Missionaries of Charity is a world renowned Order of Catholic Nuns

dedicated to serve the poor and destitute. The service is rendered absolutely free of charge and the nuns derive no benefits whatsoever from rendering this service. The Order was founded by none other than Mother Theresa who has herself received a Nobel Prize for peace for her unparalleled service to humanity. The Order under no circumstances engages in any kind of business activities, and least of all, engaged in the business of running adoption agencies.

In such circumstances, it is most distressing that the NCPA has rushed on to a raid, on an anonymous telephone call, charging into Prem Niwasa in the manner of a hooch raid, which has now resulted in the remanding of an innocent nun. This was the first time in world history that a Sister of this Order has been arrested.

So much so, that the Cardinal Archbishop of Colombo, Reverend Malcolm Ranjith has himself declared that he will not be participating in any State-sponsored functions unless and until a satisfactory solution is found. He condemned the action in very strong terms, which by itself shows the sentiments of the Catholics of this country.

The nuns have in several statements denied the charges that are made against them. Their position is very clear that they do not deal with money, that they do not engage in any business activities and that they are unaware of any connection to any adoption agency. It is also significant to note that only -

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake - Deputy Minister of Health) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. This is a sub judice matter. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No, I am not talking about the case. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) Last time also you did the same thing when I raised a question. It is a matter of national importance. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I am not talking about the case. I am talking about - ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. No charge sheet has been filed.

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) Maybe. There is a "B" Report filed. You are also a lawyer. There is a case pending. You have to abide by the Standing Orders, Sir. Maybe there is a nun involved in this matter. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) -

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) Sir, it is very clear. According to Standing Order No. 84 (vi) - once a "B" Report has been filed and the case is pending in court, how can you - [Interruption.] You are a lawyer. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) No. No. , - ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Anything against the Standing Orders will be expunged. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) This matter, I must say - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister, let me continue. - [Interruption.] I am not referring to any charge sheet or anything like that. I am only talking about the Sisters who are involved in the service. So, Hon. Minister - [Interruption.] , . ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) If there is anything against the Standing Orders, that portion will be expunged. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, this is my time. They are unaware of any connection with the adoption agency. It is also significant to note that sadly the State does not operate a single institution to accommodate unwed mothers such as the victims of rape and the like. ( ) (The Hon. Sarath Kumara Gunaratne) . . ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes. This is also a matter of public importance. I am not talking about a sub judice case. I am not referring to such a case at all. It is the Catholic Church and only the

907 908

Catholic Church that operates such institutions, in fact, in the whole of Sri Lanka. They further state that any children in their care who were given for adoption were done on the basis of allocations made by the Department of Probation and Child Care Services and under court supervision. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. John Amaratunga, your time is over. Please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I will finish in one minute, Sir. In these circumstances, I feel that a grave insult and injury has been caused to these nuns and to their Order. Therefore, the Government must take urgent steps to repair the almost-irreparable damage that has been caused.

Hisbullah) Sir, I am not giving way. - [Interruption.] I will tell you. Regarding this matter, we have already submitted facts to the court; this matter is before the court. So, it is better that we do not discuss it further. But, anyway, since you have raised some issues, I thought of giving some facts. This has nothing to do with any particular religion or anything else. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Without a proper investigation, you rushed in and got her remanded. .... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) Hon. Member, if there is a complaint, the officers should go there immediately. They cannot wait for an

investigation report. If there is a complaint, they should first go there and investigate. When they went to that home only, they found out all these things.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The NCPA Chairperson has gone before the media. There is some motive behind that; there is an ulterior motive. .... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) No. I must say that there was no motive behind that. The NCPA has no such background. Not only this, even earlier, they raided two or three such centres. Hon. Member, you must understand, that centre was allowed to keep only 24 children. They were keeping more than 65 children. - [Interruption.] No, no, that is not allowed. Hon. Member, according to the law, we have certain criteria followed. We say this home should consist of only this number of children. Then, they are given permission. If they want to keep more, they have to get permission.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Then, they have to close it down. You are keeping and harassing them; they are doing a charitable service.

.... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) No, no. As the Ministry, as the NCPA, in the name of charity we cannot allow that. Hon. Member, please understand, that centre was allowed to keep only 24 children. So, how can they keep 65 to 70 children? - [Interruption.] They cannot do that. ( ) (An Hon. Member) Is that an offence? .... ( .... ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah) If they want to keep more, they have to get permission. Regarding this, we have already submitted a report to the court. They will come to a finding. - [Interruption.]

Mr. Presiding Member, let me at this juncture pay my gratitude to the European Union who have actually implemented a two-year food facility programme to cater to 30,000 families in the East by allocating Rs. 862 million. Through this programme they have managed to rehabilitate 55 irrigation tanks in the Trincomalee and Batticaloa areas.

Mr. Presiding Member, let me also give some very important information regarding international support for the Northern region. The Joint Plan for Assistance, namely the JPA, for Sri Lankas war-torn Northern Province is presently facing a shortfall of US Dollars 200 million. Now, Sir, only US Dollars 76.5 million worth of support has been received. Of the support that is required to implement the Joint Plan for Assistance - the JPA Programme - in the Northern Province, the international community has managed to achieve only a 26 per cent target. Why can the Sri Lankan Government not intervene and try to provide the rest of the funds that are necessary and indispensable for the promotion of health programmes in the Northern Province?

Sir, over 60 per cent of the households in the Northern Province have been declared as suffering from food insecurity. As there is lack of income generation and food production capacity in order to secure the basic needs, the World Food Programme Survey has shown that 50 per cent of the 1.1 million people are indebted in the

941 942

[ ]

2011 06

Northern Province. On an average, they are indebted up to six months of income and much of it is because of the purchase of food items. Sir, let me also tell you that 50 per cent of the people of the Northern Province live on an income of less than one dollar a day. Why can the Government not have a proactive programme to intervene and provide remedies for the lack of proper substantive policies to ensure that the food insecurity situation is revamped and people are given their proper allocation to retain food security? Let me also mention that the Royal Norwegian Government has allocated US Dollars 1.4 million to improve food security and livelihood in the Northern areas, especially to the Mullaitivu and Vavuniya Districts, but that covers only 7,500 families. 1.4 , , .

Mr. Presiding Member, I also wish to make a few comments about the disease pattern of the country. We heard this afternoon some of the Members referring to the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases in the country. The Sri Lankan health system has been boosting and we have an excellent record in controlling the communicable diseases in the country. We have virtually eliminated some of the vaccine-preventable diseases like neonatal tetanus and polio and have very well controlled some of the diseases like measles, mumps and rubella; thanks to the health sector of this country. But, unfortunately, we see a damaging trend in the control and prevention of non-communicable diseases.

Recently, we had the opportunity to attend the First Global Ministerial Conference on Healthy Lifestyles and

Non-communicable Diseases in Russia with the Hon. Minister. There, we were actually quite surprised to note that Sri Lanka is amongst the few countries where there is an alarming trend in the rise of non-communicable diseases. In our country, conditions such as hypertension, ischemic heart diseases, strokes and cancer are rapidly rising. I think, as the representatives of the people and also the Ministry of Health, we have a responsibility to create awareness amongst the people of this country about this damaging trend. As much as we discourage smoking, as much as we tell them about the side effects and adverse effects of consuming alcohol, we have a duty to tell them that they need to get adjusted to a healthy lifestyle. They must maintain their bodyweight; they should reduce their obesity.

Actually, we were quite disheartened to note that some of the sugar-producing countries in the world had tried to influence even the World Health Organization - WHO -, not to mention about the consumption of sugar, which is equally damaging like smoking and alcohol consumption. As a country, you know that we are spending a lot of money for the importation of sugar. At the household level also, we spend a lot of money for the consumption of sugar, which is not a significant nutrient element in our food. So, we should actually discourage consumption of sugar, which will in turn, reduce the number of patients in the diabetic category, which has created a lot of difficulties in the health sector. You know that the Sri Lankan population, which is the fastest-aging population in this region, has a significant number of patients in the diabetic segment, which is rising up to about 15 to 20 per cent. The diabetic mellitus is a condition which gives rise to so many complications, such as eye diseases, kidney diseases, heart ailments and strokes. So, if we reduce the incidence of diabetes, we should be able to prevent those complications also.

Sir, I would like to conclude my speech by saying that with the able leadership of the Hon. Minister and the help of the competent health practitioners in Sri Lanka, we should be able to take our health system into greater heights in the years ahead. Thank you very much.

NON-PAYMENT OF EMOLUMENTS TO CRICKETERS ( ) (The Hon.

The Sri Lankan Cricket Board has contracted many cricketers for their annual financial emoluments. It is revealed that the cricketers have not been paid

1009 1010

2011 06

for the past 5-6 months bringing pressure on the cricketers impacting their performance which was visibly seen in Dubai and even more, disrepute to Sri Lankan Cricket Administration.

Furthermore, the ICC World Cup Accounts has been delayed and ICC is holding back money to Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh owing to negligence.

Will the Minister please reveal when the cricketers are to be paid and what action will be taken against cricket officials who have brought disrepute to Sri Lanka due to negligence and incompetence in good governance?"
