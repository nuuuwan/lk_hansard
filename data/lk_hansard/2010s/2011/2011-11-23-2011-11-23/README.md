[11.23 a.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to speak on the Debate on the Second Reading of the Budget for 2012. Next year, the Government plans to spend Rs. 2.22 trillion for capital

and recurrent expenditure, according to the Appropriation Bill, 2012. Compared with 2011, the Government has increased recurrent expenditure by Rs. 80 billion, that is, from Rs. 1,029 billion to 1,109 billion. Allocations for capital expenditure have already been increased by Rs. 173 billion, that is, from Rs. 938 billion this year to Rs.1,111 billion in 2012. Government expenditure can only be met with heavy local borrowings. Although the 30-year war came to an end a few years ago, the United Peoples Alliance Government has allocated approximately Rs. 230 billion to the Ministry of Defence for next year, compared to Rs. 215 billion in 2011. It is an increase of over 5 per cent. With an expected revenue of Rs. 1.16 trillion and the estimated expenditure of Rs. 2.22 trillion, Sri Lankas income expenditure gap for 2012 is colossal, as it amounts to Rs. 1.06 trillion. The current national debt exceeds Rs. 5 trillion and the income we receive is only sufficient to service the debts.

The real problem the people are facing now is the cost of living. We find that meaningful proposals have not been included in the Budget to bring down the cost of living. Almost everyone is affected by the cost of living and the consumers are hard hit in the stomach. This is due to the increase in prices of all consumer items: petrol, diesel and kerosene oil. In the earlier years, prices were increased only in the budget, but after Dr. N.M. Perera became the Minister of Finance, he changed it and increased the prices by gazette notifications. We are following that now.

The economy of this country took a downward trend with the nationalization of estates by the late Mrs. Bandaranaike. That was a colossal mistake and even last month the Government passed an expropriation bill to take over about 35 enterprises.

According to the newspapers, the Committee on Public Enterprises which investigated into 249 Government- owned institutions, has found that the losses incurred by them during the period 2007 - 2009 exceed a staggering Rs. 19 billion. The loss making institutions are the Ceylon Electricity Board, Sri Lanka Cricket, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, State Timber Corporation, Lankaputhra Development Bank Limited and Mihin Lanka. Mihin Lanka incurred a loss of Rs. 1,221 million in 2010. When this is so, I do not know how the Treasury has found it possible to give another Rs. 10,000 million to this airline? Is it their private property or public money? The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation incurred a loss of Rs. 12,343 million in 2010 and the Sri Lanka Transport Board incurred a net loss of Rs. 830 million in 2010.

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation is facing a severe financial crisis owing to the failure to collect its debts from Government institutions. The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has to recover Rs. 79 billion from several Government institutions including the Ceylon Electricity Board which owes a sum of Rs. 53 billion. According to

481 482

[ ]

2011 23

the Secretary of the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya, the Ugadanavi Power Project is indebted to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation for a sum of Rs. 2,387 million, while the Sri Lanka Navy has a debt of Rs. 9,950 million. The Sri Lanka Railway has to pay Rs. 3,364 million to Ceylon Petroleum Corporation while Sri Lanka Air Force, Mihin Lanka, Road Development Authority, Maga Naguma, Sri Lanka Police and Sri Lanka Transport Board are in debt for a sum of Rs. 2,378 million, Rs. 1,070 million, Rs. 592 million, Rs. 510 million, Rs. 227 million, Rs. 118 million and Rs. 102 million respectively. Therefore, the Government must take serious note of these public enterprises, which are running at a loss and see that they are efficiently managed either by the Government or by the private sector.

The international ratings agency "Fitch" has published a report on the recently passed expropriation bill and warned that it can hinder investment in the country. It states, Sri Lankas new law that enables the Government to take control of business could hinder investment in the country, although much will depend on the scope of the law.

Mr. Presiding Member, as far as the electricity is concerned, in Jaffna there is a power-cut almost daily. The reason I understand is that the Ministry of Power and Energy has given a contract to a Chinese company to produce 30 megawatts of electricity whereas it produces only 15 megawatts. Although the Ministry of Power and Energy wanted to cancel this Agreement, a senior Government servant in the Ministry of Defence has prevented it and as a result, the people in Jaffna are not getting the electricity from Lakshapana.

Sir, we have got a jumbo Cabinet. There are about 57 Ministers and some six or seven of them are called Senior Ministers and they are not given any work. Do we need such a jumbo Cabinet to manage such a small country? Twenty Ministries are quite ample to manage this country. Though there are 57 Ministries, there is another Ministry called Economic Development which is responsible for economic development of the country. I am asking, Do the other Ministries not do any development work?

I think a good feasible study was not conducted before starting to construct the Harbour at Hambantota. Now, we find that there is a massive rock in the seabed near the entrance and Sri Lanka has sought Rs. 9 billion from China to remove this rock. The Government also seems to have spent about Rs. 40 billion to have the Commonwealth Games at Hambantota but they have failed miserably and they have unnecessarily wasted this money. This is not their money; this is public money. Is the Government so bankrupt that it has become necessary to sell the lands near the Galle Face to a Chinese Company to bridge the gap between the expenditure and the revenue?

Mr. Presiding Member, the money allocated for health and education is not sufficient. There are several poor persons who need heart surgery and they are unable to pay Rs. 700,000 to a private hospital. I understand that if there are more Intensive Care Wards in the General Hospital, Colombo, more heart surgeries can be done. I request the Hon. Minister of Health to see that these poor people can undergo heart surgeries in the General Hospital. Also, several schools that were damaged during the war have to be rebuilt.

Sir, the war in Kilinochchi was over about two years ago. The war was fought in Kilinochchi and not in Jaffna but about 40,500 army personnel who were in Jaffna still continue to be there. I understand that temporary Army Camps have been made permanent and the army is also occupying about 1,000 private houses. What the Tamils want is normalcy and not militarization. It would be better if the Army could be removed from Jaffna early because of what is happening in Jaffna like the Grease Yakas and the spate of robberies taking place. There is another reason why the Army should be removed from Jaffna. The President has said recently that there are no High Security Zones in any part of Sri Lanka and that in future, resettlement must be done by the respective District GAs and AGAs. But, the Army is preventing resettlement. The Government has also announced that resettlement can be done by the respective Divisional Secretaries and District Secretaries. Even the President has announced at the UN that 95 per cent of the persons who were displaced have already been resettled and rehabilitated. That is not the actual position. The United Nations, in a report issued recently regarding resettlement, has reported that in the Districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu, 117,888 persons have not yet been permanently resettled and further in the North, the resettled people since they have no houses, are staying with their friends and relatives.

In Maritimepattu Divisional Secretary's Division in the Mullaitivu area, about 1,193 families consisting of 4,686 persons have to be resettled. In the Puthukkudiyiruppu Divisional Secretary's Division, 4,199 families consisting of 16,374 persons have to be resettled. In Mullivaikkal West, that is, in Keppapulavu, 317 families consisting of 1,336 persons have to be resettled. The Keppapulavu village adjoins the village of Vattapalai. Resettlement in Vattapalai has already taken place and the people from Vattapalai have their agricultural lands and their cemetery in Keppapulavu. They are unable to do their cultivations and cremate their bodies. I understand that the Army is preventing the people from Keppapulavu resettling in that village. In the Mannar District, people from Mullikulam are prevented by the Army from resettling there. About 200 families from Thirumurugandy, who are in camps, are not allowed to go and resettle there. The Army has constructed a road across the Thirumurugandy village and it prevents people from Thirumurugandy from resettling there. That is a serious problem.

483 484

In the year 1990, about one lakh of people got displaced from Valikamam North. Some people have already been resettled. We went to the Supreme Court and got a decision. The decision was that they should be resettled. But, several people are still to be resettled. According to this list I have here, there are 663 persons from KKS West, 1,093 from KKS Centre, 549 from KKS South, 765 from Thenmylai, 641 from Kurumpasiddy, 3,271 from Myliddy North, 696 from Thaiyiddy East, 745 from Myliddithurai East, 859 from Thaiyiddy North, 1,608 from Thaiyiddy South, 1,519 from Myliddithurai North, 1,228 from Palaly South, 1,802 from Palaly East, 1,648 from Palaly North, 606 from Palaly North-West and 809 from Palaly West, to be resettled. Then, also 1,146 from Tellippalai, 1,262 from Palai Veemankamam North, 956 from Palai Veemankamam South, 509 from Kadduvan, 972 from Varuthalaivilan, 1,596 from Kurumpasiddy East and 1,336 from Vasavilan West have to be resettled. So, nearly 26,000 people are to be resettled in the Valikamam North area. All those persons are living in camps with their children. They are not overseas. I went and inspected the areas in which people have been allowed to be resettled. Almost the entire area is covered with bushes and there are snakes and pigs in that area. The people who have already been resettled complained about those bushes. I understand that Rs. 25 million has been allocated for clearing the bushes. I have written letters in this connection to the Government Agent, Jaffna and I want those bushes to be cleared as early as possible. Nearly 15,000 acres in Sampur were taken over by the Government about six years ago for a coal power plant and about 8,000 persons got displaced and they are living in camps. The Government needs only 500 acres to have the coal power plant and the balance can be used to resettle those people from Sampur.

Thank you.

[12.17 p.m.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) , .

I am very pleased to speak soon after my Friend, the Hon. C.B. Rathnayake, who spoke in this House. We are both working in the same district and I am glad that the Hon. Leader of the House and the Hon. C.B. Rathnayake, when speaking about the people in the plantations, always referred to me because I have now been acknowledged as the person representing the plantation people though I moved to the plantation area, the Nuwara Eliya District, only one and a half years ago. The Hon. C.B. Rathnayake spoke about giving employment to the plantation people in the State sector. But, unfortunately this Government is not interested in providing any employment opportunities to the plantation people in the State sector because if they were really keen, they would have implemented Circular No. 15 of 1990, which was introduced by the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1990. It envisaged the recruitment of persons on ethnic ratio through which the people of Indian origin got a fair share of State sector employment. But, in 1995, this was cast aside and up to date, it has not been implemented. But, one and a half years ago, this same Circular No. 15 of 1990 has been implemented only in the Eastern Province because it favours the Sinhala people who live in the Eastern Province. Why should you not implement this Circular all over the Island without discriminating against those in the South, and providing it only in the Eastern Province because it is advantageous to you? So, if you are sincere about providing employment to the plantation people, please urge your Government to implement Circular No. 15 of 1990.

Mr. Presiding Member, while reading the Budget Speech made by the President in this House, I observed that it only looks like another manifesto of this Government because it does not seem to provide for implementation of the Proposals made in the Budget at all. If it is a manifesto, you present it to the people to gain the votes of the people. You are not bound to implement those promises that you make before an election. However, when you present a Budget to this House, you have to take responsibility for implementing every single proposal in the Budget that you present. But, however, we do not see that happening. I will show you one example. Under paragraph 54, in page 110 of the English version of the Budget Speech for 2012 made by the Minister of Finance and Planning, it states, I quote:

I propose to build one million houses within six years. Accordingly, many projects are in progress to renovate housing schemes, build new flats for those residing in urban shanties, improve housing facilities of those who were resettled and also to improve substandard shelters in the villages, fishing and plantation areas.

495 496

Though he says this, we do not see how it is going to be implemented. Probably he took this slogan of one million houses because it was a popular project of the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who not only proposed it but also implemented, not one million houses but 1.5 million houses. Though His Excellency the President proposes to build one million houses within six years, what is the amount of money that has been set aside for housing in this Budget? I went through the Budget Estimates that had been presented to this House and in page 538 of Volume 2, you can see the amounts allocated under Capital Expenditure under the Ministry of Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities. In the year 2010, when the Budget for 2011 was presented, there was an allocation of Rs. 800 million to build rural houses under this Ministry. I am sure with Rs. 800 million, you cannot build even 500 houses. But this time, in 2012, that allocation of Rs. 800 million has been reduced to Rs. 600 million. So, while you propose a million houses, you reduce the allocation for housing from Rs. 800 million to Rs. 600 million. Therefore, is this whole Budget Proposal not a farce? Are you not trying to take the people of this country for a ride? This only reminds me of the Mahinda Chintana that was put forward in 2005 before the first Presidential Election of His Excellency the President. In the Mahinda Chintana, there was a promise made under Housing for the Plantation People. The President or the then Presidential Candidate promised that he would build 50,000 houses within a period of three years. This was said in 2005. The Hon. C.B. Rathnayake was made the Minister for Estate Infrastructure and Livestock Development in 2006 and he was allocated funds to build some houses. He started to build 4,600 houses in 2006 and up to date, those 4,600 houses have not been completed. Each year, a little money is allocated, a few houses are completed, but six months ago the Hon. Minister for Housing, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, stated in this House that still 1,400 houses remain to be completed. Even if he states that 4,600 houses will be completed by the end of this year, if you are going to build 4,600 houses in six years, that means you can build only 800 houses per year. There is a need for 200,000 houses in the plantation areas. At the rate of 800 houses per year, you will take 250 years to fulfil the need of houses for the plantation people. But now, you are promising one million houses. Is that not a farce? That is what we wish to ask.

Again, for estate housing under the Ministry of Livestock and Rural Community Development, a further Rs. 150 million has been allocated. Somebody who proposes or promises 50,000 houses in three years allocates Rs. 150 million for estate housing. With Rs. 150 million, you can build, maybe 300 houses. So, under these circumstances, how are we to believe that this Government is serious about the proposals it makes in the Budget that was presented to this House?

There is another very serious proposal made in the Budget. The Government, which said that they would not be taking over any more properties under the expropriation Act, are now doing the same thing under the Budget. Maybe His Excellency the President presenting the Budget last year said that underutilized lands in plantations would be taken over and handed over to others. Now, the Government has identified but has not disclosed what they are and says they are going to take over 37,000 hectares of land, which works out to around 85,000 acres from the plantation companies to give the smallholders. Sir, when they say "smallholders", I wish to remind you that there was a promise made by the Minister for Economic Development in this House last year during the Budget Debate. He said that this land will be distributed among smallholders and I raised the issue of a social problem arising by bringing in smallholders from outside the plantation areas into those estates.

I will quote from the Hansard of 29th November, 2010, where in Column 1283, I have stated as follows:

You further say that if the tea plantation companies do not cultivate the fallow land that they hold now, which is 65,000 hectares, you will take over them and give them to the smallholders. Sixty five thousand hectares is going to work out to

170,000 acres. There are enough workers in the estates who have the experience and capacity to replant this. Give these land to those workers to replant. Eighty per cent of the cost for replanting goes for labour. They have it. They can put it free.

The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Minister for Economic Development, interrupted me and said, "That is what the President told". He acknowledged that the Government intended distributing these lands that would be taken from plantation companies, to the workers in the estates, but today, again the Budget Proposals say that those lands would be given to smallholders. So, are we not going back on a solemn undertaking given in this House?

Sir, I wish to point out that the estate workers are people who have lived in this country for 180 years. During that period of 180 years, they created the plantations; they nurtured it; they preserved it; they cared for it and are committed to sustain it. So, it is fair that they be considered as the first priority in granting these lands. I am sure there are people around those estates who would also like to participate in the programme of replanting those lands that have been left fallow by the plantation companies. They also could be considered to an extent, but not in the middle of an estate, which would cause social problems. But, in areas with large populations, they maybe considered for allocation of some of the lands.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Yogarajan, you have eleven more minutes to speak.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Sir.

I was speaking about the distribution of lands that are being taken over from the plantations. We know that there is a history of taking over of lands. In 1973, the then United Front Government took over all the plantations, but they did not have a proper plan or management. The Janavasama and SLSPC were created, but they ruined the plantations. Over 150,000 acres of valuable plantations were lost. They became fallow, uncultivated lands at the end of the period. Then, these were given to the companies. They have also failed to replant to the extent that is necessary. That is why you are taking over these lands. Sir, ensure that these lands are replanted when you distribute two acres to each estate-worker family. They should be permitted only to plant tea in tea estates, rubber in rubber estates and coconut in coconut estates and no other crop so that these will be sustained. If you allow them to grow vegetables, they will do it for two seasons, may abandon it and the land will become fallow again. But, if you plant tea or rubber, it would be sustained; it would preserve the estates for the future.

Sir, in the Budget Speech, it is proposed to construct three airports: one in Kandy, one in Nuwara Eliya and the other in Iranamadu. As far as Nuwara Eliya is concerned, even today SriLankan Airlines is operating an airtaxi service twice a week. They have 10 seats, but I am told that even today, they are not fully booked. So, with the possibility of aircraft landing on the Gregory Lake, and if you are not going to have even 10 persons to fly on each of those flights, should priority be given to build an airport in Nuwara Eliya? Is it to meet the needs of the plantation people or the people living in Nuwara Eliya in a more practical manner, in a way that it will suit their needs that you are going to build an airport there? For whose benefit is it? Is it for the benefit of the Ministers who can fly up there every weekend or is it for the benefit of the people who live in Nuwara Eliya? You are also proposing to build an airport in Iranamadu. Just two years ago, whenever the people in Iranamadu heard a plane

flying, they ran into bunkers. Even today, they are living in fear because they have no roof above their heads. Today when they sleep, they see the stars in the sky, not anything else. So, provide them housing before you provide them an airport using the landing strip that the LTTE had built there. Consider your priorities. Is this Government trying to satisfy the rich people, the youth who are involved in sports of a very high calibre like rugby, racing et cetera, or are you going to meet the needs of the ordinary people? This is what you have to consider. So, do not talk of airports for Nuwara Eliya or for Iranamadu but talk of housing for people who are living without houses. I am sure the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena would not mind my saying this because Mihin Air is not going to fly to Nuwara Eliya.

In this Budget, you have brought the provincial councils totally under your control. They have been allocated Rs. 130 billion for their sustenance and a further Rs. 32 billion will accrue to them as share of taxes from the Centre. What is this? Are you destroying the devolution that was created in this country? At a time when the TNA and the minorites are asking for more devolution, you are destroying the devolution that has already been created. Without taxation, without fiscal powers, what is the devolution that you intend giving? Through last year's Budget, you have taken back all taxation powers of the provinces. The collection of BTT, the only tax that the provinces were collecting, has been stopped and now you are going to give out only doles to the provinces. If the provinces are to look up to the Centre for doles, what is the independence, what is the freedom they are going to have in ruling the areas that come under their purview?

We have a Finance Commission. Through the Eighteenth Amendment, you have made the Finance Commission important, but now it has no powers and it is there merely to rubber-stamp what the Centre does. The Finance Commission was originally envisaged to regulate the share of revenue of the nation between the Centre and the provinces initially, and then between the provinces themselves. But, the Finance Commission has issued a statement about a month ago stating that their recommendations would come only after the Centre prepares the Budget for this year. If the Finance Commission is only going to distribute the funds that the Centre is making available to the provinces, then there is no point in having it. The Finance Commission is supposed to recommend how the revenue of the State be shared between the Centre and the provinces and then between the provinces themselves. So, by this, you have destroyed the devolution that has been created and the devolution that the people especially of the North and the East are yearning for.

Now, you speak about eradicating poverty. In 2007, the Household Income and Expenditure Survey conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics projected a 32 per cent rate of poverty level in the plantation areas of the

499 500

Nuwara Eliya District. But suddenly in 2009, the same department says that poverty rate in the plantation areas has dropped to a mere 9 per cent. If the poverty ratio is reduced from 32 to 9 per cent, then that has to be felt by the people. The people should feel that there is an economic revolution that has raised 23 per cent of their people from the poverty level to a good life, but they have not reported anything like that. We, who live among the people have not felt that economic revolution; that reduced poverty in the plantation areas from 32 to 9 per cent.

Further, the Government has proposed the import of 3,000 cows to improve milk production in this country. Do you know that there are 1.2 million cattle in this country? Every year 200,000 cows are killed and every year 200,000 calves are born, keeping the total number of cattle stable. So, with 1.2 million, your importing 3,000 cows alone to improve the milk production in this country, I think has no impact at all. I do not know whom it will help and this is not enough for improving the livestock economy of this country.

, . . [2.21 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Sir, the 2012 Budget was presented by His Excellency the President with many headings such as "Social Integration", "A Caring Society", "Development and National Unity" and under many other categories. The main theme of the Budget was to sustain the 8 per cent growth that has been reached by Sri Lanka. To sustain the 8 per cent growth in Sri Lanka, we have to have productivity. The investment ratio at the moment is 26 per cent of the GDP. If we have to sustain this 8 per cent growth, our Government should increase the investment portfolio to over 32 - 40 per cent of the GDP. With the incentives proposed in the Budget for 2012, can this be sustained? That is a big question. I ask this from the Hon. Minister of Finance because as far as this Budget is concerned, there has been no incentive given for Foreign Direct Investment. It is a very important factor to consider. If there is no Foreign Direct Investment to this country, how are we going to sustain the 8 per cent growth? That is my question.

The rupee has been depreciated by 3 per cent. By doing so, the cost of living in this country is going to rise. The export personnel may gain certain productivity but the import personnel will not get that ranking. Therefore, taking into consideration the present situation as far as Sri Lanka is concerned, the country should give an incentive to the people and to the investors. The question is, are we doing that ?

The 3 per cent depreciation of the rupee by the Government in this Budget is not within the fiscal policy and such limitation should have been formulated by the Governor of the Central Bank and not by a Budget. The

521 522

[ ]

2011 23

Budget should concentrate on macroeconomic policies and not macroeconomic variables.

Now, if you look at certain policies laid down in this Government Budget, the duty has been reduced for branded sports goods. That is very good. I must say the youth of this country should take part in sports. They should build their physique and be good citizens of this country. Similarly, those who are undernourished too should be given this same opportunity by reducing the duty on consumer commodities. They should concentrate on giving this to malnourished children also who need these commodities in their day-to-day life. The Budget should consider the poor mans policy and that is very important as far as we are concerned .

The increase of 10 per cent of the basic salary of the Government servants, as you all know, is only an allowance and will not be a part of the salary structure. The Government servants will not gain any benefits on such an increase in his pension. This allowance can at any time be repealed by the Government.

Sir, the Government in the Budget has said that there had been a 23 per cent growth rate in the Northern Province. The GDP is calculated on consumption, investments, public expenditure and exports, minus the imports. What is the investment that has been taking place in the Northern Province? I like to ask that question. The roads leading to the Northern Province certainly are being carpetted. Those roads are the same that were built by the British. It is not a highway like the Southern one. Therefore, the only conclusion that I can come to is that consumption is the sole factor that has attributed towards the growth of 23 per cent of GDP in the Northern Province.

On the 6th of November, 2008, His Excellency the President in his Budget Speech had stated that through the "Uthuru Wasanthaya", they are going to develop the Northern Province, rebuild about 80,000 houses that had been destroyed and also restore livelihood in the North. He proposed to make an additional allocation of Rs. 3,000 million for this purpose and to make a further Rs. 500 million allocation to the Ministry of Resettlement. I would respectfully ask the Hon. Minister of Finance whether such allocation had been made and whether the 80,000 houses that were promised, was built. To the best of my knowledge and understanding, this promise has not been fulfilled by the Government.

Today, they intend to build a golf link in China Bay at Trincomalee, a formula one racing track in Colombo, five domestic airports and another international airport in Hambantota. A port has already been built in Hambantota, the construction of which cost a colossal sum of money to Sri Lanka; that was spent from the Government coffers and which cannot be utilized as per the expectations. A fraction of this money could have been spent for the underprivileged society in the North.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) There is a domestic airport coming up in the North. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Once it comes, Sir, we will consider it.

I wish to bring to the notice of the Hon. Minister of Finance that 300 employees were recruited by the National Savings Bank about a week ago. I had the opportunity of speaking to one of the officials in the Bank and I just inquired whether there were any Tamil persons recruited.The reply that I received was that not a single Tamil person was recruited to the National Savings Bank. The National Savings Bank is one of the largest State banks, which I also at one time, headed. We have branches in the North, we have branches in the East, we have branches in the up-country and branches in Colombo. But, not a single Tamil person has been recruited to the Bank out of the 300 employees.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Are you sure of it?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Sir, it is sure. When I spoke to that official about a week ago - I do not want to mention his name now - I was told that not a single Tamil person was recruited. I have not checked it today but I was made to understand that not a single Tamil has been employed. So, if this is going to be the structure of the Government policy, if this is what you are going to promise for the Tamils of this country, are we really considering that the Tamil community is going to gain their rights which they have lost?

The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa had a Mega Development Plan for the Northern Province. Has that plan been enforced?

The Government is intending to give a Rs. 750 allowance to the respectable parents of the deceased brave soldiers, which is a very commendable act. They deserve it. But, I wish to inquire from the Hon. Minister of Finance whether the Government will also consider granting the same privileges to the parents who have lost their children and to the children who have lost their parents in the war?

A tax holiday incentive of five years for lagging regions outside Colombo and Gampaha Districts was granted for an investment over 30 million other than for trading. The same incentive was available for the East;

523 524

there was a tax holiday applicable even for trading in the East. Why was this tax holiday never introduced or enforced in the Northern Province? Only if such investment incentives are given in the Northern Province that the investors will consider investing in the Northern Province. My question to the Hon. Minister again is, why is there a discrimination to the Northern Province? By doing so the Government is depriving the Northern Province from being a viable investment zone.

The Government, after the introduction of the recent Act for the acquisition of underperforming and underutilized assets is introducing another legislation where underdeveloped lands which were given to the plantations would be taken over and distributed. This will give a wrong signal to the foreign investors. The earlier Act has prejudiced rights and this will aggravate it further. If you are to sustain an 8 per cent growth rate in this country, as mentioned in my earlier address, this type of legislation should not be contemplated by the Government as it will negate foreign investment.

The Government also intends to reduce 12 per cent in the tax structure in hospitals. That is a very good move. I must say that it is a very good move. If that is so, my request to the Hon. Minister is that there should be a regulatory system that will govern the patients who enter these private hospitals. Today, a patient who enters a private hospital cannot really afford to pay his bills. They charge exorbitant fees. I think the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance should really reconsider that if this 12 per cent tax incentive is going to be given to the hospitals, whether it is applicable to the present hospitals or to new hospitals, there should be a regulatory system brought to curtail the charges by these hospitals from poor patients who enter the same.

It was also proposed that distribution of dividends by companies may be made by issuing script dividends. This maybe in conflict with the provisions of the definition of the Companies Act. It will also be inconsistent with the principle laid down in the Supreme Court in the year 1939 in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Macan and Markar.

The Budget also proposes to grant many tax concessions and incentives to locally manufactured articles, which are substitutes for imported articles. Whilst this may be justified in case of food items in limited markets as Sri Lanka, it may have been more desirable if such concessions were given to the export industry.

Our neighbouring India is said to be the third largest economy in the world and is going to be in another 10 years' time, the largest economy in the world. The Sri Lankan companies should be encouraged to take advantage of the Indian market, which is also growing at

8 per cent per annum, and that of some Southern Indian States are growing at double-digit rates. Therefore, Sri Lankan exporters should be encouraged to take potential market opportunities in India.

With regard to tax concessions given to tourist projects, I am made to understand by this Budget that the tax advantage only accrues after profits are earned and in some cases, the tax holiday period might expire before such hotels make profit. As you are aware, after building a hotel, you cannot gain profit till about five to seven years pass. The depreciation of value, the price of goods, the cost and many other factors are the reasons for that. I wonder whether the Government's introduction of this tax holiday and the profit margin are going to be accepted by the tourist industry.

In this situation, I merely wish to tell His Excellency the President as well as the Hon. Members of the Government that the Northern Province has not yet gained anything except the roads that have been built. The people of Jaffna are not properly provided with education. The education institutions have been very badly deprived of facilities. I think it is not due to the fault of the Minister of Education. When we speak to the Ministry of Education, they say finances have not been allocated.

The hospitals are not being properly maintained. Houses are not being constructed and there is complete turmoil in the Northern Province, as far as the citizens are concerned. Fortunately, they are in a position to live because many of their relatives are living abroad and they are getting foreign remittances from them. Due to the foreign remittances, the consumption in the Northern Province is increasing and there is a 23 per cent growth of GDP. That is the cycle that goes on. But today, for a poor man in Jaffna, who has no control over his own relatives abroad or who has no other incentive, the sole asset is education. Education is his only asset and that has been his asset for the last so many years. The Tamils in the Jaffna Peninsula have got historical rights for more than 2,000 years in this country. We have discussed what discriminations the citizens of the Northern Province have faced. We have discussed that for the last 50 years; there is nothing more to be discussed. I think it is the duty of the present Government, which really got rid of the terrorist movement in this country, to prove the genuineness of the Government policy as far as the Tamils are concerned if the diaspora is to invest in Jaffna or for that matter, in Sri Lanka for the sake of its growth. As far as the foreign countries are concerned, they are zealously looking at us, wondering whether we are genuinely doing what is needed for the Tamils of this country. But, I feel the opportunity is not being properly utilized. The National Savings Bank is just one simple example where 300 employees have been recruited, but not a single Tamil. Is this going to be the policy of the Government? That is exactly what we want to know. We

can have manifestoes; we can promise to do things. But, are we doing those? As my Friend, the Hon. Yogarajan, said, it does not have to be just a manifesto. We have to see that those are enforced and the enforceability has to be carried out by the Government, showing genuineness to this country and its Tamil-speaking people.

Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for giving me an opportunity to speak today. [. . 2.38]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Hon. Deputy Speaker, I should describe the seventh Budget presented in this hallowed House by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa as a "Brilliant Budget". It shaped to cater towards a grand development process proclaimed and presently being efficiently enacted by this Government according to the "Mahinda Chintana", which the President himself launched when he was contesting for his first Presidential Election. Sir, I take extreme pleasure to state that as a Member of Parliament for as long as 20 years, I have participated and spoken in as many as 20 Budget Debates.

This is decidedly a development-oriented Budget catering to the immediate needs of every section of society, specially the farmers, the labourers, the teachers, the students and their education and the ranaviru soldiers who sacrificed their limbs in the cause for peace and eventually established the much-needed peace. Various facets of poverty alleviation too have been addressed in the allocation of welfare expenditure. The establishment of SMEs in all districts by State banks and the proposed financial assistance extended to the armed services and the Police Department and their families are good proposals in this Budget.

I heard somebody shouting from the other side this morning saying that armed personnel were only a very few and serving them will not solve the problem of the large majority of the masses in this country. What an ungrateful statement that is! If not for the heroic soldiers - the armed forces and the police - Sir, you will not be seated there in that Chair presiding over the House, and we will not be here in this House today.

579 580

Sir, a country has to honour the people who served the country. This is happening all over the world. But, due to shortsightedness and political blindness, I should say, the Opposition come out with statements of this nature. Do not belittle the army. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake was earlier saying in this House itself, . ." I am always reminded of this and it was the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera who said, " . You cannot win this war. If you say that you can win this war, it is a lie. You can never win this war. They vowed in this House. Now, these are people born in this country. They should have a sense of loyalty and patriotism. They must feel that they belong to this country. When we die our, corpses are not taken to America, London, Germany, Japan, India, Pakistan or to Saudi Arabia. No, we will be buried in this country. We were born in this country; we live in this country; we inhale the air of this country; we eat what is grown in this soil and when we die, we are buried in our own oil. So, people must remember that. It is said that everyone contributes his mite towards the development process, with a view to taking this country to the next level in achieving the envision of growth. Sri Lanka is now unique being an island of peace and on the high road to development.

Sir, yesterday I heard somebody from the Opposition referring to this Budget as "" in this House. This could be told only by a person who himself is blind, who cannot distinguish between black and white and who does not understand anything. This is not, a "" Budget. Budget ; . Budget . ? , . . . [ ] . Budget . , this is a unique Budget; Budget . ? . . , .

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, are we going to adjourn at 6 oclock?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, but there are four more Hon. Members to speak.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay. If that is so, Sir, I will conclude my speech soon. Please give me three more minutes. I thought I had 15 minutes and that is why I was speaking at a slow pace.

Sri Lanka is now a unique country. We are surrounded by nations who are sadly afflicted with continued curse of terrorism and dastard destruction of mankind. We are now a remarkably blessed country working towards sublime concept of all beings be happy. Such a lofty idea will surely be a reality in the short period ahead. This Budget certainly will contribute towards achieving that state of prosperity and peace.

Therefore, Sir, now I would in the usual traditional manner, which I used to finish my past speeches on the Budget Debate, turn a little poetical in Sinhala.
