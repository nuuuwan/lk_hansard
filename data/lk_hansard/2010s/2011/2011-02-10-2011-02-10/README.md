( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, unfortunately it has become a custom in this House that Votes of Condolence are held one year or sometimes one and a half years after a Member has passed away. We have got to fix separate additional dates and clear this backlog so that within a month or two we

are actually in a position to have the Votes of Condolence on the Members just after the death takes place especially of Sitting Members because the late Hon. Chandrasekaran passed away in 2010 at a time of election. Parliament has met in April and it is now virtually after a year or more that we are taking up the Vote of Condolence on the late Hon. Chandrasekaran.

I first met him when he was an elected member of the Talawakele Lindula Local Authority. I was the Minister of Education and I went there to inspect a training school for teachers, which had been started in a silent factory. That is the time I first met him and he used to come and discuss with me the problems of teachers in the plantation schools. We had certain plans of how to train them so that they had the required minimum standard of education that was necessary to become a teacher. The late Hon. Chandrasekaran was really actively involved in improving the social upliftment of the persons of Indian origin, especially those who worked in the plantations and whose access to education and health was denied.

I was fortunate that as the Minister of Education I was able to take over the estate schools and turn them into national schools, into the national system of education. The late Hon. Chandrasekaran at that time together with some of the others who represented the CWC, used to meet me and give me some useful and helpful suggestions in this regard. But, he parted company with the CWC and there came a period when I had to meet the relevant authorities with the support of the late Hon. Chandrasekaran because he was under detention as he was suspected of having dealings with some of the terrorist groups. I was one of those who had to press his case. Fortunately, he was released.

But, when he found it difficult to continue politics with the UNP alliance, he went over and joined the Peoples Alliance and came to Parliament in 1994. He was in the Peoples Alliance for some time. Then, when he found that neither the issues of the Tamils of Indian origin nor the Tamils in general were being settled by the Peoples Alliance Government, he came over to the Opposition. He joined the UNP; he contested from the UNP because he found that together with the bloc of votes that he had and the UNP had, he was able to secure his election to Parliament.

Again, in 2001, he came forward and contested. He became a Minister. He was in charge of estate infrastructure and the development of the community-level organizations.

The Hon. Chandrasekaran represented one section of the Tamils of Indian origin who were from the plantations and who, as my Hon. Friend would call, the "underprivileged". They were the people who had the least amount of access. Even after the steps we took in the 1980s, much more had to be done. It is not merely a question of putting money to building a road. But, how

1371 1372

do you ensure any community as "underprivileged" ? The plantation workers especially had one group, which have been overlooked in the general struggle to get franchise for them, and this is this important group which he represented.

He also became the Deputy Minister of Irrigation. It is a question which you would ask, why was he the Deputy Minister of Irrigation? Because, we had to restore the irrigation works in the North and the East. The Hon. Chandrasekaran became the Deputy Minister of Irrigation where he could deal with the two peace secretariats and the different bodies that were dealing with the repair and restoration of the minor irrigation works in the North and the East especially in the Vanni which at that time was controlled by the armed groups of the LTTE. He took that task as seriously as he took up the tasks in regard to the plantation community. I must say the reason that he got detained and the allegations thrown against him later was that he had been talking with the LTTE. He did talk with the LTTE like many others. But, it did not mean that he supported the LTTE. He did not. I remember, when he was a Minister, he went and addressed some of the cultural meetings organized by the LTTE and he was attacked by the then Opposition. But, at the same time, he went and met Prabhakaran and told him that the decision taken not to allow the Tamils to vote was wrong. He subsequently told me that the Tamils of Indian origin have decided their future separate from the LTTE while they support the general Tamil cause. So, this was the Hon. Chandrasekarans view which I appreciated though I did not agree with him for the reasons that he had for crossing over and joining the Government in 2006. Nevertheless, he felt in his own way that that was the best thing he could do for the voters whom he represented in the Nuwara Eliya and Badulla Districts.

The Hon. Chandrasekarans activities were not restricted to the plantation community. He was one of those who took up the cause of labour in general, of trade unions in general and not trade union rights and whether it was the Tamils, Sinhalese or Muslims, he was always committed to it. It is unfortunate for Hon. Chandrasekaran that he became ill early on. He disregarded his health and we lost his services to this country and to his community last year.

He was also committed to human rights. The Hon. Chandrasekaran attended many discussions on human rights. He stood for the freedom of individuals. He said, I have been arrested and I do not want anyone else to be detained. He was for the freedom of expression and at the latter stages when I spoke to him in this House, he used to speak to me separately and he was very worried about the position of the Tamils and of the anti-Tamil feelings that were going along. One of the last meetings he had was regarding the anti-Tamil postures and the difficulties the ordinary Tamils were facing even in the

hill country. He was very, very unhappy, and I must say, disappointed with the media because he said that the media had given up its independence. He said, we fought for a long time, referring to what we all had done together, for media independence and that there is no independence of the media today. Unfortunately, not only is there no independence but he found that he being a Minister of the Government and had taken up the Tamil cause, he was also getting attacked in the newspapers. He prepared some articles to be published because he was attacked by the Daily Mirror, and he wanted to insert those articles, which he felt would clarify the issues but the newspaper had not published it. Then, he complained to me and I said, there is very little I can do. As you know Chandrasekaran, these people have lost their independence and Champika Liyanarachchis guts have gone on pilgrimage. So, there is very little that you can do now except to bear it like all of us have done.

Unfortunately, this was the state of the media and he was very worried. I realized it. He felt that the Tamils of Indian origin were getting attacked. I do not want to deal at length with it, but I know that that was one of the issues that bothered him towards the end. But, the late Hon. Chandrasekaran was always for the underdog; that we have to realize. He fought for the underdog. He did not look at race, caste, creed or religion. He had a special duty in regard to Tamils of Indian origin who are underdog but nevertheless, he stood for the community as a whole and he accepted the Sri Lankan identity. Therefore, to have lost him at this time is unfortunate for all of us. We have lost another person who has dedicated for the unity of the country and the unity of the people. I want the House what we have said here to be conveyed to his family.

Thank you.

[. . 1.50] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Speaker, I thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak a few words on the Vote of Condolence of the late Hon. P. Chandrasekaran. I was so close to him for nearly 18 years that no other Member was so close to him in the way that I was so close to him.

In 1987, he was a member of the Ceylon Workers Congress. At that time, about 17 people were taken into custody and they were remanded in New Magazine Prison for nearly two and a half years. Actually what the police did was, they got them remanded, but did not send the file to the Attorney-Generals Department. So, the Hon. Chandrasekaran came up to me and asked me to help him to get them out. I went to his house and stayed there. I attended the Magistrate's Court, Nuwara Eliya several times. I requested the Magistrate of Nuwara Eliya to send a notice to the Superintendent of Police. He was told to send the file to the Attorney-Generals Department. That was done and I got them released.

At that time, the Ceylon Workers Congress was not prepared to help the people in the prisons. The reason why the Hon. Chandrasekaran left the Ceylon Workers Congress was this: he wanted to help the people in the prisons. Then, he was arrested twice. First, he was taken to custody for some incident. Then, I went to Nuwara Eliya Magistrate's Court, appeared on behalf of him, got him released and took him to Talawakele. Thereafter, he was indicted in the High Court of Kandy. Then, the case was transferred to Colombo from the Kandy High Court. The judge who heard the case in Colombo was transferred to Panadura. I appeared for him there also. I got him bailed out, brought him to my house and sent him to Talawakele to attend the marriage of his sister. I also went there to attend the wedding. Thereafter only he started this Up Country Peoples Front. Up to that time, the up-country people were known as "Indian Tamils".

But, after he started that party, they came to be known as "up-country Tamils" and not Indian Tamils. He was so close to the Tamils that he was in a position to win any election on any ticket from Talawakele in the Nuwara Eliya District.

In 2003, there was a function at the Weerasingham Hall to celebrate my reaching the 70th year. He came there and participated in that; he came all the way from Talawakele to Jaffna.

In 1994, Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga became the Prime Minister because of the Hon. Chandrasekaran. Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga wanted only one Member to enable her to become the Prime Minister. I spoke to the Hon. Chandrasekaran and he was prepared to help her become the Prime Minister.

I am so sad that he is no more with us. My wife and I used to go to his place, stay there and go to Nuwara Eliya. I was so close to him. I do not know how to express my sadness. Sir, I express my condolences to his wife, family and other members and I want you, as Speaker, to convey our deep feelings for the Hon. Chandrasekaran to the members of his family.

( () - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana - Minister of Scientific Affairs) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it is with a deep sense of regret and sympathy that I, on behalf of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, speak today about our late Colleague, Minister, Member of Parliament, political Leader of the Up-country Peoples Front and left-oriented progressive Leader, the Hon. P. Chandrasekeran, who passed away on the 1st of January, 2010.

He, from Talawakele, rose from among the Tamil people of the up-country area as a leader. He received his early education there but had to suspend that in view of the premature death of his father to support his family and through those hardships he evolved through the Ceylon Workers' Congress, as a trade union leader and also as a political leader. But, it is evident that he disagreed with the politics of the CWC to the extent that he wanted to align himself with the left politics of the country and at the same time, he wanted to get away from narrow sectarian thinking and worked together with people outside his community. This led to his forming his own party, the Up-country Peoples Front and he, in that capacity, played a critical role when he provided the necessary support to enable the Peoples Alliance Government to be formed in 1994 by providing the extra Member in Parliament that that Government needed to survive. So, he became part of the progressive current in this country, the movement that is taking the country forward.

He became a Deputy Minister and a Minister on several occasions during which he made a valuable contribution, firstly, to his own community, the people of the plantations who perhaps have contributed more than any other community to the development of our country through the plantation sector, particularly, the tea plantation sector. We know that by generating the foreign exchange that the country required for its development, what a valuable contribution that has been. But, unfortunately that section of our community has been

1395 1396

among the most neglected and therefore he had to battle on behalf of the workers, the poor people on the plantations and he did that with commitment. He even went to jail for his political beliefs and worked both as a trade union leader and a political leader on behalf of those people until his death.

As he was seated next to me in Cabinet, I had several occasions to exchange views with him and I found that he was someone who was deeply concerned about the future and the livelihoods not only of the people on the plantations but also of the poor people, the working people of this country in its entirety.

I also had an interaction with him and his party during the All Party Representative Committee, where I had to get his views with regard to what should be done for the plantation workers, particularly in relation to the proposal that I made that we should try to set up villages in the plantations where people who have been working on the plantations, who have been living on the plantations will enjoy the same rights as villagers elsewhere in the country and he was very supportive of the idea. He was someone who worked genuinely, felt very deeply for the people who were suffering on the plantations and right up to the very end of his life, he remained devoted to that cause.

I would like to state that his death was a premature one and as the LSSP, as a party representing the Left Movement, we were deeply saddened by his demise. He made an extremely valuable contribution to the Progressive Movement in this country, a valuable service to the plantation Tamil community and I would like on this occasion, to pay our tribute to him for all that he did and would like to express to his family, to the members of his party the deep regrets of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. I salute his name in the tradition of the Left Movement as a leader that the Left would always hold in the highest regard and appreciate in retrospect his valuable contribution to our country.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) . . .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) ?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) No. Hon. Speaker, this is a matter of law. . All that I have to make out is a prima facie case of a breach of privilege. If any Hon. Member makes out a prima facie case of a breach of privilege, then you have to hear it, whether it happened today, yesterday or day before and an Hon. Member can take up a breach of privilege not only affecting him but also a breach of privilege affecting any other Hon. Member of the House. In England, the Speaker himself had taken up a matter of a breach of privilege, which had been committed against an officer of the House. This is mentioned in page 382, Chapter XVII, under "Order of Items of Business in Sitting" of the Sixteenth Edition of Erskine May.

Also, I would like to state that since we are having the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Meeting here

in Sri Lanka, according to the Latimer House Principles, which the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association follows, Parliamentarians must be able to carry out their legislative and constitutional functions in accordance with the Constitution, free from unlawful interference. The Inter-Parliamentary Union of which we are members, has now adopted a declaration made by the African Parliamentary Union together with the IPU and the UNDP which states, "just like Members of Parliament who are part of the Government majority, Members of the Opposition require full respect for basic rights. For example, they must all be able to enjoy the right to life and therefore, in their political activities, be shielded from any measure which would infringe upon their personal integrity or harm their property."

This letter has been written today. Eight Members of Parliament had their vehicles damaged and today I have got the reply saying that the Government is not responsible. Therefore, what I am taking up today is a matter that came up today. If you want to find out what happened to an individual Member, that is another matter. But, I think you have to go into this issue of vehicles of eight Members being damaged. In fact, when one Hon. Member was getting into a private vehicle, they said, . ." '' '' .
