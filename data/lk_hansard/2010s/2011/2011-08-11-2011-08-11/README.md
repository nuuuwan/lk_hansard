I want to say a few words about him in English. He had one of the keenest and sharpest minds that I have seen in politics; whether in this world or in the next world, we do not know where, but that mind is still working. All I want to say now is that he was a friend who helped me in politics, and from whom I learnt many things as to how to face adversity more than any other issue. I want to quote just a few lines from a poem by William Shakespeare. It states, I quote:

Fear no more the heat o' the sun; Nor the furious winter's rages, Thou thy worldly task hast done, Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages;

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Order, please! . , [ ] .

, , [ ] . Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. CHANDIMA WEERAKKODY] took the Chair.

[2.55 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Mr. Deputy Speaker, in 2007, when the news reached us that the Hon. E.P. Paul Perera had passed away, the country recorded that it had lost a very capable and efficient citizen of Sri Lanka, more particularly for the United National Party. Much about him was mentioned by the Ministers, the Leader of the Opposition and many Members of the Opposition and I do not wish to repeat them again.

However, we have to appreciate that the Hon. Paul Perera was a brilliant man. He was a strategist, a tactician, an efficient administrator and a shrewd politician. During his career he was able to enter the Civil Service and functioned in a very high capacity in some of the institutions such as the Port Cargo Corporation and he was the Competent Authority of the Times of Ceylon newspapers at that time. Thereafter, he entered the legal profession. Even though he had passed out as a lawyer and was a Presidents Counsel, he took up the practice a couple of years later and he associated himself during his tenure as a lawyer with President J.R. Jayewardene. He gave the late President all the points, which he had to touch on, in order to gain victory at the 1977 Election and finally to be the President of Sri Lanka. It was mentioned earlier that he was one of those people who prevented President J.R. Jayewardene being sacked from the United National Party. When he was away at an international conference, the Hon. Dudley Senanayake sought to throw him out of the UNP and if that happened, maybe we would not have been here today in Parliament. The Jayewardene regime owes a great debt to the Hon. Paul Perera who went in the nick of time to courts and obtained an injunction preventing Dudley Senanayake from bringing a motion to expel President J.R. Jayewardene.

Thereafter, came the Elections and the Hon. Paul Perera played a vital role to bring the United National Party to the winning post in 1977. Having done that, he took up a couple of posts. Of that, the most important post that he took up was to be the Deputy Director-General of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission. That was the turning point of the Sri Lankan economy. During the Bandaranaike regime, the country was starved of employment and foreign investment; the economy was stagnated and the people were struggling; there was no foreign exchange as people could not go abroad and people had no food to eat. It was a very difficult time at which the President J.R. Jayewardene took over and he had to find ways and means of meeting the unemployment situation that existed in the country. One of the key proposals that he wanted to implement was the building up of free trade zones in this country. Much was studied from Singapore. The Hon. Paul Perera did go to Singapore and study the nuts and bolts of what a zone

371 372

means. Even though Mr. Upali Wijewardene was the Chairman of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission, the Hon. Paul Perera was the live wire, he was the man behind the scene; he was the man who went to different parts of the world, to the Western countries, and induced investors to come to Sri Lanka and set up factories in the zones, particularly in the Katunayake Free Trade Zone, the first free trade zone in Sri Lanka.

Thereafter, over a hundred thousand young people, men and women, in Sri Lanka were employed. The unemployment stagnation was cleared and many of the people even from the far away villages came to Katunayake seeking employment. This, I think was the turning point - as mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition - of the economy of Sri Lanka. Having established the Katunayake Free Trade Zone, he took up the task of establishing the Biyagama Free Trade Zone. Biyagama was a difficult area. I was told that during that time there was no infrastructure at all in the Biyagama area and it was full of robbers, and various kinds of criminals dominated that area. However, with the establishment of the Biyagama Free Trade Zone, it became a highly developed area with new roads, frontages, and so on.

So, Sir, these are some landmarks in Sri Lankan history and in our economy. He introduced the concept of setting up free trade zones and inviting foreign investors to Sri Lanka. I remember very distinctly he often travelled to the Western world, to countries like Japan, the USA and Canada trying to attract foreign investment in order to create more industries and trading institutions in Sri Lanka, and that was a success. Even today, there are over 200,000 young boys and girls employed there, and the architect behind the creating of these zones was no other than the late Hon. Paul Perera.

As a lawyer he was very successful. I am aware of the number of cases that he was able to gain victory in whichever court he appeared. Even as a politician, he made a great contribution to the Attanagalla Electorate as was mentioned by the Leader of the House. Though the Attanagalla Electorate was represented by the Prime Minister, the basic infrastructure development was really created by no other than the Hon. Paul Perera. The court house was a blessing to the people of that area and the technical school that was established are some of the landmarks even today that we find. In that way, he, not only as an administrator but also as a politician, as a people's representative did his part and his duty. One of his ambitions was to make Sri Lanka an industrial country and develop the Sri Lankan economy.

Besides that, he made a tremendous contribution to the United National Party. One of those, I still remember as a

lawyer myself, was the creation of the National Lawyers Association. During President J.R.Jayewardenes regime and that of President R. Premadasa, the National Lawyers Association played a very important part in party politics, which I think was an asset to our political leaders. The Hon. Paul Perera was the live wire of the National Lawyers Association.

As one of the organizers of the Gampaha District, he was able to keep the District Group together. There were no divisions or dissensions and a proper leadership was given by the Hon. Paul Perera. There is no doubt that as the Minister of Justice with his legal background, he made a tremendous contribution towards the reforms in the judicial and the legal spheres of Sri Lanka. Many of the amendments and the Bills that are coming out today was the thinking of the Hon. E. P. Paul Perera and which he originated in the Ministry of Justice at that time.

Sir, he was a loving husband, he looked after his wife and children and so much so, that during his period as a politician, Mrs. Kulaseeli Perera was the Chairman and the Organizer of the Gampaha District and did a yeoman service to the district. I am sure she is here in the Gallery listening to the achievements of her husband and their political life would have been really exciting.

They had five children. One is Ronald Perera who is now closely following the footsteps of his father. He is one of the finest lawyers we find today practising in the Supreme Court. He is rendering a great service to the United National Party in defending the Party in all matters, when necessary, and when called upon to do so. We are very proud that the Hon. E.P. Paul Perera has produced a son, who is able to equally perform as his father did when he was a lawyer and I am sure very soon Ronald Perera will also follow his fathers footsteps to enter politics.

Then, we have Rodney, one of our senior Ambassadors. He is a career diplomat who has always performed very well as mentioned by some of the Ministers and he will go further, he will climb further in the diplomatic circle. Then, his son Arnold and his daughter are also present here.

Sir, much can be said about him. I do not want to repeat all what was said by the Hon. Leader of the House and by the other Ministers. But, I have to mention that the Hon. E.P. Paul Perera was one of the finest strategists that the United National Party had in facing all problems which we had during the last 30 to 40 years. So, as I said, his demise is really a loss to the country and more particularly to the United National Party.

May his soul rest in peace!

Thank you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, Benjamin Franklin once said, God works wonders now and then; Behold! a lawyer, an honest man.

Today, Sir, we rise in this Parliament with a heavy heart to express our grief on the passing away of some great men, who have enriched the political life of this country. A great lawyer and an honest man, as Benjamin Franklin said, was the late Hon. E.P. Paul Perera. Today, we are also delivering our condolences on the demise of the late Hon. N.M. Buhardeen, the late Hon. Sarath Chandra Rajakaruna and also the late Hon. P.O. Wimalanaga.

We knew the Hon. E.P. Paul Perera quite well. We were intimate friends. When we used to visit Braemar at Ward Place, Colombo, the ancestral home of late President J.R. Jayewardene, the first person we met was the Hon. E.P. Paul Perera. I carry nostalgic memories of meeting him several times in the lawn of that ancestral home with late President J.R. Jayewardene and also with our good friend, Senator S.Z.M. Mashoor Moulana.

The Hon. E.P. Paul Perera could always smile, crack a joke and was very friendly.

He had a very incisive legal mind, deeply involved with legal matters. A clever lawyer himself, he used to speak to me and Mr. Mashoor Moulana in pure Tamil language. That was the finest aspect of the late Hon. Paul Perera, I should say, because he always made us feel that we were one of him and he was one of us. At every election he used to walk with Mr. J.R. Jayewardene from Ward Place to Alexandra College to cast the vote and the Hon. Paul Perera was always on his right. He, in fact I should say, emphatically guided, Mr. J.R. Jayewardene and gave him all the advice needed in law, in politics, in social activities, and in many other fields. He never faulted, he kept his steps right, walked straight as bulging as he was. He was also very straight and upright, a great man indeed!

Sir, I should record our gratitude in this House for one important thing that he did during his lifetime. When he was the Head of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission, there was a plan to put up a Haj Memorial Building closer to the Katunayake Airport in remembrance of the Hajis - the shuhadas of Indonesia - who were killed in a disastrous plane crash at Kimbulapitiya, Katunayake. Immediately after that, the Indonesian Ambassador met the then Speaker, Deshamanya Alhaj M.A. Bakeer Markar. It was such a tragic incident that we had never experienced in our

lifetime in this country. There were charred bodies of 300 odd Hajis. They were like burnt logs, and we carried them under the direction of the Hon. Bakeer Markar and all the other volunteers to the vehicles to be airlifted to Kalimantan in Indonesia, where we later visited and prayed for their souls with the then Speaker. The Indonesian Ambassador approached us, they wanted a piece of land. The Minister for Religious Affairs of Indonesia came here and the Hon. Paul Perera, very generously - although he had a lot of problems - and with the persuasion of the late Upali Wijewardene, allocated a piece of land for putting up the Haj Memorial Building which you can see now just before you turn to the airport. It was a massive project initiated at that time with a prayer hall, a library for all the people and resting rooms for the Hajis who were coming from all parts of the country. Whoever who stayed there and took flights for the Haj Pilgrimage would remember forever the great act of charity done by the Hon. Paul Perera by giving that land.

Sir, I also remember visiting with him, many electorates and other areas addressing meetings. His beloved wife, Mrs. Kulaseeli Perera, the then Chairman of the Western Provincial Council also accompanied him.

He had an art of its own when dealing with people. He was like the man who came to the bridge - cannons in front, cannons behind, cannons on right and cannons on left. But, the Hon. Paul Perera, undaunted, unperturbed, arrived at the bridge and crossed the bridge. That was not only the story of his successful life but also the story of the United National Party as well. It is sometimes, unfair, Sir, to speak about him only to the work he did for the United National Party. No, he was a man more than that. He gave his advice to other deserving quarters as well. He was very patriotic. He liked this country.

He was a good Roman Catholic, and, Sir, as a result he helped to build a united nation. He did not want divisions in this country. He had many battles with others on that subject. When I mention him as a very good Catholic, Sir, I also wanted to refer today that sometimes people who do not know the vision and mission of the Hon. Paul Perera, make statements condemning even His Lordship Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the Archbishop of Colombo. There were statements made in the media, Sir, criticizing him, which cannot be done. I think the Hon. John Amaratunga would agree with me on that. That will be an insult to that religion, Catholicism. Sir, I knew Archbishop Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith when he was in the Maggona Seminary. He was a person of learning, who had full of mercy in him and that is why he rose to this high position. At this moment when we are remembering the Hon. Paul Perera, I should look at such a statement by our Opposition MP with revulsion. I lodge my protest against saying that he has been linked with one of our Members, the Hon. Duminda Silva, in the matter of cleaning up Colombo. The Archbishop always would want to help the people by building them houses but

375 376

would never want to destabilise people. He would certainly look to the needs of those people first. Now, in order to make remarks, such as, he was using trickery, is very unfair by any person to have made such blasphemous statements about the Archbishop of Colombo.

The Hon. Paul Perera succeeded Mr. M.D.H. Jayawardena in 1983 and as was said, he won the Kaduwela Electorate and also the Gampaha District. He was first the District Minister for Pononnaruwa, then the Justice Minister, the Organizer for the Attanagalla Electorate, the Minister for Science and Technology and in 1993, he became the Minister of Lands.

He was helpful in establishing the court in Attanagalla. When we confronted him in certain land matters as far as the Muslims are concerned, he was very helpful to us. Sir, when we go to him, one unique feature in him was he studied the case very well. He did not see to which community that person belonged, but always readied himself up in order to solve the problem and these cases of lands were settled amicably by him.

He spoke Tamil. He used to always call us ! ? "!" "

?" " !. Sir, we need that type of people in this country today - trilingualists - in order to build a harmonious and united Sri Lanka with understanding with all communities that live in this land.

Sir, once again, while concluding I would pay our respect to the Hon. Paul Perera and also convey our condolences to Madam Kulaseeli Perera, children Rodney, Ronald, Arnold, Harold and Pushpamala. I would end, Sir, by quoting an epigram by William Erskine.

It states, I quote:

This house, where once a lawyer dwelt, Is now a smiths. Alas! How rapidly the iron age Succeeds the age of brass!

Thank you, Sir.

Mr. Presiding Member, I too wish to associate myself on behalf of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress to pay tribute to one of the illustrious Members who entered politics during the J.R. Jayewardene era in this country.

379 380

The late Hon. E.P. Paul Perera was a multifaceted personality who adorned very important positions. At the very outset he entered the Ceylon Civil Service, as it was then, a much coveted position in the Public Service of this country. But, his eminent qualities did not allow him to continue in the Public Service for a long time. While having been a serving member of the Public Service, he distinguished himself by passing the Attorney's final examination with first-class honours. All of us who are lawyers in this House know that anyone who is able to pass the Attorney's final examination with first-class honours is certainly a worthy material to enter the profession. He indeed displayed the qualities of a very sharp and incisive legal mind, which he brought to the practising period of him in the Bar in this country.

Having served the Bar with distinction, he entered politics during the most troublesome period for one of the principal political parties of this country. Sir, 1970s was a very challenging period for that party having lost the General Elections and given a two-thirds majority to the then governing SLFP-led coalition. His entry to UNP politics was as a Secretary of the UNP Lawyers Association. His dedication was such that he was successful in securing a five-sixths majority for the United National Party having served as one of the three-member organizing committee for the General Elections of 1977. That unique feat enabled him to be appointed to the Greater Colombo Economic Commission initially as the Director-General (Administration) and thereafter to follow the coveted position of the Director-General after the illustrious Upali Wijewardena. Many Members before me have spoken about interesting episodes and anecdotes from his illustrious career. I do not want to repeat all those features of his political career, but certainly in his Parliamentary career, he held many portfolios.

He was a predecessor to the portfolio I am holding, the Ministry of Justice and was also the Minister in charge of Science and Technology, and the Minister of Lands subsequently. And, most importantly, this House being the primary watchdog over public finance, he was one of the worthy chairmen of the Public Accounts Committee. I, during my tenure of Chairmanship in the Public Accounts Committee, benefited much by going through the Reports that he presented as the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee in this House.

The Hon. Paul Perera, having been dwelled in the Chambers of eminent counsels such as Mr. H.W. Jayawardene QC and Mr. M.Thiruchelvam QC, was subsequently granted silk and was appointed a Presidents Counsel in 1988. His incisive legal mind had helped the United National Party immensely and it is no surprise that one of his offsprings, Ronald, is presently serving the United National Party as a hard-working member for the UNP Lawyers Association. Similarly, Rodney, another

son of his, is serving in the Foreign Service as one of the senior Diplomats that we are all proud of. It is my wish that his children would follow the footsteps of his father and serve this country in the manner he served and I would like to convey, on behalf of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, our condolences to the family of the Hon. Paul Perera, to his wife Mrs. Kulaseeli Perera who was a former Chairperson of the Western Provincial Council, his children Ronald, Arnold, Harold, Rodney and daughter Pushpamala.

Thank you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you, Hon. Minister. May I inform the Hon. Members to be brief as possible in their speeches since we have three more Votes of Condolence to be taken up. We must be fair by the members of the families of the respective Members who passed away who are present in the gallery on invitation by the House.

The next speaker is the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake) Mr. Presiding Member, today, I rise to address this House on the Vote of Condolence on the death of the Hon. Paul Perera, Presidents Counsel and former Member of Parliament.

Born to illustrious Christian parents in Negombo, the Hon. Paul Perera excelled in sports at his alma mater, Maris Stella College, where among many other achievements, he won the best performance award for high jump and subsequently toured India as part of the football team. After completing his primary and secondary education there, he entered the University of Ceylon, Colombo, to read for his Bachelor of Arts

Degree. He graduated with an Honours Degree in History that influenced his interest in History that he held throughout his life.

It was at the university itself that he met and married the love of his life, Kulaseeli Wijeratne, a conservative Buddhist by birth. It was evident even at that time his willingness to break through barriers such as religion.

After he joined the Ceylon Civil Service, he held several important positions and during this time he benefited from the Government Scholarship Programme to study at the Law College and as a result became an advocate in 1960 serving as Legal Officer of the Port Cargo Corporation, which later became the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. He went on to private practice thereafter and became a very successful lawyer and a Presidents Counsel.

The Hon. Paul Perera was a lifelong supporter of the United National Party. He began closely associating with the former President J.R. Jayewardene from 1970. He was instrumental in supporting Mr. Jayewardene in the re-organization of the United National Party.

Sir, Hon. Paul Perera organized the inaugural meeting the National Lawyers' Association - the forerunner to the UNP Lawyers' Association - in August 1970 at "Sirikotha". He then, served as its First Secretary, fighting for the rights of those affected by arbitrary dismissals, as in the case of over 350 Point Controllers appointed by the CTB who were unceremoniously terminated by the then SLFP Government. He successfully represented the sacked employees at the Labour Tribunal and they were reinstated.

There were important instances where he directly assisted Mr. Jayewardene and thereby changed the course of Sri Lankas modern history. In 1971, Mr. Jayewardene proposed that the Opposition cooperate with the Government on pressing national issues - this did not go down well with others in the party. A disciplinary committee was appointed and the findings recommended that he should be punished. Prior to leaving to attend a Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference in London, the Hon. Paul Perera insisted that Mr. Jayewardene give a power of attorney to be used in case legal action was necessary to stave off his expulsion, and Mr. Jayewardene did so. In his absence, a resolution was moved to expel Mr. Jayewardene and a meeting was fixed to consider this resolution. Acting immediately, the Hon. Paul Perera, obtained an injunction restraining the UNP from expelling him just hours before the Working Committee Meeting was to commence.

His commitment to the UNP was total and he was actively involved with the very many Sathyagraha political campaigns and other political activities from 1970-1977. When eventually the party came to power in

385 386

[ ]

2011 11

1977, it was a momentous occasion for the Hon. Paul Perera as he loved his country and the party. He looked down upon those who crossed over to fulfil their personal agenda. He was personally approached and requested many a time to cross over, especially in 1994, but as a true party man, he steadfastly refused to betray his principles and the loyalty towards the UNP.

Sir, As District Organizer for the Gampaha District, he was instrumental in the UNP winning 11 seats in the District. The new Government appointed him as the Competent Authority of the Times of Ceylon Newspapers and as a Director of the Bank of Ceylon. He was also the Deputy Director-General (Administration) of the GCEC - later called the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, for which he gave up his lucrative legal practice. It was during his time that Sri Lankas first Free Trade Zone in Katunayake and subsequently in Biyagama were established heralding the vital garment manufacturing sector that we depend so much upon today. He also worked diligently to increase the US apparel quota which was a very important achievement that earned valuable foreign exchange for Sri Lanka. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have to be brief or you may even table the rest of your speech.

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake) Mr. Presiding Member, just give me two more minutes.

In recognition of his achievement, he was appointed as the Director-General of the GCEC succeeding the legendary Upali Wijewardene in 1982.

In the sphere of politics, he entered Parliament in July 1983 representing the Kaduwela Electorate and was appointed as the District Minister of Polonnaruwa in October 1983, with the special responsibility of resolving issues arising from illegal settlements in the Maduru Oya area. He was subsequently appointed as the Deputy Minister of Justice in 1988 and thereafter served as the Minister of Justice.

Despite some differences in opinion, he resisted the attempts to impeach the then President Premadasa and supported him completely. This was a reflection of his policy not to allow personal matters mar his better judgment and policies and accordingly aided by his son Ronald who functioned as a junior counsel, he took an active part in the defence of the then President Premadasa in the election petition filed against him.

He was appointed as the Cabinet Minister of Lands in August 1993 after President D.B. Wijetunga took office.

He also served as the Chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts and the Committee on Public Enterprises in Parliament where his independent and fearless qualities were well respected.

Sir, I also would like to emphasize on something that matters very much to my heart. I remember that I had done an interview on TV once and the very next day I met the Hon. Paul Perera at the footsteps to Sirikotha and these were the very words I remember him saying: Rosy, you were marvellous yesterday in your interview and I agree with you wholeheartedly that we should not be sending mothers who have very young children overseas as migrant workers. I opposed this when this opening came during President J.R. Jayewardenes time. He was one of those people who wanted to stop women with young children going overseas and I admire him for that because he valued family life.

The late Hon. Paul Pereras life and the legacy can be encapsulated in his favourite saying from the Bible. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you may table the rest of your speech because we have very limited time. There are three other Votes of Condolence to be taken up. ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake) St. Marks Gospel 8:36 - What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul?

I offer my condolences to his family members who are present here today.

May his soul rest in peace!

Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Gamini Lokuge. You may have only about three minutes.

Mr. Presiding Member, the late Hon. Noor Mohamed Buhardeen was very popular as an illustrious industrialist of this country and I had the rare privilege of having served him for a while in the group of companies that he had formed, which had been referred to by the previous Members before me. My acquaintance with him gave me

many rare insights to this mans wonderful personality. His philanthropy is something that was very pure and genuine. There are many thousands of people from all races in this country who will bear testimony for the wonderful gifted nature of the Hon. N.M. Buhardeen.

Mr. Presiding Member, his memory as an industrialist is unique in that he was perhaps one of those people who realized very early that with no natural comparative advantage beyond the abundant cheap labour in this country, it fell on the business genius of a handful of pioneers like the Hon. Noor Mohamed Buhardeen to harness this potential and ultimately push the garment exports to become the number one foreign exchange earner within a very short period in this country. We all know that in a poor country like ours with a small manufacturing base and a vast rural majority, the garment industry offers a labour intensive way of lifting people out of poverty. It was the Hon. Buhardeen who was one among the first to take the garment industry to the rural areas and in 1979, he established the Ceylon Garments Limited and Lankamerica Garments Limited in places like Akurana and expanded it to other areas in the neighbouring hamlets of the rural outskirts of Kandy. The Hon. Buhardeen under his tutelage has brought up many industrialists in the garment sector. To my mind, at least 20 such big garment industrialists were actually brought into business by the Hon. Buhardeen and his patronage. In fact, in around 1985, he had the largest amount of workforce in the garment industry as a single group of companies and he had received many export awards for his excellent performance in promoting garments to the international market.

The Hon. Buhardeens memory is simply not confined to the garment industry. When he entered politics, I had the rare opportunity of being by his side when my late leader, the Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff visited him in his office to invite him to be the first nominee for the National List of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, before we contested the 1989 Parliamentary Elections.

That was a watershed period in this countrys history. President Ranasinghe Premadasa had won with a narrow margin in a hotly-contested Presidential Election. It was the decision of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress towards the end of the campaign to shift from our engagement with the then Democratic People's Alliance. That made the difference in bringing His Excellency Ranasinghe Premadasa to power. Even at that juncture, despite the fact that he had his close friendship with the late Hon. A.C.S. Hameed who was a towering figure in the then UNP regime, the Hon. Buhardeen took an enormous political risk in joining the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. Not only did he join the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress but his strength as a foremost businessman assisted us financially in a great way to successfully enter Parliament with four Members in our initial attempt in the Parliamentary Election of February 1989. From then

413 414

[ ]

2011 11

onwards, his service to our Party made us stronger and towards the end, he, on a misunderstanding though, did leave us, continued to maintain very close cordial relationship with us.

I must say that his performance at the next Parliamentary Elections where he contested the Matale District on the UNP ticket has left a record up to date where he scored almost 25,000 preferential votes being a minority Member in the Matale District. Up to date it has not been surpassed by any other minority candidate in the Matale District for a General Election. That shows the immense popularity he commanded in politics having being a nominated Member for the first term. Sir, may I say a few words in Tamil?

( ) (The Presiding Member) You may have to speed up because there is another Vote of Condolence to be taken up. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes, I will. With your indulgence, I may take another five more minutes to say a few words in Tamil.

( ) (The Presiding Member) I am very sorry because there are other Members to speak. I will be able to give you only two more minutes the most because there is another Vote of Condolence on the late Hon. Sarath Chandra Rajakaruna. His family members are here. We must be fair by them.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Okay. Therefore, Sir, I do not want to switch on to Tamil but simply to say that the Hon. Buhardeens memory will go down in the annals of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress as a personality who lent us his generous support to face the challenges that we had to face at the very initial period in this Partys history. Today being one of the foremost minority political parties in this country, we would like to pay our tribute to this wonderful personality, whose philanthropy has known no bounds and as people say in the words of James Barron Hope, Tis after death that we measure men, And, in the Hon. Buhardeen and his life, we have certainly measured a man whose life was such a fountain for many others to flourish.

With those words, may I ask you to convey my sympathies to his family, his beloved wife, his youngest brother, Mr. Hameed who is in the Gallery today, his eldest son Imthiaz, his eldest son-in-law, Faris, his other daughters and sons-in-law.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by both sides of the House on the death of the Hon. Noor Mohamed Buhardeen, ex-Member of Parliament.

I too wanted to speak about him today but that right is denied since I am chairing the House now. But, I pray for his soul. As it was said, when this Parliament was built, a room was reserved for the Muslim Members and the staff to observe their five-times daily prayers which is Farl. He carpeted that room. When we pray in that room in this holy month of Ramadan, we pray for the soul of the late Hon. Buhardeen. I pray that Allah grants him "Jennathul Firdous. He served in this House for five years, four months and one day.

I shall direct the Secretary-General of Parliament to make a Minute of the Proceedings of the Meeting today and send a copy thereof to the members of the bereaved family.

We will now take up the Vote of Condolence on the late Hon. Sarath Chandra Rajakaruna. Order, please! Mr. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair.
