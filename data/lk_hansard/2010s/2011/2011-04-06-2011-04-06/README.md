Commissioner of Elections ; . , - Election Commission - . . . . .

In terms of Article 41A(1) of the Constitution, His Excellency the President appoints the Commissions referred to in Schedule I of the said Article. In doing so, His Excellency the President should seek observations of the Parliamentary Council. , .

Section 36(4) of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution provides for the person holding the post of Commissioner of Elections at the time, to continue to hold office until the Election Commission is constituted. . The proviso to Section 36(4) provides for the President to appoint the Additional Commissioner of Elections or the Deputy Commissioner of Elections to the post of Commissioner of Elections, if His Excellency considers it expedient to do so or if the exigencies of a situation so requires it. Accordingly, His Excellency the President appointed the Additional Commissioner of Elections to the post until the Election Commission is constituted, as the former Commissioner of Elections, Mr. Dayananda Dissanayake, requested him to take appropriate action enabling him to relinquish the duties of the Commissioner of Elections.

, . . According to the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, there are five Members in the Parliamentary Council : the Hon. Prime Minister, the Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Prime Ministers nominee - that is, the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer - and the Hon. Leader of the Oppositions nominee, the Hon. D.M. Swaminathan. Today, I want to tell this House and the country that we have already appointed three Commissions. The Council met under the Chairmanship of the Hon. Speaker, but the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and the Hon. Swaminathan never attended it. The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan came out in

public and said - I think it was "The Nation" newspaper or "The Sunday Times" newspaper which asked him, Why did you not attend it? - My Leader told me not to go. This is the way the Hon. Leader of the Opposition is treating the Constitution; this is the way he is treating Parliament. He nominates a Member and tells him, Do not go to the Council.

. DISPLEASURE OVER QUEEN'S AWARD TO MR. ARUMUGAM THEVARAJAN

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Sir, it is with some sorrow that I move,

That this House do stand adjourned to express its surprise that the Government of New Zealand saw fit to honour Mr. Arumugam Thevarajan, a member of the so-called Transitional Government of Tamil Eelam , in the recent New Year Awards presented by the Queen; to regret that such an award was conferred upon an individual pursuing a separatist agenda during a post-conflict situation in Sri Lanka where reconciliation between all communities is of paramount importance; to appreciate the prompt reaction of Sri Lanka in providing assistance to New Zealand following the disastrous Christchurch earthquake; to acknowledge the positive trade relations between New Zealand and Sri Lanka and recognize that this contributes nearly $300 million each year to the New Zealand economy, mainly through the export of milk powder to Sri Lanka by Fonterraa; and to urge the Ministry of External Affairs not only to raise Sri Lankan concerns with the Government of New Zealand but also to ensure prompt replies to these concerns, inasmuch as the positive relations between the peoples of the two countries should not be adversely affected by insensitive indulgence of a separatist agenda".

I am sorry, Mr. Presiding Member, because I had thought that relations between our countries were at a level which ensured sensitivity to the concerns of the other. It was worrying therefore to see the New Zealand Government nominating an avowed separatist, associated with the excesses of a terrorist group and its successors, for such a great honour.

I say "great honour", because New Zealand is undoubtedly a country, apart from the United Kingdom, in which an honour from the Queen is taken most seriously. Mr. Arumugam Thevarajan, who is one of the two members representing New Zealand in the so-called

Transitional Government of Tamil Eelam, was given the Queens Service Medal, for which he must have been nominated by the current New Zealand Government. Not at all surprisingly, neither to us nor to that Government, he took advantage of the honour to inform the media that What is happening in Sri Lanka is not war or even riot - it is genocide.

The TamilNet article in which the account of Mr. Thevarajan and his politicking appeared, mentioned that two other Tamils had been honoured in the British New Year Honours. Neither seems to have been involved in separatism, and I believe that we too as Sri Lankans can be proud of the contribution to education of Mr. Yogamoorthy, who was born and educated in Sri Lanka like Mr. Thevarajan. Mr. Yogamoorthy was a graduate of Peradeniya and has used the skills he obtained through our free education system to shine as an Engineer in England, to the extent of being able to lecture even to the British Army on the Rhine.

The other person to receive an MBE was Lakshmi Holmstrom, who was originally from India. TamilNet suggests support for their cause by nothing that she has translated . a good number of Eezham Tamil poetry into English, but Ms. Holmstrom is simply an excellent scholar who has done much for Tamil literature in general. While her sympathies for Tamil people are understandable, as those of many of us in this House, I do not think she would ever lend support to terrorism.

If Britain then has been circumspect, in spite - I am sure - of pressures from those hangers-on in the last British Parliament who furthered a terrorist cause for electoral advantage, it is doubly sad that New Zealand has failed to live up to the ideals we both share as democratic countries. We have shown our sympathy for their suffering after the recent earthquake and we must congratulate our diplomatic and consular officials for their prompt action in this regard. I hope too that we will also continue to make more tangible and continuous benefits to the New Zealand economy through our passion for their milk powder. I personally feel that this is an area in which successful marketing has triumphed over health considerations, but I do not think even those who agree with me about the disadvantages of powdered milk would consider trying to reduce the trade gap between our countries. It would be nice, though I should add, if New Zealand too were to help us to improve our own dairy industry in the North. This is, I think, being done by more active supporters of Sri Lanka such as the Netherlands, but perhaps New Zealand too would consider such assistance in a field in which they have profited from us so successfully in the past.

Given our good relations, Mr. Presiding Member, I cannot believe that New Zealand could have deliberately engaged in actions that lend strength to proponents of separatism and terrorism. It is possible that they have not

1243 1244

been adequately briefed about the situation. In this regard, I believe it important that our Ministry of External Affairs make it clear to its counterpart that we are deeply hurt. We should not only protest through our High Commission in Australia, which is, I believe, accredited to New Zealand too, but we should also make contact with the New Zealand High Commissioner to Sri Lanka who is based in Delhi.

I should note that the High Commission there has seemed to me sensitive about Sri Lankan concerns.

I was able to assist the High Commissioner a couple of years ago about a consular question with which he was deeply but very practically concerned. Later, our own High Commission in Delhi, which maintained good contacts with high professionalism with their counterparts there, arranged a very positive meeting for me when I visited them, at a time when there was some unfair criticism of Sri Lanka by other countries.

But, I think it is important too that we should make clear our concerns, diplomatically and quietly but definitely. For too long, Mr. Presiding Member, we have allowed feelings to be built up against us which we have ignored following which we tend to react dramatically when problems arise. I, myself have in the past advocated that we should call in people when difficulties begin and quietly make clear our position. I believe we have every right to deplore support for separatism and to expect that friendly nations refrain from providing implicit encouragement to the remnants of the Tiger caravan. That picked up a lot of decent people in what seemed its relentless march to success from 2001 onwards. Now that we have dealt with that, we must also teach friendly countries to help us to wean such people away from violence and terror and encourage them to join us in the great efforts we are making to promote resettlement, rehabilitation and reconciliation.

In such a context, the insensitive approach of the New Zealand Government will not help. I hope we can ensure that such regrettable actions will not recur. Thank you.

(The Presiding Member) Thank you, Hon. Member. This Adjournment Motion will be seconded by the Hon. Shehan Semasinghe.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Dilan Perera, please. ( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera - Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare) Mr. Presiding Member, I thank you for permitting me the Floor to respond to the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha and seconded by the Hon. Shehan Semasinghe. I do so in my capacity as the Acting Minister of External Affairs in the absence of the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, Minister of External Affairs.

The issue of recognition accorded to Mr. Arumugam Thevarajan by the New Zealand Government through the Queens Service Medal was brought to the notice of the Ministry of External Affairs on 19th January, 2011. The Ministry requested Sri Lankas High Commissioner in Canberra, who is accredited to New Zealand, to raise our concern and displeasure through the New Zealand High Commission in Canberra on the ground that Mr. Thevarajan is an elected member of the so-called Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE) from New Zealand and had consistently agitated for the creation of a mono-ethnic separate state of Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka. It had also been impressed that this honour conferred upon him would in all likelihood be used for the TGTEs separatist cause to gain legitimacy.

The initial response received from the New Zealand authorities is that the Queens Service Medal is given in recognition of a persons services to a particular community or field and it is not a sign of legitimacy accorded to the persons beliefs or activities related to a separatist agenda and the hope expressed that the honour conferred would not be used for that purpose. The position of the Ministry of External Affairs is that we are not satisfied at all with the initial response given by the New Zealand authorities when this matter was raised by our High Commissioner in Canberra who is also accredited to New Zealand.

The TGTE is an illegal organization that has not been recognized by any Government in the world and it should not be recognized by any Government in the world who believes in a civilized society. Giving a recognition medal to a member of the TGTE is, therefore, a violation of international norms. As the Ministry of External Affairs, we deeply regret the act of the New Zealand Government and would reiterate our strong protest at the highest level. So, the position of the Ministry of External Affairs is that. We have already conveyed our displeasure and our concerns through the authorities concerned to the New Zealand Government. As their initial response was not adequate, we are now taking other steps necessary to

1245 1246

express our displeasure and concern, and also, we condemn this act done by the Government of New Zealand. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, we could also send them a copy of the Adjournment Motion that has been moved in Parliament today.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Yes, Sir.

So, our position, Hon. Member, is that the Ministry of External Affairs has taken notice of this incident and we have already started moving on with the matter. As we are

not satisfied with the initial response by the Government of New Zealand, we are going to take other steps in future at various levels to condemn this action and also to show our displeasure and concern. Thank you very much.
