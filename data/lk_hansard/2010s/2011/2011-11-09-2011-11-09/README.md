asked the Minster of Livestock and Rural Community Development:

(a) Is he aware that -

(i) a large number of traditional dairy farmers live in the areas that come under the Thihagoda and Malimbada Divisional Secretaries' Divisions in the Matara District; (ii) they are faced with a number of problems owing to the non availability of high quality milch cows and necessary infrastructure facilities; and (iii) the farmers complain that the milch cows provided by government institutions which are said to be of high quality do not comply with the required standard?

(b) Will he state-

(i) whether arrangements will be made to provide those dairy farmers with high quality milch cows and necessary advice in order to uplift their living standards; and

(ii) if so, the period of time required to do that?

(c) If not, why?

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Arumugan Thondaman - Minister of Livestock and Rural Community Development) Sir, the Answer is as follows:

(a) (i) Yes.

(ii) No such complaints have been reported.

(iii) If any farmer has such problem, he could contact the Government veterinary surgeon of the area who will examine the animals and take actions accordingly. The performance of milch cows depend not on genetic quality alone, but on proper feeding and good management of such cows.

(b) (i) The Government programme for production of quality milch cows at farmer level is by way of upgrading the indigenous stock through artificial insemination and distribution of good quality male animals for natural mating. In addition, training of farmers is done at farm level as well as at training centres. The closest training centre for the farmers in Thihagoda and Malimboda Divisions is the Animal Husbandry Training Centre at Kekanadura in Matara.

(ii) The artificial insemination services are already made available at veterinary offices. Requests for male animals and for training require three months to make prior arrangements.

(c) Does not arise.

Mr. Speaker, I am on a different point of Order but yet under Standing Order No. 84 (vi). If I may

998 999

2011 09

draw your attention to the Bill that has been moved now, the last paragraph of Clause 9 of the Bill states, I quote:

Underperforming Enterprise means a company or other authority, institution or body established by or under any written law for the time being in force, which the Government owns shares and where the Government has paid contingent liabilities

of such enterprise and the Government is engaged in protracted litigation...

I repeat:

...the Government is engaged in protracted litigation with regard to such Enterprise...

There is only one matter in Schedule I that has been disclosed and that is Hotel Developers (Lanka) PLC. The Bill itself concedes that this is a matter that is under protracted litigation. So, under Standing Order No. 84 (vi), this is not a matter that can be debated in this House today. We do not need any other evidence but the draft Bill itself that is before the House concedes that Hotel Developers (Lanka) PLC is under protracted litigation and there are cases pending. In addition to the matter that the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara mentioned now, there are also six other cases that have been pending for a long time for determination in respect of HDL. I will give those case numbers. The case numbers are: D/C Colombo 4785/special, D/C Colombo 4791/special, HC (Civil) 1/98 (2), D/C Colombo 5095/special, D/C Colombo 19849/MR, D/C Colombo 21819/ MR and D/C Colombo 217/Co, which is a winding up application of Hotel Developers (Lanka) PLC; and finally case number HC (Civil) WP 52/ 2011/ Co that the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara mentioned. When there are seven cases pending determination, when the Schedule mentions that company specifically and the Bill itself says there is protracted litigation in respect of this matter, I respectfully urge, Mr. Speaker, that this matter, under Standing Order No. 84(vi), ought not to be taken up for debate today because all these are matters that are sub judice.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera)Sir, this entire Bill, including Clause 9 to which the Hon. Member referred, went before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court went through all the Clauses including the Clause that the Hon. Sumanthiran mentioned when they gave the Determination which was conveyed to you yesterday. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Let me finish. Hon. Member, I listened to you. Sir, let me respectfully submit my reply to this. [Interruption.] - Come on! Be a gentleman. Let me reply.

So, Hon. Speaker, there is no point in anybody now saying that Clause 6 or Clause 7 or Clause 8 or Clause 9 was not referred to in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court went through all these, word by word, and sent its Determination to Parliament yesterday. As the Hon Leader of the House very correctly said, the Supreme Court holds the view that some minor matters have to be amended. Those things will be attended to during the Committee Stage. So, there is no point in Clause 9 being now focused upon and saying, There are cases in court and because of that you cannot argue this matter today. That argument is completely out because this Clause 9 which was referred to by the Hon. Sumanthiran today was before the Supreme Court.

Then, the second matter which was referred to by the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara and the Hon. Anura Dissanayake is virtually supporting our case. What did they say, Sir? The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara and the Hon. Anura Dissanayake both said - - . , , .

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Please give me two minutes, Sir. I will explain it. In page 8, Clause 9 of the Bill describes what Underperforming Enterprises are. So, it is to recover Underperforming Enterprises. - [Interruption.] But, he said that in the Budget Speech of 2011, this was communicated. I have the Budget Speech with me. The Budget Speech refers to Non-performing Enterprises. But, this Bill is to take over or nationalize Underperforming Enterprises. So, the Hon. Leader of the House has misled the entire House and also the Judiciary because at no point does the Budget Speech talk about taking over Underperforming Enterprises. Sir, there is a big difference between Non-performing Enterprises and Underperforming Enterprises. So, he has misled the House.

"The right and supremacy of Parliament to debate almost all matters brought before it is an unfettered right that should be safeguarded at all times. However, I do take cognizance of the fact that there is a self-imposed restriction on the freedom of the House to debate any matter by the principle of sub judice which has been enshrined in Standing Order 84 (vi). I have also borne in mind two other salient points which were adduced by Hon. Members of the Opposition. Firstly, it is that the right to debate any matter before the House should not be fettered merely because at some point of time a matter could be brought before the courts by plaint being filed in civil action, which could be done even with the idea of thwarting the freedom of discussion of the House. This should not be permitted and I would like to zealously safeguard the rights of the House in this matter. The second point is that this case had created for it a great degree of importance in this country."

1052 1053

[6.17 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Deputy Speaker, thank you for enabling me to speak on this occasion.

Today, we are debating the Bill titled "Revival of Underperforming Enterprises and Underutilized Assets". In this Debate, I wish to bring to your notice that this Bill if passed today, will demonstrate that the Parliament is performing an act that it is not competent to do. By this Bill certain enterprises, companies that are listed in the Schedules to this Bill are described as underperforming enterprises or underutilized assets. In the entirety of todays Debate, there is no information available to this Parliament to intelligently discuss as to whether each of these items under the Schedules that appear in the Bill are in fact underutilized assets or underperforming enterprises. This Parliament is being invited to decide on these companies and pronounce them to be underperforming enterprises or underutilized assets without placing before Parliament, even the balance sheets or the accounts of these companies. But, even if that was available, it is not the task of this House to go into a matter like that and pronounce upon each of these matters.

The Hon. Minister of Economic Development, in his speech spoke about various matters. He had documents in his hands and he read out from various reports. None of those have been placed before this House; none of the Members of this august Assembly are privy to that information that he claims to have. If there was a desire to take over assets that had been granted to various enterprises on the basis that those assets were being underutilized, then the Bill should have had a test; should have laid down certain criteria upon which all of these enterprises that were handed over to various persons over the last 20 years, would come under scrutiny and a body could have been appointed to make that decision. And, if that decision was wrong, that could have been challenged in court.

That body then would have been able to go through all relevant accounts, balance sheets, forecasts and based upon an objective analysis come to a decision as to whether such enterprise was actually underperforming or if that pertained to assets that had been given to certain enterprises, whether those assets were being underutilized. In such a scenario, many of the companies that are not listed in this Schedule would also have come under scrutiny and there would have been equality of sorts among persons who have taken State assets on the basis that they were going to put it to use and derive income from that. But, what we have today is a Bill, which merely pronounces certain enterprises to be underperforming. In fact, under Schedule I of the Bill,

there is only one Underperforming Enterprise that is listed and that is the Hotel Developers (Lanka) PLC. For that alone, this Bill is bad. This Bill is an ad hominem legislation because it seeks to deal with just one matter and pronounces that it is an enterprise that has been underperforming.

The Hon. Minister for Economic Development stated various things about the Hilton Hotel. Most of it is factual. But, there is so much more to what he said which was not stated in this House. This enterprise will suffer more if this is taken over by a competent authority and the entirety of the shares is vested with the Secretary to the Treasury. This enterprise has a long history. It is true that there has been protected litigation but where dispute resolution has been vested in the hands of the Judiciary and where litigation is pending, and in this case, one must recall - I said this at the time I took objection right at the beginning of this Debate - one of the matters that is pending in court is a winding up application. A winding up application was filed on the 17th of November, 2006 - five years ago - and that is pending judicial determination. There are persons who have opposed the winding up. There is a petition for winding up saying that it is just and equitable; that the company be wound up because the company has failed. The court will go into a judicial examination to see whether the company has in fact failed or not, and while that matter has been pending for five years this House today is asked to declare that this is an underperforming enterprise.

There was a Ruling given by the Hon. Speaker with regard to the rule of sub judice, citing a previous Ruling by one of his predecessors, the Hon. M.H. Mohamed, in which he says it is possible for somebody, merely to stall the debate in this House, to file a plaint the previous day. That is true. There has been a plaint filed, even in this case, yesterday. But, I am not talking about what was filed yesterday; I am talking about what was filed five years ago. What is pertinent to the matter under discussion is that what was filed five years ago is a matter of winding up of a company on the basis that the company has failed. So, if the task of judicial determination has been given to the Judiciary and if we respect the rule, if we respect the separation of powers in our Constitution, then this House ought not to take this up and pronounce upon a matter that is entirely within the competence of the court.

Sir, I would also urge you to look at the definitions of underutilized assets and an underperforming enterprise. These have been designed, these have been tailored to suit what later appears in the Schedule. That is why I said this is an ad hominem legislation. In previous instances, Sir, you will be aware that even the Privy Council has ruled out as bad, any legislation that was recognized to be ad hominem and ad hoc. This is a classic example of what an ad homiem legislation is because it even spells out by name, the enterprises that are said to have underutilized the assets and the enterprises that are underperforming. It is outside the competence of the

1054 1055

2011 09

Legislature to pass laws like this. Now, one might cite the Determination given by the Supreme Court hurriedly when the matter was referred as an urgent Bill. I do not want to talk about the decision to refer it as an urgent Bill. The less said of that, the better. I do not think anybody can argue and justify this matter being referred as an urgent Bill. The only argument that can be put forward is that it is a matter for the Cabinet. Yes, we know it is a matter for the Cabinet but the Cabinet has abused that power in referring this matter as an urgent Bill to the Supreme Court. When one reads this Determination, one is sad for the Supreme Court; for what the Supreme Court has been reduced to, at how they have pronounced upon this Bill without any material whatsoever placed before them. How can the Supreme Court like this Legislature, rule on whether a particular enterprise is underperforming or not without examining the accounts of that enterprise, without examining other material? In one hearing, at which only the Attorney-General appears and is said to have assisted it, the Court has come to a ruling that 37 enterprises have, in fact, underutilized assets and one of them is an underperforming enterprise. It is a sad indictment on the highest court of the land. I am saddened by the fact that I am also an officer of that Court and have been prevented from assisting it in the determination of this because it was an urgent Bill and hurriedly and secretively taken up for hearing. This has happened because of the Eighteenth Amendment. We have such quality judges

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

because of the Eighteenth Amendment. There is no independent Judiciary in this country because judges

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

are no longer vetted by the Constitutional Council. When the Secretary to the Cabinet certifies something as an urgent Bill and sends it, they know the message in the certification of the urgent Bill, they know what is expected of them to do and this is what they do. This is not going to improve until we take stock.

I would like to ask a question about the underperforming enterprise. What about Parliament? By a good test, Parliament can be described today as an underperforming enterprise. It has lost all its powers merely because the Government has obtained, perhaps by dubious means, a two-thirds majority. This House has been reduced to a mere rubber stamp and when you place your signature on this after the supposed passage of this Bill, this is also an underperforming enterprise. That is the sad end we have come to and it is a matter of great regret that we have drafted a Bill like this that deals with a particular situation where law is described as something that is of general application. Anything that is done for a particular situation to apply only for a particular event is

not law. That is outside the definition of law. I am glad, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that you are in the Chair at this moment. Being a lawyer, you know the fundamental definition of law. That is why anything that is ad hoc or ad hominem is not even regarded as law. It is a sad day that you have to preside over this Debate and perhaps take a Vote on this piece of paper, and call it a law that is passed by this House.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . 15 .

So, please permit me - I just want to talk about something that is very important. I will quote from Foundations of the United States Economic Model. I know the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa and everyone here actually believes in the market economy. I want to read just three sections. It states, I quote:

"Contrary to what propaganda has led the public to believe, Americas Founding Fathers were skeptical and anxious about democracy. They were aware of the evils that accompany a tyranny of the majority."

"Not surprisingly, the Framers of the Constitution went to great lengths to insure that the federal government was not based on the will of the majority and was not, therefore, democratic. - [Interruption.]

Let me just finish. Sir, it further states, I quote:

The Constitution divided the federal government into legislative, executive and judicial branches.....

:

If the Framers of the Constitution did not embrace democracy, what did they adhere to?

What did they adhere to, if it was not democracy?

To a man, the Framers agreed that the purpose of government was to secure citizens in John Lockes trilogy of the rights to life, liberty and property.The Framers wrote extensively and eloquently on liberty....

Hon. Deputy Speaker, before I conclude my speech, I will further quote:

The Constitution was designed to further the cause of liberty, not democracy. To do that, the Constitution protected individuals rights from the government, as well as from their fellow citizens. To that end, the Constitution laid down clear, unequivocal

and enforceable rules to protect individuals rights. In consequence, the governments scope and scale were strictly limited. Economic liberty, which is a precondition for growth and prosperity, was enshrined in the Constitution.

Thank you.

[7.06 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Deputy Speaker, today we have heard many discussions regarding the Revival of Underperforming Enterprises and Underutilized Assets Bill that was presented in Parliament yesterday.

Firstly, there are only a few questions which I wish to ask the Government: Why has this Bill been brought in as an urgent Bill? In the last Budget Speech, there was a mention regarding this Bill; that was last November. Today, we are in the next November - 2011, and just two weeks before the Budget, this has been rushed and brought in to Parliament as an Urgent Bill. A bill of this nature which deals with public enterprises, a bill which deals with public investments, a bill that deals with foreign investments should be scrutinized in a better manner than in the manner that has been brought in as an Urgent Bill. If this country is to move forward in economic development, it should be the duty of the Government to see that there is confidence built in the enterprises that have been utilized in this country. But, today unfortunately it is not so. For instance, even Sevanagala and Pelwatta are two organizations which are supposed to be running at a profit. But, today the Hon. Minister said that although they are running at a profit, the proper taxes and other utilities have not been paid by the organization. I am not in a position to comment on that. - [Interruption.] No, I accept it. If that is so, the position is this: under Section 2 before the acquisition is made the Hon. Minister and the Government of Sri Lanka should have given an opportunity for them to give the reason as to why it has not been done and why it has not been utilized. Why do you not give them some time? Why do you not give them six months' or one year's time to comply with their requirements if you want it, not to take an organization that has been built for so many years from the owners who have spent money, who have gone to the Banks and got their loan facility to take them across. Is this going to be the proper way of utility? Is this going to be the proper economic way of growth? If you bring a public Bill, within three days the Supreme Court has to make an order. The Supreme Court makes an order to say that it is not inconsistent with the Constitution. We do not know what the reasoning is. Up to date, Parliament does not know what the reasoning of the Supreme Court was. Today, at the rate we are going, after 1972 any Bill brought before Parliament cannot be questioned today in any Court of Law. Prior to 1972 from Soulbury Commission there were issues, they were questioned and even set aside.

Like in the case of the Queen Vs Liyanage, then there was bribery Commissioners case and two other cases that were brought up and which were set aside. Therefore, it is very important to consider this: if we are going to have an economic growth in this country; if we feel that we are going to be another Singapore or another Hong Kong, certainly, yes. Then, if organizations have

1066 1067

[ ]

2011 09

performed badly, yes, you can take them over or if organizations had closed their businesses for more than three to five years, you can certainly take it over and I think that is a very good move by the Government to do so. But, not take over organizations which are running at a profit today. Organizations are taken over by the Government with no valid reason and the parties concerned have not even got the right to question the Government as why they are taken over. That, I must say, is a complete dictatorial act. It is undemocratic and against the fundamental rights of the people. If this continues, foreign investment is definitely not going to come into this country because as far as investment is concerned, the Bill states that the Government has a right, as an assets holding company, for any investment.

Today, the Government even in the open market may be able to buy certain shares of an organization. Is that organization also going to come under this Act? We are unaware of that. Today, there are 36 organizations in the Schedule. Are you going to add further companies into this Schedule? Who is answerable to this? Whose question are you going to answer? We are unaware of that. So, is this the economic growth we want in this country? Is this the Government's policy towards economic growth? Why did you rush this Bill in two days' time, a Bill that was focused one year ago? Today, we are bringing in this Bill overnight to make it law in this country.

Therefore, Hon. Deputy Speaker, it is my earnest request to the Government of Sri Lanka as well as the Members of the Cabinet to please consider giving certain concessions at least to the companies that have done well. Companies like Pelwatte Sugar Industries (Pvt.) Limited and Sevanagala Sugar Industries (Pvt.) Limited, whatever maybe their political affiliations; that is quite different. But, let us look at this from a different angle; look at it from an enterprise point of view, whether you are in a position to accept this. If you do not do so, you are exposing yourself to the entire world. The entire world is watching it. Therefore, it is the prime duty as far as this Government is concerned, to look into this matter and reconsider this law in whatever manner that you could do. I am sure that although I ask you to reconsider this Bill, it will never be reconsidered. It will be taken for vote now. Once it is taken for vote, that is the end of it. That will be the end of the economic growth of this country. Please keep in mind that all countries will be definitely aware of this law. For instance, the Taj Samudra, Hilton - Hilton has already been taken over - and in every company that has got lands of five to six acres, the Government has some shares. If that is so; if the Government has got shares in all these companies, none of the foreign investors are going to come into this country because they will be scared that if there are any shareholdings by the Government, it can fall into this same category of the law.

Therefore, it is my earnest request that we should not consider adding any other Schedules to this Act or to

amend this Act, whenever they think it is necessary. We do not know; it can suddenly happen because the Government has got a two-thirds majority, they can amend the Act as they want. If you amend the Act and if this continues in this manner, I am sure that there will be no proper investment in this country.

In todays newspapers, I read that there is another Bill that is going to be brought in to take over private lands. I do not know how far that is true. But, if this is going to be the trend of the Government, and if this is going to be the economic growth of this country, I am sorry, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to say that we are really doomed. You can see countries like Spain, Italy and Greece have crashed. Their economy is crashing. The reason is due to the fact that there has been no proper economic growth and there has been no proper budget. It is the same in Sri Lanka. We are also taking short-term loans. It may affect this country. I am not trying to say it is not going to affect this country, it may affect this country. So, we ought to be very careful. In this situation, when the countrys economy should grow, can we bring in a Bill of this nature to prejudice the rights of the economic growth of this country. If that is going to be so, I am sorry, Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is a wrong way, it is a negative approach to a positive outlook which you have got. Thank you very much.
