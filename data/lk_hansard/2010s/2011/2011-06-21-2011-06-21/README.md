... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Speaker, Parliament creates conventions and it is very clear in the Erskine May. In Great Britain, there is no written law. It is governed by in itself over the ages by precedents and practices created from time to time. As the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena and the Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena pointed out to the Chair, we have set up conventions in this House. There had been a precedent where such Regulations have been passed. Therefore, going by the conventions that Parliament in itself creates for its good governance, I plead with you, Sir, it is my contention that the Regulations that have been presented before the House today by the Hon. Minister of Agriculture is in perfect order. Therefore, going by the convention and the precedents which have been set only last year, Sir, it is my contention once again that you have all the right to permit a full-days debate on these Regulations as the Speaker of this House.

[. . 3.39 ] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I want to speak a few words on the Human Rights Commission because monies are being allocated today to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka . I think from the year 2005 onwards, we have been speaking about the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka and the most unfortunate thing is, none of the orders of the Human Rights Commission are being carried out. From the year 2005 up to now, 99 per cent of the orders and recommendations of the Human Rights Commission have not been carried out. I would like to read from a UN Report - the Report of the Secretary-Generals Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka. On page 106, under 384 it states, I quote:

The result is that, in the past, its recommendations have been substantially ignored, not only by the police hierarchy,

but also other Government departments.

So, why are we allocating monies to this Commission? If there is a Human Rights Commission, the orders given by it have to be carried out. If the orders of the Commission are not carried out, what is the earthly use of having the Commission?

This Commission has no international recognition at all. So much so, that in the year 2006, the Commission was downgraded. It was downgraded and we were put on par with countries like Sudan, Malawi and Congo. We were downgraded. So, the fact of the matter is, why are we having this Commission? I would like the Government to answer because large sums of monies are being allocated to it but the orders of the Commission are not being carried out. I saw a statement made recently by, I think, the new Chairman of the Commission stating that the Commission wants more powers. This is a very lame excuse given by all persons who have to maintain law and order in Sri Lanka. They say, we do not have powers. If you examine the powers of the Human Rights Commission, they have not used even the powers they have for the betterment of the people. If the Human Rights Commission gives an order, it is up to the Government to carry it out. I do not blame the Commission for that. It is the duty of the Government. But, they have the power to do certain things within the Act. For example, Sir, with regard to detainees, under the Human Rights Act, the Commission has the power to visit all the detainees held by the Government. The parent Act of the Human Rights Commission provides for it with powers to monitor the welfare of the detained persons. They have the right to go and inspect where the detainees are kept and see whether they are being properly looked after. Then, the Commission has to be notified within 48 hours with a list of detainees, so that the Commission will have within itself the names of the detainees. The Human Rights Commission has not been

1565 1566

granted a list of detainees up to now under the Human Rights Act. So, these are the powers that are already with the Commission and the Commission is not using these powers for the betterment of the detainees.

Then, Sir, there are international standards set out for the appointment of the Chairman and the Members of the Commission. Under the UN law, when you advertise for the post of Chairman and the Members of the Commission, there must be a transparent process, interviews called and there has to be a discussion among all political parties in Parliament about the persons who will be appointed to the Human Rights Commission. But, in Sri Lanka, unfortunately the Chairman and the Members are appointed by the President. No discussion takes place with anybody. So, because of that, the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka does not meet international standards.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, the Human Rights Commission was demoted in 2006, not in 2009. It was downgraded because at that point of time there were 2,000 cases of disappearances, which the Human Rights Commission refused to investigate. They refused. For the first time in the history of the Human Rights Commission of any country, in 2006 they refused to investigate the 2,000 cases of disappearances at that time. So, that was the reason for downgrading the Human Rights Commission in Sri Lanka. At present, the Government is under severe pressure internationally to safeguard human rights. So, I hope the Government will make a new beginning and at least take some concrete steps to restore human rights in Sri Lanka. The dialogue between the international community and the Sri Lankan Government has virtually broken down. There is no dialogue today. . The dialogue was completely broken down. In 2007, there was a request by the United Nations to open a branch of the UN Human Rights Commission in Sri Lanka. So, I suggest that the Government, at least for a new beginning, to start a dialogue with the international community. The Government should immediately open an office of the UN Human Rights Commission in Sri Lanka so that we could start afresh.

The problem today is that there is no discussion and there is no give-and-take with the international community. Now, with regard to the Ban Ki-moon's Report, the Hon. Minister of External Affairs says, "we are rejecting the Report totally". But, what has actually happened? Hon. Deputy Speaker, if you go through the Report which I have with me, the Government has answered 31 questions. The Government through the Presidential Secretariat has answered 31 questions in writing to the Ban Ki-moon's Panel Report. If the Government does not accept the Panel Report, why did the Government answer 31 questions posed by the UN committee?

Then, with regard to Channel 4, two years ago, certain clips were shown on TV. What did the Government say at that time? They said, "we will file legal action". I remember Mr. Mahinda Samarasinghe at that time, two years ago, said, "we will file action against the Channel 4 clips that were shown all over the world". But, up to now nothing has been done. So, as a responsible Opposition what we would like to tell the Government is: . . . The Government must take steps to disclaim the charges made by the UN Panel Report. It is the duty of the Government. Up to now, the Government has failed to do so.

. . . . , . , . . , . Channel-4 , , , . . That is the duty of the Government. The duty of the Government is to safeguard the reputation of the country. Now, for two years, since the footage was shown on Channel 4, the Government has not taken any steps to disprove the Channel 4 allegations.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Government has totally rejected the fake Channel 4. The Government has totally rejected the Darusman Report. Sir, what is he talking? He is misleading the House. He is not even reading a Sri Lankan newspaper. His brain has been pawned to the foreign countries. That is the problem.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, what I said was, it is the duty of the Government to show the world that this Darusman Report is false. For that, you have to appoint a proper committee, you have to gather evidence, you have to accept some charges and reject some charges. That is what Israel did. Sir, Israel was accused of - [Interruption.] Please do not disturb me. Sir, three or four years ago, Israel was accused of human rights violations in the Gaza area. There were 400 charges. What did Israel do? They did not reject it. They took the report. They appointed a committee to go into each allegation and what did they do? They accepted some and rejected a vast majority. But what have we done? The UN Panel Report is there. Have we gone through the Report? Have we gathered evidence to reject the Report? Have we gathered evidence to accept the Report? - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Why? Are you ignorant of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, why is he acting like this? What is the meaning of this? The Hon. Member is on his feet.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Hon. Member, you may continue with your speech. , .

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer asked a question about the LLRC. I will give him a reply. Sir, the LLRC does not have a mandate. I think the Hon. Sumanthiran three months ago made a very clear speech in Parliament. The LLRC does not have a mandate to investigate human rights violations. Why was the LLRC appointed? The mandate of the LLRC is to find out why the ceasefire agreement was signed and why it broke down? That has nothing to do with what happened during the last stages of the war. In fact, when the Ban Ki-moon Report was out, I suggested to the Government to give the LLRC necessary powers and my comments appeared in the Divaina. The LLRC has to be given the necessary powers to investigate human rights violations. You go through the mandate. The mandate is: "Why was the ceasefire agreement signed?" - [Interruption.] Sir, there is no use in the Government trying to convince us; they have to convince the international community. That is the mistake this Government is making. They are speaking to the public of Sri Lanka. They are not speaking to the international community. The Government is speaking to the people who are already converted. They must speak to the international community. That is not happening today. They are speaking on TV; they are speaking in Parliament; they are speaking in the Provincial Councils. But, have they had a dialogue with the international community? No. The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris said, "We are not accepting Ban Ki-moon's Report". But, secretly he has answered 31 questions raised by Ban Ki-moon's Panel. Why did he do that? Here, in Sri Lanka, we are opposed to Ban Ki-moon. But, what happened in the UN? You voted for his second term. Why did you vote for his second term? The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa said that there should be an alternate UN - -. After opposing Ban Ki-moon for several months, you go and vote for his second term. - [Interruption.] This is what I am saying. Hon. Azwer,

even the private newspapers that are supporting the Government such as The Island and Divaina, what do they say? The Government has no proper plan to answer the charges made by the international community. There is no point in speaking to the Sri Lankan public. You are wasting your time. You must speak to India; you must speak to the European Union; you must speak to the UN; you must convince them. Sir, when the Hon. (Prof.) G.L Peiris went to India, what did he state in the Joint Communiqu? He stated: "A solution based on the Thirteenth Amendment" So, where is the solution based on the Thirteenth Amendment? Then, he said, "Investigate human rights violations in Sri Lanka". That is what the Joint Communiqu said. So, do not waste your time trying to mislead the public of Sri Lanka and making allegations against the Opposition. What we say is - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Member, do you know that a high-profile delegation came to Sri Lanka including Nirupama Rao and others? What does it mean? We are a working in order to have a dialogue.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Hon. Member, you may continue with your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I would like to remind the Members of this House that we also love this country. So, we do not want to see the reputation of the country tarnished. It is not the duty of the Opposition to rectify a report. There is the UN Report and it is the duty of the Government to rectify that. They must take steps to rectify that but up to now they have not taken any steps with regard to that. Have you all asked for our support? Have you all asked for the support of the Leader of the Opposition? Nothing. You appear on TV and scold the international community. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You are conspiring with foreign forces against the Government. That is the problem. You come forward and help us.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) You can say that. But, that is not going to help you internationally. You will fall into a bigger pit in September. So, I would like to - [Interruption.]

1569 1570

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please!

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I do not know whether the Members of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka are there. But, all I wish to say is that we have no faith in them. The whole world has no faith in them. Time and again the UN has condemned the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka as being worthless and ineffective and I hope the new Chairman will take some steps in this regard. As I said earlier, there is no need to give more powers because there are powers within the Commission to safeguard the human rights in Sri Lanka. What does the Government do when they face allegations of this kind? They assault the Tamil MPs in Jaffna. What is the meaning of this? , , . ? . , ? Are these the messages they are conveying to the international community? I just cannot understand the attitude of the Government.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have taken 19 minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I will wind up, Sir. I wish to remind this House that we too like a resolution to this conflict with the international community because this is a serious problem. The Government has to realize this. Sir, I will make a prediction. We are going the way Sudan had been going. Three years ago, the situation in Sudan was similar to that of Sri Lanka. There was a very similar situation. There was a very similar civil war in the South of Sudan where thousands of people were killed. But, there was no internal investigation. Then, there was an international investigation and what did they say? The Northern and the Southern Sudanese cannot live together. So, we too are heading that way. You must realize the seriousness of this situation. You must realize that the Government does not wish to see a reality. We are exactly where Sudan was three to four years ago. So, please take note of this at least at this late stage. What we are saying is, initiate a dialogue with the international community. Start talking to them. You have to accept certain mistakes; you have to reject some. Now, what is the defence of the Government? Zero casualty. Who will believe this, Sir? The Government says that they maintained zero casualty in the last stages of the war. Who will believe this? Nobody is going to believe this. So, this is a fallacy of the Government and I hope the Government, even at this late

stage, will start a dialogue with the international community. As I said earlier, if you open a UN Human Rights office in Sri Lanka - not to investigate the past, I am not talking of the past - to prevent any future incidents at least, I think that may be a good starting point to restore human rights in Sri Lanka.

Thank you. [..3.59 ]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, as far as Sri Lanka is concerned, we have reached a focal point in history where the pace of recovery is taking gigantic steps after a prolonged war of 30 years. The whole world is surprised at the way Sri Lanka is managing its affairs, particularly, the economic revival amazed the world. We have heard about Vietnam War, Korean War, wars in Indochina and Burma which is presently known as Myanmar, then Indonesia and in other places. There is no recorded history in those countries to draw a parallel with the massive development and rapid recovery that is being staged in Sri Lanka. Barely after two years, this puzzles even the economic pundits - not the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, my good Friend at all - in America, in the International Monetary Fund, in the World Bank and in Geneva as to how this miracle has been achieved. The only answer that one can stand up in the middle of this earth and give is that this miracle is achieved because of one man, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa. That is the story of modern Sri Lanka and that will be a monumental history recorded in the next Mahawamsa that would be written soon.

Therefore, Sir, we are not surprised as to why the Opposition is gushing out to attack on us criticizing our achievements. Now, I have regard for my good Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva. Before he entered Parliament, he used to talk about economics and I used to patiently listen and sometimes learn. But, after coming to the House, he should have developed his mental capacity; rather it has sunk, I am sorry to say.

Now, he is talking about the roads and how many bridges there are. I think a bridge must be built between his brain and the tongue; there is something missing there. That would be the most-modern bridge that could be built by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. I would ask him to do that. Sir, I went the other week to the Eastern Province, from Colombo up to Ratnapura, Pelmadulla, Kahawatta, Udawalawe, then through Bibile, Monaragala to Addalaichenai, Ampara, the other side of Pottuvil. Believe me, Sir, if you come with me, you will travel along that route everyday. There was a time when we shuddered to take our vehicle to the Eastern Province because we would never return home with the four tyres intact. We would have had to repair them at several points. So are the roads through Polonnaruwa,Welikanda, Ottamawadi, Eravur, Batticaloa, Kattankudi. They are all wonderful. These were all built during the time of war in this country. They were accusing us. The Opposition, particularly the UNP and the JVP were conspiring with foreign forces and asking us to lay down arms. Our

leaders did it in the past. As a result, 600 policemen were mercilessly butchered in Karaitivu in the Eastern Province. They were ordered not to carry arms and be silent even if they were attacked. What happened to them? , , - . Channel 4 . Will the Channel 4 show these events to the world, to Barack Obama, Ban Ki-moon, all the leaders of the world and Israeli leaders? Sir, 600 unarmed, innocent policemen were mercilessly killed and it was engineered by Pottu Amman. . You ask that from our the Deputy Minister, the Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran. He will relate to you all these blood-tingling incidents that happened in the Eastern Province. Innocent people from Jaffna were driven away 20 years ago. Now, they have been rehabilitated. I am sure my good Friend, the Hon. Muththali Bawa Farook who has come duly to this House, we welcome him, will vouch for it. They were driven away to Mannar. I was at that time in Puttalam; I was in charge of the Puttalam Electorate. The Hon. J.R.P. Sooriyapperuma, a historian of your calibre must know this. People came from Vanni, Mannar and Jaffna to Kalpitiya in boats and one

mother - - was holding her arms trying to hug a baby. There was no baby.

. Her hand was not working. The almost dead baby had fallen into the high seas and the mother had not realized it. Where was this Ban Ki-moon then? I am asking you, where are these Human Rights Commissions and the so-called human rights activists? There are some human rights activists in this country under the garb of red shirts. , . . . . , . .

. . . ; follow-up . . - - . . . . Yasin language . . . .

Read all the newspapers. This must always be told in English so that the diplomats, our friends, can understand this. Go through all the newspapers. Get the Sinhalese and Tamil newspapers translated. Compare them and you will find that only about 10 to 15 per cent of the news items are pro-Government and the rest 80 per cent or so is against the Government. Where do you find this kind of freedom in the world? Immediately after war the situation in India was different and today they are saying - .

1593 1594

. ? . . - - ... .

It must be printed by the Colombo Municipal Council and distributed among all the people. Then, the people will understand how the Britishers undertook the development schemes, although we were under them at that time. Now, this Channel 4 journalist- , ; . ? , human rights violate - See the massacre that was carried out at the Mosque in Kattankudi. The innocent people who were worshipping at Husseiniya Mosque in Kattankudi were massacred. Where were the human rights activists then? Let the Channel 4 people come. We will show them the photographs and video tapes, if they want. They came to Polonnaruwa. Farmers in Eravur in the Eastern Province, successful tobacco cultivators in the region, were tortured and butchered. Come Channel 4, we are inviting you! This Parliament is inviting you.

The Defence Ministry yesterday said that Issipriya the woman who is alleged to have been a journalist and a news presenter in the Channel 4 documentary, was an LTTE cadre.

You give an explanation to Channel 4 on how you betrayed your own party; how you decimated one National Organizer and usurped power. We stand aright; we stand tall. Why? Because we are pure, our hearts are pure and we have a genuine cause to safeguard the people of this country. That is the correct position of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his entire Cabinet. This story is in the first page of todays Daily News.

There is an article published in page 2 of The Island dated 16th June, 2011. It states, I quote:

Congress I member Hasanali speaks out

I will take two more minutes to read this, Sir. This is a nice article written by my good friend Mr. Shamindra Ferdinando.

It states, I quote:

Hasanali lashed out those shedding crocodile tears for Sri Lankan Tamils for their personal gain and at the expense of Indo-Lanka relations, which he said would be beneficial to both countries.The vast majority of those targeting Sri Lanka over human rights allegations never showed any concern

This is not stated by me or by the Hon. M.T. Hasen Ali who represents the Eastern Province but Hasanali of Madras, Tamil Nadu State Assembly. He furthers states, I quote:

.LTTE assassinated many prominent Sri Lankan Tamils including A. Amirthalingam and Lakshman Kadirgamar.Had they been genuinely concerned about the situation. They couldnt be selective in their concern, Hasanali said.

, , . This article further states, I quote:

The politician welcomed CM Jayalalithaas reported readiness to send an all party delegation from the TN State Assembly to Sri Lanka on a fact-finding mission in spite of recent attacks on the Rajapaksa administration. The TN administration needed to take up issues with the government of Sri Lanka and it would be a mistake on the part of CM Jayalalitha not to deal with Colombo.

This is what his advice is. Mr. Hasanali further states, I quote:

any move on the part of the international community to punish Sri Lanka for meeting the LTTE challenge would be counterproductive.

Hasanali of Tamil Nadu says so, not A.H.M Azwer of Colombo, Sri Lanka.

This further states, I quote:

Sri Lanka couldnt be punished on the basis of unsubstantiated war crime allegations, he said...

. Let us decorate him because he comes from there and speaks bravely in this manner. He said, "We are very thankful to Mr. Shamindra Ferdinando too".

I quote further:

... pointing out that no country would be safe if legitimate governments were prevented from tackling the threat of terrorism and violent uprisings. If Sri Lanka could be questioned over its right to quell the LTTE, what would be the position of Indian troopsand police deployed to fight those who had taken up arms,...

Hurrah! I would say from this Parliament today, Sir.

Then, Sir, there is another fact that I must tell this Parliament before I wind up. The whole country knows that Osama was killed. Now see how human rights work in some people's eyes. How have they watched it? Through dark glasses. Osama was killed and his wife came to his rescue. She was also bulleted down. She was killed and who was watching this? Barack Obama was watching this. Is this not human rights violation? The American Press said, an unarmed Osama. Then, who is the terrorist and who is the tourist? They call Osama a terrorist. Then, is Obama a tourist, as our good friend,

Mr. Alavi Moulana, the Governor of the Western Province asked the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena the other day? This is the double tongue; this is the double glass that they are wearing.

Therefore, Sir, from this Parliament I say - [Interruption.] He was telling this. Yes, he is a very good friend of ours. There is no problem. Sir, Mr. Moulana has a way of always - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, your time is over. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay, Sir. This is the last thing I wanted to say. I am winding up, Sir. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Is Bin Laden your relative? - [Interruption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bin Laden is my best relative because he is a Muslim. He was fighting against all the atrocities in the world. Because he could not equal the American fire power - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, your time is over.

When Prabhakaran was killed, his wife was looked after and his children were educated. He was a terrorist who wanted to take over the entire country. This is the humane approach of the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government

and it is through "Mahinda Chintana" that we will recover this land from the debris that the UNP is putting. We will herald a new Sri Lanka so that from Jaffna to Hambantota, to Dondra, we will be able to live as trustworthy and honest people in this country.

, . .

While we speak on the Resolutions under the Appropriation Act, there are many misappropriations also that we need to refer to. I am referring particularly to Section 8 of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act. I am doing so because the speakers before me referred to that. The question I am asking is, "Has there been enough of allocation made to the Human Rights Commission when the country is facing such a problem?" There is a backlog of cases in the Commission. The Commission has not been functional for a while. But, what is the remedy? How will we overcome this problem of backlog ?

There are about 1,000 cases pending according to the Chairman of the Human Rights Commission. But, how many cases have been reported in 2010 and how many have been investigated? I also have a question to ask about the appointment of the Commission itself. As we know, with the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the President became the appointing authority. Therefore, to some extent, the independence of the Commission is under question. But, it would be better if the Human Rights Commission itself could forward its budget to Parliament rather than forwarding it to the Government so that its independence could be strengthened through that process even if the President is the appointing authority.

Section 3(1) of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act states that those who are appointed to this Commission as members should be people who have a background of human rights; practical experience on working on human rights issues and knowledge of human rights standards. Maybe, the Presidential Secretariat has

1601 1602

the criteria of the people who should be appointed for this. I am requesting the Presidential Secretariat to inform Parliament about the criteria that have been used in appointing Members to the Human Rights Commission.

Sir, the Paris Principles have to be followed by this Commission. As you know, in 2007, the Sri Lankan Human Rights Commission was downgraded from A to B. The Paris Principles states that the national commission of a country should monitor any situation of violation of human rights and have access to any group or individual possessing knowledge about violations or threat. It also states that it should be able to advise the government or Parliament on any violation on issues related to legislation and comply with international human rights standards. But, the Parliament has not received any such advice as far as I can remember. It also states that it should advise the government to ratify human rights instruments and contribute to the reports which governments are obliged to submit to regional and international institutions. It should educate and inform the public; it should publicize reports on any human rights matter and have access to the media.

Now, the issue is that Sri Lanka has been downgraded by the international co-ordinating committee and the question I have is, while the country is going through such a bad period in terms of the international arena, what plans has the Government got to move the Human Rights Commission's ranking from B to A. It was an unequivocal message from the international community that Sri Lanka is not in compliance with international standards on human rights. What does this mean? The downgrading means that Sri Lanka has no right to vote at international meetings and it is not eligible to stand for election in international fora on human rights. This is an expression that human rights are being violated with impunity and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka cannot provide protection. This is an indictment on the country and we together must strengthen the Human Rights Commission and see that we have local mechanisms that are going to put this situation right.

We must not forget that in September this year, India will become a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva and together with its seat on the Security Council, India will determine the agenda for the whole of South Asia. We have to work together to make sure that this situation is rectified. The attack on Sri Lanka is not just an attack on the Sri Lankan Government or on the Head of the Government. It is an attack on the country and on every citizen of this country and therefore, we have to work intelligently and have a strategy that will counter it so that the country could be restored to its former glory. Let us not leave in denial that we have a problem because we have a problem as Sri Lankans, not just as a Government. Attempts on

disrupting meetings of the Members of Parliament, whether it is in Allaveddi or whether it is in some other place in the country, does not really help.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, now you have to wind up please. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I will conclude. We must protect the rights of the Members of Parliament. Blocking websites of citizen journalism as what has happened today to the citizen journalism websites like "Grownviews" or "Vikalpa" will not help. Remember, we are just coming after the Arab Spring Revolution and this is not the path to take. We should allow for free expression and counter those who have different views to ours. That is the way to set right the human rights record of this country. Just a hardline, non-engagement with the international community is going to take this country down the wrong road and we must, as a Parliament, look into this and work together.

Thank you.
