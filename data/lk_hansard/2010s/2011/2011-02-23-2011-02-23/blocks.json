Now, the fact that the cost of living goes up is not anybodys fault as such; there can be various factors, various reasons for that. The cost of living always goes up. But, the point is that it is the duty of the Government to ensure that it is in control, that it takes the right measures, its fiscal policy is correct in that it contains the rising cost of living. If that is done, then the people will not be so dissatisfied. They can see that the Government is doing its best despite prices are going up in the world market, despite oil prices going up, despite factors that are beyond the control of a country such as ours, the Government genuinely is trying to ensure that the people can live within the means that they get as their livelihood. Today that satisfaction is not there amongst the people and that is clear for everyone to see.",

Duty structures were slashed but the question is whether the need of the country at the moment is to have more vehicles on our already crowded roads. The effect of the surge in the importation of vehicles can already be seen. People who are at the bottom level, who are struggling to make ends meet are not very impressed by the fact that the cost of importation of vehicles like cars has come down. Their concern is that their food cost has gone up. Their concern is that their essentials like clothing - apparel - and housing, even to take on rent, keeps going up. Their concern is that in the agricultural sector, the cost of production has spiralled up. Now, in this context, Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw your attention to the priorities that the Government ought to have and that is certainly not to make the rich richer and the poor poorer. The priority of any responsible government must be to narrow that gap and certainly the Orders that are being placed before this House today do not indicate that.",

    "text": "sufficient to pay lip service to developing areas that have been devastated by the war. What is being stated is very good. It is continuously being told that developmental work, particularly in the North and the East is going on, is thriving. Bridges are being built, roads are being laid and I too can vouch for that. Many bridges have been built and many roads have been laid. But, the question that is before us is, is that the priority for the people who have no roof over their head? Is that the priority when hundreds of thousands of people have no house to live in? Over 250,000 houses had been razed to the ground during the war. This is a matter that we raised during the Debate in the Budget that was presented in July last year and also at the main Budget in November; that the Government does not have or does not seem to have a scheme to rebuild dwelling houses for these persons. That is an essential requirement. Two years have gone by and those people are still living in huts made by using six poles, a few tin sheets and in certain instances, a tarpaulin to put over it while roads are being built and bridges are being constructed all around them. Now, is that the right priority for any responsible government? - [Interruption.] When we raised this issue, the Government's response in July last year was that the Government of India had offered to build 50,000 houses; not that the Sri Lankan Government was undertaking to build even one house, but the Government of India, after our appeal, had offered to build 50,000 houses. We welcome that move and thank the people and the Government of India for that generous offer. Now, it is almost a year since that offer was made and I would like to ask the question as to how many of those 50,000 houses have been built. If none has been built, then where lies the problem? We understand that for the recipients or the beneficiaries list, only the first 1,000 has been prepared. Does it take one year to prepare the beneficiaries list for the first 1,000 out of the 50,000 houses? At that rate how long will it take to prepare the beneficiaries list for the 50,000 houses? Fifty years to prepare the list! - [Interruption.] There was a housing scheme that was inaugurated by Sri S.M. Krishna, the Minister of External Affairs of India, when he visited Sri Lanka in November last year. I was present at that occasion. A few hundred houses in Ariyalai are being built. I know what is being done. I have been to those places and I am aware of what I am saying. Apart from that, there is not a stone that has been laid upon another stone to build any of these 50,000 houses. Now, the question - [Interruption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Rubbish. Hon. Member, are you criticizing the programme for the construction of these 50,000 houses? -[Interruption.]",

It was gifted for the farmers of the North who had lost their tractors and after they were gifted at a public ceremony attended by the Minister of External Affairs of India, they have been taken away for two public corporations in the South. The third lot 100 tractors are still in Jaffna but ready to be transported to the South. Only 38 tractors have been given to the Agricultural Societies in the Kilinochchi District and another 38 have been given to the Agricultural Societies in the Mullaitivu District. Now, why is this being done? I am asking this question. Can anybody with a clear conscience answer this question? To replace 10,000 tractors that were destroyed, a good neighbour, India, gives us 500 tractors to be specifically",

It will also serve to relieve balance of payment difficulties faced by the country. The imposition of import cess will also help to provide strong protection to local manufacturers and farmers which would lead to strengthen the local economy. In the past, the local manufacturers had to face severe competition due to the flow of cheap, low quality goods into the country. The current cess has been imposed on a unit rate basis as well as on an ad valorem basis. Thus, an effort has been made to reduce the adverse impact on our industry by importing under invoiced goods. A reawakening of our industry has been observed as a result of the development activities carried out by the Government and due to the protection received by the imposition of cess. According to the statistics released by the Department of Census and Statistics, the agriculture sector has registered a growth rate of 6.2 per cent while the industrial sector has registered a high",

The main objective of the Strategic Plan 2010-2015 of the EDB is to achieve an export target of US Dollars 15 billion by 2015. By adopting a strategic approach, the EDB aims to implement a number of programmes such as development of exports to identify markets, supply chain development programmes, trade information and e-commerce development programmes and skills development programmes. The main objective of these progrmmes is to improve the competitiveness of the export sector which would enable the sector to successfully confront the challenges posed by the international market. I have instructed the EDB to implement programmes that would contribute to increase export earnings in order to make an increased contribution to the GDP and to permeate its benefits to the regions. Accordingly, the EDB is implementing model export-oriented agricultural projects, regional export development programmes and Agri Export Zone Projects throughout the country thus channelling regional resources and skills for export development.",

In this context, as indeed the Brazilian Ambassador noted when he spoke to us, we must try to develop links between investors and potential partners and between businessmen in both countries.

At its simplest, we should also encourage greater awareness of other cultures and other societies. In this modern digital age, showcasing the achievements of other nations and promoting exchanges that will allow us to showcase our own will not be difficult.

Well, it is a timely and most appropriate Adjournment Motion, I would say, because the relationship with other countries is much important today than ever before after we have recovered from the most difficult era of the war time. Now that the focus on Sri Lanka is much greater, the relationship among the rest of the world, especially with the countries having true democratic surroundings, is of importance. We can share their views and experiences with regard to trade, education, economic aspects, as well as political relationships and understand as to how various levels of administration and power sharing are practised within those countries. So through these Friendship Associations we get a huge advantage; we can look at how the neighbouring countries perform at the moment, their political stability and what they have against us. So, I invite all Parliamentarians irrespective of party, coalition or alliance, to endorse this Motion brought up by the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha.

Now, taking a leaf from it, as the Foreign Minister, can that be done at your level? So, as the Hon. John Amaratunga put it, that will be very educative for the young Members of Parliament from both sides. Whenever you are going on a goodwill mission or other areas of interest, you can take them to accompany you. That will be very good in order to promote closer friendship.",

I am aware of other instances where senior Members of the Opposition have been invited to join Government delegations, but there seemed to be some degree of hesitation in responding affirmatively to those invitations. So, this is all due to the suspicion, the rancour, the acrimony that is regrettably a characteristic of the political culture of our country. So, we need to shed that attitude. It is not a good thing. Certainly let us engage with each other - criticize in a constructive spirit. This is exactly what Her Excellency Sushma Swaraj said to us: \"The conflict within the country is legitimate and unavoidable but outside the shores of India, it is only the interest of our motherland that motivates us in everything that we say and do\". How wonderful it would be, Mr. Presiding Member, if we ourselves could take some meaningful steps towards the accomplishment of that ideal. I am not for a moment suggesting that this can be done overnight. It is a process; it is not a single event, but with firm resolve to achieve that, we certainly have the resources in terms of our human resources, in terms of our levels of education and the depth and richness of our political experience over the decades.",
