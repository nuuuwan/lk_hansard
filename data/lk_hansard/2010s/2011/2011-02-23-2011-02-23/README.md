asked the Prime Minister and Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs :

(a) Will he inform this House of the number of private houses and institutions that are being occupied by the Security Forces in the North including Kilinochchi?

(b) Will he state as to when those places will be given back to the original owners?

(c) If not, why?

( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena - Minister of Water Supply and Drainage and Chief Government Whip) Sir, on behalf of the Prime Minister and Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs, I answer Question No. 5.

(a) The private lands, houses and institutions which are being used by the Army are approximately 1129, while 35 private lands are being used by the Navy. Approximately 32 private houses and relevant lands, and two paddy mills and relevant lands are being used by the Air Force in the Palali Camp, which is situated in the Palali High Security Zone. No private houses are situated there, while there are approximately seven private lands in the area used by the Air Force (Vanni) which belong to the Special Operations Group.

(b) 472 private lands, houses and institutions which belong to the civilians and used by the Army have been handed over to them while most of the remaining was given for utilization by the civilians themselves. Some parties have not established their ownership over the houses and lands nor made any requisition. It is planned to hand over the houses, lands and institutions as soon as a requisition is made by them. A decision has not been taken to hand over some of the institutions and houses which are situated in the High Security Zones as Army Camps are already functioning there. It was observed that it is necessary to carry out the functioning of the Sri Lanka Navy Camp, and resolution matters of particular lands which are suitable to establish the camps are being performed by the Divisional Secretaries. There are no houses in the Vanni area used by the Air Force and it is expected to hand over the private lands that belong to it to the relevant personnel within the time period of the next 90 days.

(c) Not applicable.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, my first Supplementary Question is this. The Hon. Minister referred to houses within the High Security Zones. Todays newspapers report that His Excellency the President as having stated that all High Security Zones in the North have been dismantled. I would like to know where these High Security Zones are in the North. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Speaker, the High Security Zones have been gazetted and been in operation for the last 20 years and we have been reducing the area. The Hon. Member is unaware of it. I think he should first visit Jaffna and go through the relevant files as to the background. Secondly, His Excellency the President did not make such a statement. What he said was that they are being scaled down. In fact both of us, the Hon. Minister of External Affairs and myself, were also present at that time.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) My second Supplementary Question is, the Hon. Minister is persisting in saying that there are High Security Zones in the North and that they are gazetted. As far as I know, there are no gazetted High Security Zones, particularly the Palali High Security Zone has never been gazetted. Is the Hon. Minister aware that that has never been gazetted and that there is a Supreme Court Order also to that effect? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I do not want to refer to the Supreme Court Order. If there is such an order and if the Hon. Member can produce it, we will answer that question. I do not think you have the reference. But, in relation to the Emergency Regulations, we have earmarked and gazetted -

1437 1438

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I want to know whether there are High Security Zones that have been gazetted as High Security Zones in the Jaffna Peninsula. That is the question. I also add that there is a Supreme Court Order in the case of the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah versus the Attorney-General. The question is whether you are aware of it? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) As far as the defence operations are concerned, in the last 20 years we have very clearly, by regulations, stated where the High Security Zones are and they are being scaled down fast as I said. Already 472 private lands, houses and institutions have been handed over to the civilians. So, we are in the process of handing over, which you must accept is happening. If you go there you could see, Sir, that the farmers have moved in. I have seen it with my own eyes; the farmers have moved into the lands that have been released. So, that is the position. We will continue to scale down those zones.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) The third Supplementary Question, Hon. Speaker, is whether the Hon. Minister is aware that the Defence Secretary and the Government Agent have told the press that there are no High Security Zones in Jaffna. My next Question is, when are you going to hand over the houses at least to the people in the North?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) When you say the North, it covers about five districts. Could you be particular, could you please pose the Question clearly?

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) That is, the part of Elephant Pass.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Which part of Elephant Pass? Is it the part you cannot go to?

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) The Jaffna District.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Ah, the Jaffna District. We are scaling down the zones, Sir. We have brought the area down to one-third of what it was. You know that there are landmines. Hon. Member, do you want to walk on landmines? . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) No, no. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We do not want any civilian to get injured. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) I do not know whether the Hon. Minister is aware that the demining group has already given a certificate that the demining is over.

(ii) those land recipients were chased away by other persons later and they have forcibly taken possession of those lands; and

(iii) even though the land recipients who were chased away as mentioned above have complained about this, no inquiry in that respect has been held so far?

(b) Will he submit to this House the list of names of the land recipients according to the distribution of land carried out in the year 2002?

(c) Will he state whether steps will be taken to inquire into the complaints lodged by the land recipients chased away from their lands, ensure their ownership and resettle them?

[. . 2.13] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Speaker, thank you for permitting me to participate in this Debate when several Orders have been placed before this House for approval. These Orders have been made under several financial statutes and if one takes a look at these several Orders that have been placed together, one finds that serious changes have been made, some with regard to duty structures, some with regard to cess and other changes that affect the economy as a whole.

Today, the main concern of the people of this country is the rapidly-growing cost of living. That cannot be gainsaid. That is a fact. Now, the fact that the cost of living goes up is not anybodys fault as such; there can be various factors, various reasons for that. The cost of living always goes up. But, the point is that it is the duty of the Government to ensure that it is in control, that it takes the right measures, its fiscal policy is correct in that it contains the rising cost of living. If that is done, then the people will not be so dissatisfied. They can see that the Government is doing its best despite prices are going up in the world market, despite oil prices going up, despite factors that are beyond the control of a country such as ours, the Government genuinely is trying to ensure that the people can live within the means that they get as their livelihood. Today that satisfaction is not there amongst the people and that is clear for everyone to see.

Some of these changes that are being introduced today make the importation of vehicles, for instance, the cost of that to be lower than it was before. That has already happened. Duty structures were slashed but the question is whether the need of the country at the moment is to have more vehicles on our already crowded roads. The effect of the surge in the importation of vehicles can already be seen. People who are at the bottom level, who are struggling to make ends meet are not very impressed by the fact that the cost of importation of vehicles like cars has come down. Their concern is that their food cost has gone up. Their concern is that their essentials like clothing - apparel - and housing, even to take on rent, keeps going up. Their concern is that in the agricultural sector, the cost of production has spiralled up. Now, in this context, Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw your attention to the priorities that the Government ought to have and that is certainly not to make the rich richer and the poor poorer. The priority of any responsible government must be to narrow that gap and certainly the Orders that are being placed before this House today do not indicate that.

Speaking of priorities, I must also come back to something that we have been saying for almost a year, since the commencement of this Parliament in April last year, that for a country that is recovering from the ill-effects of a long-protracted war, there are certain priorities that it must address its mind to. It is not just

1487 1488

2011 23

sufficient to pay lip service to developing areas that have been devastated by the war. What is being stated is very good. It is continuously being told that developmental work, particularly in the North and the East is going on, is thriving. Bridges are being built, roads are being laid and I too can vouch for that. Many bridges have been built and many roads have been laid. But, the question that is before us is, is that the priority for the people who have no roof over their head? Is that the priority when hundreds of thousands of people have no house to live in? Over 250,000 houses had been razed to the ground during the war. This is a matter that we raised during the Debate in the Budget that was presented in July last year and also at the main Budget in November; that the Government does not have or does not seem to have a scheme to rebuild dwelling houses for these persons. That is an essential requirement. Two years have gone by and those people are still living in huts made by using six poles, a few tin sheets and in certain instances, a tarpaulin to put over it while roads are being built and bridges are being constructed all around them. Now, is that the right priority for any responsible government? - [Interruption.] When we raised this issue, the Government's response in July last year was that the Government of India had offered to build 50,000 houses; not that the Sri Lankan Government was undertaking to build even one house, but the Government of India, after our appeal, had offered to build 50,000 houses. We welcome that move and thank the people and the Government of India for that generous offer. Now, it is almost a year since that offer was made and I would like to ask the question as to how many of those 50,000 houses have been built. If none has been built, then where lies the problem? We understand that for the recipients or the beneficiaries list, only the first 1,000 has been prepared. Does it take one year to prepare the beneficiaries list for the first 1,000 out of the 50,000 houses? At that rate how long will it take to prepare the beneficiaries list for the 50,000 houses? Fifty years to prepare the list! - [Interruption.] There was a housing scheme that was inaugurated by Sri S.M. Krishna, the Minister of External Affairs of India, when he visited Sri Lanka in November last year. I was present at that occasion. A few hundred houses in Ariyalai are being built. I know what is being done. I have been to those places and I am aware of what I am saying. Apart from that, there is not a stone that has been laid upon another stone to build any of these 50,000 houses. Now, the question - [Interruption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Rubbish. Hon. Member, are you criticizing the programme for the construction of these 50,000 houses? -[Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker, I must draw your attention to the unparliamentary words the Hon. Azwer has just used. -[Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I know what Parliamentary language and unparliamentary language is.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I have previously also told the Hon. Member that if he continues to do what he has been sent here to do, he will not get any promotion. He will sit at the last row and keep doing only this. You will not get any promotion because you are doing well what you have been asked to do.- [Interruption.] At that occasion when the Minister of External Affairs of India visited Jaffna, 500 tractors were also gifted to the people of the North. It was very clearly stated that it was for the people of the North. I was present on that occasion and thanked the people and the Government of India for that generous gift. The Northern Province lost more than 10,000 tractors during the war. Five hundred tractors were gifted by India. But, it is sad to note - I am saying this with utmost responsibility - that out of the 500 tractors that were gifted, 100 tractors have been given to the Sri Lanka Cashew Corporation and another 100 tractors have been given to the Coconut Development Authority. .. ( )

( .. - , ) (The Hon. A.P. Jagath Pushpakumara - Minister of Coconut Development and Janata Estate Development) To the Coconut Cultivation Board.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you very much, Hon. Minister of Coconut Development. They have been given to the Coconut Cultivation Board. That confirms what I said. It was gifted for the farmers of the North who had lost their tractors and after they were gifted at a public ceremony attended by the Minister of External Affairs of India, they have been taken away for two public corporations in the South. The third lot 100 tractors are still in Jaffna but ready to be transported to the South. Only 38 tractors have been given to the Agricultural Societies in the Kilinochchi District and another 38 have been given to the Agricultural Societies in the Mullaitivu District. Now, why is this being done? I am asking this question. Can anybody with a clear conscience answer this question? To replace 10,000 tractors that were destroyed, a good neighbour, India, gives us 500 tractors to be specifically

1489 1490

used by the farmers in the North and then, out of that, only 76 have even been allocated for that purpose and all the balance are being transported away. Now this is a question - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.P. Jagath Pushpakumara) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Hon. Member, there is a point of Order being raised.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.P. Jagath Pushpakumara) , 100 . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is not a point of Order.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.P. Jagath Pushpakumara) . 100 . . .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . , .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Minister only confirmed what I said and I thanked him for that. If there is an explanation, he can give it when he speaks. I am only asking a question that if a good neighbour gives a gift to be utilized in a particular way, why has that not been utilized in that way? That is all. I said that I am saying this with responsibility and what I said happens to be true because it is repeatedly being confirmed by the Hon. Minister concerned. So, this confirms that the Government is not doing its priority, particularly in a country that is recovering from the devastation of a protracted war. Any government in that situation must focus on the people who have been worst affected by the war. In this House, we repeatedly hear and I am sure, today also we will hear, several solemn assurances that that is the priority of the

Government. But, that is not substantiated by the acts of the Government and the two instances of housing and the tractors that I raised are only examples to demonstrate what I am saying.

With regard to the duty structure, I am making a request to the Government to consider raising the duty on onions very soon. Otherwise, there will be a glut when farmers in Jaffna harvest their onions. At this point in time, as you juggle with the cost of vegetables and speak of protecting the local farmers, at least do that as a gesture of goodwill to indicate that you have not forgotten the farmer in Jaffna even though you have taken away his tractor and even though you have not given him a house to live in. I appeal to the Government that you restructure the duty for onions because that is what is required in the immediate future with regard to the sale of his onions. Thank you very much.

[. . 4.03] ( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) ? [ ] ( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! The Hon. Minister is on his feet.

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) . . .

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, you have completed your speech. Hon. Minister, you can continue.

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) , . . . Hon. Presiding Member, with the fundamental objective of protecting the local industry and agriculture and promoting manufacture of value added products by discouraging exports in raw form, the Government has taken action to revise the import and export cess structure through the enforcement of the following Orders published under the Sri Lanka Export Development Act, No. 40 of 1979. They are: Gazette No. 1680/25 dated 19.11.2010, Gazette No. 1681/15 dated 22.11.2010 and Gazette No. 1685/18 dated 23.11.2010.

The basic objective the Government wishes to achieve by imposing cess on imports under the EDB Act is to discourage import of non-essential items and protect the local farmers and manufacturers. Import cess has been imposed only on non-essential items such as processed meat, frozen foods, vegetables, fruits, fruit juice, flowers, perfumes, footwear and luxury goods. The Government has not imposed cess on import of essential items such as medicinal drugs and investment goods.

Therefore, through the imposition of cess, it is expected to protect the local industry and to retain within the country a large sum of foreign exchange which would otherwise have flowed out of the country. It will also serve to relieve balance of payment difficulties faced by the country. The imposition of import cess will also help to provide strong protection to local manufacturers and farmers which would lead to strengthen the local economy. In the past, the local manufacturers had to face severe competition due to the flow of cheap, low quality goods into the country. The current cess has been imposed on a unit rate basis as well as on an ad valorem basis. Thus, an effort has been made to reduce the adverse impact on our industry by importing under invoiced goods. A reawakening of our industry has been observed as a result of the development activities carried out by the Government and due to the protection received by the imposition of cess. According to the statistics released by the Department of Census and Statistics, the agriculture sector has registered a growth rate of 6.2 per cent while the industrial sector has registered a high

1517 1518

growth rate of 8.8 per cent in the third quarter of 2010. While the developed countries are facing an economic setback, the progress achieved by our industrial sector is commendable. This is one instance which reflects the success achieved by pursuing policies under the Mahinda Chintana.

Hon. Presiding Member, cess has been imposed under the EDB Act on certain selected exports. Cess has been revised on exports of tea, rubber, coconut products, rawhides, and metal scrap while cess has been imposed on export of pepper, vanilla, cinnamon, cardamom, mace, maize, rice, wood and mineral in primary form. The objective of imposing such cess is to discourage exports of these items in raw form. Several items such as tea, rubber and coconut are currently exported from the country without sufficient value addition.

In 2010, tea worth of US Dollars 374 million, rubber worth of US Dollars 169 million and spices worth of US Dollars 100 million have been exported in bulk. These exports have been used by our competitor countries as raw materials for manufacture of value added goods. Therefore, an environment has been created for expansion of local value addition and to achieve a multitude of benefits for the country.

The encouragement of the value added industry, while leading to more investment opportunities, would also present opportunities to establish new industries, employment generation and increase export earnings. Therefore, measures taken by us to impose cess on exports in raw form will no doubt be a milestone in our march towards a manufacturing economy.

Sir, although the country is currently facing a shortage of coconuts, we have exported fresh coconuts to the value of US Dollars 11 million in 2010 without any value addition. We have now imposed a cess of Rs. 30 on export of raw coconuts under the EDB Act with a view to curtail exports and grant relief to local consumers and manufacturers engaged in the value added coconut industry. The objective of our Government is to build a strong economy as set out in the "Mahinda Chintana".

Sir, our Government had to implement several measures to develop and promote exports from Sri Lanka in the past, as a result of which the export sector has achieved considerable progress. Although it suffered a setback in the face of the global financial crisis in 2009, according to the data in the Customs, the export sector has been able to register a satisfactory growth rate of 16 per cent in 2010. This improved performance is reflected not only in agricultural exports but also in industrial exports. Agricultural exports which contribute 24 per cent to the total export earnings have registered a growth of 20 per cent in 2010. Tea exports, have registered a growth of 15

per cent, rubber 72 per cent, coconut fibre products 23 per cent and spices 55 per cent during this period.

The industrial exports which contribute 72 per cent to the total export earnings have registered a high growth rate of 14 per cent. Textile and garment exports which suffered a setback last year has registered a satisfactory growth of 6.6 per cent. Further, export earnings from food and beverages, leather products, wooden products, paper products, rubber products, chemicals and plastics, electrical and electronic products and footwear have achieved considerable progress in 2010. Exports to our major markets which suffered a setback last year has registered a satisfactory growth in 2010. Exports to USA have registered a growth of 10 per cent.

Sir, we should also be happy to note that our exports to the European Union have registered a growth of 5.9 per cent. Exports of garments to EU have registered a growth of 2.7 per cent. Exports of garments to EU have greatly improved during the fourth quarter of 2010. This clearly demonstrates the ability of our exporters to compete in the EU market even without the GSP Plus concessions.

Sir, it is important that the export sector which contributes significantly to the Gross Domestic Product of the country should make a substantial contribution to achieve the development objectives of the country. Accordingly, my Ministry is taking necessary action to increase export earnings up to US Dollars 15 million in 2015. As a result of prudent policies pursued by the Government including imposition of cess, a strong local economy is building up and therefore we believe that we are in a position to achieve that target.

Sir, the defeat of terrorism under the leadership of His Excellency the President has created a peaceful and stable political environment which is necessary for the development of private enterprises. Our Government has been able to reduce inflation to a single digit. Interest rates have come down and a conducive environment has been created to encourage investments. The favourable political and economic environment together with the co-operation of private sector has presented great opportunities for export development. With the liberation of the North and the East by our gallant forces, a conducive environment has been created for our entrepreneurs to make investments. The Government has taken the initiative to lay the foundation for infrastructure projects to achieve rapid economic progress. The Hambantota Port Development Project, the Colombo South Harbour Development Project, Power-generation Projects at Norachcholai, Kerawalapitiya, Kotmale North, Highways and flyovers are currently under implementation.

Sir, the development of infrastructure facilities, expansion of production capacity and improvement of economic efficiency not only help to increase

1519 1520

[ ]

2011 23

productivity but also to minimize regional disparities. Furthermore, the Government has taken the initiative to develop the human capital, which is a prerequisite to develop a knowledge-based economy. These favourable developments taking place within the political and economic environment will greatly enhance the work carried out by the institutions engaged in export under my Ministry. The Sri Lanka Export Development Board which is under my Ministry has implemented a number of programmes for the development of the export sector. The main objective of the Strategic Plan 2010-2015 of the EDB is to achieve an export target of US Dollars 15 billion by 2015. By adopting a strategic approach, the EDB aims to implement a number of programmes such as development of exports to identify markets, supply chain development programmes, trade information and e-commerce development programmes and skills development programmes. The main objective of these progrmmes is to improve the competitiveness of the export sector which would enable the sector to successfully confront the challenges posed by the international market. I have instructed the EDB to implement programmes that would contribute to increase export earnings in order to make an increased contribution to the GDP and to permeate its benefits to the regions. Accordingly, the EDB is implementing model export-oriented agricultural projects, regional export development programmes and Agri Export Zone Projects throughout the country thus channelling regional resources and skills for export development.

The economy of the country has registered a growth rate of 8.5 per cent during the second quarter and a growth rate of 8 per cent during the third quarter of 2010. It has been reported that the world economy also grew by 4 per cent in 2010. These are signs of emerging positive prospects for the future. As patriotic Sri Lankans, our task of the era is to support programmes implemented by the Government to make Sri Lanka the "Wonder of Asia". We are fortunate to be guided by the excellent leadership of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa in this endeavour. Therefore, I would earnestly request this august House to set aside the differences and work in harmony for the development of the country. , .. , . , 500 '' . , , , , , , . , ,

It states, I quote:

Statement at the conclusion of the IMF Staff Mission to Sri Lanka

The economy grew at a strong 7 percent in 2010, according to current estimates. Inflation has increased but this reflects some recent increases in food prices. Credit growth is in line with earlier projections, the property market remains subdued, and other signs of demand-driven inflationary pressures are not evident. Against this background, our assessment is that current monetary conditions are appropriate for supporting the economic recovery."

. :

"The authorities continue to execute policies in line with the programs goals. Performance against the end-December targets was satisfactory, with the 2010 budget deficit likely to have been held within the target of 8 percent of GDP.

The authorities structural reform agenda is also broadly on track.

1545 1546

It again states, I quote:

Recent flooding has significantly damaged Sri Lankas harvest of various crops including rice and vegetables, as well as rural infrastructure. Any effect on food prices is likely to be temporary, and given the strength of the Sri Lankan economy, the overall impact on output growth should be limited.

. ; . :

Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala announcing the moves which could pave the way for Sri Lanka to receive increased support from the development Institution has reaffirmed the World Banks strong and expanding support to Sri Lanka as it transitions towards a middle-income country in lasting peace."

It further states, I quote:

"The World Bank official attributed Sri Lankas remarkable rise from past challenges to the tenacity of the Sri Lankan people and the commitment of the countrys leadership"

It further states, I quote:

"During the meeting with President Rajapaksa, Dr. Okonjo-Iweala has reiterated her institutions commitment to Sri Lanka, especially in supporting programs designed to encourage inclusive growth throughout the country".

I further quote:

"....... investment from both foreign and domestic sources as envisioned in the Mahinda Chinthana, the Government's vision for future development.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The Adjournment Motion is to be moved by the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha.

ESTABLISHMENT OF PARLIAMENTARY FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATIONS

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I move,

In view of the importance of developing good relations between Sri Lankan Parliamentarians in general and Parliamentarians in other countries, this House do stand adjourned to suggest the establishment of Parliamentary Friendship Associations that would -

(a) develop links between Sri Lankan Parliamentarians and Parliamentarians in other countries;

(b) promote familiarization visits which would encourage mutual understanding of country situations;

(c) enhance understanding of legislative practices in other countries, and in particular those with different constitutional traditions;

(d) produce newsletters that would provide relevant information about legislative and other developments in Sri Lanka.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to propose this Adjournment Motion that is intended to develop closer links between Parliamentarians in Sri Lanka and their peers in other countries. I should add, however, that there has been much progress since I first suggested this Motion, nine months ago. Several Friendship Associations have been set up in the last few months, beginning with the initiative of the former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs who revived the Sri Lanka-Brazil Parliamentarians Friendship Association. This was a fitting tribute to the increasingly close relations between Sri Lanka and South America.

I should note, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that the idea for this Motion was first suggested by a European Ambassador from a country that has supported us very positively over the years, but where knowledge of Sri Lanka is limited. That had allowed policy with regard to this country to be governed by initiatives by a highly motivated few, who might not always have the interests of Sri Lanka at heart. I was told that Sri Lanka had an extremely good story to tell, not only about how we had defeated terrorism but also how we are making up the lost time in terms of developing areas that had been neglected before, and providing opportunities to those who had been deprived for ages.

Unfortunately, we are not telling our story effectively enough. This allowed a few representatives from just one or two countries, with a particular agenda, to make the running at the European Union with regard, for instance, to GSP Plus. The feeling then was that many European countries which benefited from expanding trade with Sri Lanka, and wished us to benefit too, had simply not been able to make their views felt forcefully enough, since they were not updated with details to help their case and ours.

The suggestion then was that, by developing the social and personal contacts that are so important in policy making, we would be able to ensure better awareness of the Sri Lankan situation. At the same time, we should lay stress not on the story, but on the actuality, by encouraging greater awareness of what we have here and what we are developing. Our friends in Parliaments all over the world should want to know what was going on, should be facilitated to obtain the knowledge they required, and we hope sympathetic understanding would come with such knowledge.

So, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we must not look on such Friendship Associations as created primarily to promote visits to partner nations by us. Whilst expanding our awareness of other countries is important, more important in the present context is expanding awareness in other countries of Sri Lanka and its enormous promise. In this context, as indeed the Brazilian Ambassador noted when he spoke to us, we must try to develop links between investors and potential partners and between businessmen in both countries. Though obviously we would like to concentrate on our exporters and their tourists, with the passage of time and increasing prosperity, contacts the other way too would be helpful.

We also need to ensure cooperation between practitioners of culture so that exchanges can be facilitated. In this regard we should strengthen the regional cultural centres that our Ministry of Culture and the Arts is establishing. It has been suggested that these should promote multi-cultural activity, and there is much that other countries can offer us in terms of training and support for such initiatives. At its simplest, we should also encourage greater awareness of other cultures and other societies. In this modern digital age, showcasing the achievements of other nations and promoting exchanges that will allow us to showcase our own will not be difficult. I believe our Parliamentary Friendship Associations, through liaison with foreign missions here and by using their good offices to promote cooperation, will have much to offer young people in areas that now have little exposure to world cultures.

Over the last few months, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we have revived or established Friendship Associations with - to move from East to West - Australia and Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Iran, South Africa, Italy, Spain, France,

1557 1558

Germany, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Cuba and Canada. I believe one with the Netherlands is about to be set up, as well as with Kuwait and the Philippines and certainly there are other countries with whom we should work. Most recently, a couple of weeks back, we took a new step forward, subject - I should add - to the Inter-Parliamentary Union Executive approving. We established a Friendship Association with a Parliament representing not just one country but several. I refer to the European Union Parliament, and this was in fact a timely move, since at this very moment we have a delegation from the European Parliament visiting Sri Lanka.

Unfortunately, that group represents what is known as the South Asia delegation, which indicates a tendency to consider us simply as one of a group of countries. We cannot object to this which is moving towards closer integration of several countries, but we should also encourage the establishment of a Friendship Association concerned only with this country. I was delighted to see amongst the Members of the European Parliament, Members who have liaised closely with our Ambassador in Brussels and who have spared time to meet with Parliamentarians from this country. Developing such contacts on a regular basis, formally and informally, would benefit all the people represented by Parliamentarians both here and in Brussels.

In this context, I should mention an area in which I believe we could learn from Europe to the benefit of our Parliamentary system. Last year, my Coordinating Secretary spent three months as an intern with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group in the European Parliament. In his report he mentioned the importance of the European Parliaments Committee Systems which served to disseminate information and contribute to informed policy making. Given suggestions that have been advanced about the setting up of what are termed Oversight Committees, given the increasing need for accountability which we see all over the world, we could benefit from experiences in this line elsewhere. But, in the end we have to develop our own systems suited to this country.

However, learning from experiences elsewhere, benefiting from good practices in other countries, will help us in this Parliament too to contribute to good governance. I was delighted, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to receive recently a notice from the Research Division of Parliament about a journal that is planned to boost the legislative process and policy formulation. I was very happy to offer a contribution, entitled The Role of Parliament in promoting Good Governance, and hope to expand this into articles in a newspaper, if this is acceptable, so as to promote discussion of the topic.

This scholarly initiative of the Research Division suggests a commitment to developing Parliamentary practices in this country which is most welcome. As with all initiatives, the more inputs we have with regard to good practices elsewhere, the better for any reforms that might be undertaken. I hope therefore that the Friendship Associations we have established will contribute to a mutual learning process for us as well as for Parliamentarians in the partner countries, and through this we hope to service the people on whose behalf we all function.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) Sir, I would like to second the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha. Well, it is a timely and most appropriate Adjournment Motion, I would say, because the relationship with other countries is much important today than ever before after we have recovered from the most difficult era of the war time. Now that the focus on Sri Lanka is much greater, the relationship among the rest of the world, especially with the countries having true democratic surroundings, is of importance. We can share their views and experiences with regard to trade, education, economic aspects, as well as political relationships and understand as to how various levels of administration and power sharing are practised within those countries. So through these Friendship Associations we get a huge advantage; we can look at how the neighbouring countries perform at the moment, their political stability and what they have against us. So, I invite all Parliamentarians irrespective of party, coalition or alliance, to endorse this Motion brought up by the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha. We truly believe the representation of all the parties in the Friendship Associations will gather more recognition and more respect when we go before Foreign Missions and various other Government agencies in this country.

Thank you. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is a very appropriate and timely Motion that my Colleague, the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha, has moved.

When we travel around the globe to various countries, what they say is that you must have close understanding with the democracies of the world. The democracies mean the Parliaments of those countries. We have a very vibrant democracy - our Parliament is also strong. We have had elections over and over again, 17 or 18 times and it is an expression of the will of the people that they registered their support for the party headed by His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa at all these elections.

Sir, first I would give a brief account of the history of the formation of Parliamentary Friendship Associations. The formation of Friendship Associations or groups among friendly countries is a worthy concept followed by many countries in the world. This has many facets as various aims and objectives could be achieved through those associations. The Parliamentary Friendship Associations could also be considered as an extension of this concept, which can have the blessings of the supreme institutions of the countries concerned.

Sir, a Parliamentary Friendship Association was formed for the first time in the history of the Sri Lankan Parliament in 1985. It was the Sri Lanka-Korea Parliamentary Friendship Association. The late Hon. Norman Waidyaratne, the then Deputy Speaker of Parliament, took initiatives to form it and he was elected the President while my good Friend across the aisle, the Hon. John Amaratunga, was elected the Secretary of the Association. The late Hon. E.L. Senanayake was the Speaker of Parliament at that time.

The main purpose of the formation of the Sri Lanka-Korea Parliamentary Friendship Association was to promote mutual understanding, goodwill and friendship between the people and the Parliamentarians of Sri Lanka and Korea. Later, it was included in the objectives of the Friendship Associations with the addition of some more aims and objectives: to promote, encourage and assist in the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge of society, culture and language of the friendly countries among the people of Sri Lanka, to promote friendship and social intercourse through appropriate means among the Members of the Association, to sponsor, encourage and support social, cultural, economic and any other activities between the two countries and to collect and receive gifts and donations of whatever description and utilize them for the purposes set out in the objectives. Of course, the objectives shall be consistent with the Foreign Policy of the Government of Sri Lanka.

Then, Sir, the second Parliamentary Friendship Association was formed between Sri Lanka and Cuba on the 7th of July, 1989. The third Parliamentary Friendship Association formed was between Sri Lanka and Japan.

Sir, we have a Foreign Relations and Protocol Office in our Parliament, a unit for the CPA, IPU and SAARC headed by the Chief Parliamentary Protocol Officer, Mr. Upali Kumarasinghe and there are other Assistant Protocol Officers who are doing a very good job of work.

Recently, the Third Asia Regional Conference of the CPA was held in Colombo. The Speakers of Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and the Maldives came here for that. Earlier, after the President of Pakistan, His Excellency Asif Ali Zardari came to Sri Lanka, we strengthened the Sri Lanka-Pakistan Parliamentary Friendship Association. As a result, our Speaker, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa was

invited as a special guest of the Parliament of Pakistan, and he took a delegation. I also had the privilege of joining that delegation. What came out of that, Sir? That delegation was taken to Taxila in Lahore. Taxila is a famous, historic and ancient town, Sir. There is a museum where they have preserved all the Buddhist relics from the time of Lord Buddha and the Great Emperor Ashoka. There are relics of Lord Buddha, which were permitted for the Speaker and the delegation to be viewed. His Excellency the President of Pakistan, being a Muslim - it is a Muslim country, of course - promised that during the 2,600th Buddha Jayanthi celebrations in this country, he will make arrangements to send one of the relics to Sri Lanka. I am happy, Sir, that our young Deputy Secretary-General of Parliament, Mr. Dhammika Dasanayake, also associated with us. He is taking a keen interest in promoting friendship among all these countries.

Sir, the Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena was elected as the President of the Sri Lanka-Brazil Parliamentary Friendship Association. The Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Sudharshini Fernandopulle was elected as the President of the Sri Lanka-Italy Parliamentary Friendship Association. Then, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, our Chief Government Whip, was elected as the President of Sri Lanka-Spain Parliamentary Friendship Association and also of the Sri Lanka-South Africa Parliamentary Friendship Association; the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana is the President of the Sri Lanka-Cuba Parliamentary Friendship Association; the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa is the President of Sri Lanka-Germany Parliamentary Friendship Association; the Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie was elected as the President of Sri Lanka-Pakistan Parliamentary Friendship Association; the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva is the President of the Sri Lanka-India Parliamentary Friendship Association; the Hon. P. Dayaratna is the President of the Sri Lanka-Australia Parliamentary Friendship Association; the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha, the Mover of this Motion, is the President of Sri Lanka-Canada Parliamentary Friendship Association; the Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala, the Member who seconded the Motion, is the President of Sri Lanka-United Kingdom Parliamentary Friendship Association; the Hon. T.B. Ekanayake is the President of the Sri Lanka-France Friendship Association. The Hon. W.D.J Senewiratne is the President of the Sri Lanka-Iran Friendship Association. The Hon. Rauff Hakeem is the President of the Sri Lanka-Indonesia Friendship Association and you yourself, Sir, who is in this exalted position, is the President of the Sri Lanka-European Union Friendship Association. Then, the formation of several other Parliamentary Friendship Associations is in the pipeline.

I think at this moment we must thank, particularly the Indian High Commissioner, His Excellency Ashok K. Kantha and the Pakistan High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, Her Excellency Seema Illahi Baloch, who have

1561 1562

been very helpful to Sri Lanka at a critical time. The Indian High Commissioner, who came with us the other day to open the Galle-Matara Express Railway line, is also very enthusiastic to open up the boat service, first,from Talaimannar to Tuticorin Port and thereafter, up to Rameswaram. The countries with which we would have Parliamentary Friendship Associations formed very soon are Norway, Korea, Bangladesh, Japan, Thailand, Turkey, Switzerland, China, Russia, Nepal, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Cyprus, Kuwait, Egypt, Sudan, Romania, the Maldives, Tunisia, the USA, Singapore, Malaysia, Hungary, Latvia, Ukraine and the Philippines.

At this time when we are promoting Parliamentary Friendship Associations, through which we were able to disseminate knowledge and build up a strong economy, it is very important to state here that the "Fox News" had broadcast - it was amazing - "Fox News claims Sri Lanka has the best performing Bourse in the world, February 21, 2011. The 'Fox News' in the US has said that the best performing stock market in the world is in Sri Lanka." These are facts that we could spotlight for the world to know. People may decry our development due to jealousy. The other day, it was unbecoming of a leader to say things adverse, against the territorial integrity and the freedom of our country before Hon. Speakers of other countries and others who were present in the conference hall. They also did not feel comfortable to hear such things from our own leaders.

Therefore, through the Friendship Associations, we can inculcate in them, be it the Leader of the Opposition or the Members of the Opposition, the correct perspective on our foreign policy, upholding the integrity and self-respect of our country. Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer to take the Chair.

.. ( )

( .. - ) (The Hon. S.B. Dissanayake - Minister of Higher Education) I propose that the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

, ... .

, , ... . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER took the Chair. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Now, I call upon the Hon. John Amaratunga to speak. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) When we are debating our foreign relations, I would like to place on record that the other day, we had the Third Asia Regional Conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in Sri Lanka. Also, I would like to congratulate the Hon. Speaker, the Secretary-General, the staff and the CPA Secretariat here headed by Mr. Upali Kumarasinghe for doing a wonderful job, for having made excellent arrangements. I am sure that all the participants in the Conference, the Speakers, other Members and officials, went back with very pleasant memories and quite satisfied with the arrangements. I wish to place that on record, first.

Secondly, talking of Friendship Associations, one thing I have noticed is - the Hon. Azwer, the Hon. Presiding Member, gave a past record of those Associations for the last 20 to 30 years - although we have formed all these Friendship Associations here with the participation of our Members and most often with the participation of the Ambassador of that respective country, we do not see counter-associations formed in those countries. Now, that is a matter for the Hon. Minister of External Affairs and our representative in that country must ensure that the formation of a counter-association is promoted. Otherwise, it becomes a one-sided affair. We only have it here, but we do not have one in that country, where there could be groups of legislators who would be looking at events that are taking place in Sri Lanka and even promoting and defending Sri Lanka at times of crises. ( ) (The Presiding Member) When our Hon. Speaker visited Pakistan, they took up the responsibility of forming a Pakistan-Sri Lanka Friendship Association. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) That is good. At least here is a start now. As you mentioned, earlier there was a very strong counterpart- association with Korea. Because of that, there were so many trade links, so many investors and so many

1563 1564

[ ... ]

2011 23

industrialists came to Sri Lanka at that time. There were regular exchange of delegations and there was a lot of understanding between the legislators of the two countries. The young Members of Parliament at that time had the opportunity of exposing themselves to the foreign policies and foreign relations in the legislatures in other countries, as you quite rightly said. This is something that we have to keep in mind. We are merely forming one Association in Sri Lanka without having a counter-association to go along with it.

The Hon. Minister of External Affairs is also present here. It is his responsibility. He has to take an initiative in this regard and instruct the Ambassadors or the High Commissioners to meet the Speakers of those Assemblies and leaders of the legislatures and tell them that there is a Friendship Association in Sri Lanka and we would like to have a counter-association in that part of the country. In the good old days, we had a very strong counter- association in the British Parliament. They really defended us at difficult times. They were very much interested in Sri Lankan politics and what was happening here. They did make periodical visits here. Our Members of Parliament were also invited to their countries. I remember when we were Members of the COPE at that time - the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena was also a Member of the COPE then - very often, once or twice a year - the Committee got an invitation to visit some of the European countries or the United States of America or some countries in South Asia and we had a lot of exchange of views with the other countries through the two Committees - the Committee on Public Accounts and the Committee on Public Enterprises. Both the Committees had this opportunity. But, I do not see that happening today.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you would remember, we travelled to most of the South Asian countries like Indonesia, Thailand and other countries. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes, you were also part of that delegation. What I am saying is that we do not get those types of invitations coming to Sri Lanka now. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Through COPE? ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The Hon. Minister of External Affairs, you must make sure that the Ambassadors take an initiative in this regard.

Earlier the World Bank used to give us invitations, the IMF used to give us invitations, then the ADB and the UNESCO also used to give us invitations. All those foreign institutions used to give opportunities for the young Members of Parliament on both sides. I heard that a group of Members of Parliament accompanied the Hon. Speaker to Pakistan. The Hon. Speaker must take with him Members of the Opposition too. After all, he is an independent personality in the House. I am just suggesting that it should be so. But, that does not mean that we have a right to ask for it. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Two Hon. Members of the Opposition were named but they did not join. One was from your side and the other was from the TNA. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I am sorry. I did not know that. Otherwise we would have substituted another name, if they were not going. It is a simple thing.

Anyway, these are some of the things that I would like to mention. I must congratulate the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha who moved this Adjournment Motion, which is quite relevant. I can see that every other day a Friendship Association is formed. There is a lot of enthusiasm on both sides. But, the problem is whether it is moving in the right direction. Hon. Minister of External Affairs, in spite of all the problems that we have, you are a very capable Minister. Nevertheless, I think you should instruct your Ambassadors in this regard. Take a list of all the Associations that have been formed and tell the Ambassadors to please take an initiative to move forward and have counter-associations functioning there. Thereafter, Parliamentarians can meet up and have discussions.

Thank You. ( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris. You have 15 minutes.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, I would like to bring to your kind notice that today at the Consultative Committee Meeting of the Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, the Hon. Dilan Perera suggested that young Members of Parliament could accompany him when he goes to the Middle Eastern countries. Now, taking a leaf from it, as the Foreign Minister, can that be done at your level? So, as the Hon. John Amaratunga put it, that will be very educative for the young Members of Parliament from both sides. Whenever you are going on a goodwill mission or other areas of interest, you can take them to accompany you. That will be very good in order to promote closer friendship.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) I agree entirely, Mr. Presiding Member. But, of course there has to be acceptance of that idea by the Opposition as well. As you yourself pointed out, Sir, recently there were opportunities given to two Members

of the Opposition to join a foreign delegation. But, there was some degree of reluctance on their part in accepting that. I am aware of other instances where senior Members of the Opposition have been invited to join Government delegations, but there seemed to be some degree of hesitation in responding affirmatively to those invitations. So, this is all due to the suspicion, the rancour, the acrimony that is regrettably a characteristic of the political culture of our country. So, we need to shed that attitude. It is not a good thing. Certainly let us engage with each other - criticize in a constructive spirit. This is exactly what Her Excellency Sushma Swaraj said to us: "The conflict within the country is legitimate and unavoidable but outside the shores of India, it is only the interest of our motherland that motivates us in everything that we say and do". How wonderful it would be, Mr. Presiding Member, if we ourselves could take some meaningful steps towards the accomplishment of that ideal. I am not for a moment suggesting that this can be done overnight. It is a process; it is not a single event, but with firm resolve to achieve that, we certainly have the resources in terms of our human resources, in terms of our levels of education and the depth and richness of our political experience over the decades.

My respectful submission therefore, Sir, is that we draw upon the diversity of that experience in order to move forward in accordance with the spirit that is reflected in the contributions that were made a few minutes ago, both by the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha and on behalf of the Opposition by the Chief Opposition Whip, Hon. John Amaratunga. I thank you Sir.
