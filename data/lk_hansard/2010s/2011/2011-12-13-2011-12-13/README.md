.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Member is referring to the Hon. Shritharan by name without referring to him as an "Hon. Member".

. ( . ) (The Hon. J. Sri Ranga) I did not refer to a Member of Parliament, I said only "Shritharan" -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If you can clarify that the Shritharan you referred to is not the Hon. Shritharan, then it is all right.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) If the Hon. Member is referring to Hon. Shritharan, then it will be expunged.

. ( . ) (The Hon. J. Sri Ranga) He must still tired after the cricket match. I do not know what he is talking about. I did not refer to the Member of Parliament. He must tired after the cricket match and the party. So, he does not know what he is talking about. I think he needs a rest.

[1.43 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Deputy Chairman, it gives me great pleasure to speak today on the Votes of the Ministry of Labour and

1857 1858

Labour Relations, being a person involved in the trade union movement.

The Hon. Joseph Michael Perera, a former Minister of Labour, started his speech followed by the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne, another former Minister of Labour, discussing a matter that is in the hands of an able trade unionist who has the needs and aspirations of the workers in his heart all the time.

It was nice to see the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne speaking about the Employees Provident Fund (Amendment) Bill and also about the Pensions Bill and he understands why the Pensions Bill failed. Knowing this and with so many people concerned about labour interests, the Government could not change the Pensions Bill in such a way that it would have been useful to the people. In fact, the Pensions Bill is a very positive social security legislation which would have been passed but, as the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne said, the workers were supposed to contribute but they were not sure of getting the money back if they prematurely left employment or if somebody died prematurely. Even his family was not to get the benefits of the contributions that they themselves made and that was the reason why the Pensions Bill failed. So, knowing that, the Government did not come forward to amend the Bill in such a way that the workers could accept it.

Hon. Minister, I wish to first thank you for having co-operated with the trade unions in the plantations by gazetting the Collective Agreement signed between the Plantation Trade Unions and the Employers' Federation of Ceylon. By gazetting this, you have made it possible for the Department of Labour to intervene whenever the Collective Agreement is flouted by either party. It becomes a statute and thus we have the power to enforce the Collective Agreement by your gesture of gazetting the Collective Agreement. Further, there was resistance from the smallholders to extend this Collective Agreement to the employees in the smallholdings. This was due to the drop in prices since June as a result of the incidents that were taking place in the Middle-East, which had an impact on the auction prices and the employers were reluctant to extend the new Collective Agreement to their workers. However, in the smallholder sector, which is generally considered to be in the Ratnapura, Galle, Matara and Kalutara Districts, the employers were anyway paying above the salaries that were being paid in the plantation company areas. However, the Hon. Minister was successful in negotiating with the employers in the smallholder sector and persuaded them to accept the Collective Agreement. Now, it has been adopted by the Wages Board for the tea and rubber trades and it has been gazetted. The workers are glad and happy that they would receive the same salary as in the plantation companies, and we are grateful to you, Hon. Minister, for extending this Collective Agreement to the smallholders.

The Collective Agreement, as I stated, is today a statute because you have adopted it. However, the Employers' Federation of Ceylon having committed to uphold the Collective Agreement is sometimes flouting it at the estate level. At the national level, the CEOs come, discuss, agree and sign the agreement but at the same time they are giving instructions to their managers at the estate level not to follow the Collective Agreement but to change them to the disadvantage of the workers.

As you know, the Wages Board and the Collective Agreement state that workers in the tea or rubber manufacturing trade are supposed to be paid a daily rate of wages. Anybody attending work for a day is supposed to be paid a minimum wage. However, in many of these estates, even today, they are employing a certain number of persons on piece-rate basis. In the tea estates, the worker is called upon to work on a piece-rate basis. That is, each day he is expected to pluck tea and when the tea is brought in, they are paid only for the kilos of tea that they bring in. So, in the Collective Agreement, it is said that as an incentive for workers who bring above a norm that is fixed, they will be paid Rs. 17 per kilo. But, in some estates, they pay Rs.17 for every kilo that is brought by some of the workers who are called "cash pluckers". Therefore, the worker, to reach the minimum wage of Rs. 510, will have to bring at least 30 kilos . They cannot do it. They bring in 16 or 18 kilos and they get a wage in the region of Rs. 300 per day, which is far below the minimum wage that is stipulated in the Collective Agreement. However, the Labour Department does not take any action against this.

Further, the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne stated in this House today, that any person employing even one person is bound to pay EPF to his worker. All these plantation companies, being public companies employing thousands of workers, are flouting the EPF law by not paying EPF or ETF dues to any of these workers and they are also not entitled to maternity benefits or gratuity. So, all these statutes that govern labour have been flouted by these public companies, which is very unfortunate. Hon. Minister, I hope to take this up at the ACL - Assistant Commissioner of Labour - level in the different areas where this is being done by different estates on estate-to-estate basis. I would request you, Hon. Minister, to instruct the Labour Department to stick to the rules and take action without fear or favour. By doing so, we can implement the law and see that justice is done and fair play is maintained for the benefit of the workers in the estates.

Further, the Collective Agreement very clearly states that on Sundays and Poya days, the worker is supposed to be paid one-and-a-half days' wages. This is not because of the Collective Agreement alone. There is a universally- accepted law that any worker who sacrifices his or her holiday is entitled to be paid one and a half times the wages and to be paid two times the daily wage on a statutory holiday. This also has to be paid on the basis of

1859 1860

[ . ]

2011 13

a daily paid workers wage and not on any other terms. But, these plantations companies, having signed the Collective Agreement saying that they would pay one and a half days' wages and not increase the norms, are often increasing the norms on Sundays. If it is 18 kilos on other days, they have to pluck 24 kilos on a Sunday. In rubber, if it is 6 kilos, they have to increase it to 9 kilos, which is an impossible task. However, if they do not bring that, they are not paid the one-and-a-half days' wage. Some who do not wish to flout the minimum wage itself, are cajoling the workers who would like to earn a little extra money on a Sunday or a Poya day to work on a piece-rate basis. They are paid, maybe Rs. 30 for a kilo of tea or Rs. 40 for a kilo of latex on a Sunday. They are being asked to bring it in quantity and not according to the time factor that they work. The Wages Board and the Collective Agreement state that every estate employee has to be employed on a time basis, and not on a piece-rate basis. However, this is being flouted again by the so called public companies.

Since the wage increase in June 2011, the companies have started talking about low productivity in the plantations and that because of this wage increase they are losing money. Maybe the companies are losing money since June. But, it is not because the workers are working less after June but only because the companies have failed in their marketing strategies. With the unrest in the Middle-East and Libya - who buy tea at the highest price - being out of the market, the auctions have produced lower prices.The marketing part is to be handled by the management of these companies and not by the workers. Workers are producing tea or rubber to the extent that is necessary. However, they are being exploited by these companies. Now, they are telling the workers that the companies are running at a loss and unless they work more and produce more, these companies will be taken over by the Government and that outside intervention will come into the estates. One of the trade unions who work with your Government has summoned the leaders of the estates and told them that there is a possibility of the Government taking over the plantation companies that are running at a loss and the army would be brought into the estates. They hold this threat against the workers and ask them to increase the work they do.

Hon. Minister, this is an indirect way of taking back the salary increase you gave in June, through the back door. Why I say this is, by bringing 18 kilos of tea leaves they were getting Rs. 515. If they brought 20 kilos, they would have got for the 2 kilos, over Rs. 34, making their wage Rs. 549. If they increase the norm without the "over kilo" rate, then they will be getting Rs. 550 for 20 kilos. That means, a decrease in their wages by Rs. 34. This is a fact which is being urged by the Government and one large trade union in the plantation sector.

This should not be done under threat. This can be negotiated with the workers. If there are good agricultural practices and higher yields from the estates, then I am

sure the workers will be willing to produce more during their working hours for the day. We have seen this. In Galle, where the yield per hectare is 2,300 kilos, the norm is 22 kilos per day; whereas, in the upcountry where the yield is only about 1,300 kilos per hectare, the norm has been fixed at 18 kilos. It will be unreasonable to increase the norm without increasing the yield per hectare. The increase in the yield per hectare cannot be brought about by the workers. It can be brought about only by the management, by better agricultural practices, by using fertilizers, by weeding their fields and through other methods. Without doing that, to force the worker to bring more yield without an extra payment is unreasonable and unfair and this is also against the Collective Agreement, which stipulates that norms can be increased only with the consent of the workers trade unions.

The Minister, Hon. Athauda Seneviratne spoke about the Employees Provident Fund (Amendment) Bill, which has been listed in the Order Paper. It has not been brought to the House. I inquired from you about a month ago. You said that with the Budget, you may be able to pass it through. I hope it could be done but it does not seem to be considered, because otherwise you could have brought it today and I am sure we could have passed it without much ado because it is for the workers. Today, the worker has to borrow for housing by pledging these EPF money to a bank. I know of some workers who have borrowed Rs. 30,000 ten years ago and they have paid Rs. 400 per month and during the 10 years, Rs. 48,000 has already been paid. But, when you go to the bank and ask them how much more they have to pay, again they say it is Rs. 30,000. The Rs. 48,000 that they have already paid is all interest and the capital has not been reduced. By the time they pay off the loan, they will be paying a total of Rs. 78,000. Today in the plantations, the workers are yearning for a better house.

If you will pass this Bill and enable the worker to draw his own money from the EPF without a monthly interest or instalment payment, then it would enable him to improve his house and that would be a big boost for this community.

Sir, the Labour Department has to enforce these statutory laws. But, the JEDB - Janatha Estate Development Board - which comes under the Ministry of State Resources and Enterprise Development is not coming under your laws. The JEDB has not paid gratuity to several workers who retired 10 years ago. Some have already died but their gratuity has not been paid. As far as the EPF is concerned, it has not been paid for the last four years and therefore the workers are unable to withdraw their EPF. This is a State institution. The JEDB sold some properties in the Vauxhall Street for Rs. 160 million sometime back. We thought that would settle the EPF dues. But, that was taken by the Treasury and not released back to the Ministry and up to now, though it is two years since the buildings were sold, they have not been able to settle the EPF of the workers. Unless you

1861 1862

settle this issue, I am sure the workers will keep on suffering. The management of those estates is very poor. In addition, the statutory dues are also not being paid. Hon. Minister, you are the only person who can enforce this; even though it is a State institution, if you take them to courts, definitely they will pay up. I request you to kindly do that.

Thank you. [.. 2.02] ( ) (The Hon. Palany Thigambaram) , , , . , , , . . . . , . . , , . 20 . .

Sir, our Hon. Rosy Senanayake, the fair Member, was saying about Swadeshiya sarees and other anda paladum - - While she was speaking, I was just thinking what saree she was wearing when she was elected as the World Woman Married Beauty? Was it a Swadeshiya saree? . ,

1889 1890

. . . . , . . .

Sir, I want to straight away come to the case of Rizana who is in a Saudi Arabian prison. The other day, a delegation led by our Governor of the Western Province, respected Seyyed Alavi Mowlana and some of us went in this delegation. We went to Riyadh. It was almost a new move that was taken by Mr. Kingsley Ranawaka, the Chairman of the Foreign Employment Bureau. He roped in some of the best known Moulavis from this country who are scholars in Arabic and together with them we were able to go to Saudi and meet the parents who live 500 kilometres away from Riyadh. So we spoke to them in their own language. We went to Dawadmi village - to the place where the parents are living. In Dawadmi there is a tribal leader. His name is, Muhammad Faihan Shuraim Al-Uthaibi. He accorded us a warm reception at the Civic Hall, a magnificent hall built in the tribal city of Dawadmi. He summoned all the tribal leaders and they were so sorry to hear of the fate of Rizana.

I must also stress here about Moulavi M.S.M. Thassim (Gaffoori), Secretary General of the All-Ceylon Jamiyathul Ulama and Mr. Imran Jamaldeen (Gaffoori) of IIRO. Both of them are well versed in the Arabic Language. They were able to speak to the tribal people in their own Arabic language. While they were speaking, those tribal leaders were surprised to know that Rizana was a Muslim. All these days, they were unaware of this fact. Our good Friend, Parliamentarian M.S.M. Thowfeek, representing Rizanas electorate Muttur in the Trincomalee District, also came with us. These two Moulavis quoted from the Holy Quran.

I must mention those Verses in this House.

Surathul BAQARA [2 : 178]

There are two important articles of details of these talks written by these two Moulavis appears in the "Sunday Thinakaran" and "Engal Desam" - fortnightly.

One must understand, as the Minister Hon Dilan Perera told the other day in this House, that Shariah Law is based on Divine Law. That is the Holy Quran. No man can change it. No king or queen can change it. We have to act according to that. It is our President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa who understood it well and wrote a letter to the King asking to show mercy on Rizana. As a result the execution was stopped, but she is still in prison. We took her parents, Mr. Nafeeq and Mrs. Fareena Nafeeq also. When the tribal leaders met them, they could not hold back their tears. The tribal leaders cried. It was really an emotional moment They cried out and said that they will never believe that this girl has committed the crime. She was trying to bottlefeed the child when the child got choked. She was an underaged girl.

After that we met the grandfather of the deceased infant - As-Sheikh Mirdath Fahad Al Otaibi, we went 500 kilometres from Riyadh to Dawadmi to meet the tribal leaders. All the other leaders in the desert assembled there. That is a tribe that comes from the time of the Holy Prophet. There are various tribes in Saudi Arabia.

I must thank Moulavi M.S.M. Thassim Gafoori and Mr. Kingsley Ranawaka, who executed the plan of this mission very well, stopping the execution of the girl. The Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, Mr. Nissanka Wijeratne also came with us. Since the Saudi Arabian rules are rigid, we can only appeal to them. Our learned two Moulavis quoted the Holy Qur-an and appealed. What did they say? They quoted this verse from the Holy Qur-an"

Ya ayyuhallazina amanoo, kuthiba alai kumul kisasu fil qathla, al-hurru bil hurri, wal abdu bil abdi,wal unsa bil unsa, faman ufiya la hoo, min akhikhi. The last sentence of that is, Faththibaun bil ma roof, wadaun Ilaihi, bi-ihsan. That is, show mercy. It is true that God has given you the power. God has told you that he is also merciful. Allah utha-ala Raheem is also merciful. In that context, we asked them, Please, pardon this girl. According to the Sharia Law it has to be done by the parents, not the King. So, we allowed parents of Rizana to remain there at the request of the Tribal leaders.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have to conclude your speech now.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The tribal leaders, according to their ancient system, with their sticks holding aloft said, It is our duty - Hon.

1891 1892

[ ... ]

2011 13

Minister, I want to tell you this - "You please go back home and when the pardon is obtained from the parents, please come again to take the girl home". The grandfather himself said it. I hope the Hon. Minister would also come with us to go there at that time. I must extend special thanks to Mr. Ahmed Jawad, the Ambassador in Saudi Arabia there who did the ground work extremely well, together with his efficient staff, Mr. Alavi Mowlana, his son and the private secretary Mr. Naqeeb Mowlana, Moulavi Zarook who came from our Embassy in Kuwait and various others who joined us in this very well organized delegation. Insha Allah, in the name of Allah I say, we will receive the good news and succeed in our mission. That is the good news I am passing on to you at this moment, Hon. Minister.

UTILIZATION OF FUNDS OF EPF AND ETF TO PURCHASE SHARES ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Presiding Member, I move,

The private sector employees look forward to a safe retirement through the process of contributions made to the EPF, ETF Funds.

The EPF and ETF Funds which are captive funds in the hands of the Government has in the recent past, been used to pursue political activities and as such irrational decisions have led to huge losses to the Fund owners, rather than pursue a role

as a protector of the stakeholders which is expected of the persons appointed to run the Funds.

The EPF and the ETF Funds, Central Bank Reserves and Bank of Ceylon Reserve Capital has been used too irrationally and irresponsibly buy into shares in companies which are not fundamentally strong nor provide a stronger value to the Fund.

On many instances, we have seen the shares being bought at unconscionable prices at the behest of certain businessmen who were instrumental in running the business entities ineffectively and placing the companies in a perilous state. On many occasions, purchases of these shares have turned to be disastrous and led to such funds lose heavily at the expense of the employees who are the most important stakeholders in EPF and ETF Fund etc.

Therefore, will you advise the shares bought by EPF and ETF Funds, Central Bank and Bank of Ceylon separately in the last 20 months and state separately the purchase prices, share holding in the company where the shares were purchased and inform its present market value? "

Sir, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to move the Adjournment Motion at a time when everybody is speaking about the haphazard manner in which the Central Bank reserves, the Bank of Ceylon reserves and the funds of the EPF and ETF are utilized to buy shares. If it is bought at realistic prices, we do not mind. But, it is bought at unrealistic prices and it is reflected in the Stock Exchange with a huge drop in the next couple of days. So, that is the reason why I thought it was timely to move this Motion and get a reply from the Government, which I hope will be factually correct, as the share market bears testimony to the real value of the shares.

, . . captive sources , ?

, . Securities and Exchange Commission . , . . . . . . . Director-General . .

The Securities and Exchange Commission is normally the policing arm of the Stock Exchange and the share holders, which is a supreme body that is non-political and it is the only institution that looks after the share market activities.

Now, during the United National Party time, we saw that people, individually, did not posses the talent to buy shares and sell them at a time, which is opportune. That is the reason why the unit trusts were brought in. You amalgamate small shares into a bigger group and the unit trust comes in and buys these shares and gives the satisfactory methodology to protect the small shareholder. That was the concept that the United National Party brought in. Thereafter, the Colombo Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission were brought in to protect it from international players coming in and trying to take undue advantage and basically create a problem in the Sri Lankan market. But, all that is history. Today, the Chairperson is no more; the Director-General is no more and the Stock Market is crashing. Then, there is a fundamental error. When there is a fundamental error, why is it that people who are involved in captive sources are utilizing such funds to buy those types of shares in a manner, which does not have any rhyme or reason? Let me quote certain things but before that, once again, there seems to be another conflict within the Treasury and the Central Bank.

The Secretary to the Treasury by virtue of the fact that he is holding that post, happens to be an ex officio Member of the Monetary Board. Now, there are three areas that protect the countrys economy. One is, the normal economy, which is protected by the Finance Ministry under the Finance Minister and then, he is reporting to the country. The next one is, the areas of foreign involvement that come in; that is, the stock exchange which has both domestic and international players and then, the third one is, the exchange mechanism, which basically has a demand and supply to the rupee and that reflects the realistic value of the Sri Lankan Rupee.

Now, you have a Monetary Board representative who is the Secretary to the Treasury and up to the date the President came and presented the Budget, he was a member privy to what was going on in the Monetary Board, who was defending the rupee, spending US Dollars 2,000 billion on one hand, and allowing it to be devalued by 3 per cent, on the other. Now, they say that this is a reflection of the regional trend. Owing to the Indian Rupee devaluation it needs to put Sri Lanka in a realistic manner. There is no question. The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, as the former Minister of Finance, will know that that has to be the case. But, remember, we did mention this previously. Just because we are from the Opposition, that does not mean that what we say is wrong. It is absolutely correct and why it was not followed then is the question and the people are feeling its impact today. The Government tried to cushion the cost of living impact through the exports and as a result, the import content was robbed by the Government, protected by the exporters and today the exporters are paying the price, the importers are paying the price and the Government is sitting and doing nothing to eradicate or alleviate the problem that is there on both sides of the fence.

If you have defended the rupee, why did you devalue it? If the devaluation was owing to the fact that the Indian Rupee was devalued, then you have got to devalue it by another 43 per cent. When are you going to do this? Just 3 per cent of devaluation had an impact of Rs. 81 billion on your cost-push into the Governments Budget. But, you say that your projected Budget deficit is 6.2 per cent without realizing that if Rs. 81 billion be added on, the Budget deficit will increase up to 7.3 per cent. Now, what is the answer? Anyway, that is irrespective of the matter.

Now, where is this battle between the Treasury and the Central Bank leading to? Because of that, you are having the Central Bank utilizing these white-collar crimes being allowed to go through without anybody taking the rap for it. Look at the case of Raj Rajaratnam, a person who has committed no sin, was basically punished and sent to jail for 11 years for no crime committed. It has been done on the basis of wiretapping, they say. We all know it. Even the Supreme Court has

1937 1938

now accepted his appeal on the basis that the case is fundamentally wrong as per the view of the jury who sat for that case.

If that is the case, Hon. Minister, who is held responsible for these type of white-collar crimes? Is it the Chairperson? Is it the Director-General or is it the players who are allowed to do this with political lineage that is coming right from the top, channelled through the Central Bankers and doing sweet nothings to ensure that the people do not lose out on this money? It is you and I? At least I am a stakeholder of the EPF. I, being a private sector worker, do contribute to EPF. My money too is being utilized by these captive sources through the Central Bank. There must be a sense of decency to tell us as to how these monies are invested. They say they make 30 - 35 per cent return. If they make such large returns, why was only 9.3 per cent paid to us in the last three years to four years? That is the reason why I thought that it was necessary to move this Adjournment Motion. Owing to this white-collar crimes that are being committed by the higher-ups in the Central Bank, from the Governor downwards, I thought of moving this Adjournment Motion today. They are the ones who say, go for such and such activities. You do not want to worry about the small, puny managers and the consultants who are there. This is like, democracy is closing down. Not only is everything done in a manner detrimental to the macroeconomy of the country but it is done in a manner advantageous to the micro aspects of some of the people who are taking undue advantage of this move.

Look at the ETF. It has Rs. 7.5 billion invested in the Stock Exchange. Today that value has dropped to almost Rs. 4.1 billion.

() ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of International Monetary Co-operation ) Out of what? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Out of Rs. 7.5 billion. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Is that out of the total? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is, the ETF has invested over Rs. 7.5 billion in the Stock Exchange. Today, its market value is only Rs.

3.9 billion. Then, you have the EPF which has Rs. 73 billion invested in the quoted companies and Rs. 5 billion in the non-quoted companies. That is altogether Rs. 78 billion. I am informed - but I may be subject to correction in this - that this value has come down to Rs. 69 billion. That is a loss of Rs. 6 billion. That Rs. 6 billion loss plus Rs. 3.9 billion loss equals a total loss of Rs. 10 billion. For what crime committed by the workers such as us and maybe you who also contributed to this Fund, is this?

Roshen Chanaka in Katunayake lost his life because he was looking at protecting his future through the EPF and the ETF. This Government thought it fit to meddle around with the EPF and the ETF funds. Owing to the fact that these workers jointly got together -

If the Net Asset Value of the group of Laugfs is only Rs. 1,680 million, who is held responsible for this? We need an honest answer for this because these are reflected in the open market. So, you might be defending the Government but you are depending on the real stakeholders who are the workers of this country.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Our perception is totally different. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Okay, Sir.

I will end up with our perception. Our perception is that when the interest rates come down, we must find other ways of increasing the amount we can pay to members of EPF and ETF. To do that, we diversify. We are diversifying largely into blue-chip companies, strong companies and companies which, in our perception, will do better and will be able, in the long run, to get a better return than at the time of investment. It is your opinion now that it is not a good investment. That, only time will tell, my good Friend. So, whether you are right or whether we are right is part of the stock market speculation and stock market activity. Therefore, nothing wrong has been done by the Government; nothing wrong has been done by the Central Bank. We have taken a policy decision. It is not an individual decision; it is a decision of the

Monetary Board to diversify, to use a certain percentage of those trust funds to sponsor and strengthen the growth of local companies, to inject capital into those.

When you think of these investment companies, venture capitals, we see that we do not have enough venture capitalism in Sri Lanka. People are not willing to come and put in money, take a chance and see that those companies grow. You know that very well. We have to have a whole area of venture capitals. So, Sir, what we feel is that we have taken a very legitimate decision, a very serious decision and a decision which will reflect in a better income for those subscribers to EPF and ETF.

Thank you.
