(Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That will be up to the bank to take a decision with regard to any case that is pending. But, first, they must have legal provision. Once we give legal provision after passing this Bill, they will be able to take the decision that they want. My good Friend, obviously if anything is now under consideration, common sense dictates that this law will prevail once it is passed. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Why can you not note it down in the amendment itself? () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) It is stated as Rupees five million. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes, Rupees five million is stated, but what about the pending cases? () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is obvious. I will tell you about something with which you are more familiar. In criminal activities, once the law is there, the law will be applied. But, how can it be applied before the law is there? So, whatever reservations you have, kindly mention that. That is why I said, The Opposition must have its say, the Government must have its way. That is our dictum. You are perfectly free to make all these suggestions. Yesterday, we were very flexible when some of your Members of Parliament made certain suggestions. We said Okay, we will consider it. We may sometimes even change some of our own attitudes. That is normal Parliamentary democracy. But, I can assure you that once this Bill is passed, all the pending cases will also come under the purview of that, in respect of the banks. That is quite

normal. If the banks come under the Ministry of Finance, we will certainly give them that clarification. ( )

( - , ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara - Minister of National Languages and Social Integration) This statement alone is enough. () ( ) (The Hon.

So, what are you doing about those things? Let us not keep the Debate at that level. , . . . . So, be reasonable. they can come again.

[. . 2.17]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity not only to respond to the Hon. Senior Minister, a former Minister of Finance but also to contribute with the knowledge of the United National Party in order to ensure that the borrowers are put in a more safer point, and as to how we can further improve the legislation that you are bringing in, which is not to protect the consumer but the banker.

, , . ( ) () . . , 50 . . , . , , ; . , . ? ; . , ? . 50 . , . Now, what does the Statement of Legal Effect in the Bill say? I quote:

Clause 2: The clause inserts new section 5A in the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act, No. 4

of 1990 ........ the principal sum borrowed is over rupees five million...

It basically stipulates that what you are trying to do through this piece of legislation is to fortify the bank and say, "Without fear you give over Rupees five million and we will ensure that your parate execution is made easy." So, what we are basically saying is, Rupees five million today -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, that is already there in the law.

479 480

2011 06

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I know that. If it is there in the law, as the Hon. John Amaratunga mentioned to you very clearly, why did you not make it Rs. 50 million? What is Rupees five million today. This law was brought in when Mr. N.U. Jayawardena was the Governor of the Central Bank to satisfy his ego in the banking sector, but nobody spoke of the consumer. But, there is a necessity for the person who is lending and the borrower both, to be protected. But, what happens here is, actions of the Government alone defeat the purpose because on one side, you are saying that you are protecting them from parate execution. On the other, you have a 26 per cent inflation two years ago. Now, let us assume a person borrows Rupees five million today. Of course, it is not Rupees five million; it has to be Rupees six million because you say Rupees five million or above. The Government brings in a legislation. This happened to a helicopter company. This happened to a domestic airline company. They brought in Rs. 100 million or Rs. 200 million. Suddenly you said that they cannot fly in Sri Lanka. What happened to those companies? All went bankrupt. Now, if the same thing is utilized in this particular lending aspect also, then the deceitful attitude that has got to be taken is owing to the activities of the Government. Now, what I am basically saying here is, either it has to be increased to Rs. 50 million or index it to the inflation because three years later the purchasing power of Rupees five million reduces and you will be basically looking at Rupees one million or Rupees two million worth of loans.

The former Finance Minister was very arrogant. His generous disposition seems to have been somewhat perturbed today. His arrogance was that the Opposition must have their say and the Government must have their way. So, if that is the case, why do you want to bring this to Parliament? If we are just coming here and going to speak and waste our time here, then why do you want to do this? That sense of arrogance has come from the executive down to Parliament now. The Deputy Minister, Hon. Faiszer Musthapha went to court and appeared on behalf of a client. What is going on? This sense of arrogance must stop somewhere. Who is this Deputy

Minister who has God-given rights?- [Interruption.] Sir, for Gods sake, ask these MPs just to keep their mouths

shut a little. What is this? - [Interruption.] All we have seen is, interruption in this House. This type of nonsense must stop. This sense of arrogance comes from two MPs who went to that side and they are now singing hosannas

for their dinner. [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order?

( ) (Mr. Speaker) What is your point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the Hon. Chief Opposition Whip raised this matter without mentioning the name.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Now, he is referring to the conduct of the Deputy Minister of whom we have no knowledge and you have no knowledge. Therefore, Sir, he is talking nonsense. It must be expunged. I think, Sir, as far as I am informed, Ministers cannot appear - ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . - Chief Opposition Whip - , . [ ] , . . . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . . . ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) . ( ) (The Hon.

481 482

, . . [ ] . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, Hon. Minister, while certainly the Government must have their way to do their job, they must also do what they are saying. What they are saying is, do what I say but do not do what I do. Where is good governance in the Government? You are basically telling that a company or an individual that borrows Rupees five million must ensure that they pay in due time and agree to all the conditions of the bank. But, look at what has basically happened to the Government. Look at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation lost Rs. 18 billion last year. Now, this has an impact on the macroeconomy. Then, look at Mihin Air. They invested Rupees five billion and lost Rs. 4.5 billion. That money is part of the macroeconomy. Then, look at the CEB. I must say that the Hon. Minister of Power and Energy is making a valiant effort to resurrect the CEB from a very professional point of view. I must concede that if there are certain benefits that need to be given, they have to be given. But, what does the Minister say? He says, We have Rs.150 billion long-term loans; we have Rs. 75 million medium-term loans and we are losing Rs. 20 billion a year. Is that a healthy statement? That basically shows that the CEB is bankrupt. If it is bankrupt and if banks are lending to such a Government institution, which is a part of the macroeconomy, where is the good governance that is being implemented? It is the same with the Paddy Marketing Board.

. , . .

I totally agree with you that these laws should not be made for saints but for sinners. But, in doing that, Hon. Minister, you must ensure that it has a commercial sense. Todays Rupees five million in three years time will be worth Rupees one million. So, what we are saying is, when there is a fast inflationary-tendency type of economy, you must ensure that you have a realistic figure. What is this Rupees five million? This is what we are saying as the United National Party on behalf of the minority borrowers who are transacting with the commercial banks. If you look at how many people borrow less than Rupees five million, your statistics will not go beyond 5 per cent of the total lending. So, whom is this law going to help? You are only going to help the bankers to recover the delinquent debts. That fact must be accepted. So, do not think that you are trying to help the consumer in any way. If you want to help the consumer, follow the way we are telling you; ensure that you make the loan Rs. 50 million or Rs. 75 million or link it with the rate of inflation. With the rate of inflation, you will get Rupees five million plus, the next year. In five years time, this Rupees five million will be worth only Rupees one million according to the way the Sri Lanka Freedom Party runs this economy. There was a 26 per cent inflation in the year 2008 and 31 per cent in the year 2007. That would basically mean that the purchasing power has reduced. Therefore, Hon. Minister, what is your answer to this? These are not impracticable, these are easily attainable. But for that, you must have the wherewithal and the courage to think outside the box.

Yesterday, you were very magnanimous in saying that there were very good suggestions that came from the United National Party and as a result you postponed yesterdays vote for today. I hope the same will follow today. You made a big noise saying that the Hon. Leader of the Opposition was making five into fifty. Obviously, you have to add a nought to five to make it fifty and two noughts to make it 500. So, what we are saying is that that zero makes the difference. We are saying this to help the consumer, who is in the small-medium category and is borrowing desperately.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hero from zero.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is right. That is what has happened today. We also have got "zeroes" who are trying to be heroes. The necessary answer will come from those type of persons who come mostly from outstations. You can see how they

483 484

try to distract the little that is there within the fortified area of the commercial structure in the country today. So, Hon. Minister, all I would like to say is this. You know what a mess the world is in and I would love to see that the Government accepts this reality. You need not say, Sri Lankas economy is the best in the world. We are a nation of poverty in an ocean of prosperity but we need to get on to the status of a prosperous nation. That is the phrase that you have been using and I really admire it because it is useful. But, unfortunately it is only a rhetoric today. You are unable to walk the talk owing to the fact that the Government's policy is, look left and turn right. That is the problem. This is where we must ensure that we have a corporate culture that helps build a stronger economy. A stronger economy is necessary to bring in a strong monetary system in this country.

Look at the Budget Speech. The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardenas pet subject is the Budget Speech and he says, Get on to the Budget speech. You say you gave the benefit of the VAT reduction to the consumer in respect of lending. But, what is the bank that has reduced its rate of lending on that basis, Hon. Minister? No bank has done such a thing. They come and just read out the Budget Speech. Last year they gave a 20 per cent benefit on savings but nobody got that benefit. This time they reduced VAT from 20 per cent to 12 per cent on financial services. Tell me one bank that has done that. The profits of the commercial banks are Rupees six billion in the last year and for a quarter of this year, it is projected at Rupees two billion. All these banks are making a profit of Rupees six to eight billion at the expense of the customer. You need a stronger banking system and I would be the happiest to see that because then only, there will be a surplus which can be utilized to lend at a lower rate. But, are the bankers doing that?

Today, the Central Bank says that the inflation rate is at 5.2 per cent. But, what is the lending rate, Hon. Minister? You are lending to blue-chip companies at 16 to 17 per cent. What is the rationale? You have a figure of 5 per cent as inflation and you lend to blue-chip companies at 16 to 17 per cent. So, there is a 12 per cent gap and where does it go? Assuming that the administration cost is 2 per cent and 3 per cent goes for other activities, there is a balance of 11 per cent. A spread of 6 per cent profit is for these banks. I am talking about State-owned banks. Private Banks are much sleeker and leaner in their management that you get a profit of 8 to 9 per cent. So, Hon. Minister, these unconscionable profits should be reduced and that benefit needs to be given to the customer who is borrowing. So, on that basis do not think you have been magnanimous in giving a cover, a safety net, for the borrower which is from zero to Rupees five million because that does not help at all. It is not enough for any businessman today to start a small enterprise or a medium enterprise unless he sells string hoppers or bulath on pavement.

Now, look at the world today. The United Kingdom is slashing Sterling Pounds 180 billion off their State expenditure. Ireland is slashing US Dollars 114 billion, Greece - US Dollars 89 billion, Portugal - US Dollars 121 billion and Spain - US Dollars 117 billion off their State expenditure. I am only mentioning these figures to show that the world is in chaos. So, we do not need to be shameful to say that we have a problem. We must accept that we have a problem, but we are a small part of the titanic movement that is taking place in the world. So, Hon. Minister, be magnanimous. Do not say, "We have our say and you do what you want, but we have our way". We have a say as well as a way because what you are unable to attain today, we will attain tomorrow. But, ensure that the passage is made comfortable.

Hon. Minister, another thing we would like to know is whether the law is retrospective. You said it will be practically retrospective because the bankers will realize that tomorrow's borrower will have a Rupees five million guarantee and today's borrower has no guarantee and as a result, they would think, "Let that benefit come in". That means you are leaving it to the discretion of the banking officer. But, that type of society does not exist. When you go there, if you wear blue colour, you will get one kind

treatment and if you wear green, you will get another or else, you will be transferred to Jaffna or Vavuniya. So, I think you have to be much more clearer .

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, I want to clarify this issue. If this is passed, then that becomes the law with which all the banks must comply; they must submit to that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The question that was put forward by the Hon. John Amaratunga -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Anything that is being discussed now, will be finalized in terms of our decision today. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, laws cannot be retrospective in effect. So, what you could do is, you could convert the loans into todays loans and make it prospective from today. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The Hon. Member wanted to know what was going to happen to the cases which are pending, under discussion. Those will be finalized in terms of the law that we are going to pass.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But, according to this particular Statement on the Legal Effect, it would not happen, because it is prospective. It would be effective immediately after the Speaker gives his assent to this Bill this evening. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, it applies in terms of the final decision because there are a large number of cases which are pending in these banks. Now, they will be able to decide in terms of the Bill that is going to be passed in Parliament today.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) For how many Members of Parliament from the Opposition, have banking loans being utilized as a basis for jumping from this side to that side? These are the cheap-scale political landscape that is there today. So,

what I am saying is to stop these types of things that are going on. Ensure that we head towards a more magnanimous society. That is what we have got to do. What we have got to do for the benefit of the countrys economy is to withstand all vicissitudes. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You may be right. But, that has nothing to do with what we are discussing here. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But, certainly, we are passing a law today. This is Parliament. So, we are debating this Bill today. We have got to talk here what we need to do tomorrow. You cannot talk about these things in the Colombo Municipal Council. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, if you can talk anything under the sun, then what is the purpose of going through all these procedures of bringing a Bill, tabling it and discussing and all that? You are limited as I am limited, to discuss this Bill before the House.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is why I am saying that you are not limited.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) From the beginning of the Parliamentary system, that has been the convention.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is why I am saying that you are not limited.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Your favourite style of oratory is cherry-picking. You take one little thing from somewhere and then present it. Of course, that is up to you. But, today, please confine yourself to what we are discussing here.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , , . Do not think that you are stymied. You have all the powers to accept with generosity and to ensure

489 490

that the lenders are protected up to Rs. 50 million and go forward, because I believe a Rs. 50 million borrower is well beyond the small and medium sector and that he does not need additional precautions. I am telling you one thing - the Governments business policy also affects a borrower. Suppose you start a business today and you bring in a 10 per cent tax, then it affects his cash flow by 10 per cent. If by chance, if it is a company that is having a lot of competition, then it affects his cash flow and in a year or two he may have this problem of parate execution. There is another issue. If you give a loan of Rupees five million, there is no issue. If you give a loan of Rupees six million and pay in one year, then there is no issue. At what point do you do it? You pay interest plus capital. Is it on a loan that is above Rupees five million or is it the principal capital that is left behind?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You must read the Bill. It is very clear.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is not clear. According to the Bill, it excludes the interest. But, here it does not clearly say. When the loan is paid, first the interest component is paid and the capital is left behind.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is very clear.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You and I are talking here, but the banks are utilizing it. We first take the interest and the capital is kept till the end. At the end of the day interest is taken off and the capital component remains.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is precisely why they are precluded from doing that in terms of this law. That is why they brought in this law. Do you want me to read that again? I do not want to take your time. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, I do not need that. But, the problem is that you and I are basically looking at it from a macro picture. But, that is not implemented by a bank officer down there.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You are talking about -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Let it go to the Hansard. Then, at least someone who goes to court will basically say at least there was a Member of Parliament from the Opposition who spoke on behalf of them at that particular moment. So, let it be on record at this particular moment.

Then, the other matter is regarding going into the CRIB. At what point do you send him to the CRIB? Now, today you have not ensured that you protect the CRIB because the CRIB is a very draconian piece of legislation that is there. As soon as a banker finds that he is not able to deal with a borrower, he goes into the CRIB. Now, that is not there with some of the State patronage people. But, the normal man - hoi polloi - who is borrowing is living through the CRIB. So, Hon. Minister, this is another area that you need to rectify because there is no point saying, "Okay, we protect you from zero to Rupees five million on parate execution". You put the same fellow back into the CRIB which is worse than parate execution, because the little he can resurrect himself by getting another loan from another bank is precluded, is prevented owing to the fact that his name is there in the CRIB. So, these are the areas regarding which we said, Do not bring piecemeal legislation". If you are bringing, ensure that you bring in a wholesale approach, that the borrower is protected from this type of thing. That is why I went even further to state that for anybody who borrows more than Rupees 500 million, ensure that his banking secrecy is taken off and he is named if he has been a delinquent payer. Otherwise, ensure that we protect these people and give the comfort factor because at the end of the day you are basically living off that innocent person who is not even 5 per cent of the total lending of those banks.

I will take another classic example of Kabool Lanka (Pvt.) Limited which was having loans to the tune of Rs. 5.5 billion with two banks. One was the HNB and the other was Bank of Ceylon. Rs. 5.5 billion was owed to those banks - one was a State bank and other was a private bank. Then, the Board of Investment through the Minister in charge in 2004, decided to give Kabool Lanka (Pvt.) Limited to a private sector company. What did he do? He sold it at Rupees one billion. The balance Rs. 4.5 billion was left it in the hands of the Government. Now, who is to be held responsible? Is it the Government? Is it the bank? No, the banks were told, You find your own way. The Government seized the asset from the person who was having a loan that was fully covered by their asset and said No, I am sorry, we are taking this asset and we are selling it for Rupees one billion, you take the rest of Rs. 4.5 billion.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Are you talking about the HNB?

491 492

2011 06

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am talking about both HNB and Bank of Ceylon.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Now, they have got their money.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No. they have not. They had to have a haircut of almost about 40 per cent.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) "Haircut" means that both parties agreed? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, the Government seized that asset. They thought that it was better to get a rupee rather than not getting anything. But, if they had the asset in their hands, if they had the collateral in their hands - () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) If the bank is satisfied ,why are you worried? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, that is why I said that if you say that the Opposition must have their say, listen to what we are saying. What I said was that the Bank of Ceylon had Rs. 2.5 billion and HNB had Rs. 2.5 billion. They had a fully secured loan of about Rs. 6 billion. But, when you take the asset away, they have no asset to cover the loan that was there. Then, what are you expected to do? The Government came and forcefully took it off and said You go and get the money from Kabool. Where is it? If they had the asset, they could have sold the asset and got it. The Government did not give the Bank of Ceylon and the HNB their right to collect the money. Now - [Interruption.] () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Why not? That asset was given to MAS Holdings. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It was given to MAS Holdings for Rupees one billion. What happened to the Rs. 4.1 billion that was outstanding through Kabool? That is why I am telling that good

governance is not there in this Government. You are telling us, Do what we say but do not do what we do. We are trying to highlight that type of a government. You think that we, the United National Party, are traitors when we mention this, but those who implement this are nice statesmen.

So, Hon. Minister, all what we are saying is, please be more merciful to the people who borrow less than Rs. 50 million and ensure that this comfort factor is given, so that they can do a decent business borrowing from banks, without a fearful tomorrow that their houses will be robbed by these banks, they will feel that the economies are run down not by the people who have borrowed the money but by the Government owing to certain conditions, maybe within their control or completely outside their control.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you can commence your speech. [. . 3.19] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir. Before I commence my speech, may I request the Minister to make a clarification? I have been handed a copy of the Amendments to be moved at the Committee Stage of the Bill just a moment ago and I find that you are going to move an Amendment on the Interpretation Clause, Section 22, as well. It states, I quote:

22. 'bank' means a licensed commercial bank or a licensed specialised bank within the meaning of the Banking Act, No. 30 of 1988.

As far as I know, parate powers are presently only with licensed commercial banks. This is a far-reaching Amendment. This is an Amendment that goes contrary to your policy of limiting the harsh effects of parate execution. This will extend the applicability of parate execution to banks that hitherto did not have such parate powers. Is that Amendment correct?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That Amendment has been brought in because of the amalgamation of the regional banks. They have to be caught up under that. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I wonder whether there is a sanction of the Hon. Attorney General for this Committee Stage Amendment. Even if that has been mechanically

given, it is still unconstitutional and I wish to draw your attention to a determination of the Supreme Court in respect of this law. During the UNP regime, when this law was sought to be amended with regard to interpretation of the word, "borrower" and "mortgagor"- you might remember - that since there was some doubt as to whether a mortgagor who is not a borrower is also caught up under this Act, whether his property also can be parate executed, there was a determination of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court in that instance commented that this is a draconian piece of legislation; this takes away the judicial power of the people because when there is a dispute between the lender and the borrower, it is the judiciary that must settle that dispute. But, here one party to the contract, namely the bank, by passing a resolution makes up that, determines that issue and therefore, it was unconstitutional. It further went on to state that since the law had anyway been passed in 1990 it will remain a law, nevertheless, its applicability must be narrowed and must not be allowed to affect other categories of persons. I would like to draw your attention that there are two aspects to this : one is the constitutionality. I want to draw the attention of the House that there is already a determination of the Supreme Court that the harsh effects of this Act cannot be made to apply to more sections than it presently applies. So, if that is to have any meaning, this Amendment cannot be moved at the Committee Stage. The second, perhaps is more important to you and that is, you present this Bill on the basis that you are reducing the harshness on certain sectors and then when you, in the Interpretation Section, include the licensed specialized banks also which do not have parate powers now, you are actually extending the applicability of the extraordinary draconian parate powers that the banks have to a section of the banks which are perhaps, not even able to exercise those powers. Because specialized banks, as you know, are savings, investment and development banks. They do not indulge in day-to-day commercial banking activities and it is a dangerous thing to invest specialized banks with such extraordinary parate powers. So, I urge the Hon. Minister, before the Committee Stage, to reconsider bringing that Amendment.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer to take the Chair? () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I propose that the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

501 502

, ... .

, , ... . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER took the Chair.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Sumanthiran, please continue with your speech. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Presiding Member, I was drawing the attention of the House to the stated policy of the Government in bringing this law and I wish to speak a little bit on the background to this law. It is conceded now by almost everybody that this is a draconian piece of legislation. As I said, as the Supreme Court has already observed, one party to the contract decides whether there is a default or not. There is no independent third party, which makes that judicial pronouncement. This has caused immense hardship to a lot of people. It has gone against the grain of our ordinary law which says, in execution of a money decree, you cannot take one dwelling house, your wearing apparel, one bed, your books, the tools of your trade and so on. Those are time-tested safeguards that are being allowed so that a person is not left without the wherewithal, not left without means. Even if everything else is taken, he has a roof above himself, a bed to sleep on, clothes to wear and kitchen utensils and tools of his trade. Now, under this law - () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, may I disturb you for a minute? That, exactly, is the intention of this law. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Exactly. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) There was this wider net and now we are going to reduce that. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is what you said. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) So, that is in keeping with what you want us to do.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Exactly. I congratulate you, Hon. Minister, for bringing this law, but what I am trying to say is that this law, in its entirety, is a misnomer, is draconian. So, why is the Government not repealing the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act, No. 4 of 1990? So many speeches are made by Hon. Ministers in this House on how this was brought about. I agree entirely; I am in total agreement with the sentiments of the Government with regard to this law. This law should not remain in our statute books because not only has it caused immense hardship to the borrowers, but it has also caused hardship to banks. It has caused hardship to banks because they have got used to a system of lending on security. They do not examine the viability of the repayment; they merely lend on security. They are comfortable if the amount lent is secure with the property that is mortgaged.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) When the original legislation was brought in by the UNP, your party supported it.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That may be so. But, there is always a change of mind. Today, the UNP is also saying, This is draconian. Why do you limit it to Rupees five million? Increase the limit to Rs. 50 million.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I think these have always come in when you were in the Opposition. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We have always been in the Opposition.

What I am saying is that with the experience of how this law has operated, one comes to realize that not just the borrowers - that is the point I am making - but also the banks have been facing hardships. At one point, the banks of this country were the largest real estate owners and they did not know what to do with it. They went on parate executing everything in sight and they cannot use that because there are persons resident in those houses and there are tenants. All kinds of other issues arose with this law not being addressed.

This extraordinary power was there with the Bank of Ceylon, the Peoples Bank and the National Savings Bank even prior to 1990, but they very rarely used it or almost never used it. But, once the private banks got this power and started using parate execution as a means of

503 504

2011 06

recovery, even the State banks joined in that carnival and started parate executing. That afflicted the State banks also.

So, it is time now to change it. It is good that you have taken one step. I am not saying that the step you have taken is in the wrong direction; I am saying that it is in the right direction, but all what I am saying is, it is not sufficient. If, as you say, this law is not good - I agree entirely - it cannot stand on principle and on practice. It is an illogical piece of legislation that our statute books have. Then, the most logical thing to do is to repeal that law. The limit of Rupees five million is also unrealistic knowing the practice of bankers. When there are a few defaults, they call the borrower for discussions and reschedule that loan. Rescheduling the loan is the term used. So, even if you have borrowed only Rupees four million, at the time of rescheduling, with the interest it becomes Rupees seven million, which becomes the borrowed sum. The borrower is asked to sign a fresh mortgage, giving the borrowed sum as Rupees seven million. This Clause that is coming in limiting it to Rupees five million does not address that. It still leaves room for an interpretation because it does not say that the original sum borrowed is under Rupees five million. I think it should say that the original sum borrowed is under whatever the sum. I think Rupees five million is far too low but whatever limit you place, you must say that the original sum is below that amount. Otherwise, by this process, by calling the customer for negotiations and throwing a few sweets in his direction and saying, "We will reduce the interest rate", you reschedule it. Then after that, the borrowed sum is deemed to be, according to what the borrower will sign, the capital sum plus a portion of the interest and they will make it jump above this limit you have prescribed.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I specifically stated that the interest and so on will be taken away and only the capital will be the requisite amount.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I understand you have said that interest is out. But, in interpreting that section, all that I am saying is, if in the meantime there has been a reschedulement, the reschedulement will say, the principal sum is what is stated now; not what was originally borrowed. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara ) But, that is what is stated in the law.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, no. The law only says, the borrowed sum without the interest. I understand that. I am drawing your attention to the fact that at the point of rescheduling, the borrowed sum becomes - [Interruption.] That problem is there. It can become a new sum. That problem is there because the borrower had signed - [Interruption.] No, all that I am asking is, clarify it, limit it to the original borrowed sum, so that we do not run into this problem, because all the time -[Interruption.] Well, that may be the intention but when it goes for interpretation somewhere else, it might be different. We cannot use Parliamentary speeches for interpretation. So, the Statement of Legal Effect does not say that and that can be used. So, that has to be clarified.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) How do you clarify it?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If you say, original borrowed sum -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, it is not there.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) The Central Bank which is the supervising bank will clarify it, if necessary.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Why not? ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) How can you clarify that from the Central Bank? You have to go to the Supreme Court for that. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) No, no. It is the supervising bank. If you want a clarification - [Interruption.] If you want to go to litigation, that is a different matter. The Central Bank can always give directions. - [Interruption.] Why do you not understand the role of the Central Bank?

505 506

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, no. The Central Bank can have a role, but that role never extends to interpreting a law. The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, being an Attorney-at-Law himself and senior, knows that very well. The Central Bank can give directions to the banks. [Interruption.] I understand what you are saying. The Central Bank can give directions to the banks but they cannot interpret the law. You do not know who the officials of the Central Bank will be tomorrow. Mr. N.U. Jayawardene who brought this law, whom all of you are crucifying today - and I too join with you gladly on that - was once the Governor of the Central Bank. You do not know who will occupy that seat in the Central Bank. [Interruption.] So, why do you not make it clear in the law itself, if that is your intention?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is called a non sequitur, because he was the Governor long ago. Then, various things intervened and now you are attributing more to Mr. N.U. Jayawardene that at a certain point of time - [Interruption.] I mean, surely you are a better logician than that. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, I am only trying to be helpful. The point that I am making is, why do you want to leave anything for doubt? Clarify it, if that is your intention. I am fully with you that that must be your intention; that must be the law. I am fully with you. I am only saying, clarify it, so that there can be no doubt whatsoever in anybodys mind.

Moving on to small borrowers, it is a good thing, as I said, if this is in the right direction, because you are taking care of persons who have borrowed small sums of money. Now, there are categories of persons that I am aware of, who borrowed small loans, who would now be afflicted by this parate execution. But, there are people, particularly in the North and the East and also in the South who were affected by tsunami, I know special measures were taken by certain banks on that, but subsequent to the tsunami also, monies have been borrowed, so that they rebuild their lives. Those may be small sums. Originally in your draft Bill, before the Committee Stage amendment came, your Clause 2.5A. (2) stated: I quote:

Notwithstanding the provisions of section 16 to section 31 of the Bank of Ceylon Ordinance...... no action shall be initiated under

any such law for the recovery of any loan where the amount of the loan is less than rupees five million, ....

I thought you were granting a reprieve in toto for those who have borrowed under Rupees five million. No action there shall be taken under any such law, means that you cannot even file action in court for the recovery of those monies, leave aside parate execution.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you may use another one minute. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay, thank you.

But, now you have sought to replace it with another formulation. That says that Section 5A will apply to all banks that have an Incorporation Order so that it will not apply and it will only apply to parate execution and not to any other mode of recovery.

Now, my appeal to you, Hon. Minister, is to think of the persons who are unable to repay, leave aside parate. But, I am talking about writing-off certain persons loans; certain persons who have suffered calamities - natural and otherwise - and we know that our country is recovering from several of those calamities. I am asking you with respect, to look at the circumstances of those persons as well, apart from those who have borrowed below Rupees five million not been afflicted by parate and consider a total waiver, a total write-off of the loans taken by such persons. Initiate a mechanism and waive off the loans taken by such persons. Let me wind up since my time is up, urging you once again to take steps to repeal this law in its entirety.

Thank you.

[. . 3.39] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity to speak on this Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Bill. I am standing here after having seen this morning and yesterday three of my friends who have become victims of this parate execution law which my Colleague, the Hon. Sumanthiran, described as a draconian piece of legislation. Two of them had to sell their residential properties to settle their loans to their banks, who were not very co-operative in the recovery, because they should allow these people to survive while they recover the loans. Two of these persons I speak about are garment exporters. With the winding up of the Multi-Fibre Agreement and the recent doing away with the GSP Plus concession that we enjoyed, these garment factories

507 508

2011 06

became unviable and those owners ran into large defaulted loans and they had to sell their homes to settle the outstanding amounts to the banks because under parate execution, their homes are to be auctioned.

Sir, today, the banks are acting in a very heartless manner though some of them call themselves banks with hearts and partners in progress. They are the people who have acted without a heart and who were there when you progressed and now care only for their own progress. The Government, two years ago summoned all the banks and told them to reduce the lending rates. The Banks could not do anything but to abide by the decision of the Government. That is very good. You thought by reducing the rate of interest, you would give a boost to the economy because then they would lend and the economy would flourish. That is a good idea. But, what happened? The businesses that were competing internationally, where the interest rates in other countries were single digit and the interest rates for borrowers in Sri Lanka were even above 20 per cent. The banks quickly reduced the rates paid to depositors down to 6 per cent and the Savings Accounts were paid only 4 per cent but the lending rates were reduced, even to prime customers, to 15 per cent and to other customers to 18 per cent. Whenever they borrowed at 18 per cent, they lent at 24 per cent, a 6 per cent gap.

Today, the average interest on savings and fixed deposits put together is in the region of 6 per cent. But, the banks are lending to prime customers at 15 per cent with a markup of 9 per cent. Usually, the banks are allowed to charge a higher interest on their loans because they borrow and they have to add the service charges for lending that money to the borrowers. That is fair. In all other countries the markup is in the region of 1 to 3 per cent. Even in the developing countries, it is in the region of 3 per cent and in the developed countries, it is in the region of 1 per cent. But, in Sri Lanka, the markup is 9 per cent. The banks are making exorbitant profits. As my Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake stated here, the banks are making profits in the region of Rs. 6 to 10 billion. Even the private banks are making exorbitant profits. How is this happening? As I said, the markup is so high and then the charges on banking transactions are also very high. Except the Peoples Bank and the Bank of Ceylon, the private banks are charging very high rates for every single transaction that is giving them the necessary funds to pay their recurrent expenditure, which they are supposed to earn in the gap between the borrowing rate and the lending rate. But, they make all their money for providing the services through the service charges and then also have a 9 per cent markup on the borrowed money. So, this is very unfortunate. Are we trying to make a few people who are running these banks rich or are we trying to make this economy flourish? You must help the small businessmen,the middle-level businessmen, and the large entrepreneurs also have to be sustained if the economy is to flourish. Are we giving them that extra strength or are we helping a few people who are running

these large banks, which declared 10 years ago profits in the region of Rs. 200 million and today reaping profits of Rs. 6 to10 billion? We have to look at this. The amount that the banks today are lending to the industry, to the business sector and to the trade is very little. They are running behind secure lending methods. Banks are today competing with each other for pawning, the most secure way of lending money. Pawning has become a very popular arm of business for most of the banks and even for finance companies, because the asset is in the hands of the bank while the money has been lent out and by auctioning the asset that you hold, you can recover the money lent. What is the other line of business that the banks are expanding into? It is leasing, leasing of equipment and vehicles, mostly vehicles, and why do they get into this business? Again, it is a very secure means of lending, because if somebody defaults, it is very easy to recover the money by seizing the vehicle or seizing the asset. So, this is not proper banking. Banks are supposed to lend to projects based on their viability and their contribution to the economy. This is not happening today and it is a very sad state of affairs. The Government has to insist the banks to contribute to the economy by increasing their exposure to industry, business and to trade.

The Hon. Minister would have noted at the Public Accounts Committee yesterday, that we are unable to lend to chief foreign-funded or foreign-backed projects through our banking system. Why are the banks failing? They are supposed to encourage and enthuse industrialists to come and invest. That is the only way to create more jobs, more production and to increase the Gross Domestic Product. Are they doing that? It is a very negative approach that the banks in this country are taking today. As soon as a customer defaults, they withdraw the umbrella. Some of these banks at New Year time give umbrellas to their customers. These banks are sunshine banks. As long as a company is doing well, they lend an umbrella to protect from the sunshine and as soon as it gets into a problem -[Interruption.] But, why do they call themselves as banks with hearts; why do they call themselves, partners in progress? It is their progress. Is it the progress of the nation, is it the progress of our entrepreneurs that they are concerned about?

Today the garment industry is having a problem. Do you not think that they have a duty to stand by themselves to overcome the difficulties? Today we have an advantage. But, are they making use of that advantage? Bangladesh is failing and their business is moving into Sri Lanka. Sir, there are industries under the BOI who have been asked to pay new levies. The BOI charges a ground rent for the land that has been given to garment factories, which is in the region of Rs. 150,000 a year. This is in addition to the service charges paid by the BOI entrepreneurs. Recently, they have gone and revalued those lands and imposed ground rents in the region of Rs. 10 to 15 million to be paid upfront and the

509 510

operations of the entrepreneurs who did not pay up have been stopped by the BOI. Is it going to help? Today, when there is new business, these industrialists who were struggling can start up again but the BOI is strangling them. Why? This attitude has to change. Otherwise we will not be able to sustain our industries. We talk proudly about foreign banks operating in Sri Lanka. Take the top two foreign banks operating in Sri Lanka, HSBC and the Standard Chartered Bank. What are they doing? They are involved in personal banking only. If you have a job, if you have a big salary, they will give you a personal loan. Other than that, they are only involved in servicing large corporate banks, corporate companies and corporate entities. Why is this? If the foreign banks are to operate here and if they are going to operate only in the region of personal banking, what is their role? The personal banking needs of this country can be met by our local banks. If these foreign banks are operating here, they have a duty to support our economy. They are involved only in syndicating loans for the Government, for setting up hedging contracts and similar operations and not interested in supporting or building our economy, our industry or our trade.

Finally, Hon. Minister, you are definitely taking a positive step. As the Hon. Sumanthiran said, a draconian piece of legislation that should not exist is being eased. You are taking a step forward. The UNP is only asking that you take a longer step than the steps that you have already taken. - [Interruption.] You have the authority to do that but the Government should think that way and the Hon. Minister also kept on talking about the late President, Mr. D.B. Wijetunga who was the Minister of Finance, Prime Minister and the President. When he was holding all of these positions you were with us, Hon. Minister. I would like to remind you that.

Thank you.

[. . 4.11] ( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am glad that today we are debating the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Bill. When this Bill

was first introduced to this House as far back in 1990, and passed as Act, No. 4 of 1990, there was a lot of criticism about it.

For that, there was a background. The concept of ownership of immovable property was considered as sacred by our legal system. The law relating to immovable property is governed by the Roman Dutch Law. Since our country had been a part of their colony for a long period during the Dutch era, the Roman Dutch Law has become our property law. In addition to that, we know that there are several special laws like the Islamic Law, the Thesawalamai Law, and then the Kandyan Law, but the majority of the properties are governed by the Roman Dutch Law.

When we talk about the concept of title of ownership, there are three factors which should be fulfilled to have a title to a property. As they had been described and interpreted under the Roman Dutch Law, they are called jus utendi", "jus fruendi" and "jus abutendi. Jus utendi means that if a person is the owner of an immovable property, he has the right to hold the title. Jus fruendi means that he has the right to possess the property. Jus abutendi means that he has the right to dispose of or transfer the property to a third party. If only those three factors are complied with, one gets the title to an immovable property and that was considered as sacred. There were so many local traditions and one was that the title of an immovable property should not go out of the family circle and therefore, it was ingrained in our legal system as another legal theory called "Fidei Commissa Law". By fidei commissa, it is basically meant that if a property is owned by a particular person or a particular family, that person or family had a right to protect the legal entitlement of the property and pass it on to people from the same pedigree or the same generation. But, that was considered, of course, by the developing world as an obstacle for the economic development of the country and therefore, in May, 1973 during the period of the late Prime Minister Hon. (Mrs.) Sirima Bandaranaike, the Fidei Commissa Law was abolished and the person who gets the title became the absolute owner of the property without any obstacle or hindrance. Therefore, he got the absolute right and absolute ownership to mortgage the property to a bank, to keep it as a security and get some financial facility, maybe for the purpose of the development of the property or advancing his industry or business. While that legal position remained in our country, when that Bill was passed in 1990 during the late President Ranasinghe Premadasas period, people defined that law as a draconian piece of law. I think we cannot blame them because taking into consideration this noble concept which had been ingrained in the legal system, I myself realized that that was definitely a draconian piece of law.

But, at the same time, we have to concede that this privilege had been extended to the State banks even prior to the introduction of Act, No. 4 of 1990. When the

517 518

Peoples Bank Act, the Bank of Ceylon Act, the State Mortgage Bank Act and the National Savings Bank Act were passed by the Legislature, these particular provisions had been inserted into the law and therefore, parate execution was in existence in our legal system. But, we must not forget the fact that it is very hard to find instances where banks had exercised the parate execution right. But, in the 1990s, I can recall, in fact after the open economy was introduced in our country and when private banks were permitted to conduct their business in this country, there was a big demand, a serious demand or, we can say, a pressure towards the Government by the private sector bankers that the same rights should be extended to the private sector banks also. That is the history of this law.

But, now we will have to consider how this law had been functioning during the last two decades in this country. Of course, I myself started my career as a banker. That was almost 32 years ago. Thereafter, when I was the Minister in charge of the State banks in the present Government under His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, we were discussing even during that period - that was in early January to February, 2006 - about some changes and amendments to this Act. Even at that time, His Excellency was agreeable to make the ceiling Rupees five million whereas the existing law says it is Rs. 500,000. We appreciate the move made by the Government even at this belated stage, after five or six years. There is some positive step you have taken, which we really admire. But, the problem is, in 1990, Rs. 500,000 was a big sum; it was a huge amount. But in todays context, Rupees five million is not that big an amount. If you take the value of half a perch of land in the Colombo Municipal Council area, I think it is above Rupees four or five million. Therefore, we, being in the Opposition, propose to the Government to move further and make it Rs. 50 million. We are not saying it just to have an argument with the Government, but we are making this suggestion with good reasons.

During the last couple of decades, especially during last two decades, we have seen banks reflecting or showing their profits as they have made them double or treble. Some banks said that they exceeded Rupees three billion, Rupees four billion or Rupees five billion. That is good. But, you must not forget the fact that the mere earning of big profits by the commercial banks in this country does not mean that there is a significant contribution to the development of our economy and the upliftment of the social standards because our commercial banking system is basically confined to a traditional type of banking transaction, where they are doing the job of a money-lender. The only difference is, they have been recognized by the Monetary Board, registered and a licence issued by the Government, and instead of the standard of the kalukada mudalali, a professionalism is there with the banks. So, what I respectfully suggest is

this. To get a mere profit, I know when the bank gives a loan, there has to be some security. For that purpose, they have to keep some valuable security. The banks are especially keen to keep immovable properties because the price or value of such properties is stable. It is not an issue; it is part of the banking system anywhere in the world.

But, you will have to take into consideration that all these banks, State or private, are existing because of the energy, the courage and the activities of the small and medium-scale businessmen, entrepreneurs and industrialists. There is no doubt that there are multi-national companies, companies which are doing business in billions. The banks are getting a profit out of them doing business with them. It is not an issue, but the majority of the profit they get, if you take it percentagewise, I think about 70 to 80 per cent, is from the small and medium-scale industrialists, traders and entrepreneurs. We concede that there was a turbulent period with the bloody war we had for over three decades. So, everybody had to suffer and the business community also suffered immensely. While having to face those kinds of issues, we have to consider and concede that they were struggling to exist with the greatest difficulty because of the tax system in our country and with their burden to pay EPF, ETF and so many other charges, especially the banking interest rates. Those have always been double-digit rates. The Minister, Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara knows that those have always been double-digit rates during the last 15 to 20 years. Therefore, if you take into consideration the tax liabilities, not only businessmen but even we being professionals, have been taxed in different ways. We have to pay a 12 per cent VAT and if we have reached a particular slab in our income, we have to pay 30 to 35 per cent VAT. Then, we have to pay a 3 per cent Nation Building Tax. In addition to that, there is a Withholding Tax which is retained in the Inland Revenue Department and the Department has not been in a position to repay the Withholding Tax during the last so many years. Therefore, businessmen have got into trouble because liquidity problems have arisen. Taking into consideration the tax liability, which exceeds 40 to 50 per cent of their income, if you have to get a loan from a bank and if the interest rate is something above 15 or 20 or 25 per cent, then how much of profit margin do you have to earn to pay all those things? It is a Herculean task. Unless there is a profit margin of 50 to 60 per cent, you cannot settle all these liabilities. Therefore, people who take loans from banks, especially within the range of Rupees five million to Rs.40 million, are not big businessmen and are not members of the big business community. They belong to the category of small and medium-scale businessmen. Therefore, if you extend that right for them also to enjoy, as we suggested, up to a limit of Rs. 50 million, I think the Government is not going to lose. Actually, the Government will gain. Unless the small and medium-scale business community entrepreneurs do get involved heavily in their business activities, the revenue

519 520

[ ]

2011 06

of the Government earned by way of taxes, whatever the nature of them, will be minimized. But, if there is some kind of encouragement for them, they will do more and more business. That means, the Government revenue will go up. That is why we suggested that the Government must be flexible on this issue. This is not an argument or a debate between the Government and the Opposition. Both parties are trying to do the best for the people, for the country and for the economy. Therefore, do not take it as a privilege issue and do not think that we are prophets of doom. We are trying to build the nation, to help the Government to fulfil the aspirations of our people in this country. So, we all are here for one purpose. You may represent various political parties but the target of all 225 Members who are gathered here as peoples Representatives in this august Assembly is the same. That is why we came out with an alternative suggestion.

Also, at the same time I would like to remind you that there are a lot of lapses in our financial administration, especially on the part of the Central Bank and Monetary Board. The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara suggested that the Central Bank can issue various directions and circulars. I concede that all the circulars and directives must be within the scope of the Monetary Law. Therefore, this particular Bill, Recovery of Loans by the Banks (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, is not caught up within that definition. Therefore, once this Bill is passed in this House, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank has no right to give any direction or to pass any circular to adopt a particular method. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) If the meaning is not sufficient, the Central Bank is there to clarify it - not the interpretation of it.

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) I fully understand the Hon. Ministers position. But, what I submit is that the powers of the Central Bank to do a clarification under this particular Act is not possible for the reason that any such clarification will not be accepted by a court of law. Once this law is passed by this House, the power to interpret the law is vested only within the judiciary. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) But, if the banks want a clarification, that is what I said.

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Minister, I understand your attempt. I appreciate it. But, the way this has been drafted in the Bill, I do not think anybody can do it other than the court. That is why

we say that this could have been clarified by this House itself, because we are the people who are going to make the laws. We are the legislators. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) This is not the rescheduled capital. It is the capital that was given at the outset.

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Minister, that I know. I think it was said by the Hon. Sumanthiran also. Now, there is a definition already given in Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Bill Clause 5A, which states, I quote:

Provided however, at the time of default when calculating the amount due, and owing to the Bank on the loan granted to such defaulter, the interest accrued on such loans and any penalty imposed thereon shall not be taken into consideration.

That is right. But, the problem is, the practice in the banking sector is always to go for rescheduling. This question arises - [Interruption.] That is right. That is because there are no banks in this country that have fixed the amounts when they reschedule, leaving out the accrued interest and penal interest. They are always calculated as a part of the capital. That is the problem that we wanted to draw your attention to. You can look into that matter and if further clarification or further amendments are required, I think this House can consider them.

I want to bring to the notice of the Hon. Members of this House another serious issue. This parate execution system had been misused and abused by so many banks. That is being done by the State banks; that is being done by the private banks and sometimes even the management level in the hierarchy are unaware of this. They are not aware as to how these kinds of frauds are taking place. Therefore, Hon. Vasudeva Nanyakkara, I specifically draw your attention and request you to take this issue very seriously. This fraud is being committed under the guise of parate execution. This fraud is being committed by the State banks, and this is being done by the private banks. I do not say that this has been done with the blessings or the knowledge of their Chairmen or the Board of Directors, or even, sometimes with the higher management level. How it happens is, if you go through this Bill there is one section which says, while you are going through the parate execution, if there are no bidders, you do the advertising, you do the publicity, and with all that if there are no bidders, then you will have to fix an Upset price. What is the Upset price? The Upset price is decided by the bank. I know that in Colombo, through my professional experience, I have come across so many instances where the value of the property is over Rs. 500 million but if there are no

bidders at the auction, they buy it for the Upset price. What is the Upset price? That is, Rs. 1000. They buy the property in the name of the bank, then the Certificate of Sale is issued. There are judgments by the Supreme Court. When the Certificate of Sale is issued, it cannot be challenged, it is final and conclusive. Then, what will happen is, assume for an example, that the value of the property is Rs. 500 million and if the liability to the bank is Rs. 50 million, they sell it to someone for Rs. 51 million or Rs. 52 million in a couple of weeks time. The person who buys that property maybe sometimes the brother-in-law of the Bank Manager or a relative of the Regional Manager. I can give you a hundred odd instances where this fraud had been committed by State banks as well as by private banks, but I am not going to name any bank in my speech in this House because that will have a bad impact on our banking system. I do not want to do that kind of damage to the banking system. We will have to protect it. If the liability is only Rs. 50 million, the property is sold the following day for Rs. 51 million or Rs. 55 million and again a few days later, the same property is sold for Rs. 200 million. Then, they get the margin distributed among the people who got involved. The latest trend now, Hon. Minister, is that when there is a public auction fixed under the parate execution, as per this particular law, sometimes they themselves manipulate the people to create a havoc in the scene and then they cannot proceed with the sale. When they fail to proceed with the sale, the bank buys it for the Upset price and then they get together with the people who got involved and make big money. -[Interruption.] That is right. This is a serious crime.

Therefore, I urge the Hon. Prime Minister to evaluate or reconsider Section 11 of this particular Act because it high time to give a definition for the Upset price. At least it must be defined. There is a requirement that before you go for an auction you need to get a valuation report from a recognized valuer. Unless you make an interpretation to this particular Section, the meaning of the Upset price is taken as the price that has been mentioned in the valuation report taken by the bank. Therefore, the whole purpose of this Act will become nullified unless you put it into the proper track by getting the people to have justice, because this has become a serious threat to the private sector, especially to the small and medium business entrepreneurs.

I have got some information in this regard but I will not mention the names. When some of the banks came to know that we are going to increase the ceiling from Rs. 500,000 to Rupees five million, some instructions have been given to bank managers to discourage it. I will not mention the names because it is not good for the system. I know my responsibility. I speak with a sense of responsibility towards the nation. Some instructions have been given to discourage the people who are getting loans below Rupees five million because unless it is Rupees

five million, they cannot go for parate execution. This is something very dangerous. We say that it is a draconian law, in one way. But, if that kind of a scenario can happen in our banking system, that would be the most draconian system in the country. We know that the Government is doing it genuinely. - [Interruption.] Yes. I am thankful to the Hon. Minister. I know that the Government has done this in good faith. But, the banks are going to manipulate the people. That is why at the beginning I said, that just because one bank could show that their profit was Rupees five billion or Rs. 10 billion, that does not mean that they have helped our economy.

I can remember when I was in London three years or four years ago, it appeared in the front page of one of the newspapers there, that one of their famous commercial banks had earned an unprecedented profit margin. In the normal context, people like us would have been happy to hear such a thing being the customers of the bank, thinking that our bank had earned so much of profits. But, the people of that country were not so immature. The following day something happened. I was also astonished to see it. People were on the roads with placards shouting that the bank had made so much of profits at the cost of their money. Therefore, there should be a reasonable margin when earning profits out of customers money. The people in that country protested against that. Finally the financial authorities of the country got involved. Then, the bank was compelled to reduce their rate of interest. That was what happened. Therefore, it has to be balanced. Getting money through parate execution, by squeezing the necks of the business entrepreneurs and showing that the profit is Rs. 10 billion does not help the country. It has to be balanced. It is the duty of the Government to take into consideration that there is some deterioration of confidence and trust in the banking system. If the people had the fullest trust and confidence in our commercial banks, they would never have gone and deposited the money in Sakvithi; they would never have gone and deposited the money in the Golden Key and also in Daduwam Mudalali. Now, consider the attitude of the people of this country. Some people who have gone and deposited the money in Sakvithi, Daduwam Mudalali and the Golden Key have thought that they are better professionals than the Bank of Ceylon, the Peoples Bank and the Commercial Bank. Otherwise, how can they go there? It is because the banks have failed to establish the trust and confidence that they are rendering their best.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Sir, can I get another five minutes?

523 524

[ ]

2011 06

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, I will give him two minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Sir, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we have considered these issues previously. I would like to read a comment that we have made in the COPE Report that I presented on the 12th of January, 2007. Page 5 of that Report states, I quote :

It was pointed out that the CBSL, has not taken adequate steps against the finance companies functioning in the illegal manner

without obtaining the proper approval from the Monetary Board. Frequent publication of notices in news papers indicating

the illegal functioning of the finance companies are most unhealthy practice which could cause an immense effect adversely to

the economy of the country. The Governor undertook to take the remedial measures within the period of two months."

That undertaking had been given by the Governor of the Central Bank to the COPE, which had been subsequently adopted as a report of the whole House on the 1st of December, 2006. He wanted only a two-months period to take remedial steps. What were the remedial steps that had been suggested? That was either to repay the deposits to the depositors and to wind up the companies or to make those companies regularized and to have proper control over the Monetary Board of Sri Lanka. But, did he do that? His undertaking was given on the 1st of December, 2006. Then Sakvithi collapsed in August, 2008. For a period of almost 18 months, what did he do? What did the Monetary Board do? After that, there was a line of collapsing financial companies such as Daduwam Mudalali, the Golden Key et cetera. Then, the report which had been adopted by the whole House had pointed out that it was the duty of the Central Bank either to regularize or to have some kind of remedial measures to avoid any catastrophic situation the depositors had to face. But, by giving the undertaking to this House, the Monetary Board of Sri Lanka had failed to do it. They had not done their duty to over 9,000 depositors of the Golden Key and including other collapsed companies; I think it is over 20,000. They are in a real tormenting situation. That is due to whose fault? It is due to the fault of the Monetary Board. That is why I suggest that the Government initiates some more progressive steps where we are willing to contribute and help as Members of this House, irrespective of party politics. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Therefore, finally I request you to consider having a further amendment to increase the ceiling. If you cannot go up to Rs. 50 million, at least, please go up to Rs. 40 or Rs. 30 million.

Thank you, very much.

( - , ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Deputy Minister of Technology and Research ) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, firstly, I am thankful for being given me this opportunity of speaking on the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Bill.

The original Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act, No. 4 of 1990, I would say, is a draconian piece of legislation where one could lose ones property overnight without the banks having to go to recourse of court. As the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe pointed out, as practitioners, we always find some loophole in getting an enjoining order and dragging it for sometime to give a breathing space, because if the bank institutes a court action, it would take 4 to 6 years or more, which would give an opportunity to a breather. Therefore, we see that people are losing their property or their residential home overnight. Under the Civil Procedure Code and the General Law, you cannot get a writ against your residential house. But here, since you have entered into a mortgage bond, that right is vested and therefore we would not see one losing his property overnight. But, you could see how the banks have conducted themselves. When a small man defaults, the bank is more stringent but the big entrepreneurs are getting massive discounts on loans taken by them. So, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his Government, which is a Government of the common man, decided to bring this amendment where one cannot go by way of parate execution on a bond which is less than Rupees five million and I think that is the right way forward. We see the Opposition debating that it should be Rs. 50 million but let us safeguard the poor man first.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) You can repeal it. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Repeal what? - [Interruption.] There is no need to repeal. Commerce has to continue and the banks also

525 526

have to recover especially when you consider big enterprises. If you repeal this Act, you will see massive defaulters getting away over a period of time.

I would also at this point of time like to state in this House that the Hon. John Amaratunga and the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake mentioned that I, as a Deputy Minister, had appeared in a case in court. I appeared with responsibility. I appeared for the UPFA and its General Secretary. We had to take disciplinary action against one of our members and he sought an enjoining order against us. Today, the court refused the enjoining order. I clearly state in this House that it is within my legal rights to appear as an Attorney-at-Law in courts though I am a Deputy Minister and there is no wrongdoing on my part. Therefore, I would like to say that the allegation against me is sour grapes.

The UPFA had taken action, went to court, tried to get an enjoining order and the court held that there was no basis and then I appeared. So, this is to throw mud at me because I appeared for the UPFA and its General Secretary. The allegation is that I, as a Deputy Minister, cannot appear in court. There has been precedence in this House where people holding political offices have appeared in courts. Therefore, I respectfully state that I will never act in a manner contrary to which a Member of Parliament has to act and I always act in keeping and maintaining the dignity of this House. Therefore, I would like to state again that there has been precedence and this mud-slinging exercise against Members of Parliament should stop.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Member, can I interrupt you for a moment? ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Yes ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) It is a decided case. I will get the details and give you later. A Member of Parliament holding an executive position cannot appear in a court of law on behalf of a client. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. John Amaratunga, I am a Deputy Minister. A Cabinet Minister holds executive power. A Deputy Minister whose powers have been gazetted holds executive power. A Deputy Minister holds executive power when he acts as an acting Minister or when powers have been specifically gazetted for him. You

have your view and I will have my view. Let the Speaker of this House give a Ruling and I very clearly state that this is sour grapes. This is an action with malice because I appeared for the UPFA and its General Secretary and this mud-slinging exercise is politically motivated against me.

Thank you. [. . 4.48]

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) He is not here. But, may I -

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) No, you cannot. It should be moved by the Member who gave notice.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) But, give him an opportunity.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) A Member can move an amendment. There is nothing to prevent a Member moving an amendment. But, we do not accept these amendments. That is all.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva)

There is a clarification, Sir. I only have the English version. On page 3, line 16, there was an amendment to Clause 8, but there is no change. The amendment states, I quote:

"three years of being issued with a licence under...

So, it reads, I quote:

"Every insurer shall be required within three years of being issued with a licence under section 15 of this Act, to have itself listed on a licensed stock exchange."

But, is there not a contradiction with Clause 51, line 17?

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) No.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) But, amendment to Clause 51 states that you need to list it in five years. [Interruption.] So, in one place, it states that you need to list it in three years and in another place it states that you need to list it in five years.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) So, we will make both as three years.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) No, Sir, we have to make it five years; not three years.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) No, no.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) That is the amendment you proposed in Clause 51.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) In which Clause is the amendment is proposed as five years? ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, in your own amendment to Clause 51 on page 26, you proposed five years. I hope I am not mistaken. I am just reading out what I see here. So, please clarify this. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) What is the amendment that you are referring to?

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I am reading from page 2 of the amendments. It states, I quote:

"Page 26, Clause 51 - delete lines 17 to 20 (both inclusive) and substitute the following:-.."

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Hon. Member, three years for new companies and five years for existing companies for listing.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Okay.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) So, that is the clarification. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Okay. Then, to Clause 52, what we suggested, Sir, is -

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) No. We have not yet come to Clause 52.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, do you need any clarification?

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Yes. Sir, for Clause 52, we requested that this be applied either for new companies, not retroactively or make it six years. That was our request.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) No, the Government is not prepared to accept that amendment. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) So, are you not prepared to accept six years?

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) We have made it four years. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) So, at least let us meet in the middle, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) That is why we have made it four years.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Let us make it five years.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) No, it is four years. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, for existing companies, you gave five years to list. So, why do you not give the same five years to break up the companies? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Debate is over. The Hon. Member cannot debate now.
