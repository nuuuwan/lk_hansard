Pages 66 and 67 of the Report of the Kandyan Peasantry Commission states, I quote:

"THE REBELLION OF 1818

212. The Kandyan rebellion of 1818 is noteworthy as having contributed in no small measure to the retarding of the development of the Kandyan Provinces, more particularly of Uva."

It further states, I quote:

"It was suppressed with difficulty and at one stage the situation became so serious that the British resorted to a policy of sheer terrorism in order to force the people into submission. The following account of the British campaign is given by one historian :-

'Wherever they went they carried away or destroyed all cattle and stores of grain or provisions that they found; villages were wiped out, houses were burnt down, crops devastated, fields permanently ruined by damaging the irrigation system, fruit trees cut down and livestock killed so as to starve and terrorise the inhabitants into submission. When reinforcements arrived from India, the system was expanded. Numerous posts were created and small detachments scoured the country covering every portion of it and authorised to burn, ravage and destroy, and to put to death all who may be in possession or found with arms in their hands till the last embers of rebellion were stamped out.......'

[. . 4.07] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Speaker, today in this House, we are paying our tribute to a very colourful and a versatile politician that this country has produced. The passing away of the Hon. Rajaratna and also his wife the Hon. (Mrs.) Kusuma Rajaratna marks the eclipse of a rejuvenated political era. The Hon. Rajaratna was considered a controversial political character. But, knowing him well, I should emphasize the fact that when he served in the Senate together with people like the Hon. (Dr). A.M.A. Azeez, the Hon. M.D. Kitchilan, the Hon. S.M.H. Mashoor and the Hon. Kurban Adamally, he cultivated a very close friendship and affinity with the Muslim community. He had very many friends in the Bar in Hulftsdorp. He practised together with great people and the names come to my mind at this moment are the Hon. A.C.M. Ameer, QC, a former Attorney-General, M.Izadeen Mohamed, QC who was also an MP, M.M. Markhani and M.S. Osman.

Sir, when he was in the Senate, I must make particularly mention that there was a very controversial statement made by an Ambassador, as they do these days, trying to bring disrepute to the country in so many ways. At that time also this had happened. I do not want to mention the name of the country but that statement hurt the religious susceptibilities of the Muslim community. There was great agitation in the country. There were protests in all the mosques and a man of wisdom, Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel who was the President of the All Ceylon Muslim League and a Cabinet Minister, told his colleagues we will go and meet Senator Rajaratna in the Senate and explain to him what has happened because this statement is against Islam." They pointed it out to him when they met him.

The Constitution guarantees the freedom of religion of every community. Article 10 of it even now guarantees this religious freedom to minorities, which cannot be compromised. I think so many others did not want to take up that fight and tell the truth for fear of reprisals from certain quarters. This happens even now. But, the Hon. Rajaratna stood up in the Senate. He made a very long speech eulogizing the ideologies and principles of Islam; about world Islamic civilization; about the contribution of

2051 2052

the Muslims for the growth of civilization and of humanity. He made a very fine speech in the Senate. Anybody can go through that Hansard of the Senate to know it. What did he do at last and what did he say on behalf of Sri Lanka? He said, "this particular Ambassador should be declared persona non grata and sent out of the country." The courage that he had, the political vision that he had and his forthrightness enabled him to make such remarks irrespective of caste, creed or religion. He took up a cause of the community who are part and parcel of this country and he espoused this cause to the last.

Sir, I still remember that there was a Muslim League Senate at that time and I must mention the names of those "Senators"' who met the Hon. Rajaratna on this important issue. They were the Hon. A.M. Nazeer, a former Deputy Mayor, the Hon. M.L.M. Farook, the Hon. Munsoor S. Deen, the Hon. S.Z.M.Mashoor Moulana who became a Senator later, the Hon. M.M. Bahauddeen, the Hon. M.C. Cassim Sharif, the Hon. M. Zahir Sufi Ismail, the Hon. A. Mamun Sally, the Hon. Mohamed Zain and the Hon. A.R.M. Zain.

He said, My dear young men, do not be cowards and do not be afraid. We will face this type of anti-religious propaganda that certain people carry on in our country- like what anti-rationals are doing today, Sir - and the late Hon. Rajaratna was bold enough to take up this issue in the Senate.

In 1952, the late Hon. Rajaratna contested the Welimada Electorate in the upcountry hills, a beautiful area with full of vegetables - valleys and mountains. At that time, he came third polling as a SLFP candidate 3,327 votes, and the the late Hon. K.D.D. Perera polled 5,118 votes becoming second and the late Hon. M.B. Bambarapane, who was a UNPer later contested independently and won this seat. Then, Sir, in the following election on 2nd April 1956, the late Hon. Rajaratna who got only 3,327 votes earlier was the winner from the SLFP-MEP, . , . . . , , .

The late Hon. Rajaratna polled 12,336 votes in 1956 whereas the late Hon. M.B. Bambarapane, UNP polled 4,318 votes and the late Hon. M.D. Perera who contested independently polled only 770 votes. So, he won with a majority of 8,018 votes.

Then, Sir, there is a village in the Welimada Electorate where the majority are Muslims. I think now there are about 14,000 to 15,000 voters but at that time, there were only about 7,000 to 8,000 voters. That is called

Harakgamakanda which is very close to Nuwara Eliya. Inhabitants are all Muslims and there was a mosque. He built a school for them and later, when a Thangal came from India and asked about this name Harakgamakanda the meaning was told to him. Then he suggested that it should be renamed as Silmiyapura - The "Serenity-Pura" - that is what it meant. The late Hon. Rajaratna at once accepted that suggestion and agreed to this name change.

Finally, Sir, he and his beloved wife, the late Hon. (Mrs.) Kusuma Rajaratna were quite interesting figures in this House. The late Hon. Rajaratna, I can still remember, almost resembled the Hon. J.R.P. Sooriyapperuma, when he wears the spectacle. Bespectacled Rajaratna was tall and handsome and the late Hon. (Mrs.) Kusuma Rajaratna was pretty as ever. They both formed a very ideal couple in this House. The late Hon. Rajaratna served in Parliament for four years, six months and fourteen days and his worthy wife, the late Hon. (Mrs.) Kusuma Rajaratna - as was described a firebrand politician - was fighting from the rear and from the front after the late Hon. Rajaratna was unseated. She served in this House for eleven years, nine months and four days.

Sir, now what I want to emphasize is, that, as was told by the Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena, your revered father, the late Hon. D.A. Rajapaksa, the late Hon. Rajaratna and the late Hon. Philip Gunawardena were the leaders who formed a national renaissance movement in that era. They fought for the farmers, people of the soil and they carried forward with a national zeal. So much so that the late Hon. Rajaratna sometimes, as mentioned here, was a controversial person. . But, I am very happy today, after his demise, the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka in his speech has cleared the late Hon. K.M.P. Rajaratna's name. He had asked, As a Buddhist, will I ever say that and can you believe that? Therefore, today, although he is no more with us, he stands exonerated and innocent of all the vituperative languages that were used on him. When the Paddy Lands Act was enacted by the late Hon. Philip Gunawardena, he was a tower of strength to him.

Sir, there were certain couples in this House like the late Hon. Rajaratna and the late Hon. (Mrs.) Kusuma Rajaratna; the late Hon. Philip Gunawardena and the late Hon. (Mrs.) Kusumasiri Gunawardena; the late Hon. T.B. Ilangaratne and the late Hon. (Mrs.) Tamara Ilangaratne; the late Hon. Leslie Goonewardene and the late Hon. (Mrs.) Vivienne Goonewardene. It was a very interesting era. Today, in the history of Parliament, it is a coincidence that this august Assembly is called upon to condole the passing away of both the husband and wife, a Parliamentary combination. May he rest in peace.

Thank you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) .

Order, please! I may also add this brief sentiment. The late Hon. L.A.B. Perera was very friendly with us. He had a very friendly demeanor. I must make particular mention that he chartered a coalition course with the Muslim community and he was also helpful in sending thousands of youth free of charge to Arab and other foreign countries which was of great service to the youth of this country.

I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by both sides of Parliament on the death of Hon. L.A.B. Perera, ex-Member of Parliament. I shall direct the Secretary-General of Parliament to make a minute of the proceedings of the meeting today and send a copy thereof to the members of the bereaved family.
