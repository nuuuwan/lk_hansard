.formal notice of appeal is lodged until the appeal is decided; and in courts martial from when the charge is made until the sentence of the court has been confirmed and promulgated, and again when the convicted man petitions the Army Council, the Air Council or the Board of Admiralty.

Similarly, Sir, the Indian "Practice and Procedure of Parliament" by M.N. Kaul, S.L. Shakdher and G.C. Malhotra is also very clear. It says, I quote:

Rule of sub judice applies to questions, statements, motions (excluding motions in respect of leave to introduce a Bill, take a Bill

1211 1212

into consideration, refer a Bill to a Select/Joint Committee, circulate a Bill for eliciting opinion thereon, pass a Bill) resolutions and other debates."

Sir, the rule of sub judice applies to questions, statements and motions. This is the judgment given in a court of law which is embodied in Malhotras publication. Also as I quoted, Sir, - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, again Erskine May states, I quote:

.in exercising its discretion the Chair should not allow reference to such matters if it appears that there is a real and substantial danger of prejudice to the proceedings;..

I do not want to quote the whole paragraph on matters awaiting judicial decision from Erskine May.

The last thing that he emphasized is, I further quote:

The Select Committee on Procedures has also considered whether a similar rule should be established prohibiting reference to matters subject to injunction by the courts.

So, all in all, Sir, as the Leader of the House quoted to you from the Standing Orders, there is a case pending and an appeal also has been made. According to Erskine May and G.C. Malhotra, the submission of the Leader of the Opposition is not admissible in this House.

[10.55 a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Mr. Speaker, right at the inception, let me thank you and the Chief Opposition Whip for providing me with this opportunity to make my observations on the Budget for 2012. First, let me begin with a quotation from one of the eminent US Presidents, Abraham Lincoln. He stated, I quote:

I have endured a great deal of ridicule without much malice; and I have received a great deal of kindness, not quite free from ridicule. I am used to it.

With this particular quotation, let me point out that I do not intend to use any ridiculing tactics or be malicious in my observations on the Budget for 2012. Rather, I shall provide this august Assembly with a realistic and dispassionate assessment of the basic ingredients of this Budget. Before doing so, I would like to remind this House what John Adams stated. He said, I quote:

Facts are stubborn things; and whatever maybe our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.

As such, Hon. Speaker, I shall base my arguments and my presentation purely on facts and substantive evidence.

Mr. Speaker, George Bernard Shaw, one of the eminent authors of our century once stated, The greatest of evils and the worst of crimes is poverty. Sir, undoubtedly, there is universal acceptability that poverty must be eradicated. But, poverty must be eradicated through an integrated, non-political, non-partisan, impartial programme. The programme has to be viable, it has to be effective and it has to be efficacious. So, it is my fervent belief that the Samurdhi Programme, which claims to be the Governments flagship poverty alleviation programme has to be restructured, revamped, and it has to be a clear-cut, target-oriented programme, which is designed specifically to achieve short, medium and long-term national targets.

Mr. Speaker, when making an assessment of the economic growth rate of the country, we must take

cognizance of the actual facts. Our policies must be based upon those strong and realistic premises. We must not base our policies on falsehoods; we must not base our policies on cooked-up information and statistics. Sir, the Finance Minister stated that we have an 8 per cent growth rate. I humbly and respectfully forward my contention to this House that when you take the GDP deflator, the actual growth rate is not 8 per cent but it is 6 per cent according to page 21 of the Central Bank Report.

, , -macroeconomy - . Before I commence my note on the macroeconomic structure and the macroeconomic situation, let me just quote Hannah More. Hannah More basically stated, I quote :

A sound economy is a sound understanding brought into action. It is calculation realized; it is the doctrine of proportion reduced to practice; it is foreseeing contingencies and providing against them; it is expecting contingencies and being prepared for them.

Now, Sir, when we talk of macroeconomic management, we always focus on the national production, inflation levels, price levels, employability, unemployability, unemployment situation, balance of payment position and the exchange rate. We take all these factors into account when we talk of macroeconomic management.

, ? . . .

Mr. Speaker, this reminds me of the so-called golden Thatcher days; the Thatcher economic revolution in the 1980s in the United Kingdom. In the late 1970s, the United Kingdom was classified as the poor man of Europe but Mrs. Thatcher managed to use various economic tools and instruments to engineer a programme that brought economic prosperity. But, one of the main deficiencies of her economic programme was that it was a service-oriented development, a service-oriented growth. While the service sector propelled the United Kingdom to achieve very healthy economic growth targets, the manufacturing sector suffered a precipitous decline. So, let me make myself clear. If Sri Lanka is to have a strong programme to achieve national economic growth, we have to have a bias in favour of the industrial sector and the agricultural sector more than the service sector.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees I would like to ask, what are the policies that have yielded these results? The world has accepted the justice, the fairness and the correctness of the foreign policy that has been pursued by this Government. Once the hostilities were over, we concentrated very sharply on rehabilitation. We have a particular concept of rehabilitation. Every country has its own culture.

Mr. Yasushi Akashi, a distinguished representative of the Government of Japan who is in this country at this very moment stated this publicly yesterday: "There is no size that fits everybody. Solutions to be sustainable must be responsive to the cultural traditions of a particular country. Considerations of time, place and context are of overriding importance". It is in that spirit that we have approached the task of reconciliation.

In our view, one of the principle elements of reconciliation is economic contentment. At the time the hostilities ended in May 2009, there were as many as 297,000 people who had been displaced by the conflict. Today, the number is less than 6,000.

Mr. Akashi has handled these problems in the former Yugoslavia and in Cambodia. People of that stature are aware that in no country in the world, in a comparable situation, had these results being achieved within so short a period.

I think, not in a grudging spirit, not in the spirit that was demonstrated with great regret by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition this morning, not grudgingly but generously, large heartedly and in a spirit of magnanimity, we must give credit where credit is due and these are substantial accomplishments which have been recognized by the world at large. It is not easy to get 15 countries one after the other; it is no mean achievement to have all those countries getting up one after the other to express their emphatic and unreserved support for our country and some of these countries do not have very close relations with us. We do not have everyday business to transact with those countries. It is something that must kindle the flame of pride in our hearts and in our minds. It is not a matter that should elicit the kind of response and behaviour of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, which the whole country painfully and tragically witnessed this morning. That contrasts very sharply with what we saw in Abdul City and in particular in Perth in Western Australia. I do not think that the people of this country appreciate politics of that kind. Taking off a tie, a Commonwealth tie, what does that mean? Does it mean that the decision of 54 Heads of States can be reversed by such an empty gesture? It is a vacuous, empty and meaningless gesture and it is a sign of disrespect, not to the President, not to the Government but to the people of Sri Lanka.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Why are you excited?

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) I am not excited. Hon. Chief Opposition Whip, I am not excited at all. I am expressing my deep sense of sadness at what occurred this morning.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, so this has been a multifaceted and realistic approach to reconciliation and rehabilitation fully in consonance with the cultural traditions that are entrenched in this country. We have focused on the things that cry out for attention.

Let us take, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, a very moving ceremony. It must move the hearts of all of us whatever hatred or whatever envy we may have. One thousand eight hundred young people who were misguided, who took up arms against the State, were fully exposed to programmes of vocational training that would enable them to have access to livelihoods and incomes to hold their head high as Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore said, "A mind free of fear and a head held high". These 1,800 young people are now in a position to go home, to their parents, to their families, to turn over a new leaf, to start a new life and to enter the democratic

mainstream in this country. His Excellency President Rajapaksa presided over this very moving function. He was joined on that occasion by High Commissioners and Ambassadors of some of the most important countries in the world. Together they distributed certificates which represent a passport to a new life, a life of contentment, a life of dignity, a life they that can be usefully led not only for the benefit of the people concerned but for the collective benefit of the Island, the country which we all love and cherish.

Sir, we have also been able to revive the electoral process in the Northern Province. That is the source from which all democratic rights and freedoms flow. More than 600 Tamil-speaking police officers have been appointed in the Northern Province, so that the people of that area, in the uncongenial environment of a police station, can transact business in their own tongue. Sir, this is a complete approach. No rehabilitation can be, at all, complete without a sharp focus on economic and social development.

The economy of the Northern Province is growing by more than 22 per cent. More than 44,000 loans have been given by State banks to the people in the Northern Province during the last few months. We have not, by any means, neglected accountability. It is a false charge that is made against us.

Sir, as I speak to you today, there is a complete census being carried out in the Northern Province so that the truth can be ascertained. All these measures are being taken voluntarily and spontaneously by the Government of Sri Lanka. These are measures which are genuinely appreciated by the international community, whatever the Hon. Leader of the Opposition may say about it. I also want to tell you that we will work cordially and productively with the international community but we are not going to be dictated to by anybody. This country values its sense of pride. We will not allow anybody to take decisions for us. We will not allow anybody to impose upon us, but in a spirit of goodwill and of partnership, we will reach out to the international community and I know that the vast majority of the 193 countries that are Members of the United Nations are reciprocating in the fullest measure, that spirit of empathy and goodwill. Their friendship and support is available to us as we emerge from the shadow of 30 long years of conflict and face the challenges of the future with courage and confidence.

I wish to make just one other point, Sir. I am conscious of the time constraint. I would like to say this. I would like to ask our critics who are talking of the weakness of our foreign relations, how do you account for the fact that something unprecedented is happening in our country today? I have never known a time when so many high- profile visitors have come to the shores of our country within such a short period. Last week we had a high-profile delegation from the Republic of South Africa. We had probably the most powerful lady in the

Arab World, the Hon. Sheikha Lubna, Minister of Foreign Trade of the United Arab Emirates. We had Mr. Yasushi Akashi, the special representative of the Government of Japan. In a few days time, we will be welcoming to this country the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of Qatar. Two days ago, we welcomed a distinguished Member of the European Parliament. In four days' time, we will be receiving another delegation - an All-Party Delegation - of the European Parliament from Brussels. Two days after that, we will be receiving in this country a delegation from the Parliament of Australia. Everyday we are meeting people from foreign countries; we are engaging in discussions with them. There has never been - I say in all sincerity and this is a verifiable fact - such an influx of people representing these capitals coming to this country to ask us what they can do, expressing appreciation of the efforts that are being made by this Government for the betterment of conditions in this country. The President of Vietnam was here a few weeks ago. He did not come empty-handed. He came with some of the most important business leaders in Vietnam. They met the Chambers of Commerce here and a series of agreements were entered into. So, that is the truth which we must face. We cannot live in a world of make-believe, jealousy, envy, hatred and acrimony. These are the facts which stare us in the face.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Minister, you have to wind up now.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Yes, I am just about to conclude. I say that we have confidence in ourselves. We have a convincing story to tell. We do not need to embroider. We only need to place the unvarnished facts before the bar of world opinion. It is that that has brought about this singular success for our country and in all humility, I ask my good Friend, the Chief Opposition Whip, to join with us in a spirit of solidarity. Let us all work together. Let us seize this moment which has arrived after 30 long years and let us in a large-hearted and generous spirit, work together to ensure for our country, a stable and prosperous future. Thank you.

Mr. Presiding Member, please give me only one more minute. Before I conclude my speech, I would like to say that the people of this country have a very strong feeling and expectation that ours would become an emerging economy in Asia very soon, under the dynamic leadership of our smart President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa. Therefore, I wish him all the success in his untiring endeavour to reach that noble goal.

Thank you.
