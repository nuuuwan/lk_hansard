( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am happy to follow the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera and I would like to make use of this opportunity to inform the House of several aspects of the foreign policy of the Government, which are of particular importance to our country at this time.

During the last month, some of the central initiatives of the Government have been in the field of international relations. We have invested considerable time and effort in bringing to the notice of the world the action taken and the results achieved with regard to a wide range of matters including the resettlement of internally displaced persons, the reintegration into society of ex-combatants, the progress in respect of de-mining, the shrinking of the area covered by high security zones, the handling of issues relating to land and the recruitment of large numbers of Tamil-speaking police officers in the Northern Province. Particular emphasis was placed on the work of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission and the implementing arm appointed by the Government, the Inter-Agency Advisory Committee.

I am happy to inform the House that the extensive discussions we have engaged in, make abundantly clear the widespread understanding of and support for, the position of Sri Lanka. The principal basis of this is the belief that Sri Lanka has achieved a daunting task against overwhelming odds, in defeating terrorism; that the country requires from the international community not judgmental postures, imposition of impediments and

resort to threats, but goodwill and empathy and, above all, time and space to carry forward the delicate task of reconciliation on which it has embarked; that solutions have to be evolved in keeping with the cultural traditions and value systems specific to each country situation; and that those who cast the first stone must stand prepared to be judged by the standards which they purport to prescribe for the rest of humanity. These, Sir, are the common elements we encountered in a variety of discussions over the last few weeks.

During the State Visit of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa to Bangladesh, I had the advantage of detailed discussions on the current Sri Lankan situation with Dr. Dipu Moni, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh. Shortly thereafter, I undertook an official visit to the Sultanate of Oman, where I was received by the Head of Government of Oman and the Foreign Minister of that country. A very clear view on the part of the Government of Oman in respect of Sri Lankan issues emerged from these discussions. It may be noted that Oman is one of the six countries comprising the Gulf Cooperation Council, the other five countries being Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.

In India, I had discussions with His Excellency Dr. Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, Finance Minister, Shri S.M. Krishna, Minister of External Affairs, Shri Shiv Shankar Menon, National Security Adviser and Srimathi Nirupama Rao, Foreign Secretary. The result of these discussions with the highest tier of the political leadership and the apex of the bureaucracy of India is crystal clear. I assure the House in categorical terms that there exists an immense fund of goodwill for Sri Lanka in India. The leaders of India were emphatic in their assertion that in their eyes, Indias relationship with Sri Lanka has a unique quality which they are firmly resolved to protect and develop.

Sir, in the conduct of foreign relations, it is not always prudent to react to strident rhetoric, at times based on incomplete information and even erroneous assumptions. The priority objective is, and must be, the accomplishment of concrete outcomes in furtherance of the greater good of our country. For our part, our attitude to the relationship between Sri Lanka and India is one of openness and candour and we will continue to work closely with the Government of India on all issues encompassed by our bilateral relationship.

It must be remembered that a crucial aspect of the opportunity which presents itself to Sri Lanka after the eradication of terrorism, is the robust impetus to the development of our economy, with particular reference to tourism, direct and portfolio investment and expansion of volumes of international trade. These dimensions of the current challenge formed an integral part of the engagement in India, where issues relating to livelihoods,

1135 1136

2011 08

housing, highways and railroad systems, revival of the economy with special importance attached to support for agricultural activity, and resuscitation of the electoral process appropriately received sharp emphasis.

Indeed, Sir, these dimensions occupied pride of place in the fruitful consultations which took place with the Government of Singapore soon after the conclusion of my official visit to New Delhi. It was quite apparent from my discussions with Mr. Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Singapore, and Mr. Lim Hng Kiang, Minister of Trade and Industry of Singapore, that there is explicit recognition of the synergies which characterize the relationship in the new environment, pervaded by peace and stability in Sri Lanka. We covered substantial ground in respect of identification of areas suitable for collaboration, especially in the services sector. I found the Singaporean side strongly receptive to investment and trade opportunities now available in profusion in Sri Lanka.

Lively interest in unfolding events in our country was demonstrated by the extent of audience participation, and the sustained discussion which followed the lecture I delivered on The Current Situation in Sri Lanka and the Way Forward at the Institute of South Asian Studies of the National University of Singapore. The depth of this interest was reflected in the wide exposure which my views, expressed on this occasion and in a separate interview, received in "The Straits Times". Scholars from all over the region, gathered at the International Centre for Terrorism Research at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Nanyang Technological University of Singapore, had many insightful observations to offer in their discussions with me.

Sir, the outcome of my visit to the Peoples Republic of China was uniformly encouraging. Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi articulated, in the most unequivocal terms, the view that, in the opinion of the Peoples Republic of China, the Government and people of Sri Lanka have total capability to resolve their issues in accordance with their own requirements and aspirations. There was complete agreement that contextual factors have overriding importance in the formulation of practical approaches to the resolution of national problems, and that the fullest expression must be accorded to the nuances of the local situation. Chinas Minister for Foreign Affairs made it clear that the support of his country is at Sri Lankas disposal as we address in earnest the tasks of national reconstruction and reconciliation.

This discussion proved beneficial, also from the standpoint of imparting further clarity and cohesion to reciprocal arrangements in the economic sphere, which straddle a wide spectrum of projects. The Foreign Minister of China and I took advantage of the opportunity of my working visit to Beijing to address a cluster of matters relating to projects, now in the process of

implementation, as well as new projects proposed by us and further phases of existing projects crucial for infrastructure development in our country. These projects include the development of our ports, harbours and airports, road and railway networks, the power and energy sector, and the field of culture and the performing arts. The warmth of the relationship between the two countries is reinforced by the visit of the Hon. D.M. Jayaratne, Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, this week to the Kunming Trade Fair which, with the participation of several Sri Lankan companies, will certainly add an impetus to the trade relations between Sri Lanka and China.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, Sri Lanka played a leading role in the 16th Summit of Foreign Ministers of countries belonging to the Non-Aligned Movement which was held a fortnight ago in Bali, Indonesia. It is a source of deep pride to Sri Lanka that we were invited to preside over a plenary session of the Conference. Current membership of the Non-Aligned Movement extends to 120 countries, almost two-thirds of the total membership of the General Assembly of the United Nations. My own address served as an occasion to remind the world community of Sri Lankas vital contribution to the conceptual underpinnings of the Movement, established and consolidated in Belgrade half a century ago.

An exceedingly useful part of this event, given the level and scope of participation, was the opportunity it afforded for bilateral consultations of immediate relevance to Sri Lanka on the sidelines of the plenary sessions. This was of inestimable value to us in communicating Sri Lankas point of view regarding contemporary developments to countries whose voice is of considerable importance in multilateral fora. In this task, I was fortunate to be assisted substantially by my Colleagues, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena, the Hon. Dilan Perera and the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena.

Sir, in total, we had 22 bilateral meetings with countries from different geographical regions of the world. From the Continent of Asia, we engaged with Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Myanmar. From Africa, we had discussions with Egypt, Senegal, Nigeria, Tunisia, Mozambique and South Africa. From the Middle East, the countries we interacted with were Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. From Europe, we had discussions with Spain, Serbia, Slovenia, Belarus and Ukraine. From Latin America, we engaged with Cuba, Gautemala, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic.

There are some principles which can be readily distilled from this extensive range of consultations. There was much in evidence the vigorous sentiment that approaches to contentious matters must be issue-based, and founded on principle rather than expediency. Accompanying this sentiment was vehement opposition to inconsistency, caused by double standards and the

1137 1138

selective application of seemingly lofty principles. The conviction was expressed by many delegations that these principles, although unassailable in the abstract, are often exploited, as experience has shown, for partisan ends and in pursuit of objectives which are far from altruism.

Within hours of my return from Indonesia, I received with pleasure in Colombo the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Hon. Mohammed Ali Fathollahi, who pledged the unequivocal support of his Government to Sri Lanka in dealing with our current issues. It was an appropriate occasion for me to convey to the visiting Iranian dignitary, on the Governments behalf, our appreciation of Irans generous assistance with regard to resources for the purchase of oil during a difficult period in our countrys contemporary history and now, for their significant contribution to the economic development of Sri Lanka, notably in the fields of irrigation and rural electrification.

The "Shangri-La" dialogue in Singapore, which has currently established itself as a pre-eminent forum for in-depth analysis of security-oriented issues, especially in the Indian Ocean area and the Pacific rim, served as a timely setting for bringing to the attention of a large number of countries Sri Lankas perspectives on these issues. I addressed the Plenary Sessions of this Summit on Armed Forces and Transnational Security Challenges. Sri Lankas delegation was strengthened by the participation of Vice-Admiral D.W.A.S. Dissanayake, Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy.

I made use of the occasion to have bilateral discussions, which proved of great benefit to our country, with the Rt. Hon. Dr. Liam Fox, Secretary of State for Defence of the United Kingdom, His Excellency Sergei Ivanov, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, the Hon. Steven Smith, Minister of Defence of Australia and the Hon. K. Shanmugam, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Singapore.

On my return to Colombo, yesterday, I was delighted to receive, at the Ministry of External Affairs, His Excellency Koro Bessho, Deputy Foreign Minister of Japan. While I found a considerable measure of understanding of Sri Lankas position on current issues, I thanked the visiting dignitary for the very substantial volume of overseas development assistance which Japan had made available to Sri Lanka over the decades and, above all, for the exemplary gentleness and sensitivity that consistently typified Japans relations with our country.

I look forward to my discussions tomorrow with a delegation, led by Senator the Hon. Stephen Hutchins, representing Members of the Australia-Sri Lanka Parliamentary Friendship Group in the Parliament of Australia. This will be a valuable opportunity, especially

as we prepare for the meeting of Commonwealth Heads of State and Government, which will be held in Perth, Western Australia, in October this year.

Sir, the sequence of events amply demonstrates the vigour and intensity of Sri Lankas interactions with the world at large as we address a variety of issues of importance to our nation. All the discussions we have had, and the responses we received, indicate beyond doubt that Sri Lanka has a convincing and indeed compelling case to make before the bar of world opinion. There is no need for embellishment. The facts speak for themselves.

We do, however, need to remind ourselves of one basic imperative. At a time when forces hostile to our motherland are acting in concert to launch an onslaught against our vital national interests, there is no room for division on the basis of sectarian loyalty or party affiliation. Our collective voice, rising above differences in respect of domestic issues, must be that of the nation, as a whole. While the thrust and parry of party politics is an essential feature of representative democracy, in the setting of the Parliamentary system, there is the overarching need to recognize that, in matters which transcend narrow consideration and concern the security and dignity of our country, all must unite in a spirit of solidarity to ward off this danger. I have every confidence, Sir, that at this crucial hour, we shall not be found wanting. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Presiding Member, we were expecting the Minister of External Affairs to give a very clear-cut statement on what is going on. I have in my hand now - [Interruption.] Listen to me. - [Interruption.] This is an issue on which all of us have to work together.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! Let him speak. He has got only two minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I have a document which states that the Tamil Nadu Assembly has passed a Resolution seeking imposition of economic sanctions on Sri Lanka today.- [Interruption.] I am asking the Minister of External Affairs - you had a joint declaration with India; you spelt it out yesterday and today the Tamil Nadu Assembly passes a resolution seeking imposition of economic sanctions on Sri Lanka. Is this the result of the joint declaration you had there? This is supported by all parties including DMK and ADMK. We all are concerned about this. We are all Sri Lankans. We can be in the Opposition but we have no thrill about this. The Minister of External Affairs has also given a very categorical statement. We are coming to the end of the Debate on the extension of the state of Emergency. This may or may not have been known by you. But, I am tabling* this document, a document by the Press Trust of India coming through the Chief Ministers office. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, do you take responsibility for that? Who has passed that Resolution?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Tamil Nadu Assembly.

( ) (The Presiding Member) But, that is not the Indian Lok Sabha?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am talking of the Tamil Nadu Assembly.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Yes, but that is not the Indian Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) They are basically telling the Indian Government to take action. You, as the Minister of External Affairs had a joint declaration with India. This is a politically sensitive issue. Tamil Nadu dictates Sri Lankan policy in India. So, please ensure that you make a categorical statement on this even at this moment.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We must work together on issues like this. Do not tell us later on that we have gone to Western countries and told other things. This is an Indian issue. So, as the responsible Minister of External Affairs in a responsible Government that is concluding the Debate on the extension of state of Emergency, you must be able to respond spontaneously in this august Assembly to this particular issue.

What have you got to say about this? You defended matters that were taken up by my co-Opposition Colleagues and basically tried to humiliate them by saying something else. There are worse things, not only economic sanctions. But, I do not want to mention them.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you may conclude your speech now. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) On that particular basis, it is incumbent on the Government to respond to this matter because this is public knowledge from now onwards.
