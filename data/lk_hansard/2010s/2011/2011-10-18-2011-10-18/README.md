( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, I got to know the Hon. Denzil Fernando well in l974 when we were both engaged in the Katana by-election. I had met him earlier when he was a Member of the UNP in the Opposition; he was a lawyer. But, it was from 1974 that we really started to work with each other. During the time that we were in the Opposition, the Hon. Denzil Fernando was a very active Member. He had come to Parliament in 1967 through a by-election which we had all followed. He, being a lawyer also helped us to organize the National Lawyers' Association in the Negombo area. Being an advocate himself, he practised in that area and was friendly with most of the lawyers. Unlike many lawyers who used to travel around the country, the Hon. Denzil Fernando told me that he based himself within the Negombo District Court circuit. He was very active because that was the time in which the Courts Ordinance was repealed and the then Minister of Justice, the Hon. Felix Dias Bandaranaike brought in the Administration of Justice Law. Unfortunately, it was not well thought out and he rushed it through. This met with opposition from most of the legal fraternity, whatever be their politics. The Hon. Denzil Fernando was one of those who spoke out in Parliament, who pointed out the shortcomings and was welcomed as a speaker on this subject in different parts of the country.

In 1977, when the new National State Assembly was elected, he and I both became Deputy Ministers. We both represented what was to become the Gampaha District and he was the Deputy Minister to the Hon. Cyril Mathew, the then Minister of Industries and Scientific Affairs and I became the Deputy Minister to the Hon. A.C.S. Hameed, the then Minister of Foreign Affairs. But, we got together more often as Members of

Parliament representing the Gampaha District of which two are still in Parliament with me, one is the Hon. John Amaratunga and the other is the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera. We had the task of developing the Gampaha District.

The Hon. Denzil Fernando was fortunate that he had a city, that there was a Municipal Council and the first Free Trade Zone came in Katana opposite that. While being a Member of Parliament, we all worked together as Members of the Gampaha District Development Council where most of the issues were taken up. The Hon. Denzil Fernando was a frequent visitor to other parts of our district and in Parliament, he was regularly answering questions on behalf of the Hon. Cyril Mathew as well as taking parts in debates. If there was any legal matter, you could be sure that the Hon. Denzil Fernando was among the speakers.

In 1984, he joined me in Cabinet and we worked together for four years. The Hon. Denzil Fernando stood for elections under the Proportional Representation System. Though he was very popular in Negombo, he had really not built up an electoral base outside the Negombo Constituency. Unfortunately, though he was respected, he could not be elected and had to leave elective politics in 1988. But, if we had the old constituency system, the Hon. Denzil Fernando would have served at least in two more Parliaments as long as his health enabled him to do so. What we knew about the Hon. Denzil Fernando was that he was a person who led a very simple life. Even as a Minister, you could see him marketing in Negombo on Sunday; you could see him walking around. He never took on the paraphernalia of his ministerial office as a Deputy Minister.

He just walked into the Hon. Mathews office after he resigned and then started functioning there. He never asked for special privileges for any member of his family. He said, Do not give them any special treatment. They are my family. I am a Minister and as a Minister, I have no family. Those are examples that we have to follow. He led a very simple life. He was a devout Catholic and he stood by his principles. Once he gave the word, you could certainly depend on what he said.

There is one instance which I must place on record about the Hon. Denzil Fernando. We had a Group Meeting in July 1987, and there was an outstanding problem regarding the Ceylon Tyre Corporation. There was a difference in views between him and our District Minister, the Hon. Ariyaratna Jayatilleke. At that time, I was a Minister and represented the adjoining area overlooking Kelaniya. Just before the meeting, the Hon. Denzil Fernando told me that he wanted to discuss the issue. So, the Hon. Denzil Fernando, the Hon. Jayatilleke and I, went and sat outside and had a discussion. We were trying to sort out the issue about the Chairman and the recruitment of some people from Kelaniya whom the Hon. Jayatilleke wanted to take into the Corporation.

231 232

[ ]

When we were seated, we saw President Jayewardene and Prime Minister Premadasa walking in. So, as they were walking in, I rushed back - I used to sit quite close to where the President and Prime Minister sat - and found that my seat was taken by some other Minister. So, I went and sat at the back. Mr. Speaker, within 40 minutes, a grenade exploded inside that hall. If not for the fact that the Hon. Denzil Fernando had called me out, I may have been seated there. Amongst the others who were there on that day - some of them are on the both sides of the House today - were the Hon. John Amaratunga and Hon. Gamini Lokuge, the Hon. Minister of Labour and Labour Relations. Fortunately, since the Hon. Denzil Fernando called me out, I was certainly far away from where the incident took place.

Before, I conclude, Mr. Speaker, I must also mention about the Hon. Denzil Fernandos honesty. Much could be said about it. He did not earn a cent from his Ministry. But, in todays politics, when corruption is on the rise, when allegations are made against the Members of the Cabinet and when corruption is the order of the day, it is unfortunate that we have lost the services of people like the Hon. Denzil Fernando. At this moment, I would like to join the others in conveying my condolences to his children and to say, as a Christian and a devout Catholic, "May his soul rest in peace".

Thank you. [. . 2.28]

Denzil Fernando particularly at the 1967 by-election that was held for the Negombo seat at that time after the demise of the Hon. Quentin Fernando. Thereafter, we came to associate with him very closely. I must particularly mention in this House that he was very helpful to the Muslims of Kamachchiolai, Poruthota, Palahathurai and the rest of the area. He had a very good friend, Mr. Amir Sheriff who also for sometime served as the Deputy Mayor of Negombo. The Hon. Denzil Fernando carried no ill will. He was not a man of malice or vanity. He liked to live a simple life. He wanted everyone around him to smile and be happy all the time. Even in Parliament, I remember very well he encountered many interesting moments in the House, which are all well recorded in Hansard.

I remember, Sir, Mr. I.L.M. Thassim who hails from Poruthota and was a Member of the Village Committee working with him very closely. He is still living. He recalls very vivid memories of the activities of the Hon. Denzil Fernando. In that election, Sir, we also saw the emergence of a lady politician for the first time, a Muslim lady - Nadia Abdul Gaffoor Sattar. We hired a particular place at Negombo to work for the Hon. Fernando. We stayed there for a full month electioneering. I remember Alhaj M.H.M. Riyal, M.H. Amit who was our former MP, A.M. Nazeer MMC, Senator Mashoor Moulana and lawyer Maharoof from that area, who were together working for him.

The Hon. Denzil Fernando cut a very interesting figure in public life and also in Parliament. He was an advocate by profession. He was born on 24th March, 1923. He was educated at St. Marys College and St. Maris Stella College, Negombo and at Law College, Colombo. At the Law College, he was the General Secretary of the Law Students' Union from 1950 to 1951 and he was the Vice-President of the All-Ceylon Catholic Students' Federation. He was a very devout Catholic, but he endeared the brethren of other religions like the Buddhists and the Muslims of that area. He was also the Vice-President of the Law Students' Political Society. Before entering the Law College, he was a teacher at Christ the King College, Ja-Ela and worked for sometime at the Food Control Department too. At the Law College, he passed the Proctors Final Examination in 1952 with First Class Honours. After about seven years as a proctor, he passed the Advocates Examination, and was enrolled as an Advocate in December 1959.

Hon. Denzil Fernando began his political career in 1953 when he was elected to the Negombo Municipal Council and served for eight long years. He also had his mentor, the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis who was the senior-most politician in Negombo, in the Gampaha District. He was the elected Mayor of Negombo from 1960 to 1961 and then from 1964 to 1965 and in January 1970. So, all in all, the Hon. Denzil Fernando was an illustrious figure and I should record here that he served as a distinguished Member of this House for 21 years, 01 month and 02 days.

May his soul rest in peace!

[3.43 p.m.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it was my good fortune to have known the late Hon. Nelson, Member of Parliament for Polonnaruwa, from the time he entered Parliament in 1977. I too happened to enter Parliament at the same time. The Hon. Nelson was a very simple and a very good-natured individual. He got along well with everyone. Though he represented the Polonnaruwa Constituency in Parliament, I recall his telling me that his origin was in the deep South. He came from the deep

253 254

2011 18

South, but as a young man he settled down in Polonnaruwa. He became quite popular with the people there. He must have served the people with commitment to be able to win their affection and support and subsequently he was elected to Parliament from the Polonnaruwa Constituency. He was a Member of the ruling party at that point of time.

During his tenure in the First Parliament, he was also appointed the District Minister for Trincomalee. I happened to be a Member of Parliament for Trincomalee. I had the good fortune of interacting with him in my capacity as a Member of Parliament for Trincomalee when he was the District Minister for Trincomalee.

I must say in fairness to him that he made an effort to get along with all the people in the Trincomalee District. I think he was a person who realized the importance of maintaining goodwill amongst the people by doing what was proper, just and fair, which cannot be said of many persons in politics today. But, the Hon. Nelson who had a rural background and who rose to high positions from humble origins, realized that it was important to get along well with everybody and thereby earned the goodwill of everybody and enabled everybody to live and work together amicably.

I have known him quite well, Sir. He had always been kind in his dealings with me and I do sincerely regret that we have lost the Hon. Nelson. He was a person who had a standing of his own wherever he went.

I wish to record my deep regret at the passing away of the Hon. Nelson and I would join the other Members of the House in requesting you that our condolences be conveyed to his widow and his children.

Thank you.

, . [4.45 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I rise today in this House to pay my respect and tribute to the late Hon. Mervyn J. Cooray. He was a very dear and close Friend of

mine. I came to know him when I was the Private Secretary to the former Speaker, Deshamanya Alhaj M.A. Bakeer Markar. The Hon. Mervyn J. Cooray was an endearing personality. He lived a very happy life. He had an open heart and lived happily with his friends, kith and kin. He never encountered any problem in his life, be it social or political. In the political field, he happily faced his adversaries and carried forward his mission of serving the people. I should mention that he came very close to the hearts of the Muslims of the Kalutara District, particularly Panadura and Beruwala. There is an annual feast held at the Kechchimala Mosque in Beruwala. We always found the Hon Mervyn J. Cooray visiting that place and attending that feast. A host of young friends of the Muslim community would surround him because he liked to have a very fascinating dialogue with them.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! The Hon. Speaker will now take the Chair.

, .

, , . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and MR. SPEAKER took the Chair. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Hon. Mervyn J. Cooray was a great sportsman. He excelled in volleyball rising not only to national fame but also to international fame. He was for a long time the President of the National Federation of Volleyball and gave the correct leadership to the youth. He also became the Vice-President of the Asian Federation of Volleyball, and as the Hon. Reginold Cooray said, he was the first Sri Lankan to hold that post.

At the later stages, he was overtaken by ill-health and I very well remember that he underwent a heart surgery. Funds were released from the Presidents Fund. I remember well the request made by the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya at that time saying that the money given was not enough and I had to take that massage to His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who readily agreed to grant more funds. It was a very rare occasion because he grants funds equally to all.

When he was the Minister of Power and Energy, together with Mr. M.I.B. Hafi, of Puttalam, another good friend of mine, a Provincial Council Member, I used to take Mervyn to the Puttalam area.

He gave electricity to many villages in the Puttalam District, and he also joined the Muslim community in breaking fast - Iftar - in the Mosque. We knew his

271 272

children very well. When they were tiny tots we had even carried and petted on them. His daughter Marian Kumari unfortunately had a tragic death over which grieve even today. Jagath, Ajith, Vijith and Sujith, who was a Member of Provincial Council. All in all, Sir, we have lost a genius personality, a good hearted man and a friend of all. I pay my respect to his memory. May his soul rest in peace.

Thank you. [. . 4.50]
