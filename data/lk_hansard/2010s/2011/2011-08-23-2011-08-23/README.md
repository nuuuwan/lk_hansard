by the Ministry of Finance and Planning and I have requested updated information from the Ministry of Finance. No sooner I get it, we will answer the Question.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Okay, Hon. Minister. In the meanwhile, the tea prices seem to be tumbling and likewise the rubber prices. So, with the additional labour cost that is to be borne by them, are you as a Minister, satisfied that the companies are viable and the Government is giving necessary support to make it financially viable?

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) I agree with you that the cost of production has gone up significantly as a result of mainly the wage component. But, of course, on the other hand, you could justify it because that is something that was achieved on the basis of the legitimate requests made by the trade unions under the collective agreement bargaining strategy. We are trying to do our best to identify the other components of cost of production so that some collective efforts could be put into place to bring down the overall cost of production.

Once the wage increases are given, you very well know that that is a "lock-in" increase. So, that is something that cannot be tampered with. But, there are other components of cost of production at the moment, which we are looking at in order to bring down the overall cost of production. I fully agree with you that the cost of production needs to be brought down for us to remain competitive in an increasingly competitive international environment.

Of course, the tea prices have been affected as a result of the Middle East crisis: the crisis in Libya, the economic sanctions put on Iran, the situation in Syria et cetera. But, it has not been a significant drop. Hopefully, this situation will subside and we will be able to get this situation back to normalcy. But, I want to state for the record that the prices are still quite high compared to what it was before but the challenge for us really, is to bring down the cost of production and to increase productivity so that our market shares could be maintained internationally in the future.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Hon. Minister.

A report has just come in stating that a photographer of Udayan newspaper has been arrested. There have been some demonstrations in Navanthurai, Jaffna yesterday due to the inability of police to control "Grease Yakas" and a police vehicle has been damaged. They allege that they were beaten up yesterday night by some security force personnel. Seventeen people have been arrested and when the photographer was taking photographs outside the court, he had been arrested. The problem that is building up is that the police have not been able to take any action to apprehend the "Grease Yakas" but they have taken into custody a photographer. So, I would like the Government to go into it and defuse the situation in Jaffna.

, 1 Ports and Airports Development Levy , - - . .

According to the Budget 2011, import of samples which are worth not more than Rs. 25,000 in relation to businesses are exempted from the payment of Value Added Tax - VAT and Nation Building Tax - NBT, subject to such terms and conditions as prescribed by the Director-General of Customs. Before that, the import of samples worth not more than Rs. 25,000 was also exempted from the payment of import duties, subject to such terms and conditions as prescribed by the Director-General of Customs. Now, it has been decided by the Government to exempt the Ports and Airports Development Levy as well. That is Sir, in addition to VAT and NBT, to exempt the Ports and Airports Development Levy as well on the samples with effect from 25th April, 2011 to provide relief to entrepreneurs who import samples for their business activities. In this business, it is a requirement that samples should be shown to customers and manufacturers. When samples are imported, it is the cost which in some cases cannot be recovered. Hence the tax component is an additional cost

for them. In order to provide facility for reducing the upfront cost, it was decided to exempt samples from PAL as well. That is to say, Hon. Speaker, that in addition to the exemption from VAT and NBT, these samples which are worth not more than Rs. 25,000 will now be exempt from PAL as well. Accordingly, Gazette No. 1703/1 dated 25th April, 2011 will provide the legal provisions to the exemption of PAL applicable on import of samples worth not more that Rs. 25,000.

, . . , Excise (Special Provisions) Act, No. 13 of 1989 - Order under Section 3 published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 1706/3 dated 16th, May 2011 . The Government has started to lose revenue due to importation of modified luxury limousine vehicles under the low tax rate applicable on motor vehicles for transport of 10 persons or more category. Therefore, this gazette notification was published including necessary amendments to tax rates to improve Government revenue. Accordingly, high tax rates imposed on luxury motor vehicles were extended to this modified luxury limousine vehicles as well.

. . Question proposed. [2.22 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Mr. Speaker, we do not oppose the Order under Section 3 of the Ports and Airports Development Levy Act, No. 18 of 2011 that is before the House today, regarding the Gazette notification exempting those who import samples in relation to business worth not more than Rs. 25,000 into the country, from that levy. There is no objection to that. I do not wish to speak about the airports. There is a serious problem with regard to the ports of Sri Lanka. If you examine the Colombo Port closely, particularly where all the goods for import and export are taking place, it is facing a serious problem. There is congestion at the JC Terminal and the SAG Terminal; I am referring to the problem in the Colombo Port. The Colombo Port cannot cope up with the ships that are bringing in and taking away goods from Sri Lanka. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, I do not want to disturb you. You can of course speak about the ports. But, the issue here today is with regard to the exemption of Ports and Airports Development Levy. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes. You are charging that levy for the development of the ports. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) By a long process of argument, you can bring it under that.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I am entitled to comment because you are collecting money for development. Unfortunately, the development

641 642

[ () ]

2011 23

in the ports and airports is insufficient to cope up with the import and export trade in Sri Lanka. That is what I am trying to point out. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is why we have one in Hambantota. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The Hambantota Port is there, but there are no ships coming to it. You have constructed an incomplete port. You may later on make it available for bigger ships to come in. But, let us see what is happening in the Colombo Port. If you speak to the shippers, you will see that they are very unhappy with the present situation. The reason is that the terminals could not conform to the new berth windows which are being demanded by the shipping lines based on their performance schedules. They have schedules but they are unable to keep up to it especially because both the terminals are fully occupied during the weekends and there is no space for implementation of new services. This is a big problem. That is why many ships are bypassing the Colombo Port. The Colombo Port is one of the oldest ports in the whole of Asia, starting from the Spanish traders who came to Sri Lanka. Then, there came the other people like the Dutch, the Portuguese, and the British. Unfortunately, our development pace has not kept up to the mark. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) One of our biggest development projects is the extension of the South Harbour.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I know, but how many years will it take?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The work is going on. So, precisely the problem that you are raising has been remedied by the Government. Naturally you cannot build a port overnight.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) You are in the process of finding a remedy. It will take about another two years according to the work schedule. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) It is one of the biggest port development projects in Asia. So, you cannot build it overnight.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) May be so, but how many years are you going to take to complete it?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Now, you can see the breakwater. Have you not seen the breakwater?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes, I have seen. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The breakwater is being done and it is almost complete. Then, we will have to build the terminals on the breakwater. Then, there will be the cranes and the capacity is over. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) You should have done it much earlier. As a result, you are going to take another two years to complete it. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, I do not want to disturb you, but all these things were delayed by the UNP Government.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes, I am telling you. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) How many years has the PA Government been in power?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I can tell you for a fact that these ideas were mooted during President D.B. Wijetungas time.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) It is during the UNP regime that we had some development.

643 644

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) But, nothing was done at that time.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No, you cannot say that.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) By that time the late Hon. Alick Aluwihare was the Minister.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The late Hon. Lalith Athulathmudali was the person who really brought the port into proper form.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) It was the late Hon. Lalith Athulathmudali, but afterwards during President D.B. Wijetungas time, the proposal was brought by John Keells but nothing was done about it. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) President D.B. Wijetunga was there only for one year. Why are you accusing him?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) After that we started on this big project. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The PA Government has been in power for 15 years, but nothing has been done. You are trying to construct the Southern Port terminal only now.

Then, Sir, there are berthing delays. Currently, the mainline services as well as feeders are encountering berthing delays especially at the JCT. Now, this is the problem. The ships are waiting outside the harbour and as a result, on one side you have to pay demurrage and on the other, they do not want to waste their time. They bypass and go to ports in India. Ports in South India are now developing. Also, this causes schedule delays. There are transshipment cargo misconnections at the Port of Colombo due to feeder delays. It is badly affecting the overall growth of the transshipment cargo at the Port of Colombo

We are specializing in transshipment cargo. But, the majority of the containers that come to the Port of Colombo face difficulties. They are finding it difficult to operate in the Port of Colombo. There is something wrong somewhere. Another reason they give for that is that the maximum permissible draft of the Port of Colombo is 14.25 metres and the length is 310 metres.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is exactly why we started the Hambantota Port. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I know.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) My Friend, you are supporting that. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) But, it is not catering to the needs of the Sri Lankas imports and exports. Why are the ships not coming to Hambantota Port? () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) My dear Friend, the Queen Elizabeth Quay is now handled by the private sector; part of it is handled by the Government and part of it is handled by the private sector. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) There is a responsibility by the Government to ensure that they perform efficiently. You cannot say it is handled by the private sector and get off. - [Interruption.] You are the Government. The responsibility is on you to ensure that there is a smooth import-export facility for the vessels coming to Sri Lanka.

The Port of Colombos permissible draft is 14.25 metres and the length is 310 metres. Therefore, due to this draft restriction, the Port of Colombo cannot handle 10,000 TEUs or bigger capacity vessels. These are matters you should have attended to earlier. The dredging would have been done earlier. There are also manoeuvring difficulties. That is again a facility that has to be there, which is lacking. You should have known that according to -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Why are you talking this rubbish?

645 646

2011 23

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Why?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) If you just walk down to the harbour, you will see the work that is going on now?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No. It is the congestion - [Interruption.]

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) How can you make all these criticisms? Which harbour are you referring to? ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I am referring to Colombo Harbour. We are talking about the congestion. - [Interruption.] You must admit that. In short, what I am trying to say is that you have mismanaged the port, the affairs of which were very well looked after during the regime of the United National Party. At that time, it was one of the most efficient ports in the whole of South Asia.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) During that period, you sacked Mr. Lalith Athulath Mudali. After he left the House, he never rejoined the UNP.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) He did it and that development is there. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The person who built the Port was sacked by the UNP and he never returned to the House as a Member of the UNP. Of course, you know the facts.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Do not get carried away with that. Those are internal matters. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The man who built the Port for the UNP was sacked by you all and he was never allowed to come back to this House -

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) That is another matter; that is a political decision. You are not entitled to challenge that.

Then, Sir, also the Colombo Port is today reluctant to handle over 300-metre length vessels due to limited berth space. What I am trying to say is, you are not keeping pace with the latest developments in the shipping industry. Today, there are ships coming in with 10,000 to 20,000 containers. They are unable to berth in the Colombo Harbour because for over the last 10 to 15 years, there have not been many developments. So, this is what we are saying. For heavens sake without building up the Hambantota Port, you should dump that money in the Colombo Port and develop it. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is what we have done. That is not a secret. The Colombo South Harbour Development Project is exactly that, one of the biggest development projects in Asia.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) What I say is that you have delayed that development. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, no. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) It should have been done much earlier. ( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake ) It is not only one harbour. There are five harbours - ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I know that you are doing the Colombo South Harbour Development Project but it is going to take another two years. By that time you would lose the business. Indian ports are developing fast and the Singapore is absorbing quite a lot of it.

Then, the next point is with regard to the Gantry crane, the maximum reach and weight limitations. There again you have not modernized them, you have not brought in machinery to meet the modern day requirements. The maximum weight which could be handled under the Gantry crane is limited to 55 metric tons and 18 rows towards the seaside. Therefore, the port

647 648

operation is restricted to handle overweight cargo and ships which are over 18 rows across. These are the problems that the shippers are facing. I am not trying to bring in matters which are false accusations. But this is the reality. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) But, my dear Friend, those shippers are misguided. If this Government is to be given credit for anything, that is for the development of ports. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes, but you have not done it. That is our complaint. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) If you have to give credit to this Government for one thing - there are many other things - but number one is development of ports which was never done before. It was earlier done under the late Mr. Lalith Athulath Mudali. You sacked him. That is all.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) So, you are admitting that he did it. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Then, we come to the terminal yard congestion. These are the complaints made by the shippers. Currently, the Colombo Port has reached its maximum handling capacity. Actually that is another problem. Therefore, the terminal operation productivity has dropped due to yard congestion and again it is affecting vessel sailing and there are berthing delays. That means you have not expanded the handling capacity of the Port sufficiently to cater to the vessels that are coming into the country. The average berth productivity of the Colombo Port is very much low compared to other competitive main ports in the region such as Bombay, Singapore and Dubai. That is the complaint we are making against the Government. Considering our limitations compared to these ports, we are now going backward. At one stage the Colombo Port was quite modern, well-equipped and it had an ability to cater to any number of shippers that was coming in. But, today it is a different situation.

Then, there are vessel manoeuvring delays. Currently, most of the vessels face unnecessary berthing and sailing delays due to insufficient facilities for manoeuvring. These are some of the matters that you should look into before you go into new harbours or try to develop new ports. Develop the existing port and give all the modern facilities to avoid delays.

The car carriers experience berthing delays of average five to six days due to short of yard space for discharging, storing, and pending clearance of vehicles. The country is importing thousands of vehicles. But, there is no space to park them; there are no yard facilities available. It is essential to find additional yard space either in the port or outside in an area in the vicinity with ample security and protection. This is a very serious problem : the parking of vehicles that are imported to the country. They say that there is no yard space and there is a shortage of customs officers and appraisers for inspection and valuation, especially for the individually-imported vehicles of permit holders and also of vehicle dealers. What is the meaning of this? Surely this is a place from where you are getting revenue. Why do you not have more people to attend to the collections? Individual importers are the most affected. They are unable to get their valuations done in order to clear their vehicles. These are the very serious problems that the Colombo Port is facing. I am sure that their annual income also must be down as a result of it. It is time that the Government looks into these shortcomings and makes arrangements to overcome them.

Though you are having a Port in Hambantota, I do not think that there are shippers who are prepared to call over. Insurance for berthing in the Hambantota Port has not been settled so far. There is no proper approval given by the other shipping lines to call over at the Hambantota Port. There is a problem. You have to concede that. It maybe that you have not completed it. Okay, there is no harm in having another port. But, our argument is, before you do that, the Colombo Port should have been developed and the shortcomings should have been attended to. That is the complaint we are making. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The fact of the matter which you have so far refused to recognize is that the Colombo Harbour is being developed and is one of the biggest projects in Asia. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) How many years will it take for the Southern Port terminal to come up? You are talking of development.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The breakwater is already complete. So, now we will work on the terminals. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Can you tell me the time frame? () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) As far as the Queen Elizabeth Quay is concerned, the private sector is working side by side with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. So, you have to look at the reality of it. As you know very well, harbours cannot be built in a day; Rome was not built in a day. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The problem is that you have not done it in time. That is our complaint. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , 2008 . ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I have another complaint to make. The Hon. Minister will understand that. There are so many road accidents today. Most of the container terminals are located in our areas. They start from Colombo and move to the North. Everyday a human being is run over by these containers.

At one stage in the good old days, we were able to bring in restrictions that container operations have to be restricted from 6.00 a.m. in the morning to 9.00 p.m. in the night, because these roads cannot hold these huge vehicles that run. School children are being run over; cyclists are being run over; cars are being knocked down. So, I would very earnestly urge the Government to bring in this restriction until the new highway is developed, not for all times, because this is a very dangerous situation. The present road is only a two-lane one. I do not know how it is in the South of Colombo. But, the North of Colombo is extremely dangerous and it is time that the Government takes notes of it. If you read the newspapers, you will find that everyday there is an accident.

The present existing roadway cannot cater to the load of vehicles that are plying on it during the day. There are huge vehicles such as 40 feet trailers and 40 feet containers that have been brought in and are moving up and down. Therefore, Hon. Minister, please take serious notice of this and make some arrangements with the Hon.

Minister in charge of this subject to bring in some regulations not to allow container traffic between 6.00 a.m. and 9.00 p.m. during week days because this is a very serious situation. This is also connected to the port development because these containers are being brought into the port from the yards that are situated outside Colombo.

Sir, in conclusion, I must say that the port is the heart of the countrys economy. If they are not functioning efficiently, then, what will suffer is the import and export trade, particularly the exports where we are dependent on the shipments. If they are not prepared to call over due to congestion or inadequate facilities, they will bypass the Colombo Port and our exporters will be left high and dry. If you go to Galle Face, you will see a line of ships waiting to come into the port. The reason is the congestion; they are unable to manoeuvre because they are big ships. As I mentioned earlier the draft is inadequate. So, I would earnestly request you to take immediate steps to rectify this situation in order to facilitate the shippers who are coming to the country. They do not want to wait even one day extra. They would turn around and go back. But, unfortunately, today a delay of four to five days' is taking place at the Colombo Harbour. Thank you.
