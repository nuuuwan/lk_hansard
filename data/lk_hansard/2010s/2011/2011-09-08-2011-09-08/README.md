( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, can we move both Items together ?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) On consent, we can move both together.

( )

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) No, you cannot do that. They are under two different Ministers; Minister of Justice and Minister of Environment. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister of Justice, you may propose. - [ Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We agreed to move both Items together and take them up for debate. That was the agreement at the Party Leaders meeting. -[Interruption]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You are one of the Party Leaders.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yes. It is in the Party Leaders minutes. If you do not want the Debate- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) So, why did you agree then?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No, no. I did not agree.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Why not? How can you say there was no agreement at the Party Leaders' meeting?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No, no. There was no agreement.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) How can you say there was no agreement at the Party Leaders' meeting? You go through the Minutes of the Party Leaders' Meeting. Hon. Deputy Speaker, may I bring to your notice that it is in the Minutes. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) There was no agreement.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, no. Let us first read the minutes. If you do not want the Debate, that is another issue.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) These are procedural Regulations.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The Minutes are not available here. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I deny -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) How can you deny it? -[Interruption.] That itself shows that the Chief Opposition Whip is confused and you do not remember what you agreed on.

" Thursday, 8th September 2011

1.00 p.m. - 2.00 p.m. - Questions for Oral Answers

2.00 p.m. - 6.30 p.m. (i) Order under the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Previsions) Act

(ii) Regulations under the National Environmental Act

(The above item (i) was presented to the House on 23.08.2011 and Item (ii) appears as Item No. 3 of the Order Paper No. 116 of 24.08.2011) "

That is how it reads. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We agreed to move both together.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, the two Items are to be debated separately.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) They are to be taken up together. That is what it means.

331 332

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We have done it before. We have taken up two Items together.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) No, you cannot take them together. Does it state that we agreed to take both together ? -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) No, no. It does not. - [Interruption.] You must go by the inference.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) If we agree to take them together we record it that they are taken together. We have done that on many occasions. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) If there is disagreement, the Items can be taken up separately. Otherwise, if both parties agree, both Items can be taken up together and cut short the time. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, we have time till 6.30 p.m. That is the normal order of the day. -[Interruption.] Please do not mislead the House. Let us go on with the normal Business. There are two Items -

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You are going back on the agreement that you reached.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No, no.-[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I am very sorry that the Chief Opposition Whip is confused. You all are confused over other matters, but do not get confused about Parliamentary Business. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) So, if there is disagreement, the House can grant two hours and a quarter to each Item.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No. There are so many speakers on our side to speak on Item No. 1, the Order under the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Two Items are listed for Debate today. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) But, there was a notice to say that the Item No. 2 is to be moved out. I can produce that notice. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) No. There was no such notice issued. The two Items can be taken up together or separately by agreement. I put it to the House to decide. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) We want three hours for Item No. 1.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Three hours means, till 5 o clock we will go on? ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) One hour for the Regulations under the National Environmental Act.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) At least two hours should be given to debate the Regulations under the National Environmental Act. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) With due respect, Sir, you must understand the importance of Item No. 1.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) It is up to House to understand and to propose.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes. So, I am asking for three hours.

333 334

2011 08

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Do you mean to say that the Regulations under the National Environmental Act are not important? Are you trying to say that?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) It is important.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) So?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) But, this is more important.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) What we have agreed-[Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Propose of consent.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Okay. Then let Item No. 2 go unopposed. Can we come to that understanding? Do you agree? -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, you brought the Seventeenth Amendment, you brought the Eighteenth Amendment- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) That is why you ended up in court. You have been taken to court for that by the UNP itself. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Chief Government Whip, I do not think that there is any opposition to the Regulations under the National Environmental Act, but they want to make some comments on it. That is all. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) There are so many other parties and they all want to speak. It is not only the UNP.-[Interruption.] You do all this because you all are confused. You do not know whether you want to oppose or not. A section wants to oppose; a section wants to support and a section wants to run away. That is the situation that you all are faced with. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Some are confused and some are amused. -[Interruption.] Inform me of your agreement. What is the agreement?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, in the name of democracy we are asking for three hours to debate Item No. 1. Why are you trying to stifle that?-[Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Then there will be three hours is for the Item No. 1 which is an Order under the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act, and one hour for the Regulations under the National Environmental Act. Does the House agree?

( ) (Hon. Members) Aye. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Deputy Speaker, May I proceed?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes.

335 336

( ) : ( ) : CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE (SPECIAL PROVISIONS) ACT: ORDER

[2.01 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) I move, That the Order made by the Minister of Justice under subsection (2) of section 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act, No.42 of 2007, and published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1708/5 of May 30th, 2011, which was presented on 23.08.2011, be approved.

Sir, this particular Item relates to the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act, No. 42 of 2007. We are seeking to extend the operation of this Act as per the Gazette Notification that has been published on the 30th of May 2011 for a further period of two years.

Sir, the provisions of this Act basically go to curtail the inquiry procedure before magistrates, to prevent protracted inquiries and to expedite the delay that is entailed in criminal matters before the magistrate. We have, for the third time, now come before the House to extend it once again.

The legal effect is to enhance the period of detention in police custody beyond the 24 hours that is described in the Criminal Procedure Code to 48 hours and that too, in certain specified circumstances only. If at all a police officer wishes to go beyond 24 hours and hold a suspect in custody, then he will have to get an officer, not below the rank of an ASP, to get permission to continue detention and that is also under judicial supervision. I must say very specifically, if required, a suspect is entitled even to ask for the assistance of an Attorney-at-Law, which is not even provided in the Fundamental Rights Chapter of the Constitution. Access to an Attorney-at-Law is not there as a matter of right even under Article 13 of our Fundamental Rights Chapter. But we have in this case provided for all those safeguards since a suspect is sought to be held beyond 24 hours and that too with a limit of only 48 hours. This has been quite useful in trying to successfully complete investigations and bring the suspects before the process of law in this country.

And then, the other particular amendment that this Act envisages, the change that it brings, is empowering the Attorney-General to forward direct indictments in certain cases. Those types of cases have already been given in

the Schedule and this, too, in cases where it creates public disquiet. For instance, a case which creates concern among the public like the recent Angulana murder case. There, when the Attorney-General feels that a direct indictment is better, the discretion is conferred on him to call for the file and file direct indictments cutting short the procedure that is entailed in the Criminal Procedure Code to circumvent the summary procedure there. Sir, this has been in operation for the last six years. The very fact that our Government is only extending it for a period of two years as envisaged here is to see the efficacy and the acceptability of such a procedure not only from the Official Bar and the Judiciary side but also to see whether our Bar Association, the private bar is satisfied with this procedure. What I feel is that we could certainly bring it as a permanent amendment into the Criminal Procedure Code after some discussion if this is acceptable to all the stakeholders. And this matter, we can discuss later. But I feel that we need not have these temporary provisions being extended all the time. I must say that when this matter came up before the Cabinet, I was a Minister in the then Cabinet, and what was sought to be done was to have a permanent feature, a permanent amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code. There were several of us who were lawyer-Ministers in the Cabinet who felt that this must be properly bounced off with all the stakeholders before we bring in these changes.

That is why we finally amended it as a temporary provision for two years. So, once again, we are placing it and we can look at the way it functions. After sufficient discussion, we may consider to have this as a permanent feature of our Criminal Procedure Code.

I was told that there have been certain issues relating to the gazetting of the Act itself. That has been done well within the time as envisaged by Section 7(2) which states, I quote: . within one month prior to the expiration of the period of operation of this Act.

That had been duly done and we would wish that the House approves this extension of the Act that we are seeking by this Gazette Notification.

There has been a similar issue yesterday where some Members of the Opposition were seeking to make out that the Government is intending to virtually declare military law all over the country by the Gazette Notification that had been published. - [Interruption.] No, this is not a similar one. This is an ordinary law. But I must very clearly say that even yesterdays argument was quite misplaced because these are powers vested in the President and he has duly gazetted and again on the 06th of this month another Gazette, Gazette No. 1722/ 17 has been issued calling upon the armed forces to maintain law and order and assist the police. In extraordinary circumstances this power is vested in the President to call upon the armed forces. In fact, I had a lengthy chat

337 338

2011 08

with the Commander of the Army this morning. He very specifically says that only when the police calls upon the Army to come and assist them, they will come out, otherwise they are confined to the barracks. - [Interruption.] That is in certain cases. You must understand, only in certain districts-

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Jaffna Peninsula also- ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Let me finish first. You can bring it up later.

Only in two districts - Kurunegala and Kalutara - we do not have permanent camps. There are permanent camps in the rest of the districts and armed forces are confined to the camps. - [Interruption.] Only when the police calls upon - [Interruption.] A responsible government has to maintain law and order. We know what an anomalous situation, what a difficult situation was created with this Grease Yaka issue all over the country and any responsible government will have to see that law and order is enforced. - [ Interruption.] No. Law and order has to be enforced. Armed forces would get involved in only when the police cannot curtail a situation. I personally had to go to certain areas.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) , ,-[ ] ,-[ ] ? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Let me come to that. ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) . [ ] , ? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) This particular issue was such a challenge and some of our Ministers had to go personally to certain areas to calm down the people and to bring the issue under control. We saw how unruly the people were.

For whatever reason, things had to be explained to them. We had to take a long time in trying to calm the people down. This happened in Pottuvil and Kinniya

where I had to personally go with some of my other Colleagues to bring the situation under control. But, then - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) It is the army who brings them to the army camps.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, I must categorically say - [Interruption.] There are certain people who are trying to create unnecessary trouble by implicating the armed forces in this whole issue. Armed forces are there to maintain law and order and they are confined to the barracks. The Commander of the Army confirms that they are not been deployed outside, unless the police asks for their assistance and that is if they cannot contain a situation and if there is a riotous situation. You saw what happened in London a month ago.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Deputy Speaker, may I also say this. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Hon Minister, you continue. -[Interruption.]

Hon. Member please sit down. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Deputy Speaker, may I also very categorically say that the Public Security Ordinance provides very clearly that even in the case where armed forces are called out to maintain public order, they cannot detain people. Even if people are arrested by the armed forces, the armed forces cannot hold people in detention. They have to hand them over to the police and this - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) They manhandled me -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Those are matters that you can always canvass before courts. -[Interruption.] Sometimes, certain excesses do happen. I am not saying excesses do not happen. Certain excesses can happen. You may have got beaten up; I would have got beaten up and others would have got beaten up. This may have happened. But, a responsible

government has to have some provisions to maintain the law and order and those provisions have been exercised. In this Navanthurai incident, the report has been submitted to the Magistrate. You can go ahead and take action. That is there. If there had been excesses, you have judicial supervision. Sir, in this country, there is proper judicial supervision on the conduct of the armed forces and the police. That we are not taking away. I am giving you the assurance that this country's judiciary is there for you to go and complain and if that complaint is seen as something that is proved, then, that will be looked into. -[Interruption.] Let us forget. You may have an issue with Sudharman Radaliyagoda and others. But then these are -[Interruption.]

Some people are so enamored with some media persons and are all the time talking about them. There are various other innocent people. Talk about them. -[Interruption.] Let me very clearly -[Interruption.] I am not saying-[Interruption.] That is why I am saying if there are excesses- [Interruption.] No. I am saying that excesses do take place.-[Interruption.] Do not try to impute motives to what I am saying. I am saying if there are excesses, please bring it to the notice.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) All the indictments have been withdrawn.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Withdrawn by whom?

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) By the Attorney-General's Department.[Interruption.] What have you got to say about that? There is no law and order in this country.[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) For any specific case, you can go and interview the Attorney-General. He has the right to enter a nolle prosequi in any particular case where he is satisfied but then you have to- [Interruption.] If there are specific cases-[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon.

There is one Gazette published under Section 7(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act.

Where is the Gazette published under Section 7(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act? There is one Gazette published by the Hon. V. Puththirasigamoney under Section 7(2). I accept that. That was published on 29th May, 2009. There has to be another one to the effect that it has to been approved by Parliament stating the date. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, I must admit that. It is true that the Gazette was sent to Parliament. But, the approval was not got. So, it has to be debated now. There is no time limit for that. This has been an act of my predecessor. But, still, there is no time limit for approval. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) No, that is very specific. , ( ) 7(3) :

"(1) ."

. 7(4) . . . . . It must be presented to Parliament for approval. It is very much like the state of Emergency. Then, we insisted that it be put in a gazette. I mean, this is one of the reasons we all took part in that Debate. We insisted that it be published in a gazette, then, people may know about it. Because this interferes with people's legitimate rights where you could have been confined to 48 hours instead of 24 hours. So, people must know that this Act has been extended beyond 2007. Now, that Gazette is missing. Without that Gazette you cannot bring in this Gazette. That was in the last Parliament. And that Parliament was dissolved in 2010. So, everything done under that Parliament has ceased to function.

. . . . . , . . That is why I have raised a point of Order. Before we go any further into this, if there is no gazette, the matter must be referred to the Hon. Speaker.

This is a very important matter that we will ask you to do. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) ,7(4) . . . . . . . - [ ] . - [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) ? . - [ ] . . [ ] ( ) (The Hon.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, according to the Standing Orders, it is very clear. If any paper is presented to Parliament, it must go into the minutes and to the Hansard. If they can produce the Hansard which shows that this Gazette Notification has been presented to Praliament or tabled in Parliament, then we will withdrew this argument. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)

, . . . 2007 42 2009 31 . . . . . , , . , , . . , . ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Rauff Hakeem. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I have carefully listened to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and my Colleague, learned Presidents Counsel, the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. They have raised two issues. One issue particularly pertains to Section 7 (4) of the Act itself. Section 7 (4) of the Act states, I quote:

A Notification specifying of the date on which Parliament has approved the Order shall be published in the Gazette. Before coming to that I would like to say this. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition sought to draw a parallel between the Public Security Ordinance and this Act. When the state of Emergency is declared by the President, there is a specific provision which says that within ten days - a time limit is mentioned - this House has to meet and approve the Emergency Regulations; otherwise it lapses within 14 days. That is a specific provision. A time limit is given and the lapsing takes place automatically. But this is not such an instance where a specific time limit is given. The responsibility of the Government is to gazette it but there is no time limit given to seek the approval of Parliament. Therefore, that must be borne in mind, Mr. Deputy Speaker, because this would otherwise create an unnecessary anomalous situation. That is something that must be borne in mind. I must thank the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. In his

enthusiasm he has given me this fact. Of course, he was also trying to score some brownie points on this whole issue of armed forces being called out to say as if we are going break all the houses in Colombo. He is again - [Interruption.] No. no. ( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, Hon. Minister says that there is no time limit given in the Act. It is not correct. Look at Section 7 (2). According to that there is a specific time period given within which you will have to publish the Gazette.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That is so. That I agree. We have done that. ( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Our complaint is, you have not done so.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) We have done that. ( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) This is not like a Regulation under the Emergency Law which is done by exercising the powers of His Excellency the President. This is an Act. You are going to give life to a dead Act. There is no live Act. How can you extend it? When an Act has been expired, it is expired. Unless you bring a new Act by way of a Gazette Notification, how can you extend it? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) My respectful submission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is this. Section 7 (2) of the Act speaks about the period within which the Gazette must be published. Section 7 (2) states, I quote: within one month prior to the expiration of the period of operation of this Act, I can produce the Gazette published on 30th May, 2009 if necessary, in relation to the previous instance. That Gazette is available.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) The Act says, 30 days prior to expiration.

355 356

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No. It has not lapsed. ( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) The Act states, "30 days prior to the expiration". ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)No, it says, within one month. Please, do not read outside the Act, read the Act itself. That aspect is very clearly covered. It says, I quote: .at any time within one month prior to the expiration... So, we have only that one month before the expiration for us to gazette, which the Government had done very diligently. ( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Where is the approval?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The approval is an issue. There is no time limit for approval. - [Interruption.] With respect to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, unlike in the Proclamation of a state of Emergency, there is no specified time limit here. The Act talks about an approval. Therefore,-

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) But, the time limit cannot exceed two years. Certainly, the time limit given for gazetting cannot exceed two years.-[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Deputy Speaker, you have to carefully consider this. -[Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Certainly, you cannot say that there is no time limit. Then you can even publish it after three years or -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Deputy Speaker, my learned Friend, Hon. Sumanthiran, is bringing out another supplementary issue

where he says that the time period for which we can extend this particular Act of application is prescribed as two years and that when it passes beyond two years, the third extension cannot take place without the second extension being approved. My respectful submission is that- .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It cannot exceed two years. -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Be that as it may, but, my contention, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is that it is well within the ambit of powers of this House to approve two Gazette Notifications together. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, you cannot do that. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Because, this particular issue has not been raised. - [Interruption.] There was no time limit specified. Mr. Deputy Speaker, we have placed all the facts before you. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is your point of Order?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You cannot consider this as the third extension without the second extension being complete. Surely, the Hon. Minister must know that. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Minister, you may continue.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Deputy Speaker, we have placed all the facts before you. My contention is, since there is no time limit for approval by Parliament, Parliament can approve it at a time suitable to it as long as this matter has not been

357 358

2011 08

challenged. Now that they have challenged, my contention is, that both these Gazette Notifications could be approved together and with those submissions -[Interruption.] It is up to you. You can suspend the Sittings and then consider this matter. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe)

. . rose.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, Emergency Regulations are law and therefore whatever he says - in this instance also I am talking of legislation - but let us keep the Emergency Regulations aside. I am quoting Article 76 (1) of the Constitution which states: Parliament shall not abdicate or in any manner alienate its legislative power, Now, under its legislative power it passed this law for two years and then at the end of it you can either extend it by bringing in an amending Act or, like in many legislations you have provision to extend it by a Resolution of Parliament - either before it passes or by giving notice after that date. Now what we have done in this House is, one month before you must give notice saying, We are going to extend it. So, people are aware of it. If you do not do so, it lapses. The Hon. Puththirasigamoney as the Acting Minister gave notice of it. But, that is not sufficient. The law also requires that it has to be approved by Parliament and it has to be gazetted, because this is the exercise of legislative power. Now, my Hon. Friend says that there was no date put. But, I have a different view. Let us say that there was no date put and you could have taken it up in December or any other time, but you had given notice. But the fact is that the Parliament to which this Gazette was tabled was dissolved. So, the whole thing came to an end with it and that is all. I do not concede but, you can say for arguments sake that everything done until the day the Parliament dissolved is valid. But, even in that case you cannot go beyond that and say that anything done after that is valid. You did not gazette it. When the new Parliament met in April, you cannot come and re-gazette it because the Gazette had to come just one month before. So, irrespective the Hon. Puththirasigamoneys Gazette, the whole thing, the Act, has lapsed. You cannot now say that you are going to pass it. As the Minister of Justice, you have to look at that side. If there has been a mistake made by you, admit it and look at

some other way of bringing this in. We have our own views on it. But, nevertheless, as far as the procedure is concerned, there is no Act; there is no authority, because Section 7 no longer operates. There have to be two switches to be put on, two Gazettes - one is the Gazette published one month before the expiration date and the other is the Gazette notifying the passage. There is no notice here to this House or to the country that this has been passed. The House has been dissolved. So, since my Friend has admitted that there is no Gazette under Section 7(4), he has not complied under Section 7 (4). This is why it is such an important issue and I feel that with the view of the House, that this matter be referred to the Hon. Speaker. Then, he can get advice even from outside to go ahead, because whatever it is, this is invalid. So, refer it to the Hon. Speaker. He has to give a Ruling on it. Since he is the Chairman of the CPA now, he can get advice even from the CPA. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Deputy Speaker, ultimately it is in your hands as the Leader of the Opposition said. They have raised a few issues but then, on the last point of this earlier Gazette having been published during the tenure of the earlier Parliament and with the lapsing of that Parliament that the application of that Gazette beyond the life of that Parliament, is not an issue for us, because in case if the Gazette has been published, say one year prior to the expiration of the earlier Parliament and then it overlaps beyond to another year, despite the fact that a new Parliament come into being that does not mean that the operation of that Gazette and the extension of this Act is not there. You cannot argue in that fashion. But in any event, I would say with respect that the House could approve both these Gazette notifications together to validate them. In any event this is a matter for your consideration. I would urge you to suspend the House and take advice and rule on it.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I do not agree with what he says. But if you are going on the basis the Gazette is still valid, then the Gazette should have been put into the next Parliament, passed and the Gazette under Section 7(4) published before May 2011. You did not do the ratification. You have not done it. I do not agree with it. But if you take it, it has lapsed. That is why I say such a issue - it is up to you Hon. Deputy Speaker, to refer it to the Hon.Speaker, take all views and decide on it. This is a matter which affects the Fundamental Rights of the people.

359 360

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I would like to add, if it is illegal, all detained for 48 hours are liable for compensation. -[Interruption.] Anyway, they could take it up. It is a very serious matter.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) We have to bring a law for that.-[Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon, Members, I have considered the submissions of all the Hon. Members. The issue is as to whether this can be raised as a point of Order. According to Kaul and Shakdher it is very clear that a legality of a Bill cannot be raised as a point of Order. It is very clear. If I may read out from Kaul and Shakdher, No point of Order should be raised on whether a Bill is constitutionally within the legislative competence of the House or about the constitutionality of any Declaration/Agreement/Treaty, under discussion on a Motion/Resolution: it is for the House to deal with such matters and should a Member wish to have a clarification from a Minister or object to any statement which a Minister may have made he should say so in the House with the permission of the Speaker, and should not raise it in the garb of points of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, there is no Bill before this House.-[Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) It refers to any matter. -[Interruption.] Hon. Members, legality or constitutionality of any matter cannot be raised by way of a point of Order.-[Interruption.] This precedence has been followed during Speaker Anura Bandaranaike's time. In that instance also, in regard to the Emergency this position has been taken up and that precedence is followed. -[Interruption.]

Therefore the Chair is not in a position to take a decision. So, it is up to the House to continue. -[Interruption.] The House has now been given a Ruling. You can continue.-[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) There is no Bill before the House.-[Interruption.] I am challenging your Ruling.-[Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You cannot challenge the Ruling of the Chair. -[Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) It is a very serious breach of Standing Orders.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I raised a point of Order- ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) It was not a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Kindly let me speak.-[Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) There is no Bill before the House. Show us the Bill. -[Uproar.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Precedence cited was on Emergency. -[Uproar.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I rise to a point of Order. -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition, what is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Do not disturb the Hon. Leader of the Opposition.-[Interruption.]

361 362

2011 08

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) If you read the Minutes of the Party Leaders' Meeting and also the Order Paper, there is no Bill before the House.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Exactly!

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) We are debating the Regulations and the validity of the Regulations -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) It is very clear ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, can you listen to me? We, both sides, have been debating only the validity of the Regulations. The validity of the Bill is also there. We have said that Section 7(2) does not enable you to make Regulations and neither side has addressed on the validity of the Bill. Both sides have talked about the validity of the Regulations and you have given a Ruling on the validity of the Bill. It just cannot happen. That is why I have asked you to refer this matter to the Speaker. We, both sides, are agreeable to refer this to the Hon. Speaker. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, you have not understood what the precedence is. The Ruling has been given on the constitutionality -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Item No. 02 to be moved by the Hon. A.R.M. Abdul Cader.

: : NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL ACT: REGULATIONS

[3.40 p.m.]

... ( )

( ... - ) (The Hon. A.R.M. Abdul Cader - Deputy Minister of Environment) Sir, on behalf of the Minister of Environment, I move,

That the Regulations made by the Minister of Environment and Natural Resources under Section 32 (2) (h) of the National Environmental Act, No. 47 of 1980, and published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1627/19 of November 10th, 2009, which were presented on 09.08.2011, be approved.

(Cabinet approval signified.)

Hon. Deputy Speaker, improper management of waste may be a source of danger to natural environment and public health. Rapid development for fast economic growth to raise the living standard of people leads to increase of quantity of the municipal solid waste. Further, solid waste is a pollutant of air, water and soil and it is also an aesthetic or visual pollutant.

Haphazard disposal of waste along the roadways had been a serious issue in Sri Lanka probably in the main cities. In 2008, this matter was discussed at a stakeholder committee meeting and it was noted that one of the main reasons is absence of regulation which compels the local authorities and the general public to drive for a proper waste collection system.

It is the public duty of the government agencies vested with the responsibilities of protecting the environment and managing environmental pollution to regulate waste management within the country. With a view to addressing the above problem caused by improper solid waste management and to avoid dumping and collection of garbage alongsides of national highways during daytime, the Central Environmental Authority has taken an initiative to regulate cleaning of streets by Order published under Gazette No. 1627/19 dated 10.11.2009 under the provisions of the National Environmental Act, No. 47 of 1980 amended by Act, No. 56 of 1988 and Act, No. 53 of 2000.

The provisions of this Gazette Notification allow dumping solid waste only at places designated by the relevant local authority or by a person authorized by them on that behalf. No person is allowed to dump municipal solid waste along the sides of national highways. Further, it only allows collecting municipal solid waste during 6.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. from respective households and from 6.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. from any designated places.

Since the issue is very crucial in the Western Province, it was decided to implement this Regulation in the Western Province initially and thereafter extend it to the other provinces. Initially, it was decided to implement this Regulation within the limits of municipal councils and urban councils since the issue is very much focused on the national highways which are located within these limits.

Sir, the Central Environmental Authority has taken action to inform all the municipal councils and urban councils in the Western Province to inform the CEA of the designated places for dumping municipal solid waste as mentioned in the Regulation. Most of the local authorities have responded to the above request. Discussions are underway with the local authorities and the Police Department as to how this Regulation should be effectively enforced to achieve the objectives of the Regulation.

Thank you. . . Question proposed.

[3.44 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) On behalf of the Opposition, first of all I would like to congratulate the "Acting" Minister of Environment. We wanted to oppose and contest this Item, but because of him we are not doing it. Sir, there is one amendment to the Regulations. For protecting the environment, you have taken in the Army these days. They are doing a lot of cleaning in the city of Colombo. So, I think you should include that also. We are very much concerned about the environment, there is no debate on it. We all want to protect the environment. So, these Regulations are welcome. But only see that the Army is also brought into that.

Thank you. , . . Question put, and agreed to.

Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Vinayagamoorthy, carry on, please. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Deputy Chairman, thank you very much for giving me permission to move the Adjournment Motion today. I move,

"Some people are causing havoc and injuries to the Tamil speaking people in Jaffna.

On 22nd August 2011 at about 10.30 p.m. at Navanthurai two strange men were found and when the people chased them they went in to a Navy camp and thereafter several people gathered and they wanted the two strange men who went into the camp to be handed over to them.

Some incidents took place between Navy personnel and the crowd gathered there. On that night at about 1.00 a.m. the Army officers went to every house at Navanthurai and assaulted the men and women and they seemed to have harassed the women sexually.

About 200 persons got injured and hundred persons were arrested by the Police.

Eighteen of them were seriously injured and them admitted to the hospital for treatment, one person's leg was broken and another person's hand was broken.

I wish to ask the Government what steps they would take to bring the situation under control."

The state of Emergency is over. But strange men linger on. Though His Excellency the President has decided not to extend the state of Emergency, it is not going to benefit anybody unless the Prevention of Terrorism Act is also repealed.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Member, there is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, the Hon. Member has given notice of this Adjournment Motion and I would like to raise a point of Order. As per Standing Order No. 31(6), this matter is before the courts, it is sub judice. Therefore, we cannot take up this Adjournment Motion.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) I will give you an assurance, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees and the Hon. Minister, that I will not refer to any court proceedings.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) What has been given notice is about a matter that is before the courts. It is already proceeding in the courts. So, this matter cannot be taken up. I am very sorry, the Hon. Member should have -

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) I only want to tell the Hon. Minister and the Hon. Deputy Chairman that I will only refer to what has happened in Navanthurai on that night.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You give it in writing. But you cannot raise that matter in the House now. Here I have raised a point of Order. It cannot be done. There is a procedure and we would like to follow the procedure. That is all. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, Hon. Azwer.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Deputy Chairman, I would like to substantiate the point of Order raised by the Chief Government Whip. It should be the duty of all Members of this House not to negate or violate the Standing Orders, which is very often happening, as we saw in the behaviour of the Leader of the Opposition a little while earlier. - [Interruption.] Wait, wait! You all are the people. - [Interruption.] . . - Sir, I would like to say this also. When the Hon. Deputy Speaker is giving a Ruling - the Hon. Deputy Speaker has all the powers of the Speaker - no one, including the Leader of the Opposition has any right to intervene. That he did today. That is why I raised that point of Order. Now this point of Order - [Interruption.] Wait, wait. Standing Order No. 31(6) - [Interruption.] Now you are again violating the Standing Orders. I am holding the Floor. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, that is a different matter.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I have not read it. Standing Order No. 31(6) is very clear. I am educating all Members of this House that they must abide by the Standing Orders strictly. Standing Order No. 31(6) states, I quote:

"A question must not refer to any matter which is under adjudication ..."

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I am on a point of Order. I have not finished it. One point of Order must be over to raise another point of Order He does not know even that procedure.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Clearly mention your point of Order. Do not enter into arguments.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) As pointed out by the Chief Government Whip, Standing Order No. 30(6) very clearly states, I quote:

A question must not refer to any matter which is under adjudication by a court of law or to any matter on which a judicial decision is pending.

Sir, since this matter is before the courts and the judicial decision is pending, my contention is that you have to order - I am very sorry to say this, the Hon. Vinayagamoorthy is a very good friend of mine - that it cannot be taken up until the case is over.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Wrong interpretation. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) . . rose.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. John Amaratunga, do you want to raise a point of Order? - [Interruption.] Order, please! - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, with due respect to my Friend, the Chief Government Whip, time and again in this House Debates have come up and it has been agreed that if you do not refer to the subject matter of any case, general principles can be debated. There are enough Rulings that have been given by the Speakers. This is not something new. I think, Sir, the Hon. Vinayagamoorthy should be allowed to go on. Let it be conditional.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) This matter has come up thrice before the courts and a "B" Report was filed on the 23rd of August under B 484/2011. So, I would request the Hon. Member that we follow the normal procedure. He could have spoken yesterday on the general situation in the North. - [Interruption.] No, he has given notice of this specific question. Now we cannot change it.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Vinayagamoorthy, this matter is before the courts. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) I am not saying anything about the courts or what has happened in the courts. I am only speaking about what has happened to the people at Navanthurai.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That has to be decided by courts.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No. Then you cannot talk about anything here in this House.
