2. If the Governments targeted 8 per cent growth is to be achieved, the total investment of the country should be around 35-40 per cent of GDP. Further, public investment needs to be maintained at around 6-7 per cent of GDP in the medium term and private investment needs to be increased from the current level of 19-20 per cent to beyond 30 per cent. Such a rapid increase in investment cannot be attracted through our domestic resources alone, since domestic savings are inadequate. Under such circumstances, while expediting a national development drive, the country must attract foreign investment.

3. If we are to achieve the growth target of 8 per cent, we must create an investor friendly, political, social and economic environment in the country. There are over 150 other developing countries in the world competing to attract

foreign investment. As the saying goes, we are not the 'only girl on the beach'. Hence hindrances to investment need to be identified and overcome and eliminated.

(i) the strategic importance attached to the proposed provision of goods and services, which will be of benefit to the public

(ii) the substantial flow of foreign exchange to the country

(iii) the substantial employment which will be generated and the enhancement of the income earning opportunities
