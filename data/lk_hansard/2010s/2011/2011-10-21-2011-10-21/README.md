. . Question proposed. , INJUSTICE TO TAMIL-SPEAKING PEOPLE IN NORTH AND EAST

[2.24 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Speaker, I shall first place before the House the following Adjournment Motion.

Whereas the Tamil National Alliance - the Illankai Tamil Arasu Katchi - has since the conclusion of the war in May 2009, raised in Parliament and raised with His Excellency the President, and with the Sri Lankan Government, several issues pertaining to military activities, purported development activities, religious and cultural activities and other State sponsored policies and administrative and political programmes and actions in the predominantly Tamil- speaking North-Eastern part of the country, comprising of the Northern and Eastern Provinces, which have the effect of irreversibly harming the future well-being of the Tamil people in the said areas, transforming the demographic composition of these areas to the permanent detriment of

672 673

2011 21

the Tamil-speaking people and adversely impacting on the cultural and linguistic identity of these areas.

And whereas these activities:

(i) pertain to State land and private land,

(ii) forcible and unauthorized occupation of lands - by the armed forces and members of the majority community with the explicit or tacit approval of the Government,

(iii) preventing displaced Tamil people from occupying and using lands which they have occupied and used in the past and which they are legitimately entitled to occupy and use,

(iv) arbitrary allocation of lands for military purposes and for alleged development purposes only to members of the majority community unjustly depriving the Tamil people of the benefits of such allocations and while thousands of Tamil families in these areas are landless,

(v) take over of land for majoritarian religious and cultural purposes,

(vi) deprivation to which the Tamil people are subjected in the use of religious and cultural sites historically used by them,

(vii) destruction of Tamil religious sites historically used by them,

(viii) politically motivated changes in administrative boundaries adversely impacting on existing administrative boundaries to the detriment of the Tamil people,

(ix) militarization of the administration and the consequent ineffectiveness of the civilian administration,

(x) not respecting the democratic verdicts of the Tamil people depriving them of due political recognition, and access to any form of governance,

(xi) attempts to introduce new procedures in regard to the registration of ownership of private land in a manner that severely impinges on the fundamental right to private ownership of land.

And whereas the Sri Lankan Government has not responded in any manner to such representations made on behalf of the Tamil people, and continues to engage in such harmful actions clearly indicating that the Government is not merely unconcerned with and indifferent to such legitimate representations, but, also that the Government is implementing a definite policy with certain political objectives and that the Government will not be deflected from the continued implementation of that policy until its goal is achieved.

And whereas this policy of the Government is clearly based upon its military victory and its view that consequently the Tamil people will have to submit to all the actions of the Government however capricious and unjust such actions may be and that the Government will not redress the grievances of the Tamil people however legitimate and deserving of attention such grievances may be.

And whereas the continued implementation of such policies and programmes would result in a fait accompli - where the demographic composition and linguistic and cultural identity of the Northern and Eastern Provinces would be transformed - as required by the Government and where the political influence of the Tamil-speaking people would be progressively diminished and over a period of time become increasingly irrelevant.

And whereas while the Government claims to follow a policy of reconciliation and to advance the growth of goodwill amongst different peoples, so as to bring about permanent peace and harmony amongst the different peoples, what is in fact happening is just the reverse where the Tamil people are being further embittered and alienated by being treated as inferior citizens in their own country to which they have belonged from time immemorial and for as long as anybody else."

. . ( ) ( . . - , ) (The Hon. H.R. Mithrapala - Deputy Minister of Livestock and Rural Community Development) Hon. Member, there are other Tamil leaders in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I do not want to be disturbed, Sir, when I am moving my Motion. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Please do not disturb him. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. H.R. Mithrapala) There are so many communities in the country -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) He might be asked to sit down, Sir.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Hon. Member, you may continue. , . .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) "Whereas the Tamil people are determined to make their best efforts to ensure that there is no recurrence of violence and therefore consider it necessary to bring to the notice of the Parliament, the true situation prevalent on the ground in the North and the East of Sri Lanka which is neither conducive to reconciliation or permanent peace and harmony. The Tamil people have the genuine fear that if there is recurrence of violence, they would be the worst affected.

The Tamil people are of the view that what is happening to them in the North and the East of Sri Lanka is not known to Parliament and that the truth should be known so that a future tragedy and future loss of life and destruction in the North Eastern part of Sri Lanka could be avoided."

You would appreciate, Mr. Speaker, from the ultimate paragraph in my Motion, that my Motion's objective is to ensure that there is permanent peace and harmony in this country, that there will be no recurrence of violence and if

674 675

that is to be achieved, then, inevitably and imperatively the Government must address the concerns expressed in this Parliament on behalf of the Tamil people.

I have, in the course my Motion, listed out our concerns largely pertaining to land, militarization, ineffectiveness in the civilian administration and also pertaining to development activities, where particularly lands are being made available only to persons of the majority community and not to persons of other communities, disregarding even the claims of landless people living in those areas where Tamil religious and cultural sites have come under attack and where the Tamil people are not being permitted to use such cultural and religious sites as they have done hitherto. Those are serious matters which must be attended to if we are to have permanent peace in this country and if we are to bring about reconciliation among the different peoples we have in this country. I do not think any Member in this House will dispute that.

After all, what we are primarily concerned is, with putting the conflict behind us and ensuring that we look forward to a different future, where all the peoples in this country can live as equal citizens and based on such equality and justice, that we build this country afresh and take this country forward for the benefit of all its peoples. That is the spirit, Sir, in which I have brought this Motion; it is not brought in a spirit of confrontation. But, I must say that having tried for over two years to bring some of these matters to the notice of the Government - I have met with the President; I have met with the Hon. Ministers; we have spoken in Parliament; we have raised these matters in Parliament; we have had private discussions with the President and the Government; we have written to the President; I have even refrained from releasing those letters to the press because I did not want to exacerbate feelings and tensions amongst different peoples and we have kept them quiet - nothing is happening. There is no change; things are moving in the same way and I do not think, Sir, if things move in the same way, that it will do this country any good. Therefore, it is my duty, I think, Sir, to bring these matters to the notice of the Government and appeal to the Government to take remedial action to ensure that there is permanent peace and harmony based upon justice and equality.

We need to know why the Government is behaving in this way. Is the Government wanting to punish the Tamil people for whatever the LTTE had done? Does the Government think that by carrying on programmes of this nature, they can further change the demographic composition of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces and further, politically weaken the strength of the Tamil-speaking people in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces? Is it the Government's objective to ensure that,

in due course of time, the Northern and the Eastern Provinces will also not continue to be majority Tamil-speaking areas, but will be converted into areas where the majority community is a majority? Is that your objective? That is what we need to know.

We need to urge that such a policy will be very unwise. Such a policy was never pursued by the Hon. S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. The Hon. Bandaranaike, through the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact, sought to ensure that the cultural and linguistic identity of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces was preserved. Unfortunately, political rivalry at that time did not permit that Pact to be implemented. If that Pact was implemented, this country would never have gone through a violent phase. The Hon. Bandaranaike was one of the greatest leaders this country had and the founder of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.

He was followed, some years later, by the Hon. Dudley Senanayake. In 1965, there was the Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact, which again was not implemented on account of political rivalry between the two main political parties. If the Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact had been implemented, this country would never have gone through a violent phase. The purpose of the Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact, as in the case of the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact, was to preserve the linguistic and cultural identity of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. That is why I say, Sir, that great Sinhalese leaders had accepted the fact that certain things must be recognized, certain things must be guaranteed, certain things must be ensured if there is to be permanent peace and harmony in this country and surely, we cannot find taller leaders than the Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike of the SLFP and the Hon. Dudley Senanayake of the UNP, both of whom took the same view. That is why I think it is my duty, as a senior Member of Parliament from the Tamil people, to state this in Parliament and make an appeal to my Friends in Parliament. I know, most of you are reasonable people; I know that many of you would not approve of many of the things that are happening, but things are happening.

I asked someone yesterday, Is there only one Government in this country or is there another Government within the Government? I am not blaming President Mahinda Rajapaksa. I am not saying he is not to blame. He should stop these things; he should change these things. I am disappointed that that is not being done, but I often wonder whether there is somebody else within the Government, who is engineering things, achieving things and getting things done and whether President Mahinda Rajapaksa is compelled to be a silent spectator. If that is the position, we want the position to change; we do not want this to go on because you cannot suppress the people.

The Tamils are a distinct people; the Tamils are a people with a distinct identity. They have their

676 677

[ . ]

2011 21

civilization; they have their culture; they have their history. They have lived in this country as long as anybody else, perhaps, longer than many others. We want to preserve that and when we find that there is a systematic programme and a policy towards undermining us in areas in which we have historically lived, I think the only way we can ensure that our identity is preserved is, by speaking up in regard to these matters, appealing to your conscience to reverse these things and not to permit these things to continue.

After all, we all claim to live in a Buddhist country. Lord Buddha was the noblest Son of Asia. I do not think Asia produced a nobler son than Lord Buddha and surely, we must be, at least to some extent, truthful to his teachings.

We must not call ourselves Buddhists and as persons who are proud of being in a Buddhist country and practise what is essentially non-Buddhist against the tenets of Buddhism, against the principles of Buddhism. Therefore, Sir, I think this is something which the Hon. Members of this House should bear in mind.

Before I get on to some other matters that I would like to deal with, I would like to say a few words on this question of land, both private lands and State lands which is agitating the feelings of people in the North and the East. I find the Hon. Minister of Lands and Land Development present here. He is an old Friend of ours. Today, the Tamil people are in a very disturbed state. Events in this country have compelled almost half the Tamil population to move out of this country and they are in different parts of the world. They are not in this country. They are not merely in India. They are in various parts of Europe. They are in various parts of North America. They are in Australia. They are in different parts of the world. A large number of people have been displaced from their districts and are not living in their own districts but living in other parts of the country. A large number of them have lost their assets, have lost their documents. They have been destroyed. They have been lost and today they are not in possession of those documents of title. But, there seems to be a programme which is being implemented somewhat hastily, in my view, somewhat recklessly where persons are called upon within a space of two months to register their title documents in terms of some circular issued by a Ministry with some local officials. Private ownership of land is a fundamental right. It is a right that is guaranteed by laws that pertain in this country dealing with questions of ownership. That is the common law of the country, the Roman Dutch law, to which a large number of Sinhalese people and a large number of Tamil people are subject. That is their common law. There is a Kandyan law which pertains to the people from the Kandyan areas. There is another personal law called Thesawalamai which applies to the Malabar inhabitants of the Northern Province. All these systems of law have provisions in regard to land

ownership, in regard to succession, particularly intestate succession, how title will devolve when a person dies without having gifted or bequeathed his property to whomever he desires to. There are land registeries in this country where documents are registered which confer on a person priority of title whereas the courts adjudicate upon title if there is a dispute in regard to a title. Under what law is the Government acting in calling upon people to furnish particulars in regard to their deeds, in regard to their title to Divisional Secretaries or whomever? Under what law is the Government acting? Under what law is this Circular issued?

From which legal authority does this act of the Government emanate? Merely because you are the Government, that does not mean that you can do anything you like. No, you certainly cannot. You can enact a law in this Parliament in regard to whatever you think should be done pertaining to land or for that matter anything else and you can implement that law. You have implemented no law recently in regard to land ownership. The laws that are prevailing are the laws that have always prevailed and which continue to prevail and despite those laws you are taking it upon yourself to call upon persons to register their title deeds in keeping with some circular that you have issued, at some Divisional Secretary's office. How can you call upon me to go and register my deeds with the Divisional Secretary? What is the need for me to do so? I own the land, I have documents that give me ownership of that land, my documents are registered in the Land Registry of the area where my lands are situated and I have title to that land. Then, why do you want to politicize this by calling upon me to go and register it here and there and then, there will be an MP saying, Do not register so and sos deed. Give preference to so and so. There will be interference, there will be meddling, there will be political involvement and it will be a mess like everything else. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) Order, Please! .

, [ ] .

, , [ ] . Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR ] took the Chair.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, ownership of private land, as I said before, is the fundamental right of every citizen in this country. By

678 679

issuing circulars and giving authority to various persons who are after all subordinates of the Government, you make an effort to politicize this whole question like the jobs you give in Government Service which are not given on the basis of merit, but largely given on the basis of chits that you get from various politicians. This should not become an issue of that nature and I must say that the Tamil people are very concerned about this situation because if there is a dispute people can go to court, the judiciary can make a determination in regard to ownership of land and there is no need for anyone else to do anything about it. Particularly, the Tamil people are extremely perturbed about this new development because, as I said before, a large number of them do not have their title deeds, do not have their documents, a large number of them are not in the country, a large number of them are not in the districts to which they belong. Today they are in a somewhat desperate state and when you call upon them to go and furnish these particulars under compulsion within a short space of time, it is something they cannot do, it is something they will not be able to do. You might say that the land is no longer theirs. Somebody else might come and register ownership to that land or claim that land and there may be all types of activities which may take place to deprive the true owner of its title and give title to somebody else. These are matters that need to be carefully thought about. They have got very long-term consequences. You cannot rush into doing something so serious pertaining to the rights of people in such a reckless and hasty way.

So, I would very much appeal to the Government to think of suspending this whole operation. I can understand the Government saying, Well, many people have lost their documents. So, they do not have their title deeds of private or State lands. We would like to help them. If you want to enable us to help you, you make an application to have your deeds obtained through services of the Government. That is alright. But why make it a blanket provision applicable to all the people and compel all the people to do something new in regard to their ownership of land, when they are the owners and there is no need for them to do anything more. So, I think Sir, this has caused a lot of agitation amongst the people in the North and the East because even military people are distributing forms. What has the military got to do with this? What have the sailors and soldiers got to do with land ownership? One of my colleagues was telling me yesterday that in some parts of the Vanni even the military personnel were distributing the forms. So, I think, Sir, this should be stopped and this should not be pursued. The Government should discuss this with knowledgeable persons. If there is an issue to be dealt with, it must be dealt with in a very clear way where there is proper consultation in regard to various aspects of the question and if something needs to be done, it can be done. Nobody will say that it should not be done. But, the

present process does not seem to have originated in any clear, rational and intelligent thinking. That is the worry amongst people and this process too can get very complex and could cause immense confusion and harm to people. Therefore, I would earnestly request the Government to reconsider this whole question.

Of course, in regard to State lands, it may be, there are people who have lost their permits. State lands are normally given on annual permits. They are also given on LDO permits. Even an LDO permit confers title on you. With an LDO permit you can file a Rei-Vindicatio action in court and vindicate your title. Now, of course there are Swarnabhoomi Deeds. Then there are people who had State lands but lost their documents. The Government can help them in regard to that matter. That is not a problem. I think, unnecessary interference with private ownership of land and attempts to call upon people to register their titles with Government subordinates, in terms of a circular which does not emanate from any legal provision, which does not have authority under any law in this country, may not be the correct way to approach the whole question and may in fact make the situation much worse than what it is at present.

Then, Sir, I want to deal with some other questions. I want to particularly deal with some issues pertaining to displaced Tamil people who have not been able to get back to the lands from which they were displaced. I want to first talk about an area in my own District, Sampur, a place very dear to me. I have talked about this issue with the Hon. Minister of Economic Development, Basil Rajapaksa. I am happy, he is here and I am happy, he is going to listen to what I am going to say. I am confident that having listened to me - I am sure he knows a lot about this - he will be able to guide us towards a very just and fair decision in regard to this question. Now, Sir, this Sampur issue pertains to 1,486 families. In the Sampur East Grama Sevaka Division, there are 338 families; in the Sampur West Grama Sevaka Division, there are 398 families; in Koonativu, there are 97 families; in Soodaikuda, there are 95 families; in Navaratnapuram, there are 114 families; in Kadatkarachchena, there are 276 families and in Sampur Kali, there are 168 families totalling to 1,486 families. These are ancient Tamil villages. Please remember that there is a very powerful temple, a very powerful deity, the Bhadrakali Amman Temple, in Sampur to which I have been as a little boy with my parents. Please remember that these people come from such an area. These people owned the land in which they lived substantially. They owned 411 acres of residential lands on deeds; 128 acres of residential land on permits issued by the State; 1,180 acres of paddy land on deeds; 540 acres of paddy land on permits; 240 acres of plantation land on deeds and 369 acres of plantation land on permits. These families owned a total of 2,795 acres of land in this area. They belong to this area. For generations they have been living in this area. How can

680 681

[ . ]

2011 21

you deprive them of this land? They were displaced by the war. Now, the war is over. There is no LTTE. These people want to go back to their lands. How can you possibly deprive these people of these lands? How can these people be stopped from going back to lands which they owned, residential land, paddy land, plantation land on deeds and on permits given to them by the Government? Not a small extent, in all it is almost 2800 acres of land. How can you stop them going back? Okay, the LTTE were in charge of Sampur. I have often said that the LTTE was created by you, not by us. We never wanted the LTTE. It is because you could not solve this problem with Mr. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam and with Mr. A. Amirthalingam that the LTTE was created. Otherwise the LTTE would never come into being. The President made a speech at Vakarai on the 3rd of February, 2007 and what did the President say?

Hon. Minister, I would like you to give ear to me. I would appeal to you to give ear to me. Speaking about Sampur, the President said, I quote:

What we have done is to liberate the people from the terrorists. I am here to thank the troops for their action without causing a single casualty.

The President said, What we have done is to liberate the people from the terrorists. That is what you have done, nothing more. So, why cannot these people who have been liberated from terrorists now go back to their lands and live on their lands?

Then, on the 5th of September, 2006, the Military Spokesman, Brigadier Prasad Samarasinghe stated, I quote:

the threat posed by the LTTE to the Trincomalee Harbour and the adjoining naval base was no more following the successful operation involving the three forces.

He further stated, I quote:

...once the area was cleared the civilians could resettle in the next few days

This was stated on 5th September, 2006 by your military spokesman. Surely he reflected the thinking of the Government when he said that. Why are you keeping these poor people out? Why are you harassing them? Why can they not go back and live there? The LTTE is not there; the artillery is not there.

This is the land on which these people have lived for generations and centuries. They own these lands on deeds. We went to courts on a Fundamental Rights application. One of the persons produced deeds for over 100 years. It is his title. How can you stop these people going back? What happened to that Fundamental Rights application case? We went before the Supreme Court. What did the Attorney-General say on behalf of the Government? I quote:

The Deputy Solicitor General submits that steps are being taken for the resettlement of affected persons with due compliance of the internationally operative best practices for such process.

He has said that steps are being taken for the resettlement of these persons in keeping with the best practices that are required internationally. What are those? De-mine the whole place, make sure there are no explosives and enable the people to be resettled. This is what your Attorney-General said in the Supreme Court as being the position of the Government. How can you go back on this? I am sure you will not, eventually. I do not want anyone to misunderstand me. But, it is my duty on behalf of these people who keep calling me everyday and appealing to me to do something on their behalf to make an appeal to you to look at this objectively and fairly and not to treat this as a matter which can be just dealt with as if the right of these people do not matter. You must not hurt people in this way. It will not do you any good.

So, my submission is, we have the Presidents statement, the statement of the Military Spokesman on behalf of the Government and the assurance given to the Supreme Court of this country, when these people went to court, by the Attorney-General on behalf of the Government that these people will be settled in keeping with the international best practices. I am asking the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne who is listening to me very carefully, how on earth can you prevent these people going back to their lands which they own, for which they have deeds and for which they have permits?

If you do that type of thing, I am asking you, can you ever bring about reconciliation in this country? Now look, do not take me amiss, but, I must raise this question with you. Tens of thousands of people of the majority community have been brought into the Eastern Province and given three acres of agricultural land and one acre of highland and a house to live in. Three acres of paddy land to cultivate. When the landless people from other parts of the country are brought in here, you are driving out people from their own lands; lands which they own. This will be called, ethnic cleansing. I have not called it, ethnic cleansing so far. Today is the first time I am using that word in this House. If these people are not permitted to return to their land, we will have to call this, ethnic cleansing. How can you justify bringing in people from other parts of the country and giving them three acres of paddy land, one acre of residential land with a house? Despite all the assurances they have given in public and to the Supreme Court, if you prevent these people from going back to their lands, what else can this be called, but, "ethnic cleansing"? Please, do not do that. You should not do that and you should return these lands to these people.

Now, India is going to construct a coal power plant there. I have spoken to the Indian authorities; I have spoken to the former Indian Foreign Secretary; I have spoken to the present Foreign Secretary. I have even mentioned it to people at a higher level. I am prepared

682 683

even to discuss it with the Indian Prime Minister. I will discuss it with the Indian Prime Minister if the need arises, but, I would rather discuss it with the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa and resolve it. We are prepared to help. The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa knows that we are prepared to help. We are prepared to co-operate to enable these people to resettle on those lands and carry on their lives. We do not want them out. The Indian Government does not want them out. The Indian Government is prepared to help. So, I think you must rethink this whole question. You must be fair. You must not hurt these people.

I spoke to the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa. I do not mind mentioning it in the House, Sir. About 10 days ago, I spoke to the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa and he told me I am going to Trincomalee tomorrow. Then, I said, Please tell your Governor and the Government Agent not to use pressure on these people. These are poor people. They are suffering. The Governor had said, I will stop their rations; I will not give them food, if they do not go to the lands to which I want them to go. Yesterday they have distributed some forms in all these transit camps in which these people are and told them, "By the 25th, you must decide - here we are giving you a choice of areas to which you can go and you must decide to which area you are going. Otherwise, your food will be stopped. This is wickedness; this is cruelty; this is torture. How can you treat human beings in this way? The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa assured me that he had spoken to the Governor and that they will not press these people. But it is happening there on the ground. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa - Minister of Economic Development) Any land which is not necessary and which will not be acquired for the construction of the power plant will be given back to these people and they will be resettled.

In the Eastern Province up to now we have resettled 325,000 people and according to your information, Sir, only 1,700 people have not been resettled - you just calculate the percentage and see. This is a special area. Now the final agreement with the Indian Government has been finalized. So they will decide on the extent of land that is required for the power plant. That will be done according to the Sri Lankan law - the acquisition procedure has to be followed. We have taken over lands not only in Sampur but also we have acquired lands for Kerawalapitiya and Upper Kotmale projects. All compensations have to be given. Even temples have been acquired for various power projects and also for the Norochcholai coal power project we have acquired lands. This is another development. Even for road constructions and for highways sometimes we have to acquire private

lands. So, any land which will not be required for the Indian-Sri Lanka power plant will be handed over to the people. Last time also we have allowed the farmers to cultivate. This time also we have decided to allow them to cultivate all the paddy lands and allow them to go to the Kovil and this time also we will allow them to do all the religious activities. So, we will never unnecessarily keep anybody out of their own lands. We will guarantee that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I am not for a moment saying that you should not give land for the coal power plant. The country needs energy. The Indian Government and you are prepared to collaborate in regard to a project to set up a coal power plant there. I am not raising any objection to it; I have not raised any objection to it though I represent the people of that area. That can come up. But my submission to you is that while that comes up we can also ensure that these people are also able to return to that area without being thrown out. We can work together to achieve this. I am prepared to help you in regard that matter. I am prepared to co-operate with you, get the people to co-operate with you to ensure that while your development activity proceeds we also are able to enable these people who have lived there for generations and centuries to get back to that land. That is all what I want done. That is what your Government told to the Supreme Court; that is what your President said in public - that is the position. So, I would like you to look at it at that way and I would like you to kindly make sure that these people are not deprived of their lands. I do not think that is your intention but I think that must be done as early as we can. You should not delay it any further. If you say that the people can go and cultivate their paddy fields, the people can go and worship in the temple, they can rebuild the temple, all the steps are taken to take the process forward let us have those things implemented. If you are prepared to do all these things, then why are they distributing forms in Trincomalee asking the people to go and settle elsewhere? Why are you compelling them?

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) No, no.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) The people are prepared to be patient.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) There are three lands identified. So to anybody whose land is taken we will compensate for the land and we will give a new land and also a house.

684 685

[ . ]

2011 21

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) That will be if the land is taken. But before the land is taken they need not be compelled to go. After all why should they be compelled to go now? If the land is taken at some point of time we can think about it at that point of time. So, let them remain where they are now. Let us do our best to expedite this matter, finish this matter and then take a decision in regard to the whole question. Meanwhile let the people remain where they are. They should not be compelled; they should not be forced to go to some other area. ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) They can remain where they are. We have not taken their lands.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Okay, thank you.

Then, Sir, this is what I want to mention in regard to Sampur. I want to mention a similar matter in regard to another area that is in the Mullaitivu District. There are still some families from the villages of Pudumathalan, Mullivaikkal West, Mullivaikkal East, Ampalavanpokkanai, Valaignarmadam and Anandapuram from the Mullaitivu District who are presently at the Menik Farm Camp at Cheddikulam and some of these families are with host families largely in Vavuniya. The Government has constantly maintained the position that all the people still in the Menik Farm will be resettled on their original lands. But recently there has been a meeting in Mullaitivu where a decision seems to have been taken that these people from all these villages will not be taken back to their original lands. They are largely fishermen who survive by fishing and the names I mentioned were all coastal villages adjoining the sea that all of them would be taken to a place called Kompavil, eight kilometres aware from the sea. How can these people who are fishermen by occupation live in a place eight kilometres away from the sea and carry on their occupation? It is very unfortunate probably the Hon. Minister, you know more. I do not want to get into an argument with anybody over these questions because these are all human questions, these are all questions related to the lives of human beings and we must consider what best we can do to alleviate their suffering and to enable them to get back to normalcy to enable them to start lives again, rebuild their lives. I am not going to rebuild their lives; you are not going to rebuild their lives; they must rebuild their lives. All that we can do is to facilitate that process. They surely must remain in an area where they can carry on their traditional occupation and your assurance has been all along that these people will go back to their original villages and they will be settled

there. Now suddenly there is this decision to send them to Kompavil. I do not think you should pursue that.

() ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne - Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development) Are they all fishermen? What are the names of those villages?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) The names of those villages are Pudumathalan, Mullivaikkal West, Mullivaikkal East, Ampalavanpokkanai, Valaignarmadam and Anandapuram. These are all fishing villages in Mullaitivu and these families are from these villages. They want to go back to these villages. Now, a decision has been taken that these fishermen are to be taken eight kilometres away from the sea to a place called Kompavil. People are crying. Do not do these type of things. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) I have also intervened and settled. One example is Iranamadu Tank for the fishermen. Now, we have settled and they have started fishing also. So, we will find out what has happened. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) All that we want is kindly enable them to go back to their original villages because those are where they have lived close to the sea. So they can carry on their occupation and they can start their lives.

If you put them eight kilometres away, they would starve. So, I would like the Hon. Minister to kindly pay his attention to that. I would not take any more time because many of my other Honourable Friends are here.

I also want to mention the position in regard to two other villages in my own District. One is Thennamarvadi. The people of Thennamarvadi were displaced in 1984. They are just returning to Thennamarvadi and some of their lands are being forcibly cultivated by other people. I, in fact, spoke to the SSP of the area before I came here and he told me that he was going there, that he would ensure that those people are able to commence cultivation of their lands and that he will have this matter sorted out by also talking to the Divisional Secretary. I would like that matter to be noted because particularly, when people return after having been displaced for quite some time, I think the Government should take action to ensure that they are able to cultivate their lands and recommence their occupation.

686 687

Similarly, Sir, in a place called Kanguveli, there is a large stretch of land called Padukadu, almost 800 acres of land, which the people from various villages in that area have been cultivating for a long period of time. But, again some persons have trespassed on those lands and, by force, are attempting to cultivate those lands and the people are unable to cultivate those. I think there was some action taken by the Government last year and the people were able to cultivate those lands, Padukadu in Kanguveli area, coming under the Mutur Police Station area, but again, I think, that problem has cropped up this time and the people are not able to cultivate those lands. I think you should take some action and ensure that the people are able to cultivate those lands.

I would not take more of your time. But, I must briefly refer to a few matters before I conclude. I referred in this House and I also spoke to the President and the Hon. Minister of Economic Development about the destruction of a Sivan Temple called the "Agasthyar Sthapanam" in Trincomalee and the destruction of some old statues at that place. I am handing over to Hon. Minister Basil Rajapaksa a statue of God Ganapati. That is a temple which is more than 2,500 years old. Agasthiyar was a famous saint who came and lived here in Kanguweli and constructed that Temple. The 'Lingam' is there; there is a picture of "Kundrakudi Adigalar", a famous Sage from Tamil Nadu, worshipping before the "Lingam". There is picture of a young girl, with two children in both her hands, partaking in the firewalking ceremony at this Temple. All these things have been destroyed in this Temple recently. I spoke to the President; I wrote to the President and nothing has been done thus far. I do not think that this state of affairs can continue. With this type of thing, there can be no reconciliation. If you want to bring about reconciliation in this country, you must ensure that this type of thing is not repeated, that this type of thing does not happen. Even if you cannot get hold of the miscreants, at least, that place must be restored to the people who manage that place and they must be allowed to rebuild that place.

Another matter I am very concerned about is, the seven hot wells in Kinniya. Hon. Minister, with regard to the seven hot well in kinniya, I met you personally, spoke to you and gave you a letter.

We have been performing our 31st day ceremony in respect of our dear kith and kin at that site for generations and centuries. Lord Ravana is supposed to have performed his mothers rites at that site and He is supposed to have dug with his spear at seven different places and that is the origin of the wells. Today, a monk has taken control of that area, purely for commercial purposes. A lot of people come to bathe in the hot-water wells. So, it is commercially very profitable and our people are unable to go and perform their ceremonies and

rites. This would not help us to live together; we would not be able to live together if this type of thing continues. I do not mind telling you that when I was a Member of Parliament in the 1977 Parliament, similarly, a monk tried to take control of that place. On the phone, I spoke to His Excellency J.R. Jayewardene, who was then the President and he had that monk removed the next day. I am not saying that everything His Excellency J.R. Jayewardene did was right; I am not saying that everything you do is wrong. But, I am just telling you that I telephoned His Excellency J.R. Jayewardene immediately when I heard that the monk had gone there. I went there and I saw the monk there. His Excellency J.R. Jayewardene was at Nuwara Eliya and not even in Colombo. I told him, Sir, such a thing is happening. It is not good. You should not permit this to continue. He had him removed the next day. Maybe, you are a little more careful. I do not mind your being a little more careful, but do not deprive us of the right to perform our funeral rites and duties by our deceased next of kin, the kith and kin, at those precious cultural holy sites. If you do that, you cannot bring about reconciliation in this country. So, I would like you to kindly bear that also in mind.

I have written to you about the tourist sites in Kuchchaveli, about the Raigam Saltern in Kuchchaveli. All that I am asking you is, why are all these lands being given to only one community? The Kuchchaveli Divisional Secretarys Division is more than 95 per cent Tamil-speaking. Why is all the land in that area, for development purposes, whether it be tourism or for a saltern, being given only to persons of one community? How can we have peace in this country when this type of thing happens? How can there be goodwill, how can there be reconciliation, how can there be peace and how can there by harmony?

Three thousand acres of land was surveyed to be given to the Thiriyaya Buddhist Temple. The Thiriyaya Buddhist Temple has been there for centuries. During the war it survived, nothing happened to it. When I go to Thiriyaya, I go to the Temple. When I go to the Temple, I climb that rock. I have always done that.

In a place called Sembimalai, where again there was a hindu temple, a statue of the Lord Buddha had been installed now. I do not mind that at all, but why did you have to go and do it there? And now that land is being surveyed to be given to that temple. Do not do this type of thing. When this land is surveyed, there will also be some agricultural land of private people that maybe taken. That will not be good. I have spoken about this even earlier. These are some of the matters I would like you to give your mind to and ensure that these things do not take place.

Sir, before I conclude, I wanted to talk about Kilinochchi and Batticaloa. But, I do not want to take too

688 689

[ . ]

2011 21

much time. I think I have already taken about one hour. In Wakarai in the Batticaloa District, there is some land under the System B of the Mahaweli Development Scheme meant largely for the people of the Batticaloa District.

I am told now some part of that land is being taken for other development purposes and being given to persons from the majority community. Substantial land has already been taken.- [Interruption.] I will finish my speech. After that you can answer me. - [Interruption.] No, no. Please wait. You are entitled to your views. I will listen to you when you speak. Now you better please listen to me. -[Interruption.] Okay. May I carry on Mr. Deputy Chairman? Some land has been taken over from this land, System "B" of the Mahaweli Scheme in the Batticaloa District and is being given to the persons of the majority community. Now I want to just say this. Mahaweli does not benefit any part of the Eastern Province other than System "B". Mahaweli does not so far benefit any part of the Northern Province, nothing at all. Now System "B" left bank is in Polonnaruwa, 88 per cent of the land has been given to the majority community. I am not complaining about it. I am merely saying this is what happened. Under System "C", 99.45 per cent of the land has been given to the majority community. Under System "G", 99.96 per cent of the land has been given to the majority community. Under System "H", 95.75 per cent of the lands have been given to the majority community. Under System "L", 100 per cent of the land has been given to the majority community. Under Udawalawe, 99.98 per cent of the land has been given to the majority community. These are the figures of the Mahaweli Development Authority, not my figures. Why are you meddling with this land on the right bank of Maduru Oya System "B", the only land from which the Tamils and the Muslims can benefit to a substantial extent? Is it fair? Is it reasonable? If this type of things happen, can we have peace in this country? Can we have reconciliation in this country? So I want you to kindly take these matters into consideration. There are many matters in regard to Kilinochchi that I would like to speak on, but I have no time. Some of the other Members will speak on them. Kindly do not continue with these policies and programmes. They are not conducive to good relations. After all you must remember that the Tamil-speaking people have a stake in the North-Eastern part of this country. We must not allow things to get bad there. Now the fear of the Tamil people is not merely about the Eastern Province, even the Northern Province is sought to be eroded that there are deliberate plans to change the demographic composition even in the Northern Province, not merely in the Eastern Province.This type of things gathers momentum.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) The Government is not doing that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I am happy to hear that the Government is not doing it - [Interruption.] I am happy to hear you say that you are not doing it. But my contention respectfully is that that is not good enough. You must stop it being done. As the Government you are the only institution which has got the power and the capacity to stop that and you must stop that and if you do not stop it, to the eyes of the ordinary man, you will be seen as the wrongdoer, not anybody else. This is all I am saying.

Thank you very much.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Hon. Sampanthan has taken 73 minutes and there is 17 minutes left for your side. The Hon. Vino will now second the Motion.

[3.54 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Hon. Sampanthan while moving the Adjournment Motion, referred to Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and Mr. Dudley Senanayake, our former Prime Ministers. I would like to remind him and also this House that the first leader who very publicly said and recognized that the people of Jaffna had their own history, their rich culture, their language and their civilization was no other than the late Mr. D.S. Senanayake, the first Prime Minister of Sri Lanka and he made that speech at the first meeting of the United National Party.

One of the issues here is the question of land. Land has been one of the biggest issues. Unfortunately, there is no transparency in land transactions as far as this Government is concerned. I do not think that we have to go to the Northern Province. If you go pass Galle Face and see how land has been given out to CATIC, that Chinese Company, I can understand the claims that are being made here by the Hon. Members of the TNA. - [Interruption.] Considering what is happening here, I can understand what will happen there. I also watched the Hon. Sampanthan speak and the exchange of views with him.

Work has been started in Vanni but I say that that it is not enough. Much more has to be done. In the case of land, reassurances must be given. We stand by the law and the Constitution has laid down - I mean, this is part of the Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact. You first give land to the people of the district and then to the people of the province. If you follow that system, this issue will be over. I mean, the Pact between Dudley Senanayake and Chelvanayakam which is also in the Thirteenth Amendment has laid down this issue but what you have done is not enough. Since I have not got time, I do not want to repeat it nor go through all these issues. But, there is one other issue concerning Jaffna and another, on devolution.

Firstly, I want to say that one of the other key issues on land is the High Security Zones in Jaffna. Valikamam is the heart of Jaffna. When we had to start expanding out of Palali in 1983, we always gave the assurance that we would give the land back.

( ) (An Hon. Member) Valikamam North.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Yes, Valikamam North, Manipay and all. You know that as well as I do.

694 695

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) All such issues in Manipay have been settled.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) They all are not settled in Manipay. If you take Palali - [Interruption.] In Valikamam - [Interruption.] we gave an assurance that we would start giving the land back at an appropriate time. I was the Minister of Education when we handed over the training school in Palali for the Air Force to take over. Now, this is over. So, why do you not start this process?

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) We have started it.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Basically take the areas announced, take the No-Fire Zone and then start it because even after it is announced, it will be two years before anyone can go in. You have to redraw the boundaries and the surveys have to be done. There will be disputes but do this. That is what we are saying. The only way that you can do it is to have all the elected Members from Jaffna - whether it is the TNA or the Minister or the UNP - sit down with the relevant authorities, you, the Ministry of Defence and others and work out a plan. No one is saying that you should give up all these lands. There has to be a certain amount kept for security. But, I think we can at least sort out 70-80 per cent of this issue by agreement. We can start with the No-Fire Zone in Palali and from there you can go on. It can be two years and you can announce it today. By the time the disputes are solved - some are with the diaspora and some are here. So, it will take time.

One good measure is that the Government and the TNA started talks again yesterday but you must finish it before the end of the year. It is becoming a big problem internationally and you must show your commitment to devolution. Now, where is your commitment to devolution when you still do not hand over power to the Colombo Municipal Council?

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Mr. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair.

, [ ] .

, , [ ] . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. CHANDIMA WEERAKKODY] took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) This Council has been elected but you are not handing over. All the other Mayors have taken over. If they are not handing over the oldest local authority in the South, what do you think they are going to do about devolution in the North? That is all I am asking. I mean, we must be sincere in what we say. Mayors have been sworn in. The President has sworn in all the Members of the Government Party.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Azwer, what is the point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am amazed. The Leader of the Opposition surely knows that there is a Gazette notification and the appointment date has been declared as the 1st of November. On 1st November, his Mayor will walk in. Before that if he walks in he will become a trespasser. I am so amazed - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Azwer, that is not a point of Order. Hon. Leader of the Opposition, you may continue.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I do not know why he is insulting his own President. That means, when the President swore in the Members yesterday he did not know the law, you are saying. He knew the law. - [Interruption.] You are saying that the President does not know the law. Okay! Okay! If you say that the President does not know the law, I will accept it. - [Interruption.] Does the President know the law or not? You think the President does not know the law? The Mayor is sworn in and you are not handing over. Why are

696 697

2011 21

you hanging on to this? Respect the people's mandate and hand this over.

If you are not giving the Colombo Municipal Council, how can we ask them to believe you when you talk about the Northern Provincial Council? I am saying, make it a reality. So, I ask the Government to, next week itself, Monday itself, hand this over. Even the Hon. Member there does not know what is happening inside the Council. No one knows. Now, the Hon. Member says that the President does not know the law. Okay, if that is what you say about your President, I have no problem. - [Interruption.] I do not want to waste my time arguing with him. I made my point and I rest my case there.

[4.01 p.m.] ... ( ) ( ... - , ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne - Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs) Mr. Deputy Speaker, before I begin my speech on the Motion moved by the Hon. Sampanthan and the TNA, I would like to make an explanation as regards the comment made by the Hon. Member of the TNA about the transfer of the GA of Mannar. I should say that the GA of Mannar was transferred not because of any political victimization and not because we wanted to transfer him politically, but now the policy of the Government is to transfer officers irrespective of their nationality. In future, you may find Sinhalese officers working in the North and the East and Tamil officers working in the South and other parts of the country because we are against segregation. We are against division. We want all the people to get together and work wherever it is possible. When an officer is able to work in Tamil, we are very happy to post him to a position or an office in the North and the East and that policy will be followed hereafter.

The Hon. Sampanthan being a senior Member of this House and being a senior citizen, is aware that there was a time when a large number of Tamil officers served in our areas and there were Sinhalese officers serving in Jaffna and various other parts of the North and the East. That situation must be created. - [Interruption.] Inasmuch as the GA has been transferred from Mannar to an area in the South, a Sinhalese officer might be transferred to that area. Likewise, there will be a possibility for people of different communities to work anywhere in the country. I think that is a concept that we must encourage.

Also, I would like to speak about the "Bim Saviya" . This was a term that was used by the Hon. Minister. The registration of land is not confined to Jaffna alone. That concept is being practised in my electorate, Ratnapura also. In Ratnapura, there are surveys that are being done and there are titles being issued as a result. People are

happy to go through this process because titles are being given now to the lands they possessed all this time without valid titles. Therefore, this is something that is being implemented all over the country, not only in the North or in any part of the East only. Therefore, I would like to say that this is not being implemented with any ulterior motive.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, with the conclusion of the conflict situation that prevailed in the Northern and Eastern Provinces in 2009, it is a pleasure for me to inform this House that a rapid development is observed in the entire Island, especially in the North and the East.

I am happy to state that the people of the North and the East, who were victims of terrorism of the LTTE for nearly 30 years, are now enjoying freedom for the first time. With the guidance of His Excellency the President, it has been possible to bring the situation back to normal within a short period of time and to embark on a number development projects for the well-being of the people of the North and the East. Now, I would like to draw your attention to the following:

1. A large number of families who lived in the North were forced by the LTTE to stay in Mullaitivu. Though thousands of families who were liberated by our armed forces were temporarily stationed in Vavuniya, we were able to resettle about 80 per cent of them in a short period of time.

2. All major highways, except a few minor roads in the North, are opened for the general public which has resulted in large-scale social integration and economic relationship between the North and the South, paving the way for rapid economic development.

3. Infrastructure development in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces is proceeding at a rapid rate utilizing local and foreign funds. Now all shops, public offices, schools can be seen being kept open.

However, some political groups are harping on insignificant items which have to be done overlooking the massive development process in the North and the East, which is in progress. Most of the private lands which were in charge of the armed forces have now been handed back, though there are a few private lands still under the control of the armed forces. I believe that these too can be handed back with the strengthening of civil administration.

We should never forget the sufferings caused, the lives lost and damages to properties during the 30 years of war. If we are to critically analyse the situation during the last three years, no one can deny that huge relief assistance has been provided for the people of the relevant areas. I believe that we would be able to finalize these activities if the political sector of the North and the East extend their cooperation in this regard.

698 699

Hon. Deputy Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to state that our Ministry - the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs - has fulfilled a tremendous mission to establish civil administration in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. During the 30 years of war, the civil administration mechanism of this Ministry made its contribution for the coordination of services and facilities provided by the Government with commitment. Government Agents -District Secretaries - Divisional Secretaries, Assistant Government Agents and Grama Niladharis have been the leading forces in the development process. At present, the civil administration mechanism plays a significant role utilizing the large amounts of funds provided by the Ministry of Economic Development and it shoulders the task of coordination of other activities of other line ministries with the assistance of the armed forces.

Reconstruction of buildings belonging to civil administration damaged by war, re-establishment of socio and economic activities, resettlement process, distribution of relief aids, coordination with Government and Non-Governmental Organizations and coordination of relevant financial and physical resources can be pointed out in this regard. At present, all District and Divisional Secretaries have become key centres for the development activities of these areas, that is, the North and the East. In addition to the huge development projects launched by the other Ministries, Provincial Councils and foreign development projects, our Ministry too has made the investments listed below for the development of the North and the East.

1. Rupees 92 million has been spent for the engagement of qualified officers in technology services which were required to establish civil administration services in Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Jaffna Districts.

2. Rupees 6.5 million has been spent for the divisional planning, enhancement of computer technology and standardization of public service in Batticaloa, Ampara and Trincomalee Districts.

3. Rupees 572 million has been spent for the construction of new administration building complexes, reconstruction of damaged buildings and for providing office equipment and furniture in the North and the East.

4. Rupees 12 million has been spent for the establishment of e-BMD for issuing Birth Certificates, Marriage Certificates and Death Certificates in the Northern Province.

5. Rupees 82 million has been spent from Government funds for initiating administrative activities in the Northern Province.

6. Rupees 1,030 million has been spent for providing all infrastructure facilities in the North and the East.

Considering the details of infrastructure facilities provided in the North and the East, there are 7 District Secretariat buildings; 13 Divisional Secretariat buildings; 3 Divisional Secretarys quarters, 4 Staff Visiting quarters, 17 Seva Piyasa buildings, 1 training centre and 1 circuit bungalow. We have been able to rebuild the civil administration in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces satisfactorily with proper coordination spending Rs. 1,800 million in addition to the large amounts of funds provided from other Ministries.

Then, I think there was a comment made by an Hon. Member about the Mullaitivu District saying that certain steps are now being taken in order to upset the demographic position. But, I should say that due to the conflict situation, sub office for Welioya has been created and attached to the Padaviya Divisional Secretariat in the Anuradhapura District to look after matters related to the people of the areas like some Grama Sevaka Divisions that were attached to Vavuniya and Mullaitivu.

Owing to the conflict, civil administration of those areas could not be carried out. So, those Grama Sevaka areas were attached to the Padaviya Divisional Secretary's area, which comes within Anuradhapura. During the last several years, civil administration was implemented under the Padaviya Divisional Secretary attached to the Anuradhapura District Secretary. Now, the time has come to rethink about it because the distance to Mullaitivu from Welioya is 49 kilometres and the distance to Anuradhapura from Welioya is 128 kilometres. You will see that that distance is three times the distance from Welioya to Mullaitivu. Therefore, a decision has been taken to amalgamate certain areas to Mullaitivu. That is, for the convenience of the people living in those areas.

Then, Sir, another adverse effect of the 30-year war is the destruction and misplacement of important documents of people such as deeds, other civil documents et cetera. The Department of Registrar General under our Ministry has taken the following measures during the past, paying attention to this grave situation. There has been a lot of complaints that they are unable to obtain their birth certificates and other relevant certificates like marriage and death certificates. The complaint was that they take a long time. Under the e-BMD Project, which had been implemented to computerize the issue of birth, marriage and death certificates without delay, we have been able to issue nearly 25,000 certificates in Vavuniya, 150,000 certificates in Mannar and a further 175,000 certificates in the Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu Districts. I would like to state that a sum of around Rs. 18 million has been spent to establish that project. So far, 96 Registrars have been appointed for the five districts in the Northern Province and 60 mobile services have been conducted in order to expedite the activities.

So, I would like to say that although the Hon. Sampanthan said that all that this Government does is for

700 701

the benefit of the majority, it is not so. We have done everything possible in order to facilitate the activities and the needs of the people of the North and the East. This is one instance where, I would say, the people of the area have been greatly benefited. We have held about 60 mobile services in order to expedite the issuance of the certificates to the people of those areas.

In addition, we have established six Land Registries. It should be pointed out that in the Jaffna District alone, 19,782 deeds have been registered by September, 2011. That is, under the concept of "Bim Saviya". In all, 28,000 deeds have been registered during the period of the past nine months in Northern Province. This shows the dedication to provide facilities to the general public to get their ownership of land confirmed. At present, nearly 82 Notaries are serving in the Northern Province and we are taking necessary measures to appoint staff from the respective areas.

Sir, in addition to the above, we are taking action to recruit 60 officers to Sri Lanka Administrative Service by holding a special examination in the Tamil medium with a view to remove the dearth of SLAS officers in the relevant areas. This is a matter which has been constantly raised by the Hon. Members of the TNA, that at the last SLAS examination, not a single Tamil medium SLAS officer had got through. As a solution to that problem and in order to provide relief to that problem, we are holding a separate examination in the Tamil medium and are hoping to recruit 60 SLAS officers from the Tamil medium only. By now, most of the vacancies in the Public Management Assistants Service have been filled. In the meantime, the attention of our Ministry has been drawn to find prompt solutions to the dearth of the Grama Niladharies, which issue has been raised very often by the Hon. Member in the division, and further to modernize the civil administrative activities. We will be taking steps in order to recruit Grama Sevaka Niladharies very soon. I know that there is a dearth of Grama Niladharies in that area and that problem will be solved very soon for the benefit of the people of that area.

Thank you. [. . 4.16]

, , . ? . ? , , . . , , , , . . . [4.33 p.m.] () ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne - Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I will make my observations in English especially for my Tamil Colleagues to understand better. I was listening to the Hon. Sampanthans speech. I do not know about all the details he has given in his speech. But, I am going to speak about two matters in his Motion. The first one is about the allocation of lands for development purposes only to members of the majority community. I will speak about what I have done in my sphere, fisheries, and how I have adopted my policies in those areas.

The second matter is about lands because I was the Minister of Lands from 2002 to 2004. Though the Registration of Title Act was enacted in 1998 by the present Prime Minister, the Hon. D.M. Jayaratne, he could not actually implement it. Then, by the time I came, it was a World Bank project. Actually, the procedure was laid down completely by the World Bank. Somehow, I was able to clear all the objections from various parties. The Bar Association of Sri Lanka objected and the Notaries objected. The Notaries thought that once the Registration of Title Act is implemented, there will be no need for Notaries. The Bar Association had their own views. They had their personal problems also. I have studied about title registrations in Australia and other developed countries. Sir, you know as a lawyer more than me, that 85 per cent of the civil cases and 65 per cent of the criminal cases in this country is due to land disputes. So, according to this procedure, those disputes have to come down to about 4 per cent. That is scientifically proved in developed countries.

706 707

The British brought the deed procedure in 1867 and enacted it as a temporary measure until the title registration is implemented. They did not change that temporary procedure until they gave Independence. Even we could not bring this to Parliament until 1998. So, the then government decided and I was provided with US Dollars 50 million to start the pilot project and they promised me to give US Dollars 1 billion to enact the whole thing. After the JVP joined the Government, they said that they have nothing to do with the World Bank. Then only it became a local thing. I do not know how long it will take for a developing country like ours to implement this procedure.

The title registration is the correct procedure. You can argue about the deeds in courts. My family members can have disputes with me on the deed but not on the title. Even when we go to a bank, once we produce the deed, the bank always asks us to give the title. So, we have to go for the title and it takes months. Here, a registered title is given by the State not only for Crown lands but also for private lands. Every land will be surveyed again properly and given a title. Then, any citizen of the country can go to a bank and get a loan over the counter. I summoned all the officials of the State and private banks in the country and they all agreed to give loans over the counter if the title is produced. I started the first pilot project. I think I started it in Gampaha, Maharagama and in some other areas. It was very successful. Earlier, people had a lot of misunderstanding about this because this is something new but later, everybody agreed that the title of the land was the latest and modern certificate. If it is implemented in the North, nobody can object to this procedure. I am talking as somebody who has studied about titles, lands and Acts, properly. My view is that there must be a crash programme in the entire country to give titles to everybody. Once the titles are given, the advantage is that even the Tamil diaspora do not need to come here to claim their lands. They can claim their lands online.

At that time, I started a land bank for the first time. Even the World Bank said that the land bank is too expensive for a country like ours. Anyway, I started the land bank so that anybody who knows IT can find any land from it. So, even if all the Tamil people who have left the country in the '70s, '80s or '90s want to claim their lands, now there is no way of claiming those lands because sometimes the Land Registries may have been burnt down and no document is available. But, once the survey is done and if someone is given the title, that belongs to him or her and nobody can claim that land title. Nobody, not even a Sinhalese person can come and claim that. Even if the State wants to settle someone there, that cannot be done. He can stay there only for some time and the person who owns the title can chase away that person. So, I do not think that this land title project will affect any ethnicity in any way. My good

Friend, the Hon. Sumanthiran and all the other lawyers will understand better than me about the land title procedure. Those days, even the Bar Association had a lot of problems about this but everything has been cleared by me. I started this three months after I became the Minister. Even the World Bank commended me for starting this programme. Most of the developing countries also have started the land title project. Neither the Hon. Janaka Bandara Tennakoon nor anybody else can influence this procedure. There is a laid-down procedure accepted by all the developed countries in the world. So, I do not think anyone should be scared about this land title project.

Now, there are so many problems to be resolved. Still, I cannot say that I am happy about what is done in the North and the East. In my entire career, whatever the party I belonged to, I stood for one principle and even today, I stand for that. The dignity of every individual of this country should be upheld. If we are to uphold the dignity of Sri Lanka, we have to give dignity to the Sinhala nation, the Tamil nation and the Muslim nation. When the dignity of all these nations come together only, we can say that it is "Sri Lankan dignity." In Sinhala, it is called, . , , . We have stood for this principle. We have fought. We have seen the rebellions and we have got rid of the rebellions. Now, you and I can argue; you and I can discuss; we can differ in our views but we can get together and raise our voices in a democratic environment.

So, that is why I stood against terrorism. I stood against the JVP terrorism. I actively participated against the JVP terrorism. I supported all the rebels who took arms against the JVP in order to crush the JVP, not because I was against the socialist beliefs of the JVP, but because of the manner in which they practised and the procedure they followed. It was the same with the LTTE. I was desperately fed up with the LTTE after what they did at the 2004 Election. At that moment I knew that they would never come to a settlement for a united country but only for a separate State. Therefore, I decided that if the shortest way to achieve peace is to pursue military means, we should go ahead and achieve peace quickly. Thereafter, we can settle other matters.

I have four pieces of bombs in my body. I was called "a traitor" by the JVP those days and they bombed me. Three fourths of my comrades are dead today after fighting for equal rights for the Tamil man. We are duty-bound to get them equal status before we die. The Tamil people asked for equal status for their language. But, our past leaders did not give. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition quoted the Hon. D.S. Senanayake. But before that, the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike said in the State Council that federalism was the best answer for the

708 709

development of this country. He was the first politician to say that openly but he could not do that. The day he tore the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact, he said, History will pardon me one day. He was an intellectual. So, he knew that what he was going to do was wrong. But, due to pressure he said, History will pardon me. I do not think any leader will be pardoned.

Our leaders from both sides and our political parties from both sides always talked about the differences amongst the Sinhala and the Tamil man. We have only about 10 to 15 per cent differences and we are equal in about 80 to 85 per cent. I go to the Temple and then to the Dewalaya. I worship Lord Kandasami and Lord Vishnu. Who are they? They are all Tamil Gods. According to the Hindu belief, Lord Buddha is one of the Dasa Avatharas. So, we are equal in that way. But, we always talk about the differences amongst us to practise third grade politics. If we can come together and see that the Tamil and the Sinhala man are equal in 85 to 90 per cent and our differences are minimal, this problem be solved. If somebody asks you to identify a Sinhala man and a Tamil man in London, nobody will identify them physically or culturally. Your culture and my culture, both came from India. We both came from India in different times - our arts, literature and everything came together.

Please come, we will discuss. Now, you are in the TNA. There are enough people who have fought for your people. But, you do not come for a dialogue with us. You know, we have in our Government today Communist Party people, Lanka Sama Samaja Party people, NSSP people like the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara and even people who were with Mr. Vijaya Kumaratunga. There are enough people who have a history for fighting for equal rights of the Tamil and Muslim people in this country. There are Tamil leaders here; there are Muslim leaders here. Start the dialogue. There are enough SLFP people too.

I hate Chandrika Kumaratunga but I appreciate one thing she did. What was it? She brought the rights of the Tamil man - that ideology - into the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. That is the only thing I appreciate of what she has done. That was because she was fighting for it with Mr. Vijaya Kumaratunga and us. She saw in front of her own eyes, how people were being killed, how people were being bombed and how people were losing their limbs.

She brought that ideology. Her father made Sinhala the only official language but what happened? The daughter had to change it. That is history. The daughter had to change it. The daughter said No, Sinhala and Tamil are the official languages. This is the history of our people. This is the political opportunism in our country.

So, we have paid enough. We have lost great leaders in this country. From the South, the Hon. R. Premadasa, the Hon. Lalith Athulathmudali, the Hon. Gamini Dissanayake, Mr. Vijaya Kumaratunga, the Hon. Ossie Abeygunasekara, all these people. From the North, people like the Hon. A. Amirthalingam, the Hon V. Yogeswaran and the Hon. V. Dharmalingam who has done yeomen service to that area. They all lost their lives. You and I have survived. At least now, we will sit and discuss, argue, rash out and settle this matter once and for all before we die, without transferring this damn thing to another generation, to our sons also, to suffer. That is our duty.

His Excellency the President has initiated that. There maybe mistakes, there maybe problems for you and for us. So, we will sit down and discuss. A dialogue is the best way. Armed rebellion or fighting each other is not the way to settle matters. We are very modern. We are living in the 21st Century - the human being of the 21st century - not even the 19th or the 20th Century. We have advanced. We are in the IT world. Now, it is a global village. We have to do a lot of things more than fighting each other in this country. All other countries are by-passing us. Countries like Bangladesh created in 1973, by-passed and stood before us. The Maldives, who sold Maldive fish to us and ran the economy, has now come before us. Now, our country is developing too.

I have friends in the Tamil diaspora. They come and meet me in Colombo. I used to meet them when I go to London and discuss with them. Some are moderate; some are extreme. I discuss with everybody. I listen to them. They have reasons but the problem is that they are like our Sinhalese who will talk all the nonsense from the extremes because they are not suffering; their children are not suffering. But, our kith and kin and we are suffering. We, who live in this country, must get together, sit down and talk rather than argue from both sides.

Now, it is very good and I am very happy that the TNA decided to sit with the Government. I am happy for the Select Committee. If we have waited from 1956, for almost 60 years, for a solution to this question, why can we not wait another six months? We will sit together I will also come to the Select Committee. I went before the LLRC and addressed. When I addressed the LLRC, I said I am coming before the LLRC not as a Minister of the Cabinet but as a citizen of this country. Please note, "as a citizen of this country". After my submission, the Chairman of the LLRC said that it was the best submission that they had listened to. He said we take very seriously what you say about the solution to this problem. He asked all the media to cover my speech. He said at the end when he was going out, Rajitha, I will carry tons of your submission in my final report. We also see the same thing". Every LLRC Member commented on my submission.

710 711

We must not reject anybody. Everybody has a problem. Everybody is interested in finding a solution. Sometimes we are confused as to what the correct solution is. So, the best thing is to have a dialogue.We can even argue. We can do anything because there is no terrorism in the South or in the North. His Excellency the President has liberated the country. The best achievement is peace. We can sit and fight and do anything because there is peace. You are safe; we are safe. So, we will take this opportunity. We will go before anybody. We will go and express our opinion. There are enough people.

We are responsible for the people of this country irrespective of their ethnicity. I never left this country though all my batchmates left. Only about three or four doctors remained. At that time if I went to London, there would not have been any need for me to sit for any examination. My degree was recognized, both by the Medical Council and the General Dental Council in the United Kingdom. So, I could have just started practising in London but I refused and fought with my people. We suffered enough, yet, I will not allow my children to leave this country. I will ask them to live and die in this country. We have to build this country for the next generation. It is not for us but for our children to live peacefully. You also did not leave the country. There were many people who spoke so much and made very high militant speeches here. Where are they now? They ran away. You and I stayed in this country.

Now, there is a President who is very practical. He is not like us. He does not lean to any ideology. So, we must use this opportunity. He is a very pragmatic person; he is not a dogmatic person. You can understand that. You may sometimes feel that he does not understand you. No, he is a man going who can sense the people. So, we will get together and arrive at a final solution where there will be peace. I do not say that peace will come, lock, stock and barrel. It may be in stages. We will have to start it from somewhere. The Thirteenth Amendment is a good one. So, we will start it from there. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, please wind up now. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Yes, I will conclude. We do not need to come to Parliament and pass any Bill. We can go with the Thirteenth Amendment. We are not the only people who did this. Later on, the people will understand that devolution will not lead to separating the country. That misunderstanding among the Sinhala people will have to be disproved. So, with the devolution, the country will be united. That is what happens in every part of the world. So that, we have to teach the people. We cannot leave the

Sinhala community, the majority community, and take decisions. We can take decisions but it will not be implemented. So, it is very good. I heard what the Hon. Sumanthiran said when he addressed the Tamil diaspora. He had said the same thing what I said. We have to consider both the Tamil and the Sinhala people. That is how we have to think. I always say that we have to consider both.

In the fishing areas I have not allowed anybody to come and interfere. If there is any area, you can tell me and I will rectify it. About 200 or 300 people from the South were to go to Mullaitivu. Now, there is enough fish there after 30 years. There is a good stock and people try to go there for fishing. I said that only the people who had been chased away due to terrorism in the '80s can come from the South to do fishing in that area. They can prove that; they have their registration. They are the only people who can do fishing there, not anybody else.

I take this opportunity to thank the Hon. Members who have enlightened us on this and especially the Hon. Sampanthan, who, in his speech gave us facts about a lot of areas. But, I cannot go into detail because I do not know much. I only know my area and I only know what I have done earlier regarding the lands. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. D. M. Swaminathan, you have got 10 minutes. [4.55 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Mr. Deputy Speaker, this evening we heard the Hon. Sampanthan moving the Adjournment Motion and also we heard many other speakers on this subject. But, Sir, I wish to bring to your kind notice, the issue as far as the Tamil community of the Northern area is concerned, which has gone on for generations. Originally, there were the Veddas, the Nagas and the Yakas, who were in occupation in this country. As the Nagas were occupying the Northern Province, they were very conversant with the Tamil language. Even if you look at the Sangam period in the Tamil literature, there were Naga poets who had gone to India to take part in the Sangam. In the same way, epics like "Manimehalai", "Mahabharatam" and "Ramayanam" very clearly have laid down that there were Tamil-speaking people specially in the Northern Province. Therefore, if you see the history of this country as far as the Tamils are concerned, they have been inhabitants of the Northern area.

In 1926, the Kandyans had made representation to the Donoughmore Commission that there should be three types of Governments in this country; one for the

712 713

[ () ]

2011 21

Northern and Eastern Province, one for the Central Province and one for the Southern Province.

In the same way in 1944, Mr. Pieter Keuneman and Mr. Vaidyalingam had made representation to the Ceylon National Congress saying that there should be devolution of power and that there should be a degree of autonomy given to the Tamil community. The Communist Party itself conceded it in 1944.

Today, we have discussed this problem many a time. The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne said, "Let us sit and discuss". There is nothing more to discuss. There is the APRC Report. There is the Mangala Moonesinghe Report. There have been many reports that have been submitted to this country and to His Excellency the President. It is really in the hands of His Excellency the President and the Government to see that there is a solution to this problem. This problem is a very serious problem. This emanated, as I told you, from 1926 and now we are in 2011. This same question has been argued, discussed and not taken notice of. Ultimately, what have we gained? We have lost only lives. The people of this country have died.

As the Hon. Sampanthan very clearly said, this is not a political issue. This is a personal problem where an individual is suffering, where an individual fisherman has no right to go and fish. He has to travel eight miles to his vocation. This is a problem that we have to study as an individual problem and not as a political issue. Therefore, the time has come that we have to settle this problem. We are really grateful to the Government. They have won the war. The LTTE has been defeated and there is peace. I agree. But, in the same way they must show the same bona fide to the Tamil community who is living in Jaffna. The situation with regard to land settlement and many issues, as we all very well know, have been really politicized in Jaffna. That is not what we wanted from this Government. That is not what we really need from this Government. We need this argumentative matter to be solved as far as the Tamils are concerned. As far as this Circular regarding the registration of lands is concerned, I wish to ask the Hon. Minister of Lands and Land Development under what Statute this has been brought in? Was it presented to this Parliament? Hon. Sumanthiran, was it presented to Parliament? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) The Circular that has now been circulated in Jaffna is that the people of the Jaffna Province will have to register their deeds with Government officials. What is the Statute that has been brought in? I like to know what

the Statute is? - [Interruption.] I disagree with that because this Circular that has been enforced in Jaffna at the moment is completely an administrative Circular, given to say, that a Government official can register my deed. Can he do that? I have got a valid deed with me which has been registered at the Land Registry Colombo or at the Land Registry in Jaffna. What can a Government officer do then? It is contravening the fundamental rights of the people. Ordinary Government servants cannot take over the judiciary of this country. Can that be done? That is what is happening in Jaffna. Do you call that a reasonable solution to the problem? Is that the way you look after and safeguard the interests of the Tamils? That is not what we want? That is not the correct way, Sir. I think the Hon. Minister has not replied to that question nor has the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne given me the reply on what the Circular is or what the Statute is. This Statute should have been brought before Parliament. The Parliament should have passed this Statute before this notification was given for the public to register themselves with Government officers. What right has the Government officer got?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) This Act was enacted by Parliament in 1998. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I am sorry, that is not correct. This Circular that has been circulated - () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) That Circular is under the Act that was passed by Parliament in 1998. I quoted that. You were not here.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) This Circular that is being circulated in Jaffna at the present moment for registration of land is not under that law.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) The Circular was brought under that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) No, it does not provide that.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Why not?

714 715

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) That Circular does not provide under what provision of the law it has been brought in. - [Interruption.] No, it is not provided in the Circular. If that is provided, show me. Let us look at the Circular. I have seen the Circular. I have got a copy of the Circular.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) What is the circular that gives the Act of Parliament, under which it was brought in? Once an Act is enacted, then for implementation, you send out a circular. In the circular, you do not say this and that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Why not? It states, this and that, I am sorry to say that. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) There are several Committees being appointed under this Circular. Where does the Registration of Title Act give power to the Committees?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) It was given. This is the Gazette notification. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It is not the Gazette Notification we are referring to.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Then, to what? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We are referring to the Circular that is now being circulated. The Commissioner of Lands -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) This comes under the Commissioner of Lands. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) No, it does not. Under the Registration of Documents Ordinance or the statute of the law, a Government officer

cannot take over the right to register a deed. What right does he have to register a deed as a Government officer?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) That was implemented by the UNP Government under the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, not under the Governments of Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike or President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I am not talking about the UNP Government.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) You were not there in that Government. Then, I was the Minister of Lands. At that time, we were discussing it with the LTTE and even the LTTE never objected.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) This Circular is in circulation in Jaffna, in the Northern Province today. I am sorry to say that. - [Interruption.] Please do not interrupt me. I have only a few minutes to speak. Please go through the Circular that is being circulated. That Circular does not give any statute or under which law it has been provided. - [Interruption.]No, that has to be given. That Circular is only confined to the North and the East. Maybe the other system of registration is going on in the other parts of the country. But, that is under a different Act; that is completely a different way of registering. I know what I am talking about because I am also a lawyer, I am also a notary and I have been attesting deeds. But, this is not correct.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Hon. Deputy Speaker, - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I would like you to reply after I speak because I have got just a few minutes more.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) But, I want to make it clear. If you want, you go through this Gazette of 12th January, 2011, which states, I quote:

716 717

2011 21

"PART III - LANDS Title Registration Registration of Title Act, No. 21 of 1998 Making an Order under Section I as an Area coming under the Registration of Title Act .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) No, that is not the issue. We are not talking about that Act. We are talking about the Circular that is being circulated in Jaffna.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) So, it is not the Gazette but only the Circular that is sent out.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Then, you must know what the Circular states. It has nothing to do with this.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) This Gazette states that under the Act of 1998, the Mullaitivu District, the Kilinochchi District, the Vavuniya District, the Jaffna District and the Mannar District are declared -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) No, no, that is not the Circular I am talking about. I am sorry, you are not aware of the Circular.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have only two more minutes left. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Sir, my time has been taken.

Respecting the dignity of this House, I am saying this. This is a very serious matter. Therefore, what I am merely trying to add on to this is that we are being unnecessarily - [Interruption.] First of all, the Government Members in Parliament should know what the Circular contains and what is happening in Jaffna. They are not aware of the

situation. - [Interruption.] That Circular is circulated in the Northern Province and the Eastern Province without giving any statute; no law passed by Parliament has been provided in that.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) The lawyers are there. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) The lawyers have no power. The lawyers have nothing to do with this.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) The lawyers can challenge it in the Supreme Court. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Yes, you can challenge it in the Supreme Court. That is correct but we do not want to do that.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) The lawyers are there. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Okay, we can. Anyway, thank you for saying that. We can challenge it in the Supreme Court but it is a different forum. Therefore, what I am merely trying to say is that there are so many differences of opinion as far as the minority community is concerned. We have been deprived of so many rights, not from today but from the year 1926 to date. At least, this Government should take steps to eradicate that. But, I am sorry to say, as the Hon. Sampanthan very clearly said, they are not trying to eradicate that but are trying further to create a confusion as far as the Tamil community is concerned and to eradicate the Tamils from the Northern Province and the Eastern Province. That is supposed to be the ambition of the Government.

In winding up, I would like to say that in these circumstances, it is the duty of the Government to safeguard the interests of the minority community, especially of those in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces.

Thank you very much.

Again, they are trying to create an LTTE in Sri Lanka. But, we do not like you doing that because we have lost many lives, not only of Tamils but also of the Sinhalese and the Muslims. We lost lives, we lost a good period. We do not want that to happen again. - [Interruption.] Hon. Sumanthiran, you do not know anything about the North and the East. You have never come to that area. You are living in Colombo. You cannot even write Tamil although you speak Tamil. You do not know anything about those areas.

People need development. His Excellency the President is developing the country. There is no discrimination. We are doing the same development everywhere.You ask the Minister. the Hon.

[5. 18 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to speak on this Adjournment Motion.

I am particularly happy to speak after the Minister of Fisheries, who made an impassioned appeal in this House. Unfortunately, he is not here but even at the risk of sounding patronizing, let me commend him for the sentiments that he expressed here. If His Excellency the President and all the Ministers together have that attitude, we will not have had the need to move this Adjournment Motion in this House today.

Before I deal with certain detailed aspects of the matters that concern us in both the Provinces, I want to clarify one matter. Unfortunately, both Ministers who contended that the registration process that is now in place is being done legally and under the Registration of Titles Act, are not here. Yet, for purposes of record, let me say this.

In 1998, the Registration of Titles Act was brought in to this HHouse as a bill and was pending. At that time there were several objections to it and even the Ministry of Lands had over 80 amendments that were proposed to this Act. I have the full document here where the Bar Association of Sri Lanka and the Ministry of Lands together suggested amendments prior to the passage of that Act. Unfortunately, on a day when the main Opposition party sat outside the Parliament, this Act was

passed without the amendments been taken into consideration; without a Debate it was passed.

That is the reason why until this year, for 12 years, this Act has not been acted upon. Even now, with the Law Commission also having considered the matter I understand that there are more than 93 amendments that have been suggested to be made to this Act. Those amendments have to be made. Without making those amendments, suddenly out of the blue as it were, Gazette notifications are being issued, bringing the Act into operation only in the five districts of the Northern Province and that happened in the month of January this year. Thereafter, on the 22nd of July, 2011, Circular No. 2011/04 issued by the Land Commissioner Generals Department came into being. All that the Mover of this Adjournment Motion referred to was this Circular, not the procedure under the Registration of Title Act. That is not to say that the Registration of Title Act procedure is commendable. We are not against title registration. I must make this very clear. That is a modern system that must come into being. That has to come into being but it must come into being with all the necessary amendments to the Act.

But, what is happening here is, despite all the assurances that are given by the Hon. Ministers, the Circular itself says that it applies only to the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Speeches are made in this House that this is not a matter that is confined only to the North and the East but for the entire country. But, your Circular does not say that. Your Circular confines this procedure only to the North and the East and the two months deadline that has been given through a press notification asking the people of Jaffna and of certain districts to send documents to the Divisional Secretary is only in this Circular. There is no time limit given in the Registration of Title Act.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

, .

, , . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES took the Chair.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, even under the Registration of Title Act, one sees that there is a procedure for title registration. Initially, certain districts are demarcated and the Act comes into operation. That was done in January this year for the five districts in the North. Then, Section 11 of the Act requires that cadastral surveys be done and -

724 725

[ ]

2011 21

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) It is done in the Gampaha District also. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Very well. Only Gampaha, Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi and Mannar. One or two districts from this side of the country. ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) Kalutara also. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, what do you have to say about this Circular that confines it only to the North and the East? It is not under any law. It contravenes - [Interruption.] I have only a few minutes to wind up my speech. This applies only to the North and the East. This is totally illegal as far as the laws of this country are concerned. There are committees that have been appointed with military personnel in it. From where do we get this law? This is not under the law; certainly not under the law. The two-month time limit that has been given through a press notification supposedly for the Registration of Title Act is only in this Circular. It is not in the Act. Until the cadastral surveys are done and registered, you cannot call for claims, even under the Registration of Title Act. So, the law is contravened. There are things done outside - [Interruption.] Please do not disturb me. You can answer that later. - [Interruption.] I know. I have limited time. This Circular is totally outside the law. It is illegal. That is the question that is raised. When the question is raised about the Circular, speeches are made about the desirability of having a title registration system. What we are saying is this. Even if you implement a title registration system for the entire country, the situation in the North and the East in the last 30 years is such that people have lost their paper title deeds.

They have not been able to go to court to do testamentary cases or to do administrator's conveyances and a large majority of the people do not have paper title deeds in their own names. There is a case for delaying title registration in the North and the East even if it is implemented in the rest of the country. But, what you are doing is just the opposite. You are starting it in the North and the East quite contrary to the scheme of the Act and without any cadastral surveys being done and registered. You are issuing Circulars where power is being taken out of the judiciary and various committees are being set up. You have stopped land alienation. You are talking about land being distributed. Virtues of Dudley Senanayake and S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike are being praised in this House but land alienation has been stopped in the North and the East according to this Circular.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, now wind up please.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran)

I will wind up, Sir. I have been dealing with certain matters. I know that there is time limitation. Therefore, without impinging on the time might I be permitted to table* this document dealing with some of these matters and that can be annexed at the end of my speech.

I want to also mention about the assault on the Jaffna University student leader that took place recently. This is a very worrying situation. Incidents like this have happened. This happened to us also and we knew who did it because they came in uniforms. Now, this cannot be permitted to happen. If you are saying that all in this country, whether they be in the North and the East or elsewhere are equal, you cannot have a situation like this happening. This is happening far too often for you to say that that is just another matter that we do not have to worry about like the rest of the country.

There were questions raised by the Hon. Deputy Minister of Resettlement about colonization. I will give one example and sit down. Recently 30 families belonging to the majority community were settled in Omadiyamadu in the Batticaloa District without the knowledge of the Government Agent and the Divisional Secretary. You can go and see it. You cannot say that this is not happening. It is happening. So, why are all these things happening? Why do we have to raise them time and again? This is the second time that we have asked for a full day's Debate on the situation in the North and the East. We are bringing this to your attention. Several of the matters that we brought to your attention last time are still unsettled and still not done. The situation has only deteriorated. So, I appeal to you, the Hon. Ministers who are here, please take this message that the Tamil National Alliance is bringing to you today. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Sumanthiran, you have already taken three more minutes . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) And, if you are interested in reconciliation, please change the direction in which you are moving.

Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. R. Yogarajan, you have got 10 minutes. [5. 44 p. m.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, if I could have spoken soon after the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, I would have been a much happier man. Unfortunately, I am speaking after the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, who seems to be defending the President and the Government, more than speaking facts.

It is unfortunate that the Muslim people who were displaced from the North have not been resettled. That is

an issue that you have to take up with your Government. The TNA has always said that they would cooperate with you in this regard.

I believe that during the speech by the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, he displayed so much of feelings towards reconciliation of the Tamil, Sinhala and Muslim people in this country so that we can live together as one nation in the future. He said reconciliation between the Tamil community, the Sinhala community and the Muslim community is important to have a true Sri Lankan nation. Being a person who came from the Leftist Movement, he has always expressed views of reconciliation. He has always stood for devolution and he hopes to be on the Select Committee, if appointed. I do hope that people like him will be nominated by the Government into the Select Committee if they are serious about solving the national issue in this country.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) We will look after our appointments. You look after the Opposition. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) When the Hon. Rajitha Senaratne decided - ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) . . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) . - ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) , . [ ] " " .

Among the seventeen Members from the UNP who joined the Government in 2006, it was only to the Hon. Rajitha Senaratne I spoke personally and requested him not to join to this Government because his views do not match the views of this Government. - [Interruption.] I was not in the UNP at that time. I was then -

734 735

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Who told you to cross over from the CWC to the UNP? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Because I believe that the UNP can do more for my people than the CWC or your Government. The Hon. Hon. Risad Badhiutheen is saying that there are a few racialist Members in your Government who are tying the hands of the President. But, I believe that he is the leader of that racial group and that is why we have so much of problems in this country. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Who? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The Leader of your Government. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I said the Leader of your Government. I did not mention any name or I did not refer to His Excellency the President. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, what is the point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You cannot use innuendoes also. The Member by now should have read the Standing Orders. Sir, he is referring to - Who is the Leader? Who is the Leader? Is he referring to the late Thondaman? Is he referring to the late Amirthalingam? Therefore, innuendoes - ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, that is not a point of Order. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Deputy Chairman of Committees, there have been

references to names in this House. So, for him to say this, is not fair. The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen said that it is racialists who are holding back action by this Government. But, I feel that this Government is led by people who believe only in racialism. That is why we have this problem.

When I came to this House today, I believe that it is under the Registration of Title Act that the registration in the North and the East is being is done. I did study a document by the late Mr. Arthur Samarasekera, who was a Presidents Counsel and a Member of the Central Committee of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. He says that there are three officers to be appointed: the Commissioner of Title Settlement, the Registrar-General of Title and, of course, the Surveyor General who exists. But, these appointments have not been made and before the title registration takes place, there are three things to be done. First, the areas have to be declared. Then, there has to be a cadastral survey to be done and subsequently the Registrar-General of Title has to call for applications. Calling for applications is voluntary. Mr. Arthur Samarasekera says, If you make it compulsory, then the idea of creating titles which will be acceptable will be nullified. He especially says that the process of compulsory registration of title will nullify the idea of creating valuable titles that will be acceptable. Under these circumstances, you are bringing in a circular and forcing the people in the North and the East to register their properties. How unfair it is because they are being asked to do it within two months. Many of them who are displaced have no documents, they live abroad or have so many other issues. Is this a fair way? Are you doing this to grab the lands of the people who are unable to enjoy it today? Are you trying to grab the lands of the people who have lost their documents? This is like what you did in the registration of voters.

We have nearly 1.8 million people working in the Middle-East. When these people want to register their votes in the South, nobody says that they have to physically see the person before registering his vote. But, when voter registration took place in the North and the East in 2010, the officers were instructed to insist on seeing the person physically present before registering the voters and that was why the number of registered voters in the North reduced and subsequently four Members of Parliament have been lost by the Tamil people in the North and the East. So, are you trying to do the same thing today in the North and the East in the registration of titles so that the people in the North and the East could lose their ownership, their right to live on lands that they have been living in for years, which they have owned or got some legal document, which has been issued as a grant.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, your time is over. Please wind up.

736 737

2011 21

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, I have been given 10 minutes. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) You have almost taken that time. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Okay. There is one more issue, Sir. The Hon. Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs, while speaking here, said that he is going to address the issue of no Tamil-speaking person getting selected under the Sri Lanka Administrative Service and that he is going to have a separate examination to select 60 persons as Sri Lanka Administrative Service Officers by a process of a separate examination. But, is this the way to address the issue of public sector employment? There are 92 per cent Sinhalese persons in the State sector employment whereas 25 per cent of the Tamil-speaking minorities have only 8 per cent share in the State sector employment. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now. Time is very limited. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) However, this Government, which feels that the ratio of the Sinhalese employed in the State sector in the Eastern Province is below the ratio of the ethnic population in the Eastern Province, has introduced Circular No. 15 of 1990 that permits the ethnic ratio to be considered for recruitments in the Eastern Province alone. If you wish to correct the imbalance in the State sector employment in the Eastern Province, why do you not implement the same principle in the rest of the country so that you can prove yourself to be a non-racial Government led by a racial leader? Thank you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, as I begin, I have to perform a painful task - that is, we are deeply moaning the death of Colonel Muammar Al Gaddafi, the leader of the Libyan Jamahiriyah. He was a great leader of the Arab world. He united the African countries, helped form the Union of the African Countries and was responsible in ushering a new era in the Middle East. Why should he face this tragic end? He ruled his country for 42 years. That is his country. - [Interruption.]

Do not permit me to say nasty things about you because you are a good Friend of mine. What kind of death do you deserve, Hon. Vinayagamoorthy? You wait and see. What is the type of death that will befall you? Do not talk like that. Ask the Hon. Sampanthan. Do not talk ill of the death. Shut up,

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] back-bencher. You are aged. I am telling you. Sir, he is

insulting Muslims and the Islamic world. When the Muslim world is so much grieved to see a great tragedy befallen on them, he should not utter such things.

Colonel Gaddafi came to Sri Lanka in 1976 to attend the Non-aligned Conference. He was accommodated at Acland House - Visumpaya, the present official residence of the Hon. D.M. Jayaratne, the Prime Minister. He was a very charismatic figure. People all over the world received his benevolence. Sir, today we see a Superpower invading a Third World country and killing its leader. What a tragedy! Where is the human conscience? Where is civilization hidden? I would ask only this. Allahu Tha-ala has never ill-abdicated His powers to anybody else in this world. However superior you may call yourself - [Interruption.] If you are mad,

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] Hon. Vinayagamoorthy, get out

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] and go home before I shut you out.

Therefore, this is a tragedy. The so-called Superpower did the same thing to Saddam Hussein. They made use of Saddam Hussein against Iran. In Afghanistan, they dismembered the country. In Pakistan, they were bogging. For how long will this prolong? In order to fight this tyranny, the world has to wake up. In order to hide their nakedness, the catastrophe they are facing internally, economically, America and other Western countries resort to bully Third World countries. Therefore, they are doing this for oil, to lure oil. We must also look very cautiously about the whole thing. Therefore, I, on behalf of our Members in Parliament and the Muslim community, say according to the Islamic rites, Innalillahi Wa-innailaihi Rajioon.

Free-thinking people live freely. The Charter of United Nations is very clear - Non-interference in the affairs of other nations. Why do you want to make a breach of that principle where Third World countries are concerned. Is what we see a civilized world? When you have fallen, your brain is taken out of your body and the dead body is shamelessly drawn along the street. They were kicking the body and dismembering that body.

I would ask these people, these so-called superpowers to learn a lesson, a civilized act of our King Dutugemunu. When the victor was King Dutugemunu and the vanquished was King Elara, what did Dutugemunu do? He built a "kotha" - memorial for Elara - and told all his Sinhalese brethren passing that way to pay their respect to Elara's tomb. That is the civilization and the culture that a Sri Lankan had taught the world over the ages, Sir.

Let the West take a lesson from our own culture and civilization.

Then, coming on to the subject raised by the Hon. Sampanthan, - [Interruption.] Hon. Vinayagamoorthy,

!

. Sir, I want to tell the Hon. Sampanthan, please invite the so-called diaspora to witness this mad scene here. The way the TNA Members are behaving today in this House is condemnable. I have been associating with persons like Thanthai S.J.V. Chelvanayakam, Vanniyasingam, Dr. Naganathan, V.N. Navaratnam, K.P. Ratnam, Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam, M. Sivasithamparam, Dharmalingam, Yogeswaran, Rajavarothayam, C. Rajathurai, Rasamanikkam, Thangathurai, Kadiraveluppillai and others of that calibre.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) They never behaved like this. Under the leadership of Thanthai S.J.V. Chelvanayakam, they never behaved like this. Now, these people have become clowns

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] in this House. I am very sorry to say this. - [Interruption.]

clowns

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] are led by the Hon. R. Sampanthan.

The TNA do not want development. They want some other things in the North. See the development work taking place in the North. Never in the history of this country, in so short a period, has so much of development work been done in the Northern Province. This Government is doing it now. It was only the other day that the Udagirata Randiyawara -" "- the Batticaloa Water Supply Project was ceremonially opened by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. It was initiated by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Minister of Water Supply and Drainage in the presence of so many distinguished leaders, including the Hon. Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan, the Chief Minister of the Eastern Province along with the Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The other matter is this. Sir, see the bridges that were declared open. The Upparu New Bridge was constructed instead of the Upparu old bridge in the Eastern Province. Five bridges including Yan-Oya were constructed and declared open by none other than the President of this country by visiting that area.

Sir, I have to mention one other matter in this House. It is about Mr. N.M.C. Thilakarathne, the Librarian of Parliament. He is a long-serving officer in Parliament and a very good librarian. He joined the service in 1984 and he is serving up to this day. Before we meet again on the 8th of November, 2011, he is retiring. He has been very helpful to us. Whenever I wanted a copy of the Erskine May or some other constitutional or legal enactment, he always made sure that they were readily available. I would like to take this opportunity in this House to wish Mr. Thilakarathne good luck in the future and a happy retired life.

The Hon. Leader of the Opposition was fighting the devil. When he was speaking in the morning, I told him, by way of a point of Order, that he can go with Mr. A.J.M. Muzammil to the Town Hall. He can do it very well according to the Gazette No. 1717/13 of 2nd August, whereby the MC will be reconstituted to meet on 1st November, 2011. There is no point in wasting time with the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. He can very well go with his new mayor, Mr. A.J.M. Muzammil, who is going to take over from Mr. Omar Kamil, the Special Commissioner and sit in the mayoral seat on 1st November. We also wish him success in his office because he is already in touch with President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to develop the City. - [Interruption.] Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . .

[6.55 p. m.]

( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity. There are only five minutes before the conclusion of the Debate. When I looked at the Motion proposed by the Hon. R. Sampanthan, a very senior and veteran politician,

758 759

I thought it was a very sincere effort from his point of view. But, when you look at his choice of words to express his case today, I was a bit disappointed. The Representatives of the Tamil community in this House have always come out with various grievances to make their case.

Today, we were very cautiously listening to the Hon. Sampanthan. He used the word, "cleansing", which I think is a bit "out of order" today, to say that we are trying to remove the Tamil-speaking people away from the Northern part of Sri Lanka. I think that is not correct.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) He did not say that. He said - ( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) Let me finish. I do not want you to interfere with my speech. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If you continue to do this, we can use that word.

( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) Do not interfere with my two minutes' time. - [Interruption.] No, he used the word, "cleansing". .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We will have to use that word, if you continue with this. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) Will you leave it with me? - [Interruption.] Listen to me. When we were in school - I come from the Colombo City - we had more than 68 - 70 per cent Sinhalese living in Borella. Today, it has gone down to 48 per cent. Do we say that the Sinhalese in the City have been cleansed? We do not call it "cleansing". It is because of development and various reasons that things have changed. So, if we take it in that same spirit, we can say Sinhalese people have been cleansed or have been removed from the City. So, I would urge the Hon. Sampanthan - [Interruption.] Listen to me. Hon. Sampanthan, you have a big role to play in this House.

You are a very respected senior Tamil Leader in this society. When you come out with something, we would like to give a good hearing because as much as the Tamil- speaking people in this country, the Sinhala-speaking people would like to see a long-term settlement to this whole problem that we have gone through. We do not want to leave this problem which we have experienced over the last 30-years in the hands of our children.

I read a good news item yesterday with regard to the disabled Beach Volleyball team. It is made up of three ex-Army players and three ex-LTTE players. What a wonderful combination! These people who are now disabled are participating as active sportsmen for a national event. Now, when we make a genuine effort to encourage such things, you bring in Motions, you debate about some circular for hours in this House. The Deputy Minister of Lands and Land Development explained very clearly about the genuine efforts we are making in this regard. If the TNA feels that they are the only group representing the Tamil community in this country, they are totally mistaken. We also have Tamil and Tamil-speaking friends. They write to us about their grievances from overseas. They make complaints that they have lost their lands, their houses, but they would like to come back to Sri Lanka and we would like to welcome them. This arrangement, this circular is a sincere effort to expedite that process. At one time you all were saying that we were going too slow. Now, when we are making a genuine effort to give people a chance of going back to their houses, find their lands and properties, you are saying that we are expediting it with an ulterior motive. I think the true spirit of this House should be to get together to find a solution to this problem. I can tell you from my personal experience that when Muttiah Muralitharan was charged for chucking in 1995, not a single Tamil person came to help me. I secured that boy. In 1998, he was charged, in 2001 he was charged and in 2003 he was again charged; altogether on four occasions, he was charged. All these times we stood by him, we fought for him. We made sure that Muttiah Muralitharan continues to play for the Sri Lanka Cricket team, continues to be a champion bowler and retires as a world-class player. Not a single Tamil-speaking person came to my help. I am telling this to show you that we are not extremists. We respect Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, everybody. As long as you are a Sri Lankan, we will help you for the greater interest of the country. The issues brought up by the Hon. Sampanthan, through this Motion, have been very clearly addressed by our Ministers. But, the way you have presented it, we feel that you are finding fault with the governments in power for the last 30 years, not of the LTTE. I do not think any elected Member would like to see a guerrilla movement or a terrorist movement with weapons. That is what happened in 1971; we dealt with it. In 1998, we dealt with it. From 1983 to 2009, we, as governments, have been dealing with it. So, it does not matter whether it is the JVP or the LTTE.
