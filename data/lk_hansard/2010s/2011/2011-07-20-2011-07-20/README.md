There are 15 harbours to be established under the leadership of the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development in Silawatura, Vankalai, Talaimannar, Gurunagar, Myliddy, Point Pedro, Chalai, Mullaitivu, Pudavaikaddu - all are in the North but Pudavaikaddu is in the East - in Ilangathurai, Palachchenai, Kallar, Pottuvil, Kalamatiya and Gandara .

, . . .. . . . ; .

So, he has got very talented expertise, personnel to help him. People of the calibre of Dr. Hiran Jayawardene of NARA, the other expert, Dr.T.B. Wanninayake, they are guiding him well. He is fortunate enough to get the help and assistance to pool the resources in order to develop the fishing industry in this country. Then, look at the new Chairman of the Ceylon Fishery Harbours Corporation. He was one of our Colleagues in this House, Mr. Amal Senadhilankara. I pay tribute to him, to the talented Board of Directors and others who are helping the Minister ably.

Then, Sir, - longtime vessels- . . Basic training is given to

fishermen to export Tuna fish with Sashimi quality - - with the collaboration of a |Japanese company. They will purchase directly from the fishermen and I think you will also get a commission. As a result, there is income coming to the Ceylon Fishery Harbours Corporation. Vocational Training for fishing youth on new technology will be given with the collaboration of CINEC. This is now being handled by

a Sri Lankan firm and the Institute is in Malabe. I am happy to say that the first centre will be established in Beruwala within a months time, I believe, and thereafter they will go to Cod Bay in the Eastern Province. Tuna fishing Silverline Fishery International (Pvt.) Limited . There is a plan to purchase Japanese dredgers. . Mitsubishi . . . . That is the biggest fishing harbour in Asia. .

I will finish with this. Our Friends are missing from the House now. There is Jayalalitha across the Palk Strait and Jayalath La-La in this House; Jayalalitha is across the Palk Strait and Jayalath-La-La is in this country. Both are the same. They are conspirators. So, there is no difference between Jayalalitha and Jayalath-La-La.

I should emphasize that in this House. I am happy because our learned Lawyer, the Hon. D.M. Swaminathan, is also in this House.

Then, Sir, there is a list of prison offences under the revision made to the Section 78 of the Prisons Ordinance of 1956. It states, I quote :

A prisoner shall be guilty of an offence against prison discipline if he -

(xvi) without the authority of a prison officer, communicates whether by writing, speech or gesture with any person who is not connected with the administration of the prison ;

What is Mr. Sarath Fonseka doing daily at the court there? Everyday he is speaking to the press. He had made it a propaganda meeting for him when they are taking him to courts. I think the Minister of Justice and also the Government should take very serious note of this. He is violating - the Hon. Swaminathan who is sitting across the aisle here will agree with me - the Prisons Ordinance. He will agree with me because he is a senior lawyer. This has set a precedent. Some relatives of certain prisoners who came from the fishing community in Beruwala asked me, , ?

? So, it will be a very bad precedent for other prisoners also if this is allowed to continue. I think the time has come. He is making propaganda. He is lashing out at the Government. Let him do it if he wants to, but, he is a convicted prisoner. There are two cases against him, in that he is a remand prisoner who has already been convicted for 30 months. As a result, as a prisoner he must observe discipline of the prison laws and ordinances and if he still continues to violate them, I state in this House that stern action must be taken against him and clear orders given to the Commissioner General of Prisons to take proper action regarding this.

Thank you very much.
