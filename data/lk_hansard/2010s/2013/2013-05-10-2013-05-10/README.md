. . Question proposed. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ..). . [2.47 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Speaker, when I look at this Motion moved by our good Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, I am reminded of a very good Sinhala saying, " ) " . ) ? ) . ) . ), ) . The UNP has not given their audit report. It is a very important party.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, when we make a statement in Parliament, we present relevant facts and figures. If there is an irresponsible Member who wants to throw mud, let it be done on a question mark, not at the UNP. The UNP has done everything that is required as per the legislation and

2441 2442

)

we have given it to the Commissioner of Elections. So, please tell him to withdraw that statement because there is no such thing that the UNP has not given. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . [ )] , .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) ? . ) . . ) .

Sir, we know what is happening there. I do not want to go into their inner circle and wash dirty linen in this House because I also have been a member of that party long before this Member who moved the Motion. Sir, I think what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander also. Let them tell the country that they have given all these details. I challenge them to issue a statement today or tomorrow and let the Commissioner of Elections reveal the details. There are other parties. They are also duty-bound to submit these details according to the Constitution and election laws.

I must also pay tribute to Mr. Mahinda Deshapriya, an able Commissioner of Elections who is doing his job very well. He has endeared himself to all the parties. He is free for people to meet him. He never closes his door. Therefore, Sir, as far as the Election Commission is concerned, they are doing their part well.

Sir, there is point telling these things. At one time, it was the Hon. Thilak Karunaratne who saved this party. , -2013.05.10 - "" , " " . . , Elections Commissioner ) , ? . ) . . . . ) ? ) ? ? ? After all, the country has a right, this Parliament has a right and you have a right as the Hon. Speaker to ask because they are a party that has ruled this country from 1947. Today, you can see the plight in which they are; the abysmal and deplorable condition that they have fallen into. We feel sorry about it. We are very hurt that the party has fallen into this condition of debt as has never happened. But, the question that has been asked is, "where is that money?".

. . . . ) ) - , , ) , ) - ! . Electricity bills . If the Mover of this Motion has money, let him pay like how the Hon. Thilak Karunaratne did those days, out of sympathy.

Then, another very important matter is that several commissions have been appointed under the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution was passed in this House and all the commissions have been appointed under Article 41A. The Human Rights Commission has been appointed. Justice Priyantha R.P. Perera has been appointed as Chairman of that together with Mrs. Jezima Ismail and others on 12th February, 2011. Mr. Ariyarathne Hewage has been appointed to the Finance Commission on 24th February, 2012. In the appointments to the Supreme Court, the Hon. Peter Mohan Maithri Peiris as the Chief Justice and four other members have been appointed on 15th January, 2013. Then, Vidyajothi Dr. Dayasiri Fernando as Chairman and eight others have been appointed to the Public Service Commission on 12th May, 2011. Members have been appointed to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. . , Chairman . . Members to the Judicial Service Commission have been appointed on 9th June, 2011. The Hon. S. Sriskandarajah as the President including other members have been appointed to the Court of Appeal on 23rd June, 2011 Then, Sir, Mr. H.A.S. Samaraweera has been appointed as the Auditor-General on 9th August, 2011. The Attorney-General, the Hon. Sarath Palitha Fernando, was appointed on 12th July, 2012. The Secretary-General of Parliament, Mr. Dhammika Dasanayake, our very good friend, was appointed on 8th February, 2012. The Police Commission has been appointed with Mr. Senaka Walgampaya as the Chairman on 15th February, 2012.

Now, Sir, there are pertinent questions that we ask as responsible Members. You are the Chairman of this Parliamentary Council and you have the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition also in it. As envisaged, one person from one community of the Government is myself together with the Hon. D.M. Swaminathan from the Opposition. Now, the Hon. Swaminathan has gone public and revealed through so many newspapers that the Leader of the Opposition does not want him to go - he knows it. He is not here now. He is not going to say, no. -when the newspaper asked, "Why are you two not attending?". Sir, their attendance is mandatory according to the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution. They are asking for the Nineteenth

2443 2444

[ ]

2013 10

Amendment, Twentieth Amendment and so on. This Eighteenth Amendment is being implemented properly. But, a responsible Member like the Leader of the Opposition fails to attend meetings. He has not taken part in the appointment of any of these members. You know it very well. The Hon. Swaminathan has said, "The Leader of the Opposition does not want me to go".

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, my Motion is on presenting a financial audit report to the Election Commission by political parties. The Member does not understand what the Motion is about and has got his wires crossed. I was given 10 minutes to propose and he is given five minutes to go on a voyage of discovery. I would greatly appreciate if you tell the Hon. Member to speak on the subject matter, which he very rarely does.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . ) . , .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, people who played out the UNP, people who played out the late Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali, and people who destroyed the CWC, now have the audacity to rise up in this House, dressed in coat and tie, and speak like this. I am referring to the Constitution. Under the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the Parliamentary Council has been appointed and it makes appointments to all these Commissions and to the Election Commission too. The responsible Leader of the Opposition has not attended one single meeting. This must be reported to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. Not only that, he has committed a punishable offence. He has told his party nominee not to attend meetings.

How much respect do they pay to the Constitution? Therefore, Sir, I believe this must be investigated into. We must amend at least this Article and include other

parties or more members from the Government to the Council. They have deliberately refused to attend any of its meetings and all appointments in the Commissions have been signed by you, the Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Prime Minister and myself.

Therefore, I must say that when you throw stones at others, sometimes they can come direct back on you. You are not able to properly prop up your image because there is a skeleton in the cupboard of the Mover and the United National Party.

Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, no. The Audit Report is also in a section of this Act. It is not just the Audit Report.

* : : Document tabled: Conclusions Exposure to a combinations of factors that are toxic to the kidney (rather than one single factor) seems to cause this kidney disease. Toxic factors identified up to now include, nephrotoxic agrochemicals, arsenic and cadmium. Genetic factors and other known risk factors of kidney disease appear to increase the individual susceptibility to this triple threat. Several other predisposing factors that may contribute to the development of this disease are under investigation. The social and economic impact of CKDu on impoverished households is grave.

It is essential that steps are taken as soon as possible. Delaying action will cause further accumulation of toxic agents in the environment and result in cumulative damage to the health of the people living in these areas and with time, also affects younger age groups.
