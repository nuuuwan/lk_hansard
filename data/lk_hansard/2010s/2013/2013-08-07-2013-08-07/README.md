( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the Hon. Minister can table the Answer but I also have the right to raise a Supplementary Question. It has not been debarred. I am asking a very pertinent question.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Deputy Speaker, as we have time, we can give him two or three minutes.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, what I am asking is, were these administrative provinces in Sri Lanka demarcated on the basis of the so-called "traditional homeland" and what were the areas and towns included? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We have given full particulars starting from 1833. Declarations have been made in 1845, 1873, 1886, 1889

and in 1988. The final declaration was in 2006. At no stage had it been declared that these were being demarcated on the basis of "traditional homeland". So, the "traditional homeland" theory was never applied to the demarcation of provinces.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Even during the British time? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I was not living during the British time. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I know.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) But, I think the British also did not follow that theory. They followed an economic rule in order to collect revenue. That is how it originated. Even today, those provincial boundaries have been declared aiming on development.

Mr. Presiding Member, I want to say this in English. Let it be clear to James Packer that intimidation would not work. If you do this in Australia, Mr. Packer, you would go to jail. So, you would not even dream of doing such a thing in Australia. I tell Packer, do not try this again. You maybe planning on doing a billion dollar business here and I may be a small fry but you cannot intimidate a Member of Parliament of this sovereign country. I have all the right to express our opinion, to fight on behalf of the people and to make sure that Mr. Packer pays taxes. He cannot send his henchmen to shove me around and intimidate me.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Okay, Sir.

Sir, I also want to say this. If anything were to happen to me - I say this today in this Chamber - please remember what I said today. So, you can tell Mr. Packer to back off. I am telling Mr. Packer and this country - I do not know him personally - that this is not the way to deal with it. Do not send people to push me around and try to intimidate me. That would not work. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up.

Sir, coming on to the subject, the Government has imposed a 10 per cent tax on gold imports with immediate effect to curb overseas purchases by traders looking to take advantage of a favourable price arbitrage with top consumer India. While Sri Lanka did not have a duty on gold prior to this, its neighbour India hiked import taxes for the metal by 33 per cent earlier in June to rein in a ballooning trade deficit. The Sri Lanka Customs has recently nabbed a number of people suspected of smuggling gold out of the country at airports. So, the Government has imposed a 5 per cent Customs Duty and another 5 per cent surcharge on gold imports.

? . . , . . , . Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal says that Sri Lankas gold import surged to US Dollars 100 million in the first four months of the year from about US Dollars 150 million for the full year 2012. Therefore Sir, we are on the right track. We are developing this country. You can see mega projects springing up all over the country like daffodils blooming in the early morning. All these are happening because of one person, one leader, because of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Sir, the Hon. Members in the Opposition cannot gulp this down; cannot stomach it. That is the problem. See the most pathetic, the abysmal depth that the Opposition has fallen into, the downward trend they are heading towards. They have nothing to speak about. You do mega projects, put up buildings, construct expressways and extend railwayline to Jaffna, but they are blind to all these developments. They talk as if nothing is happening.

The Ambassador for the Republic of Turkey in Sri Lanka, His Excellency Iskender K. Okyay came here and inaugurated the Sri Lanka-Turkey Parliamentary Friendship Association. These are the matters that we should spotlight. Then, together with him the Third Secretary Mohmet Aktas came. The Minister of Productivity Promotion, the Hon. Basheer Segu Dawood was elected the President of that newly-formed Association. They like Sri Lanka. They are interested in Sri Lanka. The great Ottoman Empire in the days of old ruled half of the Europe. They have material power. They have wealth. They can help us in so many ways and they are coming here to do just that. They wanted to form the

Sri Lanka-Turkey Parliamentary Friendship Association. I think the Hon. R. Yogarajan was also present there.

Then Sir, we went to China. . . , . . . , . ? -, , - , . . ?

Who built the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall? The Chinese built it. Those days, Sir, if you had been in Colombo, you would have been surprised to see thousands of very disciplined Chinese workers being taken to the site lined up in a queue and the building came up in no time. It is so surprising to see such an amazing architectural structure. That is the value of the Chinese people. They are determined; they do work tirelessly.

COLOMBO SOUTH CONTAINER TERMINAL

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, I move,

Colombo South Container Terminal and a breakwater built at a staggering cost of Rs. 400 million were declared open by His Excellency the President on 5th August 2013 which turned a new leaf in the history of Sri Lanka.

I move that this House be enlightened about the socio-economic benefits of the Colombo South Container Terminal, built within a short period of time at a massive cost, accrues to Sri Lanka.

I table* the Sinhala and Tamil versions of the Motion to be included in Hansard. Before I commence, the Hon. P. Piyasena would second the Motion and after that I would carry on.

* : * : * Sinhala and Tamil versions of Motion tabled:

" .. 400 2013 05 . ."

" 400

2013 05 . ."

. ( . ) (The Hon. P. Piyasena) , ... . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, we are in a new world. The world is moving fast. We are in the 21st Century. We see massive changes taking place in the global arena. Man went to the moon. Gagarin conquered the moon first. Then, Neil Armstrong. After that, a Chinese man. We saw his spacecraft in China, when we had the good opportunity of visiting China with His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Then, Sir, I must quote the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future" first. See how beautifully this is portrayed in the Mahinda Chintana. Page 11 of the "Mahinda Chintana" states, I quote:

"South Colombo Port As is well known, the construction of the South Colombo Port is now in progress and the new Port is expected to commence its commercial operations by the year 2012.

The mega vessels which are now not in able to access the Colombo Port will then be able to enter the new Port and the container handling capacity will then double. The new Port will reduce the time taken for import and export procedures, while increased competition between marine companies will lead to reduced shipping charges. The new Port will also enable farmers to export their products to markets worldwide. In this manner, the economic benefits will not only be accruing to the country, but also directly to our farmers and entrepreneurs."

Page 10 refers to the Hambantota Port and page 11 refers to the South Colombo Port and finishes up with the Galle Port to a Tourism Port. Not only in the South, we are also having ports being developed in North: the Kankesanthurai Harbour and the Oluvil Harbour in the Eastern Province.

Therefore, Sir, see these achievements! I think it is very rare in political history of any country that an election promise is fulfilled to the letter. This is not like growing onions or potatoes; this is a mega project. You need billions of rupees. You have to compete with this type of harbours that are being built right along in very

many countries. Although this was a far-fetched vision, thank God, our President has fulfilled this. Today, we have one of the best landmarks in this country; opened a new era of miracle in Sri Lanka. If this is not progress, what is progress, I ask in this House? If you cannot see these developments, then, you are surely blind. That is what has happened to the Opposition. I pray in this House, Sir, that their eyes get opened.

Now, about the Port itself, see this leaflet about the Sri Lanka Colombo Port Expansion Project.

It states, I quote:

"The port expansion project will enhance efficiency, increase competitiveness, and attract more ships to Colombo.

As the demand for relay transshipment increases, South Container Terminal offers strategic link between the Indian Subcontinent and the lucrative Asia-Europe shipping route.

The new facilities at South Container Terminal make it the only port in the South Asia region with a deepwater terminal that can accommodate the newest breed of 18,000 20-foot (container) equivalent units (TEUs) container ships - which are currently the worlds largest container ship, and most cost effective to operate for mainline shippers.

Higher efficiency and faster delivery times will attract larger vessels and higher volume of trade. This enhances Sri Lankas competitiveness in international trade, and will draw potential investment in the country for setting up new manufacturing and distribution centres.

The project was launched in 2006 to cater to the increasing demands of services in the international shipping industry."

It goes on to further state:

"The East and West Container Terminals are currently in planning stages. When fully opened, the three terminals will add a combined container handling capacity of 7.2 million TEUs per annum to the existing port operations.

I think Sir, this is the moment we should feel proud. This is Mother Lanka. This is the country in which we are born; this is the country in which we will be buried. When one sees these marvels, these developments, these wonders, how can he stay without expressing his deepest gratitude and also feel happier and happier? We are on the right way, on the right track and on the right direction. That is the path that we are treading upon.

Sir, I must quote what his Excellency the President said in his Message with regard to the Sri Lanka Colombo Port Expansion Project. I quote:

I am determined to make our country the centre of the Asian silk route once again taking advantage of its unique geographical location. I intend to develop it into a navigation, aviation, trading and commercial centre linking the East and the West.

Sir, in the days of yore, we had the Seda Mawatha,

- the Silk Route and this is the modern Silk Route President Mahinda Rajapaksa is opening up. Great

261 262

men from Greece, the Roman Empire, from China, from Mongolia did all this wonderful work. But, today from this small country, a jewel of a man; , has achieved this. He has once again opened up the Silk Route in the modern world map. Is this not an achievement?

I am asking the Opposition? Where is the Opposition? All the blind people have left the Chambers, and I have to speak to you, Hon. Rohitha Abeygunawardana, our gold, our piece of gold. .

"The project is a leap forward in achieving the national goal of being the "Miracle of Asia." Who says? My good Friend who is in front of me, the Hon. Rohitha Abeygunawardana, Project Minister, Ministry of Ports and Highways. I think, Sir, he must be a proud citizen of this country. He must today feel that he was so lucky enough to be born in this country. , . Then, Sir, Dr. Priyath B.Wickrama, Chairman, Sri Lanka Ports Authority says, "This project converts Colombo into the biggest transshipment hub in the region". That is what he says, and our thanks go to the Hon. Rohitha Abeygunawardana and also to the able, young, dynamic Dr. Priyath B. Wickrama, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and all the dedicated officers who put in a hundred per cent effort to make this mega project a reality.

We have heard about the Seven Wonders of the world those days; about the pyramids, about the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy, about the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and other landmarks. Today, if the world is going to speak about the wonders of the modern world, the first thing they would write down is the mega project, "Colombo South Harbour". That is the way that we have developed this country, and we are still progressing towards it. There is no stoppage; development cannot be stopped.

I quote an article which appeared on page 27 of "Daily News" dated 5th August, 2013 under the caption, "Sri Lanka Ports Authority launches Vision 2020". It states:

"Aligning to the vision of the 'Mahinda Chintana Idiri Dekma' to transform Sri Lanka into strategically important economic center of the world, the Government of Sri Lanka has laid out a development policy framework for short, medium and long term macroeconomic policies to address challenges and to make structural transformation of the economy for sustainable development. The new policy framework is a turning point in Sri Lankas economic development which is aimed at high growth rate, along with quantitative and qualitative output."

It further states, I quote:

"The growth model fostered by the Government policies will result and economy with accelerated development along with environment sustainability. The objective is to create a stable society with a high quality of life by doubling the per capita income to above US $ 4000 through an annual economic growth of over 7-8 percent and to move into an upper middle income nation in the short term."

Mind you, Sir, we must not forget the fact that for 30 years we suffered from a ravaging war that completely destroyed the life and the country. But, we have risen up like a phoenix from the ashes to be a country where mega projects are coming up so rapidly.

Then, Sir, it further goes on to state, I quote:

"Moreover, the policy emphasizes on investments to be increased to 33-35 percent GDP and exports to be grown at twice the rate or more of real GDP. Further it is expected to promote tourism, to decrease the share of rural poverty and unemployment and to increase the share of urban population of the country."

In all spheres of life, everything is embraced in this massive project that has come up; economy, lifestyle of the people, agricultural growth, transporting goods to foreign countries, earning our foreign exchange and rest of the advantages.

It further states, I quote:

"The Government is taking pragmatic policy decision to create the necessary economic conditions to strategically position Sri Lanka as a Maritime, Aviation, Commercial, Energy and a Knowledge Hub."

Sir, this newspaper article that was published in the "Daily News" of 5th August, 2013, is worth being tabled. So, I table* that article captioned, "Logistic Excellence in the Silk Route - Sri Lanka Ports Authority launches Vision 2020". It gives a bird's-eye view of the entire project.

Also, Sir, I would like to table* a beautiful handout that has been issued by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority captioned, "Sri Lanka Colombo Port Expansion Project - Large-scale, public-private partnership transport sector investment in Sri Lanka.

Therefore, Sir, I should say that we have all around. We say that we have .

The largest Mosque in that area was opened by His Excellency the President and we have to tell that to the world, the diaspora and to the international Muslim community. The Hon. Rohitha Abeygunawardena is accepted not only by the large majority of the Muslims and the Tamils but also by the large majority of the Sinhalese.
