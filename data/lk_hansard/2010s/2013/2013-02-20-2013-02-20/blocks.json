Do not worry about that. . . . , , . [ ] [2.12 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for giving me this opportunity. The Hon. Minister has moved a revision in the charges prescribed under the Public Contracts Act. When this is being done, the biggest question that arises in everyones mind is, what relevance this has in todays context. It seems like a redundant thing. He brought to the notice of this House that for 25 years, there has not been any revision to the charges and it is high time that the charges be revised. That is reasonable. But, while we discuss these charges and the revision, it is also important to have a look at the provisions of the Public Contracts Act, for what reason that enactment was made initially and what is sought to be achieved by the provisions for transparency that are contained in that Act. There are guidelines to tender procedures that were issued sometime ago by the Treasury and initially when there were some issues with regard to wrong application of those procedures. those were subject to challenges in court. One of the things that were laid down in the SmithKline Beecham case of tender procedure for certain drugs is that those who take the sword will perish by the sword and so those who lay down the procedure must adhere to those procedures, otherwise they themselves will perish by the application of those procedures.",

    "text": "Tender procedures are very important in a country where there is expectancy of economic growth because all what investors and others look for is a level playing field. So, creating that level playing field is the objective of transparent tender procedures. Through that, nobody is put at a disadvantage. The procedure itself is fairly clearly laid down even before the tender is called for and whatever that is offered or tendered is kept secret until the envelopes are opened and the tender board evaluates the offers that are made. Today we are in a situation where, as I said earlier, all this has become redundant. If we look at all the mega projects that are going on, no tenders have been called for or no transparent tender procedures have been applied, with the result that it has become quite plain for everyone in the country and outside that there is no level playing field even in the economic arena. That is why this Government has to face the accusation of being one of the most corrupt governments this country has ever seen. Tender procedures that are in the books are totally ignored. The Public Contracts Act has no application whatsoever. There is a \"free for all\". Each ministry, the persons responsible for different spheres of economic activity have all been given the freedom to earn as they please. So, this is the reason why even supervisory committees like the COPE has so much of responsibility. - [Interruption.] - Yes, the Chairman is here; that is why I am referring to it. I am glad that the Hon. Minister who heads the COPE is here and he knows the level of corruption in this country with regard to public enterprises. This is not a good thing. The COPE need not have to cope with all this burden. It is a supervisory Committee and, on and off, if there are some deviations, some irregularities, it will come up in that Committee, it will be highlighted, it will be reported to this House and will be put right. But, here is a situation where this Committee cannot handle this because the magnitude of the corruption that the country is facing today is such that when there is a change in regime, there will have to be tremendous work done, enormous work done to unravel all of the corruption that this Government has been engaged in. Each time there is a change in Government, there is a commission appointed; there are reports that come out and many findings have been revealed to this country with regard to corruption. When that happens with regard to the present dispensation, the country will see something that this country has never seen before and to cover up this corruption, constantly peoples emotions are being whipped up. Maharagama is the economic centre, the nerve centre, of a certain kind of people and that has now been encouraged. Bodu Bala Sena is an instrument by which - I am sure the Hon. Minister will take note of that and will agree with me - this wholesale corruption is sought to be swept under the carpet; peoples attention is being diverted to other fronts unnecessarily and the Government continues in this way.",

    "text": "He advocated strong fundamental Christian values to counter increase secularization of many western countries. Pope Benedict became the Head of the Catholic Church at a most challenging time, both external and internal. The biggest challenge was to compromise two different values in the background of fast spreading globalization; the challenge of bringing together, without conflict, the values of the liberal society of the Western World and the traditional values of the developing world. He tried to heal the internal wounds of the Church with the divine spirit of forgiveness. Although he was a conservative hardliner in preserving the Catholic Doctrine, he was flexible being receptive to acceptable interpretations to the literal meaning of the scriptures. He called scriptures a spiritual experience that cannot be debated upon. He never gave in to morally unacceptable modern pressures such as gay marriages, abortions and so on. He held that Doctrine should not bend to the blowing winds of sinful change.",

And, that he was happier otherwise devoting his full time to prayer which he hopes to do after retirement. He was a great example of humility, courage and inner honesty.

Your Holiness, I was greatly surprised and saddened to learn of your decision to leave the Papacy during which you gave inspiring spiritual leadership to the Catholic Church and to the upholding of high moral values in the world. Although your leadership of the Catholic Church will come to a close in such a short period of service in defending the traditional Catholic doctrine, the impact of your efforts to preserve traditional Christian values in a world moving towards increased secularization with little heed to religion and the importance of moral truths, will remain for long as a beacon of understanding the importance of religion, tolerance and morality among peoples and societies. The Sri Lankan people will recall with immense gratitude your strong opposition to terrorism that threatened our State, as it continues to endanger other societies and nations too. The Catholic Community in Sri Lanka, both the clergy and laity, were strengthened and inspired by your words to support the cause of peace in our land and the unity of our people. I will always remember with great respect the encouraging words of guidance and counsel given to me at the audiences with Your Holiness that helped me in my tasks of governance, during the most trying times in my country. As Your Holiness gives up the duties of the Papacy for greater spirituality in daily life for the better cause of the Catholic Church, I join the prayers of the Catholics of Sri Lanka, and the good wishes of all other people of our country, for your good health and many more years of blessings; to give to you the tranquility of prayer, and to the world the opportunity to share your deep knowledge of theology and Christianity. Please accept, Holiness, the assurance of my highest consideration. (Sgd.) Mahinda Rajapaksa President of Sri Lanka\"",

Pope John Paul II was responsible for the final stage of the collapse of communism, which united the European Continent. With the fall of communism, he brought about a new political order. Once the ideological issues which threatened the Universal Catholic Church were no longer there, the other issues in the background came up. This has affected not only the Universal Catholic Church, but all religions because ideology has been replaced with arguments and divisions within the religious orders. You find that is in Islam among the militants and the more conservatives. You find this in Buddhism, among ourselves in our country as well as outside, among Hindus, among the Protestants and the Jews, as to what exactly religion is. As the Hon.

Gautama Buddha in his teachings of Dhamma laid equal emphasis on the mind and the body. You have to preserve your health; you keep your mind clear. When you have a situation like this, you take a decision. Then, the Holy Father, after prayer and reflection, which was expected of him took a decision, which he said was for the good of the Church.

Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Mr. Speaker, I consider it a very pleasing opportunity for me to speak a few words on His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI, who would be retiring at the end of this month after shepherding the Catholic Church with great acceptance and aplomb during a stormy and a very controversial phase of the Catholic Church. The Holy Father while holding the most august ecclesiastical position in the world during the last eight years displayed sublime qualities of head and heart and provided profound leadership to the flock, that is, the Catholic World. During his tenure as the Holy Father, he left no stone unturned and no avenue unexplored to ensure world peace and to help maintain sanity and spiritual values prevailing upon the powers-that-be in the world. It is appropriate to state here that he was very progressive in his outlook but when the occasion demanded, he was very steadfast in his adherence to principles enunciated by the Catholic Church. He never hesitated to engage in humanitarian endeavours in any part of the world.",

It further states, I quote: In the economic sector, states in particular need to articulate policies of industrial and agricultural development concerned with social progress and the growth everywhere of constitutional and democratic states. The creation of ethical structures for currency, financial and commercial markets is also fundamental and indispensable; these must be stabilized and better coordinated and controlled so as not to prove harmful to the very poor. With greater resolve than has hitherto been the case, the concern of peacemakers must also focus upon the food crisis, which is graver than the financial crisis. The issue of food security is once more central to the international political agenda, as a result of interrelated crises, including sudden shifts in the price of basic foodstuffs, irresponsible behaviour by some economic actors and insufficient control on the part of governments and the international community. To face this crisis, peacemakers are called to work together in a spirit of solidarity, from the local to the international level, with the aim of enabling farmers, especially in small rural holdings, to carry out their activity in a dignified and sustainable way from the social, environmental and economic points of view. , . , \" , .\" . , , , . , . , - , . , , . .

On 11th February, when the Cardinals in the Vatican City assembled in the Hall of Consistory, they were stunned by the announcement made by His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI of his impending resignation. It was not surprising that shock waves rippled across the world at this unexpected and unprecedented announcement. His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI will enter the history of the Catholic Church as the one who opted to retire on his own volition, being the first to do so in 600 years, that is, since 1415 when Pope Gregory XII stepped down. In making the announcement, His Holiness Pope Benedict is reported to have said that he would resign in full freedom. He further explained that he no longer has the strength of body or mind to fully serve the Petrine Ministry. Before he assumed duties on 19th April, 2005, he was known as Cardinal Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger. Mr. Speaker, there are some striking features in his decision to resign, which I greatly admire. Firstly, since 1415, all Popes in the last 600 years passed away in office. Perhaps, he did not want to pass away in office. Secondly, he decided not to participate in the Conclave of Cardinals that will name his successor. This is unprecedented and exceptional. Thirdly, he resigned on his own volition, in \"full freedom\", to put it in his own words,. Fourthly, he admitted self-critically that the strength of his body and mind did not permit him to stay in ministerial office. Mr. Speaker, in the estimate of many, His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI has been a figure of controversy for his extremely orthodox views. He was the first German to be elected Pope since the 11th Century, that is, after 10 centuries. Perhaps his initial grounding, the environment and historical conditions under which he grew up may have made him so. Born in a Bavarian Catholic family, in a predominately Catholic area, less is known in this part of the world about his joining Hitlers Youth Movement in 1939, in his youthful days. Mr. Speaker, though he was identified as a Conservative within the realm of the Roman Catholic Church, to the outside world he appeared to be, judging from his statements my own assessment is that he was comparatively more liberal, more humane and more objective on some of the global issues. At the height of the global economic recession, referring to the global financial crisis, Pope Benedict openly called upon the economists to revisit Karl Marx in order to gain an insight from Das Kapital as to what caused the financial crisis. It is my contention that it was",

We are awaiting the white smoke to take a glimpse of the new Pope who, we hope, will be capable of responding to the moral and ecumenical challenges posed by globalization and I shall be the most happiest if Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith would emerge as our next Pope. Sir, it is our wish that His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI will have a peaceful retirement with happiness, good health and longer life. Thank you. [.. 4.23] () ( ( ) ) (The Hon.

(Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Mr. Speaker, I consider this a rare privilege to speak a few words on the services rendered by Pope Benedict XVI, who will be resigning at the end of this month. As a Buddhist, it is unusual for me to speak on matters pertaining to other religions, particularly because of my relative ignorance of those faiths. However, I said \"relative\" instead of \"absolute\", because as a Royalist we were exposed to and grew up together with boys of many faiths; be it Catholicism, Hinduism, Islam or Buddhism. I also say \"relative\" because as a Member of the United National Party, we value and respect the need to integrate our society and respect the religious beliefs of a multiracial society. Today, not only in Sri Lanka but globally, the society is moving away from that integration towards extremism. Therefore, what we need to strive is to create a tolerant society that provides freedom for every global citizen to practise his or her religion without restriction however, while being conscious of the faiths of others. As the Leader of the Opposition stated in this House a little while ago, the Holy Father was a man of great knowledge and wisdom, and was working towards such integration globally and also world peace. He was revered by more than a billion Catholics around the world and immensely respected by billions of others for his contribution in this regard.

This land is amongst the most fertile lands in Jaffna and these people have been prevented from using their own lands for over 23 years. Despite the war having ended almost four years ago, and despite security considerations not being applicable any longer and despite undertakings given by the Sri Lankan Government to the Supreme Court that these people will be resettled on these lands, this has not happened and the Sri Lankan Armed Forces are strengthening their possession on a part of the said land. The Tamil National Alliance and many other political parties and civil society organizations were invited to join the fast in solidarity with them. TNA Members of Parliament, the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah, the Hon. Suresh Premachandran, the Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy, the Hon. S. Adaikkalanathan, the Hon. Sivasakthi Anandan, the Hon. E. Saravanapavan, the Hon. S. Shritharan and the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran participated in this hunger strike. Other political party leaders, Dr. Wickramabahu Karunaratne, Mr. Mano Ganeshan, Mr. Azath Salley and others joined the fast. The Leader of the Opposition, Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe too joined the hunger strike at about 10.30 a.m.",

The people repulsed this and pushed them away from those performing Satyagraha, and they tried to run. One of these persons was caught by the people and handed over to the police. Another ran to an army camp located close-by. The police took the arrested persons away, but when they went near that army camp, army personnel interfered and released him from the custody of the police and took him away. The faces of at least two of these attackers are now in the public domain.",

    "text": "[5.10 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I second the Motion that was just moved by the Hon. R. Sampanthan and I wish to state that this incident is not just one of the incidents; this is not an isolated one. This just demonstrates to this country and to the world what goes on in the Tamil areas day in and day out. This has come to the fore because several Members of Parliament were present there, several leaders of other political parties were present there, the Leader of the Opposition was present and therefore it was well covered by the media. But, on other occasions, this kind of oppression and worse goes on in the Tamil areas without the rest of the country coming to know about it or the world being able to see it. In one sense, we would like to thank the Jaffna Security Forces Commander, Major General Hathurusinghe for performing this demonstration for the world to see of what he conducts everyday in Jaffna. As has been pointed out in the Motion itself, on 16th of June, 2011, again on another occasion when five Parliamentarians were present, the army actually came in full uniform, armed to the teeth and with batons beat up and disrupted the meeting. Subsequently, when we had a discussion with the Jaffna Security Forces Commander, he told us that if it was the army that did that, he will ensure that everyone of those who were involved in that assault was court-martialled. We told him that for his sake, we wished that it was actually the army that did it and no one else because if it was someone else, imagine the situation of about 30 to 50 people who are not the army wearing army uniforms and being able to walk around in Jaffna with poles and worse, with automatic weapons.",

Even on this occasion, the day after this incident, in Kilinochchi, when the Hon. Leader of the Opposition was there, hundreds of mothers came and fell at his feet. They told their stories where they were witnesses when their husbands, their sons and their brothers were handed over to the army. It was done in their presence. But, they cannot be found today. Your own Commission, the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, records that 1,018 persons have gone missing. Those who gave evidence before the LLRC have shown that after having been surrendered to the security forces, people have gone missing. That number is only from those who gave evidence. There are thousands more like that. So, will this promote accountability? Will this promote reconciliation? There is impunity and it will certainly not promote any kind of reconciliation when a mother who is looking for her son whom she handed over to the security forces is being told by the Government, No, he did not disappear; there is no such thing that happened. Very soon, this Government will deny that there was ever a war in this country. Such is the brass with which this Government is getting about. This is not good for the country.
