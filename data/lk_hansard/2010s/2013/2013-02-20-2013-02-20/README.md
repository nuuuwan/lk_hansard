. . Question proposed.

[1.44 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I think it is timely that we take cognizance of the fact that the Minister of Industry and Commerce mentioned. I would say that he is trying to increase the prices without a reciprocal increase in activities or without tremendous value for money to services that are being rendered. He, in his speech, did mention that the reason for increase is due to certain activities that are there. But, Hon.

601 602

2013 20

Minister, these are activities that have been going on from day dot. There are no reciprocal benefits coming on to the people concerned due to your increase. Let me take it from a different angle. You are starting from the very small corner going up to the very end of the spectrum but the benefit that is being accrued is not there.

Now, you mentioned about the tenders. Let me take the Gazette Notification itself. It states, Application for Registration as Agent, Sub-agent, Representative or Nominee for or on behalf of a Tenderer. Are you telling me that your Government is adhering to present tender conditions? Are you trying to impose the conditions to cover the loopholes that are there? There is nothing. You are increasing the price from Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,500 without any apparent justification. Then, it states, Application to register a Public Contract. The public contracts are the very activities that have been going on from day dot. But, today we are telling you that you have not been able to give a rebuttal to this that in every particular activity, starting from a clerk to the highest of this country, there is the "grease the palm" going on. As a result, you are having a corruptive element that is coming in. How are you going to stop that? How are you going to eradicate that? How are you going to ameliorate this situation? No such thing is there.

The next matter is, Application for renewal of a Registration. This is just another case of increasing price from an X figure to a Y figure. It further states, Application for re-registration of a Public Contract. So, everything is from the perspective of increasing revenue. That is the most important aspect of your activity. In a budget today where you are unable to meet your debt amortization, what more are we talking? So, Hon. Minister, because you have got to do what has got to be done owing to the vulnerability or the occupational hazards of your Ministry, you have got to bring in this and get it approved in Parliament.

Let me now go into the actual inner workings of your Government.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, please give me one more minute. It will be taken from our time. Do not worry about that. . . . , , . [ ] [2.12 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for giving me this opportunity. The Hon. Minister has moved a revision in the charges prescribed under the Public Contracts Act. When this is being done, the biggest question that arises in everyones mind is, what relevance this has in todays context. It seems like a redundant thing. He brought to the notice of this House that for 25 years, there has not been any revision to the charges and it is high time that the charges be revised. That is reasonable. But, while we discuss these charges and the revision, it is also important to have a look at the provisions of the Public Contracts Act, for what reason that enactment was made initially and what is sought to be achieved by the provisions for transparency that are contained in that Act. There are guidelines to tender procedures that were issued sometime ago by the Treasury and initially when there were some issues with regard to wrong application of those procedures. those were subject to challenges in court. One of the things that were laid down in the SmithKline Beecham case of tender procedure for certain drugs is that those who take the sword will perish by the sword and so those who lay down the procedure must adhere to those procedures, otherwise they themselves will perish by the application of those procedures.

Tender procedures are very important in a country where there is expectancy of economic growth because all what investors and others look for is a level playing field. So, creating that level playing field is the objective of transparent tender procedures. Through that, nobody is put at a disadvantage. The procedure itself is fairly clearly laid down even before the tender is called for and whatever that is offered or tendered is kept secret until the envelopes are opened and the tender board evaluates the offers that are made. Today we are in a situation where, as I said earlier, all this has become redundant. If we look at all the mega projects that are going on, no tenders have been called for or no transparent tender procedures have been applied, with the result that it has become quite plain for everyone in the country and outside that there is no level playing field even in the economic arena. That is why this Government has to face the accusation of being one of the most corrupt governments this country has ever seen. Tender procedures that are in the books are totally ignored. The Public Contracts Act has no application whatsoever. There is a "free for all". Each ministry, the persons responsible for different spheres of economic activity have all been given the freedom to earn as they please. So, this is the reason why even supervisory committees like the COPE has so much of responsibility. - [Interruption.] - Yes, the Chairman is here; that is why I am referring to it. I am glad that the Hon. Minister who heads the COPE is here and he knows the level of corruption in this country with regard to public enterprises. This is not a good thing. The COPE need not have to cope with all this burden. It is a supervisory Committee and, on and off, if there are some deviations, some irregularities, it will come up in that Committee, it will be highlighted, it will be reported to this House and will be put right. But, here is a situation where this Committee cannot handle this because the magnitude of the corruption that the country is facing today is such that when there is a change in regime, there will have to be tremendous work done, enormous work done to unravel all of the corruption that this Government has been engaged in. Each time there is a change in Government, there is a commission appointed; there are reports that come out and many findings have been revealed to this country with regard to corruption. When that happens with regard to the present dispensation, the country will see something that this country has never seen before and to cover up this corruption, constantly peoples emotions are being whipped up. Maharagama is the economic centre, the nerve centre, of a certain kind of people and that has now been encouraged. Bodu Bala Sena is an instrument by which - I am sure the Hon. Minister will take note of that and will agree with me - this wholesale corruption is sought to be swept under the carpet; peoples attention is being diverted to other fronts unnecessarily and the Government continues in this way.

Thank you.

XVI XVI VOTE OF APPRECIATION FOR THE SERVICES OF HIS HOLINESS THE POPE BENEDICT XVI

[2.57 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I move,

That this Parliament resolves to express its appreciation to His Holiness the Pope Benedict XVI for His services rendered to the Universal Catholic Church. That is the Motion that I am moving and I will now speak more on His Holiness the Pope Benedict XVI.

His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI took the world by surprise by announcing his retirement from his Ministry of the Catholic Church. He was the Head of the Vatican City State, the smallest State in the world, but the spiritual leader of a massive 1.2 billion followers around the world. Holy Fathers announcement came as a bolt from the blue with even heavens above reacting with a bolt of lightning above the Vatican Dome strangely in a clear blue sky.

Papacy is the worlds oldest dynasty, and Holy Father the Pope speaks out not only for Catholics but for all humanity in this world; for the word "Catholic" means universal. He was the 265th Pope of the Catholic Church and the first in 600 years to step down. The last Pope to do so was in the year 1415.

Pope Benedict XVI was born on 16th April, 1927 as Joseph Aloysius Ratzinger to a highly religious family in Germany. He had a brother and a sister and his father was a policeman. His brother is also a priest and still living. His childhood ambition was to become a priest but never dreamt that he would end up as the Pope.

As a youth he was conscripted to join Hitlers Youth Movement in the face of severe financial and other penalties that was enforced on dodgers from service. He ran into trouble on numerous occasions as he and his

family were convinced that Nazism was in conflict with the Catholic faith they professed; religion being subordinated to political ideology.

He was subsequently drafted as an Air Force Child Soldier towards the end of the World War, while still in the Seminary but managed to escape returning back to the Seminary. He firmly believed that he and the family were saved from Nazi punishment by a special Angel guarding them. He became a priest in 1951 and blessed to be elevated as Cardinal in 1977. He was the Archbishop of Munich for five years before being summoned to the Vatican for more important duties.

Prior to becoming the Pope, he was an academic par excellence and a highly-regarded University Theologian having served in many universities. He was fondly called the "Piano Playing Professor", and it is said that if he chose to be a layman, he would have been a very sought-after university professor.

He was known as a gentle, intellectually-gifted man who loved music and nature. He was called a green man for his environment-friendly attitudes. He was highly respected even prior to becoming the Pope as the driving force as the Prefect Of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith and as the Dean of the College of Cardinals.

Cardinal Joseph Aloysius Ratzinger, was elevated Pope on the 19th April, 2005 choosing the regnal name of Benedict XVI. As Pope Benedict XVI, he followed the saintly footsteps of Pope John Paul II, who was the most popular Pope in living memory. He gave continuation and stability to the Church, staunchly defending fundamental Christian values. He committed himself to the service of reconciliation and harmony between all people.

He advocated strong fundamental Christian values to counter increase secularization of many western countries. Pope Benedict became the Head of the Catholic Church at a most challenging time, both external and internal. The biggest challenge was to compromise two different values in the background of fast spreading globalization; the challenge of bringing together, without conflict, the values of the liberal society of the Western World and the traditional values of the developing world. He tried to heal the internal wounds of the Church with the divine spirit of forgiveness. Although he was a conservative hardliner in preserving the Catholic Doctrine, he was flexible being receptive to acceptable interpretations to the literal meaning of the scriptures. He called scriptures a spiritual experience that cannot be debated upon. He never gave in to morally unacceptable modern pressures such as gay marriages, abortions and so on. He held that Doctrine should not bend to the blowing winds of sinful change.

Pope Benedict worked hard for Christian Unity of the Eastern and the Western Churches. He reached his hand

627 628

across to the other religions for unity and world peace. He was vehemently against war which he believed has no justification. He openly criticized the Western Powers for war against Iraq. For he said no bad means justify a good end.

Pope Benedict spent his entire life teaching and preaching as a Priest, Bishop, Cardinal and finally Pope. He was a wonderful theologian and a Pastor to his flock. He was courageously honest to admit that he was too frail in mind and body to fulfil his Ministry of the Church. He has taught the world and the Church that Papacy is not about Power but True Service. The Pope perhaps saw his happiest moments and had little to do with his Power. And, that he was happier otherwise devoting his full time to prayer which he hopes to do after retirement. He was a great example of humility, courage and inner honesty. The Church under him did have problems and challenges, but, all in all, in spiritual leadership Pope Benedict gave his flock eight wonderful years of faith. As a Catholic I say, Thank you, Your Holiness.

A new leader of the Catholic Church for a flock of 1.2 billion Catholics will be chosen before the Easter celebration and it is my prayer and wish, as that of the children of Mother Lanka that, God willing, a front-runner for the position, son of the soil, our Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, be blessed to be chosen, Sri Lankan born first Asian Pope which we hopefully await, perhaps as a happy surprise and Gods gift to the people of Asia.

Hon. Speaker, finally I wish to thank the Hon. Leader of the Opposition who guided us and initiated this Vote of Appreciation for the services of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI and you, Hon. Speaker, for accepting same and the Hon. Leader of the House who agreed to second this Vote of Appreciation.

Thank you very much.

It states, I quote: "February 18, 2013 His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI Saint Peters Basilica The Vatican City. Your Holiness, I was greatly surprised and saddened to learn of your decision to leave the Papacy during which you gave inspiring spiritual leadership to the Catholic Church and to the upholding of high moral values in the world. Although your leadership of the Catholic Church will come to a close in such a short period of service in defending the traditional Catholic doctrine, the impact of your efforts to preserve traditional Christian values in a world moving towards increased secularization with little heed to religion and the importance of moral truths, will remain for long as a beacon of understanding the importance of religion, tolerance and morality among peoples and societies. The Sri Lankan people will recall with immense gratitude your strong opposition to terrorism that threatened our State, as it continues to endanger other societies and nations too. The Catholic Community in Sri Lanka, both the clergy and laity, were strengthened and inspired by your words to support the cause of peace in our land and the unity of our people. I will always remember with great respect the encouraging words of guidance and counsel given to me at the audiences with Your Holiness that helped me in my tasks of governance, during the most trying times in my country. As Your Holiness gives up the duties of the Papacy for greater spirituality in daily life for the better cause of the Catholic Church, I join the prayers of the Catholics of Sri Lanka, and the good wishes of all other people of our country, for your good health and many more years of blessings; to give to you the tranquility of prayer, and to the world the opportunity to share your deep knowledge of theology and Christianity. Please accept, Holiness, the assurance of my highest consideration. (Sgd.) Mahinda Rajapaksa President of Sri Lanka"

, , , , . . . . Question proposed.

[3.16 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, during my audience with the Holy Father on 2nd January, he looked very frail. I thought that he would have to shed a part of his workload. I never expected to hear an announcement that the Holy Father, Pope Benedict XVI was retiring from the Papacy.

As the Hon. Leader of the House said, the last occasion when a Pope retired was 600 years ago. In the modern world, it is unprecedented. The Holy Father created a precedent. We also have to realize that the Pope, after Pope John Paul II is not only the Head of the Universal Catholic Church, but also a spiritual and moral leader of the world, as well as, of course, the Head of the Vatican State. So, just let the Pope create a precedent. Our Parliament has also created a precedent, where we have assembled to express our appreciation of the services that the Pope, the Holy Father, has rendered during his tenure of office.

Pope Benedict XVI is the successor to Pope John Paul II. That is a difficult act to follow. Pope John Paul II and Pope Leo III were the Popes who were responsible for fashioning the Catholic faith that we know of today. It was Pope Leo III who crowned Charlemagne as the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, laying the foundation for the western Christendom. Pope John Paul II was responsible for the final stage of the collapse of communism, which united the European Continent. With the fall of communism, he brought about a new political order. Once the ideological issues which threatened the Universal Catholic Church were no longer there, the other issues in the background came up. This has affected not only the Universal Catholic Church, but all religions because ideology has been replaced with arguments and divisions within the religious orders. You find that is in Islam among the militants and the more conservatives. You find this in Buddhism, among ourselves in our country as well as outside, among Hindus, among the Protestants and the Jews, as to what exactly religion is. As the Hon. Leader of the House said, the orthodox beliefs are being challenged by new beliefs.

Pope John Paul II resolved the pro-justice issue: the Church would not defend totalitarianism and would stand for human rights. So, the other major issue, that of pro-life has come up now together with other moral and theological issues, such as abortion, same sex marriages, child abuse and celibacy, which the Universal Catholic Church has to face. The successor to Pope John Paul II had to handle this transition. His task was not to take definite decisions, but to handle the transition, and the Holy Father did so successfully. Those who find fault

631 632

with the Holy Father for failure to take a stand on these issues forget that politics, whether it is church politics or anything else, is basically the art of the possible. When different views surfaced after the fall of communism, issues which had secondary place in the Church, you cannot rush to take a position or support one group as against the other.

The other dilemma of this Church, like many of us, is that they have to live with the media which will take up the high profile issues to increase their market share. It is something that issues, the earlier Popes did not have to contend with. At the end of the day, when we assess the Papacy of Benedict XVI, much has gone right in the Holy See which has not been highlighted. He has also paved the way for more contentious issues to be resolved. I would like to just mention two of the issues. One is, the Holy Father is known as the "Green Pontiff", not that he supports the UNP, but he has brought the environmental issues straight into the teachings of the Church and there are his articles on the environment, which should be read by everyone.

Also, what his detractors forget is that he has emphasized, again and again, hope, faith and love and that has got precedence in the last few years of Papacy. With the transition coming to an end, the Holy Father had done his job well. But, he finds now that he does not have the strength of body and the mind necessary to carry out the work of the ministry in the next phase. This is not surprising. Gautama Buddha in his teachings of Dhamma laid equal emphasis on the mind and the body. You have to preserve your health; you keep your mind clear. When you have a situation like this, you take a decision. Then, the Holy Father, after prayer and reflection, which was expected of him took a decision, which he said was for the good of the Church. He announced his retirement. This is a case of humility in action. This is the shining and defining moment of Pope Benedict XVI Papacy.

Of the many comments I read, I was really struck by a blog by a young person who said, It is really not a big deal. The Pope made it easier for a younger person to get elected who then can go on to retire at a reasonable age. This is the modernity Strengthening the Church. Of all that was said about the Holy Father, this is the one that struck me most.

In the final act of retirement, the Holy Father was breaking with tradition himself and bringing the Church into the 21st Century. With his final act, Pope Benedict XVI became a revolutionary. The Holy Father said to everyone, Keep praying for me, the Church and the future Pope.

A vast majority in this House and outside are not followers of the Catholic faith, but we in our own ways, according to our own religions, should pray and seek the

blessings for the Holy Father, for the Catholic Church which is facing its own challenges and for the future Pope who will have to lead the Holy See.

Hon. Speaker, I join the Leader of the House and our Chief Opposition Whip in expressing our appreciation of the Holy Father and let us, of all religions, again express satisfaction with the lead he gave to this world morally and spiritually.

Thank you.

[3.25 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Hon. Speaker, the Roman Catholic Church, the single largest denomination of Christians, numbering over one billion in the whole world has a rich and long history with the Disciple Saint Peter being the Bark to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus established in the State of Vatican as the Headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church.

The Head of the State of Vatican and the Catholic Church, Pope Benedict XVI as the Leader, successor of Saint Peter, has after a brief period of eight years in office, renounced the Ministry of Bishop of Rome entrusted to His Holiness by the Cardinals on 19th April, 2005, in such a way that as from 28th February, 2013, at 2000 hours, the See of Rome, the See of Saint Peter, will be vacant and a conclave to elect the new Supreme Pontiff will have to be convoked by those Cardinals, whose competence it is.

His Holiness Pope Benedict, the German born Pontiff, who is also recognized politically as the Head of the State of Vatican, after eight years in office, at the age of 85, has made a decision to step down prior to his term of office being over, recognizing the fact that his health is deteriorating and says that he does not have the physical strength to fulfil the ministry entrusted to him. His Holiness states that the strength of mind and body are both necessary to adequately discharge his duty to proclaim the Gospel as the Head of the Catholic Church.

It is a significant moment in the time and space of world history and the renouncing of the Ministry of Bishop of Rome is a rare occurrence and a conclave to elect the new Supreme Head of the Catholic Church, will have to be convoked in the faith and process of selection from the Cardinals worldwide.

I wish to recall the address made by His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI to the delegations taking part in the meeting for peace in Assisi at the Clementine Hall in

633 634

[ ]

2013 20

October 2011. He said, I welcome you this morning to the Apostolic Palace and I thank you once more for your willingness to take part in the day of reflection, dialogue and prayer for justice and peace in the world held yesterday in Assisi, 25 years after that historic first meeting. In a certain sense, this gathering is representative of billions of men and women throughout our world who are actively engaged in promoting justice and peace. It is also a sign of the friendship and fraternity which has flourished as the fruit of the efforts of so many pioneers in this kind of dialogue. May this friendship continue to grow among all the followers of the world's religions and with men and women of goodwill everywhere

His Holiness was advocating unity, unity at an international level, unity at a global level, uniting the world at large. It is good for us to reflect on those words of wisdom, and practise that unity among us as Sri Lankans, as citizens of one nation and as citizens of one universe.

His Holiness Pope Benedict, a German national, was the oldest in almost 300 years, was 78 years old at the time of his election to the Supreme Office of the Head of the Catholic Church and was the 265th Pope who played the dual role as the Sovereign of the Vatican City State and the Leader of the Catholic Church. His Holiness is also the first German national in almost 500 years to be elected the Pope. The previous German national was Pope Adrian VI.

Our President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa met His Holiness the Pope on 8th June last year and they exchanged many thoughts and after a fruitful discussion it was reported that the spiritual sanctity and the simplicity of His Holiness and his easy approach even as the Leader of the large Catholic following was symbolic of the gentleness of his belief.

Sri Lanka had a significant place during the Pontiffs tenure, with His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith who served as the de facto primate of Sri Lanka. The Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith has been named in the "Forbes" Magazine as the only person from Asia in the list of possible candidates for the Papacy to succeed the 265th Pope.

The renouncing of the supreme leader post before the end of the term is a moment in history for much speculation, gossip and rumour. But, it is also a time of meditation, reconciliation and repair. It is also a time for a new era, a new beginning, for a new Pope to guide and fulfil the spiritual purposes of the Roman Catholic Church. The new Pope may come from Sri Lanka; it is in the hands of the divinely-guided process of conclave to select the Supreme Head of the Sovereign City State of the Vatican and the Catholic following the world over.

As a Roman Catholic, I share the sentiments of His Holiness Pope Benedict when his thoughts and focus were always on the unity of the human race, irrespective of religious, cultural or political belief; a unity based on the elements of love, compassion and milk of human kindness.

Let us, today, record our gratitude to His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI for his contribution to the Catholic Church and to the society, especially becoming the first leader to open a Twitter page availing himself of the opportunity to meet and contact people all around the world. His effort was symbolic of his intention to unite society, to unite people and to unite the thoughts and aspirations of human emotions.

The great quality of relinquishing and renouncing, when His Holiness felt that he was physically not strong enough to fulfil the great obligation of duty, is also a significant lesson and sign of humility for a leader of such great power and authority.

May His Holiness find peace and solace in his retirement from office and may the conclave select Gods chosen successor to this most crucial and vital See of Rome and See of Peter to lead the City State of the Vatican and the Roman Catholic Church.

I am happy to see at this moment His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, all the Bishops and also the Archbishop Joseph Spiteri who is representing Vatican, listening to this Debate in the Speakers Gallery.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Mr. Speaker, I consider it a very pleasing opportunity for me to speak a few words on His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI, who would be retiring at the end of this month after shepherding the Catholic Church with great acceptance and aplomb during a stormy and a very controversial phase of the Catholic Church. The Holy Father while holding the most august ecclesiastical position in the world during the last eight years displayed sublime qualities of head and heart and provided profound leadership to the flock, that is, the Catholic World. During his tenure as the Holy Father, he left no stone unturned and no avenue unexplored to ensure world peace and to help maintain sanity and spiritual values prevailing upon the powers-that-be in the world. It is appropriate to state here that he was very progressive in his outlook but when the occasion demanded, he was very steadfast in his adherence to principles enunciated by the Catholic Church. He never hesitated to engage in humanitarian endeavours in any part of the world.

It must be admired that the Pope Benedict XVI, true to the spirit of catholicity, not only extended his blessings to the entire human kind, but also associated himself with enlightening activities transcending all barriers.

I was greatly impressed when His Holiness extended Christmas greetings to our country, lo and behold, in Sinhala on the last Christmas Day. It shows that no country was small for His Holiness and we really appreciate his kind gesture on that day. It is no exaggeration to say that His Holiness blazed a new trail across the firmament, luminous and enlightening at a time when wiser counsel is most needed in the world. We also must not forget that His Holiness held the Catholic Church tight and intact, when storms assailed it displaying tremendous wisdom and moral strength, presumably which, His Holiness has endowed from divine blessings.

The Bible says that the Holy Father guides his flock, with the staff of what Angel Gabriel said to the world. It states, I quote:

Peace on earth and goodwill to humanity.

I believe that His Holiness achieved that aspiration to a large extent during His Holy Stewardship. His Holiness strode in His vineyard like a true Apostle casting a

639 640

luminous spell upon his flock. It is a well-known saying that, Many are called, but few are chosen to Gods Vineyard and the one who ascend the pinnacle of Priesthood as the Pope is indeed the Gods choice.

On this occasion, we are reminded of the famous saying of His Holiness Pope Paul VI expressed when His Holiness visited our country on 8th December, 1970. His Holiness said that he came to this region as a pilgrim and not as the Head of the Catholic Church. That modesty and magnanimity exhibited by His Holiness then are also discernable in Pope Benedict XVI. I am certain that His Holiness would be recorded in the annals of the Church as one who bore the severe strains of office with equanimity and composure and dedicate it the opportune moment, hoping that his successor would, if I may use a common phrase, fulfil his mission impeccably.

It is well known that His Holiness endeavoured to bring about religious amity and harmony in a world torn in strife and turmoil. The best tribute that we can pay His Holiness is to ensure the upholding of his holy ideals and aspirations.

At an Ash Wednesday Mass in a moving sermon, the Holy Father said that he was retiring because he believed he was physically and mentally not strong enough to carry out the world mission of bringing about unity, peace and justice. It is also relevant to state here that His Holiness decided to abdicate his mitre considering the restraints descending upon him, which is a lesson to be emulated by all those who hold high office avariciously.

I wish His Holiness long life and good health!

Thank you very much. [.. 3.52] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Felix Perera - Minister of Social Services) , , - - .

, . [3.58 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Speaker, I am very happy to speak a few words today as a Hindu on His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI.

We have just completed the 150th anniversary of Swami Vivekananda who was a great Hindu sage who advocated the principles of universal religion in Chicago. One of the main issues of his speech was though different streams have their sources in different places, all the water ultimately goes into one sea. So, Swami Vivekananda made it very clear that it was the principle of all religions and ultimately it is the belief of God. In fact, Swami Vivekananda made it very clear in his speech that Hinduism is a universal religion.

In the same capacity, I wish to say that Benedict XVI was a great Pope who reigned for a period of about seven years. He was a German; he was born and bred in Germany and he had the influence of Nazi in World War I. Ultimately, he had to join the army for a few years due to compulsory regime. After that, he got out of the clutches of the army and subsequently learnt the theological religion, and was ordained in 1951. He was born on 16th April, 1927, and on the 28th of February at 1900 GMT he will be giving up his holy power as the Pope of the Vatican.

Pope Benedict XVI had to go through many turmoils during his term of office. There was a question of the statement he had made about Islam which ultimately went against him in the Middle-East, and in Somali even a nun was killed. In the same way, he had to tackle so many issues like gay marriages and there were so many evil acts that were brought forward to this world and he had to overcome all those issues in a very cordial manner.

It was due to his fragile and unhealthy body that he is hoping to give up this Papacy on the 28th of this month. But, there is also a statement to say that for the last one year, from March 2012, he was planning to give up the seat as a Papal King. Pope Celestine was the first person who gave up his regime in 1294 as the Pope after reigning for five months. Subsequent to that, Pope Gregory XII abdicated his Papal rights in the year 1415. The present Pope Benedict XVI is the first German for the last 1,000 years to be a Pope and the second non-Italian Pope to be the Pope of Rome. The Pope deals with 1.2 billion

Catholics all over the world under his empire. So, it is not very easy for a person to give up this powers as a Pope unless he has the real willpower to understand that he is unable to serve God accordingly. In fact, it was on that basis that the Pope had not issued his ecclesiastical, that is, a sermon or a note given to his Bishops which was supposed to be published many months ago, and delayed same.

The reason for his delay was really the fragile outlook of his health. So, we, as Sri Lankans, and I, as a Hindu, wish him all the very best. Even at the age of 85, although he is giving up his duties, he will continue to serve His Lord in the way that is provided in the history and the annals of the Roman Catholic Church.

Thank you, Sir. [.. 4.03]

The message of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI for the celebration of the World Day of Peace on 1st January, 2013 states, I quote: It is alarming to see hotbeds of tension and conflict caused by growing instances of inequality between rich and poor, by the prevalence of a selfish and individualistic mindset which also finds expression in an unregulated financial capitalism. . , , ,

. . It further states, I quote: In the economic sector, states in particular need to articulate policies of industrial and agricultural development concerned with social progress and the growth everywhere of constitutional and democratic states. The creation of ethical structures for currency, financial and commercial markets is also fundamental and indispensable; these must be stabilized and better coordinated and controlled so as not to prove harmful to the very poor. With greater resolve than has hitherto been the case, the concern of peacemakers must also focus upon the food crisis, which is graver than the financial crisis. The issue of food security is once more central to the international political agenda, as a result of interrelated crises, including sudden shifts in the price of basic foodstuffs, irresponsible behaviour by some economic actors and insufficient control on the part of governments and the international community. To face this crisis, peacemakers are called to work together in a spirit of solidarity, from the local to the international level, with the aim of enabling farmers, especially in small rural holdings, to carry out their activity in a dignified and sustainable way from the social, environmental and economic points of view. , . , " , ." . , , , . , . , - , . , , . . [4.17 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. DEW Gunasekara - Minister of Human Resources) Mr. Speaker, at the outset, on behalf of the Communist Party of Sri Lanka and on behalf of the

Leftist Movement in Sri Lanka, I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by the previous speakers in appreciation of the services rendered by His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI. On 11th February, when the Cardinals in the Vatican City assembled in the Hall of Consistory, they were stunned by the announcement made by His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI of his impending resignation. It was not surprising that shock waves rippled across the world at this unexpected and unprecedented announcement. His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI will enter the history of the Catholic Church as the one who opted to retire on his own volition, being the first to do so in 600 years, that is, since 1415 when Pope Gregory XII stepped down. In making the announcement, His Holiness Pope Benedict is reported to have said that he would resign in full freedom. He further explained that he no longer has the strength of body or mind to fully serve the Petrine Ministry. Before he assumed duties on 19th April, 2005, he was known as Cardinal Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger. Mr. Speaker, there are some striking features in his decision to resign, which I greatly admire. Firstly, since 1415, all Popes in the last 600 years passed away in office. Perhaps, he did not want to pass away in office. Secondly, he decided not to participate in the Conclave of Cardinals that will name his successor. This is unprecedented and exceptional. Thirdly, he resigned on his own volition, in "full freedom", to put it in his own words,. Fourthly, he admitted self-critically that the strength of his body and mind did not permit him to stay in ministerial office. Mr. Speaker, in the estimate of many, His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI has been a figure of controversy for his extremely orthodox views. He was the first German to be elected Pope since the 11th Century, that is, after 10 centuries. Perhaps his initial grounding, the environment and historical conditions under which he grew up may have made him so. Born in a Bavarian Catholic family, in a predominately Catholic area, less is known in this part of the world about his joining Hitlers Youth Movement in 1939, in his youthful days. Mr. Speaker, though he was identified as a Conservative within the realm of the Roman Catholic Church, to the outside world he appeared to be, judging from his statements my own assessment is that he was comparatively more liberal, more humane and more objective on some of the global issues. At the height of the global economic recession, referring to the global financial crisis, Pope Benedict openly called upon the economists to revisit Karl Marx in order to gain an insight from Das Kapital as to what caused the financial crisis. It is my contention that it was

647 648

not because he was a German - Karl Marx himself was a German - but because he was surely an enlightened intellectual who did not want to disguise the global issues with silly excuses or unacceptable reasoning. I am sure, he had in his thoughts Marxs "Theory of Crisis" and the "Theory of Surplus Value". In fact, during the last or previous Budget Debates, with great satisfaction I quoted His Holiness Pope Benedict on the Floor of this House in defence of my arguments in respect of the global financial crisis. Mr. Speaker, as the Head of the Roman Catholic Church, he led one billion Catholics the world over, the bulk of whom live in the developing world. We are awaiting the white smoke to take a glimpse of the new Pope who, we hope, will be capable of responding to the moral and ecumenical challenges posed by globalization and I shall be the most happiest if Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith would emerge as our next Pope. Sir, it is our wish that His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI will have a peaceful retirement with happiness, good health and longer life. Thank you. [.. 4.23] () ( ( ) ) (The Hon.

[4.35 p.m.] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Mr. Speaker, I consider this a rare privilege to speak a few words on the services rendered by Pope Benedict XVI, who will be resigning at the end of this month. As a Buddhist, it is unusual for me to speak on matters pertaining to other religions, particularly because of my relative ignorance of those faiths. However, I said "relative" instead of "absolute", because as a Royalist we were exposed to and grew up together with boys of many faiths; be it Catholicism, Hinduism, Islam or Buddhism. I also say "relative" because as a Member of the United National Party, we value and respect the need to integrate our society and respect the religious beliefs of a multiracial society. Today, not only in Sri Lanka but globally, the society is moving away from that integration towards extremism. Therefore, what we need to strive is to create a tolerant society that provides freedom for every global citizen to practise his or her religion without restriction however, while being conscious of the faiths of others. As the Leader of the Opposition stated in this House a little while ago, the Holy Father was a man of great knowledge and wisdom, and was working towards such integration globally and also world peace. He was revered by more than a billion Catholics around the world and immensely respected by billions of others for his contribution in this regard. But, he too, as a human being having faced the decline of health, and in the face of the

651 652

requirement that he had to commit this entire strength to lead the Catholics around the world to build a peaceful and a moderate global community, decided to hand over the reins to someone else, who could take his good work forward. That is the reason why we see a resignation of a Pope since the 15th Century.

All I wish to say is, immaterial of whether we are Catholics, Buddhists, Hindus or Muslims, we have to work together to create a society, - be it here or globally - a tolerant society where we could avoid wars that create destruction and mass loss of human life.

Therefore, I wish to see a world that is conditioned by the wisdom of all religious leaders. I wish good health for the resigning Pope Benedict XVI and also hope that Cardinal Archbishop Malcolm Ranjith would perhaps be elected as the next Pope. Thank you. [.. 4.40]

, BREAKDOWN OF RULE OF LAW IN NORTH AND EAST [4.59 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I move:

"On 15th February 2013 the Association for the Displaced People of Valikamam North staged a Satyagraha - a token hunger strike - at the Tellippallai Durgai Amman Temple premises in Jaffna from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. to demonstrate against their being prevented by the Sri Lankan Government and the Sri Lankan Armed Forces from resettling on lands owned and historically possessed by them from which they had been evicted on grounds of security during the war. This land is amongst the most fertile lands in Jaffna and these people have been prevented from using their own lands for over 23 years. Despite the war having ended almost four years ago, and despite security considerations not being applicable any longer and despite undertakings given by the Sri Lankan Government to the Supreme Court that these people will be resettled on these lands, this has not happened and the Sri Lankan Armed Forces are strengthening their possession on a part of the said land. The Tamil National Alliance and many other political parties and civil society organizations were invited to join the fast in solidarity with them. TNA Members of Parliament, the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah, the Hon. Suresh Premachandran, the Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy, the Hon. S. Adaikkalanathan, the Hon. Sivasakthi Anandan, the Hon. E. Saravanapavan, the Hon. S. Shritharan and the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran participated in this hunger strike. Other political party leaders, Dr. Wickramabahu Karunaratne, Mr. Mano Ganeshan, Mr. Azath Salley and others joined the fast. The Leader of the Opposition, Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe too joined the hunger strike at about 10.30 a.m.

At about 11.30 a.m. the Leader of the Opposition addressed the people. As he began, a few persons disturbed him. Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah asked them to be quiet. When the Leader of the Opposition finished speaking and was leaving the place, the same persons who tried to disturb him, started shouting at the people saying, "It is finished, now go home." They spoke with a heavy Sinhala accent, and also started to attack the people around them. The people repulsed this and pushed them away from those performing Satyagraha, and they tried to run. One of these persons was caught by the people and handed over to the police. Another ran to an army camp located close-by. The police took the arrested persons away, but when they went near that army camp, army personnel interfered and released him from the custody of the police and took him away. The faces of at least two of these attackers are now in the public domain.

It is clear from the above incident that the armed forces in Jaffna are continuing to aggressively interfere with normal civilian life and are

terrorizing the people. On 16th June 2011, the army attacked another peaceful assembly at Allaveddy in Jaffna, not far from the present location. There were five Members of Parliament belonging to the TNA at that meeting. So far no one has been arrested in connection with that incident, although the Government promised action when I raised that matter in Parliament.

The Police continue to file information saying unidentified men in army uniform attacked the TNA meeting and that investigations are going on. No progress has been made for the last one and a half years. Armed forces personnel interfered with the elections to the Local Authorities in the Northern Province and Provincial Council Elections to the Eastern Province. Complaints were made to the relevant authorities but no action has been taken. The present incident was clearly committed by the army personnel and confirms that the oppressive military rule is continuing to date. The Police is not able to counter the armys illegal actions.

This incident demonstrates to the country and the world at large that the rule of law has broken down in the Tamil areas. There is no right to freedom of association and peaceful assembly; there is no right to freedom of opinion and expression; there is no right to equality before the law and the equal protection of the law for the Tamil people. The Police are either totally powerless or are co-conspirators in this assault on democracy and fundamental freedoms of the Tamil people. The army is certainly pursuing an oppressive agenda against the Tamil people. Not only have they grabbed the lands belonging to the Tamil people, but they attack anyone who dares to question them. Armed forces are arrogantly confident that the arm of the law will never reach them and act with a total sense of impunity.

In these circumstances, I move that the Government should take immediate steps to bring the perpetrators of this assault on fundamental freedoms and democratic rights to justice immediately and restore the rule of law that has completely broken down in the Tamil areas in the North and East. We also ask that as per the recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, the strength of the armed forces, particularly in the North, should be substantially reduced as the only effective way to curb the oppressive presence and the high handedness of the armed forces and to enable the Tamil people to live in their historic habitations with self-respect and dignity".

Mr. Speaker, this is a serious incident that occurred in Jaffna on the 15th of this month. It clearly demonstrates that the army endeavoured to disturb a perfectly non-violent, peaceful demonstration being staged by the Tamil people in Jaffna against the denial of their fundamental rights to return to the land from which they have been evicted on account of the war on grounds of security, which is no longer applicable. Therefore, the people feel that they are entitled to return to their lands.

I do not want to speak at length, Sir, because my Colleagues who were present in Jaffna, who were present at the scene, will be in a position to speak more vividly in regard to this matter. But, I do want to state with a sense of responsibility that this is not the way to reconciliation. This particular incident clearly demonstrates that the Government is not genuinely committed to a process of reconciliation and that the armed forces are determined to achieve more continuous alienation rather than bring about a process of reconciliation.

This Motion will be seconded by one of my Colleagues and others will speak thereafter. I thank you, Sir.

661 662

[5.10 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I second the Motion that was just moved by the Hon. R. Sampanthan and I wish to state that this incident is not just one of the incidents; this is not an isolated one. This just demonstrates to this country and to the world what goes on in the Tamil areas day in and day out. This has come to the fore because several Members of Parliament were present there, several leaders of other political parties were present there, the Leader of the Opposition was present and therefore it was well covered by the media. But, on other occasions, this kind of oppression and worse goes on in the Tamil areas without the rest of the country coming to know about it or the world being able to see it. In one sense, we would like to thank the Jaffna Security Forces Commander, Major General Hathurusinghe for performing this demonstration for the world to see of what he conducts everyday in Jaffna. As has been pointed out in the Motion itself, on 16th of June, 2011, again on another occasion when five Parliamentarians were present, the army actually came in full uniform, armed to the teeth and with batons beat up and disrupted the meeting. Subsequently, when we had a discussion with the Jaffna Security Forces Commander, he told us that if it was the army that did that, he will ensure that everyone of those who were involved in that assault was court-martialled. We told him that for his sake, we wished that it was actually the army that did it and no one else because if it was someone else, imagine the situation of about 30 to 50 people who are not the army wearing army uniforms and being able to walk around in Jaffna with poles and worse, with automatic weapons.

The police filed an information in the Magistrates Court of Mallakam saying that unidentified men in army uniform attacked the TNA meeting. What a joke, unidentified men in army uniform in Jaffna! And, after one and a half years, further reports are filed every time the case comes up in the Magistrates Court and the police say, "we are still conducting investigations". The Hon. Minister of Justice was here; he has just left his seat. But, before he crossed over, he made a speech saying that the rule of law breaks down in this country everyday. Now, it is worse than that; worse than when he said those words in the year 2010 and far worse in the Tamil areas.

There was this phenomenon of a "grease man". The Government said all kinds of things. But, this particular incident again demonstrates the truth of those allegations because here too the assailants ran into the army camp and we have photographs to prove that. Just like the "grease man" who, on every occasion ran into the security forces' camps, here too, one ran into the army camp. With regard to the other who was arrested and being taken, the army interfered, got him released and took him into the

army camp. With regard to this arrest, the Police Spokesman, when confronted with the photographs that appeared in the newspapers, has said Yes, I saw the photographs but holding the hand and going is not an arrest. I suggest, Sir, that the Police Spokesman and senior police officials be sent for basic training to understand and be educated on what an "arrest" is. If this is the best that you can have, a spokesman for the police in this country, I shudder to think what the situation of the ordinary citizen is. The photographs very clearly show one of the assailants at least, having been properly restrained and being taken away by two policemen holding him. If that is not an arrest, then what is? Now, where is that person who was arrested by the police? Why is the police not accountable?

At the end of this month, there is going to be yet another Resolution in the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva where there will be a Resolution titled, Promoting accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka, like the one that was passed last year. All of these incidents, particularly the one that we have focused on today, clearly demonstrate to the world that Sri Lanka is in need of help to promote reconciliation and accountability. There is no accountability.

An Army Court of Inquiry handed over a report to the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence saying that they have conducted some inquiry and found that there is no person called a disappeared person in Sri Lanka. That is the worst assault you can deliver to all those mothers, wives, sisters and children who are still looking for their disappeared relatives. Even on this occasion, the day after this incident, in Kilinochchi, when the Hon. Leader of the Opposition was there, hundreds of mothers came and fell at his feet. They told their stories where they were witnesses when their husbands, their sons and their brothers were handed over to the army. It was done in their presence. But, they cannot be found today. Your own Commission, the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, records that 1,018 persons have gone missing. Those who gave evidence before the LLRC have shown that after having been surrendered to the security forces, people have gone missing. That number is only from those who gave evidence. There are thousands more like that. So, will this promote accountability? Will this promote reconciliation? There is impunity and it will certainly not promote any kind of reconciliation when a mother who is looking for her son whom she handed over to the security forces is being told by the Government, No, he did not disappear; there is no such thing that happened. Very soon, this Government will deny that there was ever a war in this country. Such is the brass with which this Government is getting about. This is not good for the country. That is why we support all measures that are taken by friends of ours, even outside the country, to promote accountability and reconciliation because without that, this Government is on a path to

663 664

destruction. We do not mind if it is only the regime that destroys itself but the Government is dragging its people and this country down that slope and we do not want that to happen. If this country is to prosper; if this country is to make a turnaround and go in the right path, then we need all the encouragement, all those nudges; those gentle pushes from the international community even through Resolutions in the United Nations Human Rights Council to promote accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.

Thank you very much.

Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. R. YOGARAJAN took the Chair.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah will speak now.

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Sir, I will speak last. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Okay. Then, the next speaker is the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. [5.56 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, just before this Adjournment Motion was moved, there was a Motion before this House appreciating the services rendered to humanity by Pope Benedict XVI and both sides of the House voiced their sentiments. I too wanted to record my appreciation, on

675 676

behalf of the Muslims of Sri Lanka, of the services he has rendered. I also had the rare occasion of having an audience with His Holiness the Pope when I was a member of the delegation led by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa to Vatican. I am also happy to say that Pope Benedict XVI is a man of peace and always advocated the religion of peace. He had certain conferences - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Yes, what is your point of Order? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, there is an Adjournment Motion before the House, but the Hon. Member is speaking on the previous Motion that was over. As usual, he is late.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Azwer, please confine yourself to this Adjournment Motion. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Sumanthiran, you get money, you get guineas from the diaspora and appear before the court. You have no business here. You had better shut your mouth and wait there. I will show you the way.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Azwer, please maintain decorum. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Sumanthiran, you wait! Sir, I am coming to that. What type of advocate is this person? He is misleading the entire Tamil community. He is the worst jackal

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

in the Tamil community. I say, shut your mouth and wait there. I will teach you what the Standing Orders are.

Sir, I would also place on record my appreciation of His Holiness the Pope. Similarly, the Hon. R. Sampanthan should have brought in a Motion of Appreciation for the great services rendered by His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa under the Mahinda Chintana for the development of the Northern Province. That is what they should have done. That is why I am making a forward statement.

Sir, what does Mahinda Chintana say? On page 76 of the Mahinda Chintana, under the subheading Beyond the Palmyrah Grove, it states, I quote:

I extend my hand of cooperation to you and your children with sincere love and affection, without being confined to the narrow boundaries of ethnic and religious differences.

His Excellency went to Jaffna and declared, I will not let anyone create another era where men and women go missing and children getting abducted. I will not allow that. Also, I will not allow terrorism to raise its head. Hon. R. Sampanthan, not even you or your grandfather will be able to do that.

Sir, it further states, I quote:

Having understood fully your struggle for survival against various odds, I will take action to expeditiously solve your problems.

His Excellency made these statements. Hon. Sampanthan, you are a great man, you can understand, not like the other person who is behind you.

The Jaffna-Mannar railway line will be reconstructed. The silbara kotan were taken away from the railway line. The Tigers destroyed the railway line, took away silbara kotan and made bunkers. That is what they were. Are you still going to support them? No. Turn a new era and come to your proper senses. The whole world is watching what you are doing today.

Sir, strange circumstances bring together strange bedfellows. The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti is the saviour of the TNA; the TNA is the saviour of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe; the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe is squatting in a hut in Jaffna and he is the saviour of the TNA, the LTTE and the JVP.

How many were murdered by them? It was an agony. The people suffered. The Muslims were driven away, as the Hon. Hunais Farook said. - [Interruption.] What does the Hon. Sampanthan say? He says, Restore the Rule of Law that has completely broken down in the Tamil areas in the North and East. This is a rubbishy statement, I should say. Such statements should not come from a person of the calibre of the Hon. Sampanthan who calls himself a leader. Then, he says that there is no right for freedom of association. He is only contradicting his own statement. The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe has gone there; some others too have gone; they have had a

677 678

[ ... ]

2013 20

meeting but the Hon. Sampanthan says, "there is no freedom".

Sir, today, as has never been in the history of this country, the North and the East are being tremendously developed. Mega development schemes have been launched in the North. But, what are they doing? Today, in a very theatrical fashion, they are staging a drama in order to convince those who are going to assemble in Geneva. That is their motive behind. You will never succeed, Hon. Sampanthan or Savithri, or whoever advocates them. I do not know the name. Whom are you all representing? You all are representing the diaspora. From where are you getting the money? You all are getting money from the diaspora. After 30 years of war which was a bleeding blood bath, Hon. Sampanthan, do you want to see your grand children suffer? Of course, your children are very happy in London and educated very well. You go to Norway. You all fly to Tamil Nadu and enjoy their hospitality.

"!" ;

, " "

. Has the TNA asked a single question in this House about developing a small road or pathway? They were blaming Major General Hathurusinghe. But, the Daily News of 30th January, 2013 states in a headline, I quote:

Upliftment of Jaffna Amazes U.S. Reps Troop deployment should be at Governments behest No involvement of Army in Civilian administration..

Now, the cat is out of the bag. Major General Hathurusinghe is doing such great work. He is a man of peace. He is developing their area. He loves children. He loves the people of that area and the people love him. This is the difference. You must understand it. Sir, under that same headline the Daily News goes on to state, I quote:

The 10 member delegation comprising US Ambassador in Colombo Michele J Sison, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs James Moore, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence for South and South Asia Wikram Singh, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour Jane B. Zinnerman and other officials was briefed on the present situation in Jaffna in terms of security, economic development, rehabilitation and resettlement and social harmony by Maj. Gen. Hathurusinghe.

You do not want a man of truth to tell the truth to the international community. But, the Americans went there; English people went there; the Australian High Commissioner and recently the French people also went there. They all came and appreciated the development process in the rebuilding of Jaffna. We are developing that area also, not only Hambantota.

Look at the A9 road. Were you not able to go on that road? Even you - the Members of the TNA - were not able to go there. How many road blocks were there earlier? You had to pay taxes. At that time, people who

had come from the Eastern Province with the Holy Quran had been stopped at the Manampitiya Bridge. Dogs were smelling the Holy Quran. That was the state of affairs at that time but due to the efforts of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, the great President of Sri Lanka, the Leader who has an unsurpassed honour in the whole of Asia, we have been able to redeem the country from that position. We are a free nation now. On freedom of speech, we have too much -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have one more minute. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay. Sir, I must say what the Major General Hathurusinghe has said. I further quote:

The visiting US delegation unreservedly commended the progress made in key sectors in Jaffna including the de-mining process, rehabilitation etc., in the aftermath of defeat of terrorism, Security Forces Headquarters-Jaffna Commander Major General Mahinda Haturusinghe said.

Major General Hathurusighe pointed out to the delegation that the Security Forces have reduced strength in Jaffna substantially since 2009.

The Jaffna Commander also said that the Army did not get involved in any way in civilian administration."

That is a reply to the Hon. Sampanthan's Motion.

Sir, it further states, I quote:

" He added that the Governing mechanism was similar to that in the South with all responsibilities discharged by regular administrators.

He also pointed out that the Army was planning to reduce the troops strength further."

Sir, the North and the East are being governed by Governors. Who are the top administrators? There are female Government Agents, Tamil Grama Niladharis and Divisional Secretaries. All the five provinces are principally manned by Tamil officers of the top rank. Sir, we have to tell this to Madras; we have to tell this to Tamil Nadu; we have to tell this to Norway and we have to tell this to the diaspora. We have to tell them how much of development has taken place in Jaffna. Who is doing all this development work? Who is getting money? The TNA does not want money. They return the money to the Treasury but those Government Agents who love their people and primarily, the Tamil ladies, are doing this work. Even the Mayor of Jaffna is a lady. You know it.

Sir, the "Daily News" of 16th February, 2013, states, I quote:

"Court of Inquiry investigating controversial Channel 4 claims conclude : Shelling deaths due to LTTE."

679 680

But, what do these people go and say to the international fora? They say that it has been done by the armed forces. I say once again, Sir, it was all done by the LTTE.

Thank you.
