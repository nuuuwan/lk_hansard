... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) !

Hon. Presiding Member, I stood up to express our deepest sorrow on the passing away of Rizana Nafeek in Saudi Arabia, who is reported to have been executed this morning. She was sent as an under-aged girl and had to meet this calamity at last.

I must place on record in this House the great efforts made by His Excellency the President and the Ministers concerned in order to get her a pardon. He even addressed two communications to the King of Saudi Arabia and also met Prince Salmon, the Second Command in the Royal Palace in Kuwait, recently, when we also went in a delegation to a Conference. Also, every effort has been made not only by the Sri Lankan Government, but even by civic societies all over the world.

I would also place on record that on the 16th of November, 2011, a delegation sponsored by our Government and led by the Governor of the Western Province, Mr. S. Alawi Moulana and his son Naqeeb went to the village of Dawadmi, 540 kilometers from Riyadh, and met the grandfather of the dead child, As-sheik Mirdas Al-Uthaibi and the tribal group. They said that they will intervene and get a pardon.

At this moment, we are very grateful to His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Government and also the Ambassador of Saudi Arabia in Sri Lanka, His Excellency Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman Al-Jammaz; then the Minister of External Affairs and his Ministry officials, particularly the Hon. Dilan Perera, Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, Mr. Nissanka Wijeratne, Secretary and Mr. Kingsley Ranawaka, Chairman, SLBFE, His Excellency Ahmed Jawad, the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Mr.

Ibrahim Ansar, Additional Secretary to the Ministry of External Affairs and also Moulavi M.S.M. Thassim of Jammiyathul Ulama Association for all the efforts that had been made. I was also in that delegation. We took Mr. and Mrs. Nafeek, the father and mother of Rizana, from Mutur with us. They also met that tribal leader at Dawadmi, the grandfather of the infant and pleaded with them for clemency. But, fate had the last call.

Sir, according to our religion, expressing my feelings in the Islamic way, I only have to say - she is also from the electorate of the Hon. Susantha Punchinilame and he too will express his condolences - "Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi rajioon".

I also place on record our deep gratitude to Dr. Kifaya Ifthikar, a civil activist, who did everything possible by being in Saudi Arabia to get Rizana released.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, using this opportunity I rise to say a few words to place on record the shock and grief of myself personally and that of the Government at the unfortunate report that Rizana Nafeek has been executed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Having said that, it is important to bear in mind that His Excellency the President and the Government took all possible steps to see that Rizana Nafeek is given a pardon by the King of Saudi Arabia. But, in the meantime, we must realize the constraints that the King himself faced in acceding to that request. We must be thankful to the Saudi authorities for having tried until the last moment. I must place on record, that it was just a few days ago, when His Excellency the Ambassador for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in Sri Lanka, paid a courtesy call on me at the Ministry of Justice, gave me an assurance that all efforts would be taken to see that the request of the President would be honoured and, as far as practicable, they will try their best not to execute Rizana Nafeek.

341 342

But, unfortunately, today we have received this news. Therefore, while all of us genuinely are in grief and in shock at the unfortunate manner in which this has happened, we must realize that as a sovereign country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has its own legal order and we are constrained to respect their sovereignty and also realize that the authorities, particularly His Highness the King, the Governor of Riyadh as well as Prince Salman and various high dignitaries of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, tried their very best to persuade the family of the unfortunate infant who had met with the death, supposedly or allegedly, at the hands of Rizana Nafeek.

We also made sure after His Excellency the President met with various high dignitaries of the Saudi government, we sent our Attorney-General to plead her case before the Saudi authorities and his Excellency the Ambassador, when he met me a few days ago, assured me that all this will have some salutary effect in preventing this death sentence from being carried out. However, once again it must be placed on record, that His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa had made all possible steps and every time a delegation went from this country to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, he made sure and he advised all of us to take this matter up with the Saudi authorities. Therefore, it is not for want of trying by us that this has happened.

But yet, once again, we must bear in mind that as a sovereign country, we have to respect another countrys internal procedures and, as I told this House, it is a fact that the internal judicial order in that country is such that even the King himself cannot give a pardon unless the family is willing to give that pardon to the accused concerned. In this instance, I was told finally that while one of the parents - the father - had agreed, the mother was still refusing to give the necessary pardon and that has finally resulted in this unfortunate execution.

Finally, what is left for all of us is to pray for her soul. I am sure the entire country will pray for her soul and for her to be granted Jennath-ul-Firdous in the hereafter. I conclude my speech with those comments.

Thank you.

... ( ) ( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Urban Affairs) Mr. Presiding Member, I thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak a few words on the demise of our sister, Rizana Nafeek. When I heard of her death this morning, it was a shock to me.

I knew that unless the parents of the dead child give pardon, nobody else could give pardon to release that young girl who was asked to look after the child. In fact, the President, the Government, the Ministers, the Hon. Members of Parliament and various organizations were trying their best to get this girl released. But, I knew that it would not happen unless the parents of the dead child were willing to pardon her. The mother of the dead child was very adamant with their decision and therefore, her execution was not avoidable.

Sir, I request the Saudi Government to take action against the mother of the infant for entrusting this small girl with the task of looking after her child. She must be charged with negligence. She should not have given to this young girl the task of looking after that small baby. Therefore, I request the Government of Saudi Arabia to take action against her. The King tried his best to negotiate and help, but unfortunately, as the parents of the dead child did not agree, this did not come through.

Thank you, Sir.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) , .

Sir, first, I would like to speak about the girl who has been executed in Saudi Arabia, Rizana Nafeek.

In 2005, she left the country due to the economic problems her family had been facing. No parent likes to send his or her small child abroad to earn. But, Rizana's parents had no choice. During that time, due to the curse of the war with the LTTE in the East, her parents had no choice, but to send their child abroad to make money, to make ends meet.

At that time, the President of Sri Lanka, the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, the Deputy Ministers as well as the Secretaries of both Ministries did their best, sending several delegations to appeal against the death sentence passed on her. It was a special case because they found that the infant had got choked to death. It is true that the young girl would not have known how to feed an infant. But, this girl had been sent to Saudi Arabia using a different method, not through the regular way of sending maids. Some people who wanted to make money had forged documents, changing the girl's date of birth and sent her to Saudi Arabia. The Government had taken action against those perpetrators and stopped them. It has been exercising the same rules with regard to the other such institutions as well which have been sending young children or elderly parents abroad forging documents. This childs death sentence has enlightened our approach to the dealings in many areas and the Government has taken correct measures on those dealings carried out illegally. So, I must thank the Government for that.

Anyway, many of our Ministers went to Saudi Arabia and lots of money had been spent to save her. Various institutions wanted to make collections for blood money and a lot of effort had been made to save this girls life. But, unfortunately, she had an untimely death. I do not think she had any intention of killing that infant although it happened.

So, according to my religion, I pray for her soul to rest in peace. I know that the Church, the Holy See and the Holy Father also made an appeal.

All religious leaders, international religious organizations and NGOs made appeals. They made investigations into this matter. Even our Cardinals, Bishops, the Church, jointly with the Muslim clergy, with the Muslim hierarchy made pleas. Buddhist monks, high priests, everybody made pleas, but all in vain.

Coming to the subject, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera. After 1958, the Chilaw Town also went under water. , ,
