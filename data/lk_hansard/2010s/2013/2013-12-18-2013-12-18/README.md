Hon. Chairman, opening the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development last week, I stated that for many of us who have seen through the duplicitous nature of this regime and understood its Running with the hare and hunting with the hounds policy, it did not come as a great surprise to learn that the family members of this regime have been making large contributions to the ruling Conservative Party in the United Kingdom since 2011, despite the pre-Christmas pantomime - that is what I call it - put on by Prime Minister Cameron and President Rajapaksa on behalf of their respective constituencies during the CHOGM one month ago.

In fact, I table* the letter written to Prime Minister Cameron by British MP Tom Blenkinsop, as you may remember, last week, expressing concern of a news that a prominent donor to the Conservative Party has links with the Rajapaksa Regime through a nephew of the President and requesting Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, to look into the matter urgently.

Hon. Chairman, since then, I have even more details of how the Rajapaksa Regime is resorting to duplicitous and devious methods to win over Members of Parliament

and other influential people, especially in the House of Commons, using Government funds which should be allocated to Ministries in Sri Lanka. In the days gone by, we have heard that some people, in the absence of their grieving kith and kin, used to hire women to cry at their funerals. . . . Likewise, the Rajapaksa Regime, in the absence of friends in the international community, has resorted to buying friends to sing their praises in their respective countries. Sir, this is what "The Sunday Times" newspaper reported on 15th December, 2013:

Lanka pays British MP 3,412 to attend Business Forum

, . . .

I further quote:

A Democratic Unionist Party Member of Parliament in the British House of Commons has declared that he was paid around Sterling Pounds 3,412 to attend the Commonwealth Business Forum in Colombo. The event was held ahead of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting last month.

Parliamentarians in the UK are required by statute to declare foreign funds, gifts or invitations they receive. Ian Paisley Jnr, (North Antrim) ......"

In fact, he is the son of the famous Rev. Ian Paisley of Northern Ireland.

"....who has come to Sri Lanka and on previous visits hosted by the Government, had been paid Sterling Pounds 2,812 for flights to Colombo and a further Sterling Pounds 600 for accommodation.

All other expenses were paid. It goes on to state:

The visit was from November 11 to 15.

The purpose of the visit has been declared as to speak at the Commonwealth Business Forum.

But, as far as I know, maybe you all can correct me, this gentleman, even though he told the British Parliament that he is coming here to speak, he did not speak at this Forum held in Colombo. In fact, the Conservative Party obviously had become worried about the dubious fascination some of their backbench MPs had for the Rajapaksa Regime and this compelled the Chief Whip of the United Kingdom, Mr. Swayne, I believe, to stop five Conservative MPs coming to Sri Lanka because they had all been previous recipients of all-expense-paid trips to Sri Lanka.

In fact, one of the Members of Parliament who was stopped from travelling was James Wharton, who is a Member of Parliament for Stockton in the United Kingdom, who had visited, according to newspaper reports, four times in nine months. This is not taking into account the recent visit. This is for 2012 alone. I was told he was looked after very ably by the handler and provider par excellence, the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena.

I believe this gentleman is the handler and provider for all these MPs who are coming here.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I am complimenting - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Chairman) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Okay. But, can I not even compliment him? I said, "he is a handler and a provider". That is a compliment.

( ) (The Chairman) .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Anyway, I have here with me "The Independent" newspaper of Friday, 23rd November, 2012.

( ) (The Chairman) . ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) "The Independent" newspaper of the United Kingdom states, I quote:

Four visits in nine months and statements in the Commons on the controversial Rajapaksa regime: why does the 28-year-old MP for Stockton James Wharton care so much about Sri Lanka?

That was the heading and it states how he was the head of a delegation of nine UK Parliamentarians on a journey to Sri Lanka in July and August of that year. It further goes on to state how he came again later that year. It also mentions that he is a very frequent visitor to the High Commission. Commenting on this Members frequent visits to Sri Lanka, it also states, I quote:

" John Maan, a Labour MP who has also travelled to Sri Lanka with the Royal Commonwealth Society, said the country still had 'huge problems' and that Mr. Wharton had become too close to

the government. 'Theres a reason why he has been invited so many times by the Sri Lankan government, paid for by the Sri Lankan government so many times and that they are wining and dining him so often at the Sri Lanka High Commission in London,' he said. 'This is not a very effective use of parliamentary time and hes going to have difficulty explaining it to his constituents.

Actually, for the benefit of all the Members, I would like to table* this article published in "The Independent" newspaper.

Another MP who was stopped from coming to Colombo for CHOGM is the Conservative MP, Hon. Aidan Burley in the UK who, along with his girlfriend also enjoyed a lavish, all-expenses-paid trip to Sri Lanka early this year. Not only the MP, his girlfriend also wined and dined by the Rajapaksa Regime in Sri Lanka. They were kept at all the highly expensive resorts and wined and dined by the person whose name I cannot say for obvious reasons you know; the handler and the provider.

What is even more shocking according to Westminster sources, Mr. Chairman, -

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Member, do not disturb him. The Chairman is being disturbed.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I think he should be disturbed. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Use your words carefully. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) No, no, our Hon. Speaker is a very cool man. We cannot perturb him easily. I think you will be even more perturbed if you hear this. Please check whether this is true or not. This is, of course, hearsay and maybe even gossip. But, in the British Parliament they are saying that Mr. Aidan Burleys wedding, which is to be held at a resort in the Maldives in the early part of next year is also to be financed by the Sri Lankan Government.

They are busy financing weddings of British MPs but cannot give any of you enough money to spend in your Ministry. This is outrageous. Along with them, the other MPs according to British Parliament sources who enjoyed this lavish all-expense-paid trip coordinated by the

2687 2688

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

handler and provider, other than James Wharton, Ian Paisley and Aidan Burley, are Mark Pritchard, Conservative MP, Vice-Chair of the Sri Lanka All-Party Parliamentary Group, the Hon. Brian Binley, Conservative MP, Joint Secretary of the Sri Lanka All-Party Parliamentary Group, then of course, from the House of Lords, Lord Naseby, Conservative MP and Joint Chair of the Sri Lanka All-Party Parliamentary Group and Lord Rogan, who is an Ulster Unionist. All these people, from the information that we have, have accepted hospitality in Sri Lanka and all their tickets and their stay were paid by the Sri Lankan Government. According to Conservative estimates, the expenses incurred only for these seven MPs have been over Sterling Pounds 100,000; just for seven people, over Sterling Pounds 100,000 have been spent.

( ) (The Chairman) There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. What is the point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) With all seriousness, I want to bring to your kind notice that we are discussing the Votes of certain Ministries. Under that, we are not discussing the House of Commons. He is an agent of the House of Commons and he is castigating. We must be fair by the British MPs. Sir, we are a Parliament in the Commonwealth. We have to be fair by the British MPs. He is slating them. He is throwing mud at them. He is a madakariya.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] Matara madakariya.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) , .

As I said last time, the Nonises and the Monises of the world are busy grandstanding about our sovereignty and our 2,500-year history to the fascination

of the chattering classes of Colombo, while at the same time, they are busy squandering our much-needed foreign reserves trying to buy up foreign MPs or showering them with hideously expensive gifts as they have done with the Australian Prime Minister, who of course, I must say, has declared his gifts including diamond cuff-links in his own country. In fact, Mr. Chairman, I am rather curious to know the type of gifts the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth got for saving the day for this regime, going as far as hiding two reports regarding the impeachment of Chief Justice Bandaranayake from CMAG Members. So, I am sure, he would also have been showered with very expensive gifts of all kinds and I am rather curious to find out what those gifts are.

Finally, as far as this matter is concerned, Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to you, I think the Madamulana Doctrine on international relations seems to be, If you cannot win them, buy them. That seems to be the doctrine of this Government or, at least, a section of the people in the Government who are working.

Now, I would like to quickly go to another issue. You know, much has been written about the CHOGM since it concluded one month ago. I am sure much has been written about the CHOGM. But, are you aware that there was an Israeli VIP present in this country during the same period? That Israeli VIP also came to Sri Lanka on the 11th of November, along with the other dignitaries. In fact, I have here, the confidential flight schedule of the Civil Aviation Authority. This is a confidential report which gives all the details of the arrivals of the Heads of State to Sri Lanka to attend the CHOGM. Some of them - actually 10 leaders - came in their own private jets. They were not scheduled flights. They came in their own private jets, like the leader of Ghana, Malaysia, Pakistan, United Kingdom, Brunei, Bangladesh - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Chairman) There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Chairman, I would like to question the validity of the document that the Honourable Member of Parliament is quoting from. He says that it is a confidential document. I do not think it is a confidential document given to the Hon. Member. So, it is better that you do not unnecessarily involve the Civil Aviation Authority.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I take full responsibility for it. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Chairman) The Hon. Member is taking responsibility for it. Hon. Member, you can table it.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) How can he take responsibility if it is not a public document? - [Interruption.] Sir, it is not a public document.

( ) (The Chairman) What is the document, please?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) On the visit of VIPs, how can you take personal responsibility? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) On the 11th at 19:00 hours, a private jet arrived at the Colombo/Katunayake Airport - actually, four hours before the South African President arrived. The South African President also arrived in his own private jet at 22:45 hours. According to this, there is no name. It says, "VIP dignitary and other VIPs". So, there are two VIPs - Call Sign MLRK, AC type CL504 - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Chairman) There is a point of order being raised. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I am making a request that this be expunged. - [Interruption]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Why?- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You are not reading from a valid document. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) As a Member of Parliament, I take full responsibility for what I am saying. - [Interruption.] Okay. But, then, you deny. In fact, these are - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) If the Hon. Member is taking responsibility, I think - [Interruption.]

Mangala Samaraweera) Then, let me ask you, Mr. Chairman, was there an Israeli private jet which arrived in Sri Lanka on the 11th at 19:00 hours? - [Interruption.] Who were the VIPs who came from Israel in this private jet? - [Interruption.] Were the Member-Nations of the Commonwealth, especially, Pakistan and Islamic countries - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration and the Ministry of Resettlement at the Committee Stage Discussion.

The problems between the Sinhalese and the Tamils became strained only after the Sinhala Only Act was passed. I request the Hon. Minister to try to bring back the pre-1956 situation.

I appreciate the work done by the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Minister of National Languages and Social Integration. He has a very good Secretary. I think in the 2002 Budget, the Minister of Finance and Planning, the Hon. Ronnie de Mel said, You cannot prepare a good Budget, if there is an ethnic problem. Before 1956, we did not have any Sinhala/Tamil problems. It was only in 1917, that there was a Muslim/Sinhala trouble and leaders like the Hon. D.S. Senanayake and some others were jailed and Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan had to go to UK and get them released. But, the problem between the Tamils and the Sinhalese started when the Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike passed the Sinhala Only Act. He promised to bring the Sinhala Only Act within 24 hours. When this Act was passed, political leaders like the Hon. Pieter Keuneman, the Hon. Colvin R. de Silva and the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam criticized it, saying that it would lead to a division of the country. But, the Hon. Colvin R. de Silva said, If you want to have one language, there will be two nations. If there are two languages, there will be one nation. The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam said it would lead to a parting of the ways. The Sinhala Only Act made the Tamils second-class citizens and it humiliated them.

When the then Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, came to Sri Lanka in 1952, he appreciated the economic development in Sri Lanka and said that he

2703 2704

would go back to Singapore and make Singapore a Sri Lanka. Later, in 1956, he told the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike not to pass the Sinhala Only Act. As a result of the Sinhala Only Act that was passed in 1956 and implemented in 1961, today we are unable to find good interpreters or translators. Recently, the Legal Draftsman said that she was unable to draft Bills in time due to lack of translators.

When the Tamils started protesting against the Sinhala Only Act, many problems started. In 1956, 1958, 1961, 1977 and 1983 there were pogroms. This was mainly due to Sinhala Only Act. Until this Act was passed, no one spoke of separation. It was the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who laid the foundation stone for the minorities to think of separation. Some national leaders here are now criticizing the TNA; but the TNA has not asked for separation. What did Sinhala chauvinists like Gunadasa Amarasekara and S.L. Gunasekara do in 1956 when the Sinhala Only Act was passed?

Sir, now I would like to speak about Resettlement. The Government recently announced that resettlement can be done by the respective Divisional Secretaries and District Secretaries. Even the President has announced at the United Nations that 95 per cent of the persons who were displaced have already been resettled and rehabilitated. But, that is not the actual position.

The United Nations in a recently-issued report regarding resettlement, has reported that in the Districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu, 117,888 persons have not yet been permanently resettled and further, in the North, the resettled people are staying with their friends and relatives.

In the Mullaitivu area, in the Maritime Pattu DS Division, about 1,193 families consisting of 4,686 persons have to be resettled. In the Puthukudiyiruppu DS Division, 4,199 families consisting of 16,374 persons have to be resettled. In Mullivaikkal West, Keppapulavu, 317 families consisting of 1,336 persons have to be resettled. The Keppapulavu village adjoins the Vattapalai village, in which people have already been resettled. The persons in Vattapalai have their own lands in the Keppapulavu area, but they are unable to go to Keppapulavu to do their agricultural activities. The last lot of people who were displaced from the Keppapulavu village were taken out from the Cheddikulam Camp by the army and dumped in a jungle, not in Keppapulavu.

In the Mannar District, the people displaced from Mullikulam are prevented by the army form resettling there. About 200 families from Thirumurugandy area, who are in camps, are not allowed to go and resettle there. The army has constructed a road across the Thirumurugandy village and prevents people from resettling there. That is a serious problem.

In 1990, about 100,000 people were displaced from Valikamam North and they were not allowed to go and resettle in the area. We filed a fundamental rights application in the Supreme Court and the Court ordered that the displaced persons be allowed to go and resettle there, but, so far only a part of them have been allowed to resettle and the balance have not yet been resettled.

In KKS West, GN Division No. J/233, 663 people; in KKS Centre, 1,093 people; in KKS South, 549 people; in Thenmylai, 765 people; in Kurumpasiddy, 641 people; in Myliddy North, 3,271 people; in Thaiyiddy East, 696 people; in Myliddithurai East, 745 people; in Thaiyiddy North, 859 persons; in Thaiyiddy South, 1,608 people; in Myliddithurai North, 1,519 people; in Palali South, 1,228 people; in Palali East, 1,802 people; in Palali North, 1,648 people; in Palali North-West, GN Division No. J/ 255, 606 people and in Palali West, 809 people are to be resettled.

Then, in Tellippalai, 1,146 persons; in Palai Veemankamam North, 1,262 persons; in Palai Veemankamam South, 956 persons; in Kadduvan, 509 persons; in Varuthalaivilan, 972 persons and in Kurumpasiddy East, 1,596 persons are to be resettled. Nearly 30,000 people are to be resettled in Valikamam North. All these persons are living in camps or with their relatives. I went and inspected the areas where people have been allowed to resettle. Almost the entire area is covered with bushes and there are snakes and pigs in those areas and the people who have already been resettled complained to me about those bushes.

Nearly 15,000 acres in Sampur had been taken over by the Government about six years ago and about 8,000 persons were displaced and are living in camps. The Government needs only 500 acres for their project to produce electricity. Therefore, I request the Government to immediately allow the Sampur people to resettle in the balance lands.

Finally, I request all the Hon. Members of this House to go through the Editorial of the Daily Mirror of 17th December, 2013, which appeared under the headline Isnt corruption evil any more?

Thank you. [.. 11.01] .. ( ) ( .. - ) (The Hon. C.B. Rathnayake - Minister of Private Transport Services) , .

I am thankful to His Excellency the President for giving me the responsibility to steer a sector, which ensures food security in our country through livestock production and to uplift the living standard of a community which has brought much-needed foreign exchange to support our economy through their labour in the plantations.

I wish to place on record my appreciation of the efforts of my Secretary, staff of my Ministry, Chairmen and the Directors of the Boards of MILCO, NLDB. LANLIB, STMF, PHDT and the Mahaweli Livestock Enterprise, the Director-General of the Department of Animal Production and Health and all officials in these institutions for their commitment for the development of the country.

Sir, there were two issues raised by the Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam which I would like to answer. One is about the high cost incurred on the import of milk powder. For the first time, the import of milk powder has come down by 5,000 metric tons in 2012 and by 28,000 metric tons in 2013. The other issue is with regard to the import of pregnant cows. The cost incurred for the import of three Friesian and Jersey cows was Rs. 295,000. They were free of contagious diseases. However, they were quarantined for a period of two months during which a team of veterinarians were in attendance to check the progress of their health.

Due to lack of time, I would like to table* the rest of my speech.

"Growth in the overall economy of the country as the average Sri Lankan witness at present has a significant impact on livestock sector, particularly through the increased demand for food products of animal origin. At the same time, the consumers today are increasingly becoming conscious of the quality of the food and

safety issues and this prompts the use of sophisticated methods at the farm as well at processing, down the entire chain. The consumer-led forces, therefore, have created the necessary incentives for rapid intensification and industrialization of animal production thereby creating increased opportunities for gainful employment, both directly from livestock production and through engagement in livestock-related industries.

The bulk of the activities of primary production of livestock produce, the processing of such produce and the marketing of livestock products together with the related input supply networks are all in the hands of the private sector. This also includes a large group of small and marginal farmers. If this intensification of animal husbandry activities is to be sustained and also expanded over the time, it will need mechanisms for effective coordination and collaboration among the different stakeholders facilitated by appropriate policies. My Ministry as well as the agencies under my Ministry have therefore made positive efforts to create an enabling environment for the livestock industry stakeholders to contribute their best.I wish to place on record some of the initiatives made in this regard by my Ministry during the year 2013.

The vulnerability of our food security situation to external factors was clearly evident in the recent fiasco of certain imported milk powder being labelled as contaminated with Dicyandiamide or DCD. We were also worried about the story of Botulism causing bacteria in some batches of imported milk powders. These incidents reiterate the importance of a higher level of self-reliance in our food needs and the risks of greater reliance on external sources for our food needs.

My Ministry has been actively promoting domestic milk production through direct intervention by the National Livestock Development Board and also indirectly by facilitation of dairying and promoting liquid milk consumption. As I mentioned earlier, the intensification of livestock production is a prerequisite for optimizing on our limited natural resources and in meeting the modern day needs of the consumers. Unlike in the case of the poultry sector where the private sector was very quick in introducing new technologies and innovations in intensification of activities to meet the market needs, the same transformations were not visible in the dairy sector. The Government saw this gap in technology acquisition in the dairy sector and we intervened therefore by importing 2,000 dairy cows to serve as a nucleus herd at the NLDB. We wanted their progeny distributed among the small farmers to improve their dairy herds and set the path for intensification of the smallholder dairy sector.Together with these cattle importations we have also built state-of-the-art cattle housing systems, milking parlours and cattle management operations and thereby established new benchmarks in the dairy sector in Sri Lanka. These developments are needed to enhance cow comfort and animal welfare and provide a natural environment for optimum dairy production. We were able to demonstrate that milk production levels achieved by the dairying countries in the West too can be achieved by the tropical countries such as ours. The infrastructure developed at Bopaththalawa Farm of the NLDB for imported cattle has, therefore, become a benchmark for medium scale commercial dairies in Sri Lanka. We believe that there will be several private entrepreneurs emulating the new technologies we have introduced at Bopaththalawa Farm and thereby cause a ripple effect of technology transfer in the dairy sector. We are now making arrangements to continue this effort by developing the infrastructure at Ridiyagama Farm of the NLDB and increase the stock with another 2500 imported cows during the year 2014.

Together with the augmentation of milk production, we have also commenced modernization of the state-owned milk processing infrastructure where 50-year-old plant and machinery of MILCO

2757 2758

will be replaced with modern, efficient and environment-friendly dairy plants. MILCO was the successor to the then National Milk Board and was established during the period of the Late Hon. Saumyamoorthy Thondaman through a World Bank initiative. Modernization of plant and machinery of this new entity was an identified need even at that time. However, due to the abrupt termination of donor funds, modernization of machinery of MILCO could not be carried out then.

Our national milk production which was 258 million litres in 2011 was increased to 299.3 in 2012 signifying a growth of 16 per cent. For the first time, we have seen volumes of imported milk powder shrinking and local milk processors unable to meet the demand for local dairy produce. These are encouraging signals and our dairy development efforts in 2014 will further consolidate on the development initiatives undertaken in 2013.

In the poultry sector, I must mention, we are now in a position to produce all our requirements of eggs and meat. Not only that, some of our industry partners are even in a position to export day-old parent chicks, chicken meat and eggs to countries in the region. We will support these endeavours and provide necessary incentives to the poultry sector to increase their competitiveness in reaching foreign markets for other poultry products as well.

Parallel to these improvements in the state institutions, we have also developed measures to deliver a better veterinary health care service to the public so that the individual farmers too can benefit gainfully. The Foot and Mouth Disease Vaccine is now locally produced and given free to cattle owners thereby making a saving of nearly Rs.15 million annually on vaccine imports. Provision of free Ranikhet Disease Vaccine to small-scale poultry farmers and the production of a substitute to replace imported medication for mastitis in cows also deserve highlighting to this Assembly.

My Ministry also has the added responsibility of uplifting the lives of our rural community. Unlike the different rural communities, the plantation community, during the period of the civil conflict could not move freely to other parts of the country because of many difficulties which prevailed at that time. With the dawn of peace in the country, the youth from the plantation community is now able to move to any part of the country and explore livelihood opportunities outside their traditional vocations in the plantation domain. However, they need skills and competencies to market themselves in the competitive labour market outside the plantations. My Ministry therefore has taken steps to provide these youth with required vocational skills and relevant IT literacy through the Saumyamoorthy Thondaman Memorial Foundation. These programmes are aimed to empower them to compete effectively outside their plantation territory.

Transforming a community whose members were in a virtual bondage to the plantation management and brought up with a dependent mentality for all their needs is no easy task. We have therefore continued the trust areas of intervention in the sector namely, the programme for livelihood and basic facility improvement in rural areas, programmes for the socio-economic development in lagging areas and the estate housing programme.

These prgrammes and the projects of my Ministry are implemented directly by institutions assigned to my Ministry, the Saumyamoorthy Thondaman Memorial Foundation and the Plantation Human Development Trust.

The underprivileged communites in underserved areas need capacity building if they are to stand on their feet and sustain themselves. It is towards this goal that the Saumyamoorthy Thondaman Memorial

Foundation implements the Praja Shakthi Project which aims to achieve comprehensive, complete and overall socio-economic development for the underprivileged communities. Additionally, this enables the youth to equip and empower themselves to face the competitive labour market with confidence and much-needed computer literacy, web resources sourcing and social networking.I am happy to inform that a total of 46 Praja Shakthi centres are functioning in the districts of Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Kandy, Ratnapura, Galle, Kalutara and Kegalle. The activities under the Praja Shakthi will continue to be designed and implemented to enable the youth to acquire skills and competencies to uplift their social standards.

The Nawa Shakthi Programme implemented by the Saumyamoorthy Thondaman Memorial Foundation provides assistance to unemployed youth for self-employment and under this Programme financial assistance is provided using a revolving fund and through State banks.

The Thondaman Vocational Training Centre at Hatton is another institution functioning under the Saumyamoorthy Thondaman Memorial Foundation which imparts technical education to the underprivileged youth in multi disciplines so that they can earn their livelihood in a dignified and decent manner both in Sri Lanka and overseas.

What my Ministry is endeavouring is to make the youth in the underserved areas move from dependent lifestyle to an independent mode of life so that they will be equal partners with the rest of the society.

The Thondaman Cultural Centre at Ramboda seeks to empower the underprivileged youth by fulfilling their cultural and aesthetic needs and it will help the youth to unveil their hidden capabilities to the society.

The Plantation Human Development Trust, which is a catalyst agency under my Ministry, is entrusted with the task of human and social capital development of plantation-worker community. It has supported all major interventions in the plantation sector in social welfare programmes, estate infrastructure development projects, integrated rural projects, plantation reform projects and plantation development supportive programmes. Plantation Human Development Trust extends its activities in monitoring child development centres which supports worker-families, particularly, the working women to focus on their employment and also support the economy by making women free to attend to the economic activities.

I am thankful to His Excellency the President for giving me the responsibility to steer a sector which ensures food security in our country through livestock production and to uplifts the living standard of a community which has brought much-needed foreign exchange to support our economy through their labour in the plantations.

In conclusion, I wish to place on record my appreciation of the efforts of my Secretary, staff of my Ministry, the Director-General of Department of Animal Production and Health, the Chairmen and Directors of the Boards of MILCO Pvt Ltd, National Livestock Development Board, the LANLIB, Saumyamoorthy Thondaman Memorial Foundation, Plantation Human Development Trust, the Mahaweli Livestock Enterprise and all officials in these institutions for their commitment for the development of the country.

Thank you.

. . , , . [4.01 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Report of the Select Committee.

I was privileged to serve on the Select Committee, where the Votes of several Ministries and the Votes of

2817 2818

[ ]

2013 18

the 10 Senior Ministers were considered. I feel the process of this Select Committee was very useful because we were able to interact with the Ministers and the officials and get certain clarifications. We were also able to give them suggestions for changes and improvements, whereas when we discuss a Ministry in the House, it is a question of shouting at each other or criticizing and not getting replies. So, I feel if every Ministry is considered before a Select Committee or at least before a Consultative Committee prior to it being discussed in this House at the Committee Stage, it would be a very positive thing. I think during the seven days of the Second Reading, we could sit to discuss the first few Ministries in a Select Committee or a Consultative Committee, thrash out issues and then come here for an open Discussion. I feel this should be considered next year. This being the second year of the Select Committee, I think in the future, we should consider that as a positive thing.

Though we are not discussing the Votes of the Senior Ministers today, I wish to make a few comments about the Senior Ministers. The Senior Ministers are veteran politicians who have got elected by their people for, maybe, 25 to 30 years. They are highly experienced; they have a lot of knowledge, talent and wisdom. But, unfortunately, the Senior Ministers have not been given a positive role to play. They have not been given anything more than offices. They have not been given duties so that their extremely valuable talents could be used in the development of the country.

There was one issue that came up last year and also this year. The Minister for Scientific Affairs, the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana, a Senior Minister, had asked for some funds last year for the Coordinating Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation. You know, he has been doing a very positive thing. He had asked for Rs. 80 million last year, but had received only Rs. 50 million. This year, he made a presentation in the Select Committee, where he showed the new methods of producing things which will add value to our export products; it was visibly seen. Last time, he proposed that graphite be utilized for the production of graphene. He said that graphite, when exported, got only US Dollars 800 per metric ton whereas when you export carbon nanotubes made from graphene, those could be exported for as much as US Dollars 1,500 per gram. So, this type of innovation has to be introduced to industry. That can be done by the Ministry of Scientific Affairs. So, to coordinate all the institutes connected with science and technology, he had formulated the Coordinating Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation. For that, Rs. 50 million was allocated last year, instead of the Rs. 80 million he requested for. This year, he has asked for Rs. 160 million, whereas he has been allocated only Rs. 80 million.

So, the Committee considered this and recommended to the Government that they look into this issue of

enhancing the amount allocated for COSTI, so that innovation and scientific improvement of our local produce into value-added final product can enhance the foreign exchange earnings of the country.

Another item he talked about is raw ilmenite which becomes titanium dioxide or titanium. If you export this raw type of ilmenite, you get only US Dollars 260 per metric ton but, when you convert it and then export, you can earn up to US Dollars 2,300 per metric ton. It is 10 times that amount. This has already been successfully implemented. If this can be done for graphite also, the value of our minerals will go up immensely. I wish to place on record in the House itself that the request of Rs.160 million for this Ministry should be considered by the Treasury favourably.

Then, I would like to speak about the minor export crops. The Deputy Minister was here, I think he has gone now. Anyway, the Kandy District plantations, the tea estates, are all sick. They are owned by the JEDB, the SLSPC and Elkaduwa Plantations. They are unable to make profits. Large extents of these estates have become unutilized land. There is no tea at all. So, this land should be utilized for growing minor export crops such as pepper, cardamom and cocoa. We are fetching very high prices today for these crops and the private growers of pepper, cardamom and cocoa are doing very well. The workers in these estates are not getting enough work during the month, they get about 10 to 12 days. But, if this land can be utilized to grow these minor export crops, there will be employment to these workers, and the JEDB and the SLSPC will become profitable entities. So, towards this end, the workers are willing to cultivate these lands as out-growers under the management of the JEDB, the SLSPC, and you can do the marketing of the produce; they can also provide the raw materials with the workers providing the labour. So, this will be a good model that I would request the Minister to look into.

Then, I wish to speak about the Ministry of Labour and Labour Relations. The Hon. Minister of Labour and Labour Relations was good enough two years ago to bring in the Employees' Provident Fund (Amendment) Act, which provided for workers who are members of the EPF to withdraw 30 per cent of their balance in advance for two purposes: housing and medical treatment. Though this law was passed two years ago, up to now the regulations have not been passed. The Hon. Minister brought it here once, but that day some other business of more importance came up and it was put off. I feel that it is not because we do not have the time to debate it here and pass the regulations, but because the Treasury does not want to release funds from the EPF. If people withdraw money, this Government which is tottering economically will find it difficult to meet their daily expenses. So, this is being delayed and the workers whose money is with the Central Bank are unable to access that money for the purpose that this Parliament has

2819 2820

approved. The law is in place; it is only the regulations that have to be passed. I request the Hon. Minister to use his good offices with the Treasury and with the Government to see that this money is released as soon as possible.

The Hon. Minister for Private Transport Services is not here. I wish to commend him and thank him for starting the reconstruction work of the Thalawakele Bus Stand. If you look at bus stands in some of the other areas like Nawalapitiya, you will be shocked to hear that within the Nuwara Eliya District, we do not have proper bus stands and the Hon. Minister has decided to build the first one in Thalawakele, which has been converted into a modern town consequent to the Upper Kotmale Hydropower Project being located there. So, with the modernization of the Thalawakele Town, the Hon. Minister building a new bus stand in Thalawakele is very commendable and we thank him for that.

The Hon. Minister for Plantation Industries has just arrived.I wanted to speak about that first, but I thought I will wait for you. I am thankful to you, Hon. Minister, because even in the Select Committee, we raised many issues and we got very positive responses from you. We are glad that you are the Minister, but at the same time, we are also unhappy that a lot of things that should come under you such as the JEDB, SLSPC, all these, are with some other Ministers where you have very little power to do anything. If they were with you, as I suggested now, minor export crops could be grown in the estates under the JEDB and the SLSPC in Kandy.

Hon. Minister, I have stated this in the House during the Second Reading and I took it up at the Select Committee also. The upcountry people, the estate workers do not want upstair houses. They are looking for separate houses with a small garden because they are rural people, agricultural workers. Living in flats like the city dwellers is not conducive to their life. I reiterate that the Hon. Minister must pursue this issue with the Government and change the policy. I am grateful to you, Hon. Minister, for having a plan to provide land for housing for the estate staff. This is a longstanding issue. It came up in the Cabinet once and it was stopped, but I hear that you, with the support of His Excellency, are proceeding with providing land for estate staff. This has already been mentioned in the Select Committee Report. I think I can speak about it though I promised you that day that I will not speak about it until you make the announcement. But, now that it has come in the Select Committee Report, I think I have the privilege of thanking you for that and I hope that this would become successful soon.

Regarding the assessment of RPCs, you have said RPCs should replant 2 per cent of tea and 3 per cent of rubber. This should have been done long ago. Even today, nearly 40 to 50 per cent of the estates are not replanted.

They are having old trees or plants which are over 70, 80, 90 years old which are not giving a proper yield. This is the reason that in the South we get 2,300 kilograms per hectare whereas in the upcountry RPC estates, we get a yield in the region of 1,000 to 1,300 kilograms. So, replanting is very important. We are glad that you are pushing it. But, you have allocated only Rs. 500 million for this purpose. If it is spent, you can only replant 400 acres, not even 400 hectares. I have always been talking about an outgrower scheme, which you also commended at the Planters Society AGM last year. So, we must look at a thing like that where the investment will be low because the worker is willing to invest his labour free of charge when you provide the raw materials for replanting. By doing so, I think during the next 10 years, we would be able to replant all the lands that have not been replanted and revive this industry.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, give me one moment. I am glad that the Hon. Minister of State Resources and Enterprise Development has decided to pay off the EPF dues though by cutting trees. A lot of people talked about the cutting of trees. But, we all know that these trees were planted for cutting some day. If it is being done in a proper way, under the required standards, then it should not be something that we should worry very much about.

The Hon. Minister of Parliamentary Affairs is not here. But, I wish to make a request from her that the insurance given to Members of Parliament be enhanced from Rs. 200,000 to Rs. 1 million so that even critical illnesses could be attended to by this insurance.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Then, the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. You have five minutes.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, I wish to strike a note of warning regarding certain wrong procedures observed in the House, which always slip our immediate attention, but which could cause disastrous consequences in the end.

2851 2852

Sir, we have the Standing Orders, numbering 142. Are we observing them wholly or are they being breached mostly? Sir, there is Standing Order No. 71: "Responsibility for Rules of Order". Sometimes, Hon. Members come here and berate the Executive and others, as they want. There is also Standing Order No. 73 - I referred to that yesterday when the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake was speaking - which states, I quote:

....... irrelevance or tedious repetition either of his own arguments or of the arguments used by other members in debate may direct the member to discontinue his speech.

Yesterday, we saw in this House a situation quite contrary to adhering to the Standing Orders. Every Member, either in the Opposition or in the Government, must be concerned about it. Some Members come with a piece of paper and berate the Hon. Prime Minister, referring to his conduct. He is the Prime Minister of this country. He is an honourable man, even the Maha Sangha has accepted that. From where do they bring these papers? This type of things have got to be checked and stopped immediately. I think even the Hon. John Amaratunga did that, joined by the Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera. Both "John" and "Joseph" - J and J - did that. Now, where are we leading to, Sir? Parliaments record these. We are a Commonwealth nation and a Commonwealth Parliament and these procedures should be observed strictly and wholly. Otherwise, procedures are not necessary and we could do whatever we want.

Then, Sir, today, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera said in this House, "Because of this, the Prime Minister has to resign and because of Dhammika Premalal Raigama, the President must resign". The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera says that Mr. Raigama is an adviser to the President. Utter falsehood! We pointed that out when he was speaking. There is no man by the name Dhammika Raigama in the Presidential Secretariat. Sir, I am saying authoritatively that I have been made to understand by Mr. Kumarasiri Hettige, who is the Coordinating Secretary to His Excellency the President in Parliament, that the names of 300 persons, who, from all corners, have been making use of the name of the President, have been handed over to the police. They might be making use of your name, Sir, and the names of other Ministers, which is all wrong. There are 300 such cases and the police is investigating thoroughly into those. Very soon, all those names will be published in the newspapers and the culprits, the people behind this, will be known to the whole country.

For whom was the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera speaking? He was speaking for the British Parliamentarians. Quite surprised, I asked him, "Are you a Member of the British Parliament or of this Parliament?" Or he might be an agent who gets paid from certain sections of the British Parliament in order to sling mud at the Hon. Members of this House and even at the

Executive. These have got to be dealt with through the Standing Orders, Sir. If we do not do that, what is the use of quoting Erskine May", the authority on Parliamentary Procedures and Practices? Otherwise, all those go in vain. Also, it is true that we can criticize the wrongdoings. After all, the Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera is also a former Speaker who would adhere to these procedures that I pointed out.

Sir, now there is a calculated conspiracy to destabilize this Government. That charge, I make, and maybe the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera is also a party to that. This has got to be checked in time. There is a concerted effort, an international conspiracy. All the 20 or so previous elections, the UNP could not win. Then, with regard to the war, they said, You cannot win the war. . ; .

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Give me a moment, Sir.

So, if we do not check this in time, I think we will be failing in our duty as Members of Parliament, who have to abide by the dictates of Parliament and its procedures.

Sir, I will say one last thing. Todays "Thinakkural" newspaper - I raised this as a matter of Privilege also - states, I quote: " - !

"

. . :

" .. ... .. ."

Sir, this gives a wrong connotation to the public. That is about the conduct of mine. Even you, yourself, Sir, have complained several times to me about this newspaper. I have been speaking, Sir, in this House on almost every subject, but nothing has been reported in this newspaper. But, they go on to pinpoint things like this.
