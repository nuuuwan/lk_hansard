( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, let the Hon. Sumanthiran also raise his concern so that you can answer him as well.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir. - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister, the Hon. Deputy Speaker wants me to raise my concern also so that you can answer that as well.

Sir, yesterday you announced the Determination of the Supreme Court on the Draft Bill presented to court saying that there was no inconsistency with the Constitution. But, you will see, Sir, that in several places in the Determination - at least three times - the Supreme Court has made suggestions for certain amendments. Actually, at the end, they should have said subject to those, it has no inconsistencies because those amendments have to be made as the court has made those suggestions particularly at page seven and so on. Those amendments will probably be moved at the Committee Stage, I understand. But, that needs to be discussed at a certain point. So, I support what

the Hon. Leader of the Opposition said, that even if you want to rush through it and have the Debate now, the Committee Stage must take place after a Consultative Committee is convened, and with the Commissioner of Elections, consider the Determination and suggestions of the Supreme Court in regard to the Bill. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Deputy Speaker, the issue of convening a Consultative Committee, in my opinion, does not arise because as far as the Supreme Court is concerned, it has been very clear in its Determination and whatever amendments that were proposed, will also be moved at the Committee Stage. We can, in detail, discuss it during the Debate and if questions need to be answered, we can answer those.

I must also assure the House that this Bill has not been prepared without the involvement of the Commissioner of Elections. He has been fully involved in the preparation of the Bill and these matters had been raised with him, not only by political parties but even others. I am sure, even Opposition political parties have had an interest in ensuring that the voting rights of all the people who are entitled to vote in an election would be available when it comes to an election. Therefore, it is a question of legitimacy of our electoral process and this Bill is only going to strengthen that.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Minister, if you listen to what our speakers say, you may have to call in the Commissioner of Elections. That is all I am telling you because we also want to ensure the legitimacy of the process. We are not raising issues like those raised by the Hon. Sumanthiran. But, on the ground, as to how this is going to operate there are some serious issues that have come up. So, at some stage, the Commissioner of Elections has to be consulted. Therefore, do not write off that opportunity because - [Interruption.] Listen to me. When the issues come up, you would not be able to answer those. Only the Commissioner of Elections can give answers to those. That is all. We know what is coming up, we only need that opportunity. We are not trying to block this in any way. ( ) (The Hon.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Then, I call upon the Hon. Rauff Hakeem.

( ) ( ) REGISTRATION OF ELECTORS (SPECIAL PROVISIONS) BILL . . Order for Second Reading read.

[2.21 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Hon. Deputy Speaker, this country has a proud record of having achieved adult franchise much before many other countries in the region. We have also had a similar achievement of having conducted periodic, regular democratic elections and, we have, in that process enabled everyone in the country to participate in the electoral process of the country. We find that, time and again, sometimes certain impediments which arise in the exercise of the franchise of the people, which is a basic right enshrined in any instrument as far as international obligations are concerned, is something that we have to hold paramount.

Sir, during the armed conflict which engulfed our country for over 30 years, a large number of civilians were forced to flee their places of permanent residence especially in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Such displaced families and individuals had abandoned their lands and properties and sought temporary residence and accommodation in other parts of Sri Lanka or were housed in camps in other parts of the country.

In terms of the Registration of Electors Act, No. 44 of 1980, an applicant for registration as an elector should have attained the age of 18 years and should be resident in an electoral district on the first day of June of each year to be registered as an elector in such electoral district. The address at which such applicant was ordinarily resident in an electoral district on the first day of June in any year is referred to as his qualifying address. Consequently, a significantly large number of internally displaced individuals from the Northern and Eastern Provinces find it difficult to comply with the requirement of a qualifying address in order to be registered as electors in such provinces.

This Bill permits those internally displaced citizens to vote in the electoral district in which they were resident prior to 2009, subject to three important postulates. Firstly, he must be an internally displaced person. Secondly, his name should appear in the register of

621 622

2013 06

electors for any electoral district in the Northern or Eastern Province for any year until the end of the year 2009. Thirdly, his name should not be entered in any register in operation subsequent to the year 2009. Together with that, it further enables the children of a citizen referred to above - (a) who had not attained the age of 18 years on the date on which such citizen became an internally displaced person or; (b) who were born after such citizen became an internally displaced person and have attained the age of 18 years or more on the date of operation of this Act and; (c) whose name has not been entered in any register in operation subsequent to the year 2009. These people are enabled to vote in the electoral district in which a citizen referred to above was permanently resident before the year 2009 on production of the birth certificate and a certificate issued by the Grama Niladhari of the area in which he is presently residing in proof of the matters specified in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above.

As you know, Hon. Deputy Speaker, in the past when there were difficulties in people reaching their original areas of residence during the period of conflict, there was a provision enabling the voters to exercise their vote from the district in which they were displaced. There were provisions in the Parliamentary Elections Act, which enabled those displaced voters to vote for a district from which they were displaced from another district where a special polling booth had been set up for them. This is a little bit different from that procedure. Now that the country has totally been emancipated from all violent activity that the writ of the Government runs to every part of the country, we are in a situation where we have to bring into operation the normal laws of the country. When doing that, this requirement of having to prove their domicile, to show a qualifying address, is an impediment to some of those people who are yet to resettle in their original areas.

This is why this particular Bill is being presented and I must say that the Supreme Court itself very carefully examined this Bill and found it not to be in conflict with any provisions of the Constitution. Going further, it also went to the extent of saying that this is in accordance with the National Human Rights Action Plan of the Government which has been brought in keeping with the Universal Periodic Review which took place in Geneva where we have given our pledge to the international community that the internally displaced people in the country would be fully entitled to all their rights. So, in a sense, we are fulfilling one of our international obligations through the enactment of this Bill.

Sir, this Bill ultimately will envisage provision of a Supplementary Register to be compiled. I am sure the questions that the Opposition has in mind, perhaps arise about the manner in which this Supplementary Register is to be prepared within a short period of time and this is where, perhaps, the Hon. Members of the Opposition and

other political parties want to have this matter clarified with the Commissioner of Elections. I am sure the Commissioner of Elections will be available to clarify those matters even in his office. It is not necessary for him to be coming to Parliament to explain this to Members of political parties. It is very customary for the Commissioner of Elections to meet and receive secretaries of political parties and leaders of political parties in his office and clarify matters, and this, for all purposes, have been agreed upon with him and there had been several rounds of discussions before the Bill finally was presented to the House.

The Registering Officer prepares a list of names of persons referred to above and publishes a notice in the Gazette -

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Minister, may I seek a clarification? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Shall we do that after I finish? ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) I want a clarification on the Supplementary Register. What measures and what machineries have you put in place to ensure that the formulation of this Supplementary Register will be done in an authentic and transparent manner so that there will not be any mischievous activities to include and exclude certain citizens of our country according to the whims and fancies of political parties? What transparent machinery and methodologies have you adopted to ensure transparency and propriety?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Deputy Speaker, it is the Commissioner of Elections who will set up that machinery. In the past too, this type of exercise had been carried out. I must say during the Hon. Sajith Premadasas fathers time, when the residual citizens were deprived of their citizenship in the Ceylon Citizenship Act, those upcountry Tamils, a similar Supplementary Register was made available and we are following the same procedure. The enactment of this Act follows the similar provisions that were there in the Supplementary Register that was compiled in 1989, when your father was the President, under Section 17A of the Registration of Electors Act, No. 44 of 1980. - [Interruption.]

Yes, there is an impending election but all people will be given time to object or to appeal. All provisions are available and one weeks time period will be given for

623 624

these people to submit their applications and that announcement will be made by the Commissioner of Elections in all the prominent news media so that people will be notified and they will be able to get themselves registered. This process in the past had been carried out in a different manner, as I told previously, where they were able to exercise their vote from the places of displacement. Now they have to - of course, this is slightly different - go to their original areas and vote. But, since they have not got a permanent place of domicile in those areas, they are having this difficulty of proving their qualifying address and that is why a significant number of people are getting left out and this is to provide facilities for those people to exercise their franchise like others.

In this process, we will also see that a person who has applied to be registered and whose name has not appeared in the list referred to above may appeal in writing to the Registering Officer within one week of the notice being published in the Gazette. If, after inquiry, the Registering Officer decides not to include the name of such person in the supplementary register, the aggrieved appellant may appeal to the revising officer within one week of such decision. No person whose name appears in the Supplementary Register shall have his name entered in any other register of electors. This is to prevent any fraud of people duplicating their votes while having their name in another register. If a person uses his vote in two or more electoral districts, he shall be guilty of an offence and that too is being provided for. Any person who furnishes false information or forged documents shall be guilty of an offence and the Act shall be in operation for a period of two years and may be extended for further periods of two years by the Minister by Order published in the Gazette. Such Order should be placed before Parliament within three months from the date of publication.

As I explained, Hon. Deputy Speaker, this Bill is being brought in particularly with a view to enable those significant number of voters who may be left out of the electoral register in 2012. The electoral register that has been compiled and which is to come in for revision from the 1st of June this year, is now available for inspection. If those people who find their names not in that register can prove that they were original residents of the Northern or Eastern Province prior to 2009 and that their names have not been registered in an electoral register after 2009, they will be entitled to get their names included in this Supplementary Register. This is a very simple provision which enables the voters who may find themselves being left out of the electoral register for the simple reason that they do not have a qualifying address to show their original place of displacement.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) What you are saying is that those who are disenfranchised at prior elections will be enfranchised. Is that what you are saying?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, it is not so. The people who have already exercised their vote at prior elections where they had this facility of voting from the place of displacement will now be able to go back to their areas on the voting day and vote despite the fact that they are living elsewhere. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) But, why are you all in a hurry to do this? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) We are not in a hurry. This country has always followed the principle of enabling every citizen to vote at an election and that goes to the very legitimacy of the electoral process and we are only enabling that legitimate right of a displaced person to exercise his vote. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) What we are concerned about is that this is not a fraudulent process. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Certainly not. This is a very open, transparent procedure and you can clarify matters from the Commissioner of Elections if necessary. The secretary of your political party and the leaders of political parties can always meet the Commissioner of Elections and clarify matters and he had given his careful consideration to this fact.

Originally, he was not willing to give accommodation for those people who could not show a place of residence and, therefore, a large number of people were deprived of their voting right to their original district.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) That is what I say. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) What happened consequently was, those people decided to register themselves in the district in which

625 626

[ ]

2013 06

they were already displaced. Therefore, those people will be disentitled. They will be now becoming voters in the districts in which they have decided to apply for. Those people will not be entitled to apply again to vote in these areas. A significant number has already registered themselves in areas like Puttalam. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) So, there will not be double counting? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Certainly not because those names will be carefully struck off and also there is an affidavit that they will have to submit. So, if there is a complaint -

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) A suspicion is generated because this whole process is taking place with an impending election.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I must say that you must have the confidence in the Commissioner of Elections as he is an independent officer. He has proved time and again his integrity when it comes to electoral process. In my opinion, he has been an officer aboveboard when it comes to such issues. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) We have no qualms about the integrity. We are worried about political interference in the whole process.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) We are not involved in this. The moment this Bill is passed, it is the responsibility of the Commissioner of Elections. No politicians will get involved in the process except to go and educate the people about the right that are being made available for them to apply. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Minister, if you are so keen on having a very authentic, independent, free and fair election, why do you not propose in the Cabinet to ensure that the Independent Commissions are in place so that this election is done in a very authentic, transparent, free and fair manner. Why do you not do that? If you are talking in such a laudable manner about the propriety of this process, why do you

not propose an independent Police Commission, an independent Election Commission, and an Independent Judicial Service Commission?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Member, I have presented the Bill and as far as the independence of the electoral process in this country is concerned, I am sure this debate has gone on for many years. You will really vouch for the fact that we have had free and fair elections in this country for a long period of time. Whenever there had been certain incidents and when it had been brought to light, people had ultimately exercised their right to throw out those governments which engaged in any electoral malpractices.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) But, why are you so hesitant about the Independent Commissions?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Therefore, this Government is not attempting to do any electoral malpractice through this process and this is totally in the hand - ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) But, why are you prevaricating about the Independent Commissions?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) There is no prevarication. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) There is a lot of prevarication and hesitancy and a lot of stammering.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The Commissioner of Elections, as far as we are concerned, is quite independent and his independence is guaranteed by the Constitutional provisions which are now providing for that independence. Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Not with the Eighteenth Amendment being implemented.

() .. ( ) ( () .. - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Presiding Member, I would like to respond briefly to some of the points that were made by the Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera. He is definitely correct in the assumption he made; that this law applies not to people who are outside the shores of Sri Lanka but to people who are resident within the Island. I think there is a very clear and cogent reason for that. Those who left the province where they were earlier settled and who have decided to seek a future for themselves in a foreign land are not really entitled, either morally or ethically, to vote in a Sri Lankan election because their nexus with this country has been severed with their families, they have decided to establish a future in a foreign country, seek employment and to bring up their children there. So, their sense of obligation is not to this country. In those circumstances, it would hardly be satisfactory to allow them to exercise the right of franchise. The right of franchise is one of the most cherished democratic rights and freedoms.

635 636

Indeed, the Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera, as a Member of this House of several decades standing, would be aware that this is one of the basic obligations imposed on the Legislature by the Constitution. Article 101 sets out the duties of Parliament and one of those duties is to make laws relating to electoral registers and the qualifications of people who will be entitled to vote. So, in exercising that discretion, this House should certainly make a distinction between those people who are going to live here, who are going to contribute to this country and those who have decided, for whatever reason, to sever their link with this country and to go abroad. So, the Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera is certainly correct in saying that this law does not apply to those who are abroad and, in my view, it should not.

Then, the Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera also asked a question to which there is a clear answer and the answer is found in the actual provisions of the Bill that is now the subject of discussion in this House. He asked, taking the example of someone who had been, let us say, in the Northern Province earlier and who is now resident in Puttalam - he took the example of Puttalam - Now, where would this person vote after this law comes into force, would it be in Puttalam or in the North? The answer is very clearly found in this law. That is, the person concerned would have to prove that he has been resident in the province where he now wishes to vote at some point prior to 2009. So, there is a terminal point that is defined by the law of 2009, but not a year from which the period is to be counted because there are people who have been driven out of the Northern Province, for example, many years ago. We do not really recognize this distinction that is familiar in the NGO terminology between old IDPs and new IDPs. IDPs are IDPs. Certainly, I remember in my school days, there were lots of Sinhalese who were resident in the Northern Province. In fact, many people used to go there on vacation. Many of the bakeries in and around Jaffna were owned by Sinhalese but that position changed. Today, there are a very few Sinhalese living in the Northern Province.

The decision was, therefore, taken deliberately that it would be wrong to specify a starting point. So, there is no starting point. There is only the ending point and the ending point is 2009. So, I would like to tell the distinguished Member of the Opposition, the Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera, if he would be kind enough to look at Section 2 of this Law, the conditions are spelt out with exemplary clarity. This law is entitled to benefit a person who has had his name in the Register of Electors of the Northern Province or the Eastern Province at some time prior to 2009 and he must also show that his name does not occur in any register in operation subsequent to the year 2009.

So, in the example taken by my Friend, if the voter is resident in Puttalam and if his name is entered in the

Register of Puttalam, he cannot make use of this law. So, that question does not arise. The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera said there is confusion here; where would he actually vote? Would he vote in Jaffna or in Puttalam? If his name is entered in the Register in Puttalam, he cannot vote in Jaffna. He can take advantage of this law only if his name has not been entered in any register subsequent to the year 2009. Again, there is a reason for that. It is not arbitrary; it is not capricious and it is not done to win an election by unfair means. There is a very sound policy reason for that. In the example taken by my Friend, the voter is actually a resident of -

. ( . ) (The Hon. P. Harrison)

. . rose.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Please do not interrupt me because I am developing a point. - [Interruption.] First, I will deal with this point and then you can ask me whatever question you wish.

In the example that you gave, Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera, this person is resident in Puttalam and his name occurs in the Puttalam Register. The number of voters in Puttalam is taken into account in determining the number of Members of Parliament who can be returned from that district. That would apply to the Hon. M. Joseph Michael Pereras district. How many Members of Parliament can be returned from the Gampaha District? That will depend on the number of voters in that district. The number of people who had been in the North at some time and who are now resident in Puttalam, whose names occur in the Puttalam Register, is taken into account in computing the number of Members of Parliament who can be returned from that area.

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) It changed the ethnic ratio. That is what happened. That is why they lost one or two Members of Parliament from that area. That is a mistake. Is that not so?

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) But, how can you prevent that?

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) That is the thing. You must allow them to go there. Give back their lands.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) But, the demographic composition of a country will change from time to time. You cannot freeze it artificially. How can you do that? In the first place, it is impractical. Even if you want to do it, it cannot be done. Secondly, it is wrong to do that. One of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of this country is to choose one's place of residence. I can live in Jaffna if I want to. Nobody can stop me. So, how can you then say that if I live in Jaffna, I am interfering with the demographic composition of the Northern Province and therefore I should be prevented from living in Jaffna? That is a denial of my fundamental right. That is not possible. These changes will occur over time. Surely, it is not only in the Northern Province but also in many other parts of the country the demographic profile changes. I am sure in your areas also the demographic profile changes. It is a natural process; it cannot be stopped. - [Interruption.] Yes, Hon. P. Harrison, you wanted to ask me a question.

. . . ? All that a person had to do was to declare that he regarded Sri Lanka as his home; he had no intention of going to India; he had no intention of applying for an Indian passport. That was the essential basis on which franchise was conceded to no fewer than 500,000 persons who did not have the right to franchise even after the Sirima-Shastri Pact was entered into. That was the purpose and the objective of Act, No. 10 of 1989.

, . .

Security is an overriding consideration for a country which has paid such an exorbitant price for violence. How many thousands of people, including your own father, were killed? You cannot blame a Government for putting security in the forefront of the considerations which apply.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) I totally understand your contention. National security must be given priority but in the name of national security, you cannot go on a specific programme of evicting people from those areas without compensation.

643 644

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Here the disagreement is, you are saying that it is done for a wrong purpose with extraneous motives. You have to concede the fact that there has been a shrinking of these areas. What you are saying is not enough. There are genuine security considerations relating to the Kankesanthurai, Palaly area.-[Interruption.] Compensation is a different issue. The Hon. Joseph Michael Perera's contention was that they must have the right to go back to the same place.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Hon. Minister, I need a clarification.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Yes, please.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Hon. Minister, this is about 6,381 acres of land. It is almost two-thirds of the Colombo Municipality area. Thirty five thousand people vacated that area. For what purpose? Maybe, as you said, for defence purposes. But, you are putting up golf clubs, golf grounds, theatres and hotels. Are all these for security purposes? Remember, these 35,000 people who belonged to that area had been displaced for the last 24 years. They thought that they could go back to their own area but now you are saying because of security purposes, they have to still be in some other places. Half of them are fishermen. They do not have a place to go. They have to do fishing. They cannot be put in the jungle to do their work but this is what is happening. Hon. Professor, you simply cannot justify by saying that security is very much important and that you would do this. As the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera said, according to the United Nations standards, you must allow them to go back to their original lands but you are not doing that. Four years after the war, why do you want to keep 150,000 forces in the Northern Province? Tell me.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, you have only two more minutes. - [Interruption.] Hon. Member, let the Hon. Minister answer.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Presiding Member, there is no United Nations document, I am aware of, which recognizes an

unqualified, absolute right to restitution of land that one's family was in possession of. That is not an absolute right. There are other supervening circumstances which might make the enjoyment of that right impossible. In those circumstances, compensation is available. All I am saying is this. This is essentially a Debate on the provisions of this law, not on the whole range of matters that are now being raised in this Debate. But, the rationale underpinning this law is very clear. There has been an involuntary movement of population from the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Nobody can deny that. People did not leave because they wished to leave. They were forced to leave at gunpoint. If you want proof of that, on the 30th of October 1990, Muslim families were asked to gather in Usmaniya College. They were told to leave Jaffna in two hours' time. There are many such instances. There is no point in going into details about all of those instances.

I do not think anybody contests or challenges these essential facts. People were terrorized and forced to leave. If you are talking about areas where they lived for long periods -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, please wind up now. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Yes, Sir. The whole point of this is to give people the right of franchise in circumstances where they wish to vote in a place where they lived earlier and a place which they were forced to leave at gunpoint. Here is an opportunity for them to go back and use their franchise in the place to which they belong. Sir, I will take another five to seven minutes of the Governments time. There is something else that I wish to say - [Interruption.] No, I cannot because there are things which I need to say for the Government.

I wish to make this point. The Government, in dealing with this very complex situation, has acted according to a certain sequence. That is, we started with the humanitarian considerations relating to people who had been displaced. The Hon. Joseph Michael Perera asked, "Why do you not resettle these 296,000 people?". That was the number that we started with and there has been very substantial progress. That process has been almost completed. The demining was completed.

Then, the reintegration into society of ex-combatants; that has been done. They were provided with programmes of training. All of that has been done.

Then, I also want to say that the funds, the resources, committed by the Government to the development of infrastructure in the Northern Province is

645 646

2013 06

disproportionate to the size of the area. That is, the Government has made a colossal effort to develop highways, railroad systems, all of that and to generate employment by giving loans to the small and medium sector in order to enable people who had suffered so much over a long period to have access to livelihoods and incomes. In other words, to breathe new life and energy into the economy of the Northern Province and even people who are critical of the Government, who visited that area. For example, during the meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, when they came back to Colombo said, "we have to admit in a spirit of candour that a great deal has happened with regard to economic development in that area". That cannot be disputed. That is a vivid contrast with the kind of lives that these people lived in that part of the country as recently as four years ago. So, there was a certain sequence, a certain structure.

You start with the humanitarian considerations - [Interruption.] Hon. Member, whatever you do with regard to reconciliation if you do not address the economic issues, reconciliation is not going to be successful.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) There is an unfair bias in favour of infrastructure development and livelihood development has been given second priority.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) But, the two things are connected. What about the agricultural economy of the North? To take the goods to the market place, connectivity with other parts of the country, all that is dependent on road systems and railways. So, you cannot divorce the two things. They are intertwined.

Then, I want to make this point and I will stop there. What is now happening is exciting by any standard. Just take as an example, access into the vast markets of the People's Republic of China. The Government has been able to arrive at an agreement in principle with China. Sri Lankas exports will find their way into the markets of China. This is particularly important with regard to our apparel products, with regard to tea, with regard to our gems and jewellery.

Sri Lanka, in any case, does not depend on aid now. We do not want aid because our per capita income is fast approaching US Dollars 3,000. So, what we want is access to markets because our country has produced global leaders in sectors like tea and in apparel. Companies like Dilmah, Brandix, MAS Holdings, Omega Line can compete with the best in any part of the world. Now, we are giving the opportunity to those companies to access the vast markets of China.

So, we now have access into both India and China and it is a matter of great importance to the Government of Mahinda Rajapaksa to ensure that these benefits are not confined to a minuscule segment of the people.

We want to be fair by the people of the Northern Province and the proof of it is that at a political cost, we have spent a disproportionate amount of money on the development of the Northern Province because we recognize that the people of that area have suffered so much during the last 30 years. I do not mind telling you, in a spirit of frankness, Hon. Presiding Member, that there are Members of the Government who are asking, Why are you spending all these there? There is no political benefit there. Why do you not spend this money on disadvantaged regions in the South? But, His Excellency President Rajapaksa has said, No, I am going to do it because it is the right and proper thing to do. So, we want to be fair by the people of this country and this is beneficial legislation. This is expanding the contours of the franchise and this is why the House should give its unreserved support to this Bill.

I thank you, Sir. [.. 3.30]

Therefore, I say that the Opposition and the entire parties in the Opposition are in a confused state of affairs. Traditionally, what they want is to oppose every Bill the Government brings in. They want to oppose this Bill also whereas they have to welcome it. We are going to have an election. Come on! You are asking for an election; the UNP is asking for an election. TNA, do you want an election or not?

Yesterday or the day before, in a TV programme, the Hon. Suresh Premachandran was saying, Diaspora, yes. Let them come and help us. We want help from them. Now, see! the secret is out. You want to have a deal with the diaspora. Get all the assistance of the Muslims in the Eastern Province somehow or other. You will never do that in this world.

'' - '' . Then, create an Eelam there. Yesterday, Sir, somewhere in the Andhra Pradesh in the South of India, Jaya TV and all the TVs were telecasting - . . , . . . . ? . , .

From time to time, from the times of the colonial rulers, there had been commissions in this country. There

had been delimitation commissions. First, there was the Colebrooke Commission. Then, the Manning Commission, the Donoughmore Commission and lastly, the Soulbury Commission. There had been a delimitation commission called Thalgodapitiya Commission. I also had the privilege of going before that Commission under the great leadership of the late Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel of the All-Ceylon Muslim League at that time. Sir, now I want to ask one question from them. Do you want an election in the North or not? Will the TNA particularly answer this question?

I raised a question about Katchatheevu in this House. This land does not belong to them. This land belongs to us; This land belongs to the Sinhalese; this land belongs to the Tamils and this land belongs to the Muslims, the Burghers, the Malays, the Memons, the Borahs and others. Now, we have that. That is what I told you yesterday in this House.

Hon. Members, at least understand the reality. We have the full confidence in the Commissioner of Elections. He has done his job very well. He has come under praise by all parties. That is a foregone conclusion. Therefore, you need not fear. The Leader of the Opposition was mourning in the morning. What was he saying? He said, Let us consult the Commissioner of Elections; he is there. Let us go and discuss. He must understand the simple basic principles of Parliamentary procedure. You cannot get the Commissioner of Elections or any commissioner inside the House when Parliamentary Business has started. Now, this is an instrument of Parliament. This is a Bill that is being moved.

I went there during the election time. They had no electricity, no schools, no maternity homes and no roads. All those facilities have now been provided by us. The other day, the Hon. Susantha Punchinilame opened a primary school there. Hon. Sampanthan, you call yourself the leader of the TNA - touch your conscience and see the suffering of the Thennamaravadi people alone.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, Hon. Leader of the House of Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , . . . . , - Consultative Committee - , . [5.53 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Sir, we have heard many speeches today and Hon. Members of Parliament have expressed their views on the Registration of Electors (Special Provisions) Bill, which is specifically meant to exempt the Internally Displaced Persons from certain requirements of the Registration of Electors Act, No. 44 of 1980.

Now, we have to consider these provisions very carefully and I think we have debated this vividly. It is important to note that in this context where an election is going to be held for the Northern Provincial Council, many Tamils who had been displaced in the Northern Province are just coming for resettlement. So, at this stage, asking them to enter into a register and get themselves registered is not a practical aspect. We have no objection as far as any Sinhalese, a Muslim or any other party -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair.

691 692

, .

, , .

Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER took the Chair.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) We have no objection whatsoever for even a Sinhalese, a Muslim or anyone to come and inhabit Jaffana but the position remains that there should not be a forcible way of getting them to stay in Jaffna by some other means. If a person wants to go and stay in Jaffna, it is perfectly okay. He is at liberty to do so. It is like my going to Kandy and staying there or my going to Galle and staying there. That is entirely a civic right which is fundamentally placed in the Constitution of this country. But, what is happening today is that most of the people who have been displaced have not come to places where they should be and thousands of acres of land in the Northern Province have been taken over for army camps.

As far as the security of this country is concerned, as the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris has just mentioned, security is a must in this country and I totally agree with that. Security of this country is important but, at the moment, there is a tremendous amount of army camps in all parts of the Northern Province and the Eastern Province. I do not see why it should be further strengthened and for that purpose, you are using 6,381 acres of valuable land that has been taken over by the Government for the security forces. There are another 3,000 acres being intended to be taken for the Cement Corporation and there are so many other places that have been taken over by the Government for the purpose of rehabilitation. If all this is happening by force - The Government is trying to resettle people. I have to make it very clear in this august Assembly that I have nothing personal against the Sinhalese or any other community as such. But, what I want to say is that we cannot, by force, go into another part of the country and place ourselves in the Northern Province which has got certain inhabitants who have the right to live as Tamils of this country and to practise their language, their culture and religion. - [Interruption.]Yes, Hon. Member, I totally agree with you but what I am trying to emphasize is that the Northern Province has got the Malabar inhabitants who have got a certain amount of culture. Definitely, as I said earlier, the Sinhalese community is entitled to go and stay there. They can willingly go and stay there. They can buy houses; they can buy lands. That is perfectly in order but you cannot take over lands in Jaffna forcibly because there are people who are entitled to those lands. But, those lands are being taken over by the Government and people are going and staying there forcibly.

( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) You did not say a single word when the LTTE took over.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) LTTE has nothing to do with this transaction. ( ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena) Why not? You were part of all that and now you are saying that they have nothing to do with this.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) LTTE has not taken any land. [Interruption.] I am not interested in what you are saying. But, my position in this august Assembly is that we cannot forcibly take over lands and give it to another community and, for that purpose, we are trying to get ourselves mobilized in that way. In Mullaitivu, Kokilai, Varnakulam, Thattamavalattu, Marthamadu, Akkaraivalli, in all these areas, there are about 3,000 from the Sinhalese community who are radically staying there. They were all sent by force, not by their own whims and fancies. That is what I am trying to say. Even in Vavuniya and Settikulam, about 4,000 acres have been taken over by the Government for resettlement. So, these are matters to be considered. In Sampur, about 818 acres and 30-year leased properties have also been taken over. There is about 545 acres of land belonging to the Ceylon Electricity Board which is going to be given back to the Ceylon Electricity Board.

In these circumstances, there are large extents of land in the Northern Province that have been taken over. The Tamil inhabitants who are entitled to those lands in that area cannot enjoy those lands when you are trying to do this. In these circumstances, with this amount of agony prevailing in the Northern Province, you are bringing this Bill today to have a new electoral system to register the people who are going to vote in this election. What is the real objective of this whole transaction? Why are you concentrating only on the Northern Province? You have not brought this type of Bill for any other elections. You have not brought this type of Bill for the election in the Western Province, Southern Province or for elections in any other province in this country. So, why are you now concentrating basically, as far as the Tamil community is concerned, on the Northern Province? From 1987, we have been trying to establish this Provincial Council system in the Northern Province but it has been a complete failure. We could not have a democratic system

693 694

2013 06

in Jaffna, especially in the Northern Province. The Government is just trying to have an election. Hopefully, the Government is considering to hold elections in the month of September. But, before the election is going to be held, you are making this mockery. We have no objection for a proper electoral register being maintained and all the displaced people who are entitled to vote should be in a position to vote. That is a fundamental human right in this country. But, why are you doing it in a rush? This same provision can be brought in for the next General Election or for the Presidential Election or for any other election, subsequently. You can take it into consideration in a better way. My personal view in regard to this matter is that within a period of two months, you cannot force this system upon the general public in the Northern Province to get themselves registered and make themselves available to vote. Therefore, there is some suspicious element in this whole transaction. I am not trying to convince and say that the Government is trying to connive to do this. If you look at it in a general point of view, locally or internationally - you are not worried about what the international community considers - these are factors to be considered even internationally because human rights organizations or others may question as to why you are going to do this fundamentally targeting the election that is going to be held very soon.

My earnest request is that as far as this Government is concerned, even if we have to bring this amendment, please do not bring this amendment at this stage. Let this amendment be considered later. This is a very good amendment that you are bringing on behalf of the people who have been displaced; people who have the right to vote but had not been given the right to exercise their franchise. I totally agree with this Bill and I totally, vehemently agree that this is a Bill that should be considered but not at this stage, not in this context, not within a period of two months where the Northern Provincial Council Election is hopefully going to be held in the month of September.

Therefore, it is our duty to tell the present Government that we should not forcibly take any person from one place to another place, from one province to another province by force and keep them in that area for the sake of doing so. That is not the will of the people. If you do that, you are going against the fundamental rights of the people of this country. That is why the international community is watching our act. Therefore, we should be careful to modify ourselves accordingly and we hope that this Government will accept that position.

Thank you. [.. 6.03]

Madam Chair, I would begin by recalling a very historic moment. With the dawn of tomorrow, we, as

705 706

[ ]

2013 06

Members in this House, are going to remember a historic event of great importance. That is, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa took oath in this House for the first time on 7th June, 1970. Before participating in the Adjournment Motion, I have a duty to say a few words about that eventful occasion. It is through entering and making exit of this Parliament and getting involved in the social fabric, working for the toiling masses, the farmers and , as you say, by winning the love of the people, affection of the people and the confidence of the people, that His Excellency the President has now been installed as the most respected President of this little Island of ours.
