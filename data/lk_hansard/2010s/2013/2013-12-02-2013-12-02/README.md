( ) (The Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. You have 50 minutes.

[10.33 a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me the opportunity to speak at the Committee Stage Discussion. I am also particularly happy to follow the Hon. Prime Minister, who is well-renowned in the country for his oratorical skills and although in the last year or so, we did not see him at his brilliant best, I am glad that today he gave us a glimpse of his former abilities and I want to wish him well, wish him full recovery and long life.

I did not want to interrupt the Hon. Prime Minister, but there are a few things that he said in his speech just now, which needs to be noted and corrected. He mentioned that the Parliamentary Council also includes a Member of the TNA. I am afraid that that is not correct. There is no Member of the TNA in the Parliamentary Council. We refused to participate in that. So, that statement of the Hon. Prime Minister, I am afraid, is factually incorrect and needs to be put right.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan is there. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) He is not from the TNA. You know that.

He also stated that appointments that are ratified by the Parliamentary Council are just and reasonable and have been accepted to be so by everyone in the country and indeed by the international community as well. That is also not quite correct. The Parliamentary Council came under sharp criticism for the appointment of the Chief Justice when there was no vacancy. This has been sharply criticized by several renowned jurists around the world. The Hon. John Amaratunga, in his opening speech today, referred to the two independent opinions that were sought and obtained by the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Mr. Kamalesh Sharma with regard to the impeachment of the Chief Justice, and both those reports by renowned jurists, Sir Jeffrey Jowell and Justice Pius Langa were sharply critical of that. This issue has received much attention. Even in the letter written to His Excellency the President in February this year by the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, who, all of us know, bends his back to accommodate the Government and is apologetical all the time for the acts of this Government. But, even he, in a letter, raised concerns about several of these matters including the appointment procedure. As recent as a week before the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Colombo, even Mr. Kamalesh Sharma when

33 34

questioned, said that the impeachment issue is still a matter that is pending and that the Government of Sri Lanka needs to take corrective action, but he contended that there is still time for that. What is the corrective action that can take place? What is the corrective action your own Kamalesh Sharma contemplates with regard to the legal impeachment of the Chief Justice? You need to address your mind to that.

Even those few people in the international community, most notably His Excellency Kamalesh Sharma, are still saying that these are issues which need to be addressed. Even those who speak for the Government do not concede that everything is happening the way it ought to in this country.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. The Hon. Member is saying that she was illegally removed. It was done according to the Constitution. The Motion was passed by Parliament. Sir, you were presiding over it. So, he is only challenging the sovereignty and the independence of Parliament. But, it was done according to the Constitution.

( ) (The Chairman) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Azwer, please do not disturb.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I referred to the independent opinions obtained by His Excellency Kamalesh Sharma, which he hid and which came to light and he could not deny the existence of those two independent reports. Those two independent reports contend that this impeachment was illegal. That is all I said. If you have not read them, please read Jeffrey Jowell's Report and former Chief Justice of South Africa, Pius Langas Report. - [Interruption.] If you read and are able to understand the contents, you will know what I am talking about.

Sir, the point I am making is that all is not well in this so-called "democracy" of ours. When I speak on the Votes or the Estimates of His Excellency the President, I want to bring to focus the whole issue with regard to governance that afflicts this country today, which has been noted by even persons who are our friends and who want to help us. Leave aside the ones that you are attacking and saying that they are enemies, they have their own agendas and so on. What about your own friends? Hot on the heels of the conclusion of the

CHOGM, was a statement emanating from your closest friend China, that Sri Lanka must address the human rights concerns. Why did China say that? What was the imperative? Even the countries that attended the CHOGM - as the Hon. Member from Gampaha pointed out, it was one of the lowest attendance in terms of Heads of Government ever in the history of the Commonwealth - came with an apology that they are coming so that they can raise these issues.

Why should our country face this kind of indignity? Sir, we do not want our country to face this kind of indignity. But, why are those persons compelled to say that? Now, you might say, well, the Tamil diaspora is motivating all these people to say it. Is there a Tamil diaspora in China? I want to ask you. - [Interruption.] There are serious concerns, Hon. Dilan Perera, you know that and that is why these countries are raising it. We will do well not to spurn those, but to look at ourselves inwardly, examine ourselves honestly and put right those matters. I am not saying that we should condemn our own country. No, we should not. But, if there is something wrong, we ourselves must put it right. There are several of these issues that have been highlighted, that have been set out and made very clear. The Government of Sri

Lanka - [Interruption.]

( ( - , ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera - Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare) You are joking. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, I am not joking, Hon. Minister. Your own Government has given undertakings. Why does your Government give undertakings that they will put these things right if there was no need to do that? - [Interruption.] You do all of that and then, willy-nilly violate it. - [Interruption.] Yes, of course, we do that. I will tell you the reason why we do that. - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister, you say that you are losing your votes because you have stood for devolution. The Hon. Dilan Perera recently made a public speech saying that he is now losing votes because he stood for devolution.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) I was referring to your Colleague's statement on Maaveerar Day. I wanted to say that you also did not condemn his statement, but you also took part on Maaveerar Day. Who killed your good leader, the Hon. Amirthalingam?

35 36

[ ]

2013 02

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I made my speech last Friday and made myself very clear.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Who killed the Hon. (Dr.) Neelan Tiruchelvam? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, I need not repeat myself; I made myself very clear last Friday when I spoke. The Hon. Minister is asking a question, "Who killed the Hon. (Dr.) Neelan Tiruchelvam?" You all know that the LTTE killed the Hon. (Dr.) Neelan Tiruchelvam. - [Interruption.] I have made my position very clear; that is an act that needs to be condemned. Not only the assassination of the Hon. (Dr.) Neelan Tiruchelvam, but also several other assassinations and attacks on civilians and Sinhala political leaders that the LTTE carried out, all of those are condemnable and I condemn those again. If you want me to say it again and again, I will say it again and again. -

[Interruption.]

But, that does not give you an excuse to move away from the things that you must do right. When you brought the war to an end, you gave an undertaking to the international community. His Excellency the President, whose Votes we are discussing today, signed a Joint Communiqu on the 26th of May, 2009. Why did he do that with the Secretary-General of the UN, in which he gave three specific undertakings? None of those undertakings have been fulfilled even to date. This is a matter of regret. This, we are discussing in-house, amongst ourselves and I am pointing out and asking the question, "Why has His Excellency the President not carried out the undertakings that he voluntarily gave?" He gave the undertakings to the Secretary-General of the United Nations in Colombo on 26th May, 2009. One of those undertakings is that every person who was displaced as a result of the war will be resettled in their own place before December, 2009. This is in writing, signed by His Excellency the President. Why has that not been done?

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) You know that landmines - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) So, are you saying that His Excellency the President did not know that before December, 2009 the landmines

cannot be removed? - [Interruption.] Now, we are in 2013. We are at the end of 2013, four years after the deadline given by your own President. - [Interruption.] You are demeaning your own President. - [Interruption.]I suggest, Hon. Minster, that you keep quiet because you are demeaning your own President when you speak like this. You are saying that your President did not know what he was talking about. You are saying that your President signed that Joint Communiqu without knowing what he was signing. - [Interruption.] This is a treacherous act. You must be careful. You will be treated as a traitor if you continue to speak like this. - [Interruption.] Not by us, but your own ruling regime will consider you a traitor. So, you be careful.

The second undertaking that was given was that there were already allegations of violations of international human rights laws and international humanitarian laws and His Excellency the President undertook that there will be an independent inquiry into them. Where is that inquiry? Four years later, we are still talking about setting up this, setting up that, counting by the Census Department, Commission to Investigate Missing Persons headed by Maxwell Paranagama, and then Human Rights Commission is talking about having another inquiry into allegations of torture. On the 5th of May, 2010 - the Minister of External Affairs is here and, therefore, I can say this - it was the Minister of External Affairs who spoke in this House and announced the appointment of a commission, and in his speech he specifically mentioned the phrase, Truth and Reconciliation Commission. He said it will be in the lines of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa and Chilcot Commission. These two were mentioned by the Hon. Minister of External Affairs. I remember this very clearly because I responded to it on the next day, on the 6th of May - that was my first speech in Parliament - and I welcomed any commission that is asked to unravel the truth. But, what eventually came out was not a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, it was called the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. The word Truth was left out not only in the title, even in the mandate. Now, four years later, you are talking abut another Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Why is this? Why have all the undertakings voluntarily given by no less a person than His Excellency the President himself to no less a person than the Secretary-General of the United Nations, been violated? Now, when that is the state of affairs, why are you complaining that the world is against you? The Hon. Minister of External Affairs goes around crying saying, We are being treated badly", "Why is Sri Lanka being targeted?". Will somebody not ask questions if we do not carry out the voluntary undertakings we ourselves have given, our own President, the Executive President, has given and not carried them out? Why were those given and why are they not being carried out? This is an appropriate moment to raise this question. Now, you cannot blame other people for it. You gave the undertakings and, I say with responsibility, if some of

37 38

those things were done, we will not be in a position that we are in today.

We will not have given space to extremists on both sides. I want to tell the Minister, Hon. Dilan Perera this. I know how moderate you are in your views. I welcome that. I know how supportive you are of the process of devolution et cetera. I understand your frustration. But, my contention is that, it is only because even the undertakings voluntarily given on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka are not being carried out that extremism is growing on both sides. I will be fair; I concede that there is extremism growing on our side as well and that is as much a concern for us as it is for you. Believe me; that is as much a concern for us as it is for you. But, the problem is, how do we contain this, how do we answer to our people who ask the question, All right, all these assurances were given. The Government spoke about the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment and going beyond that and making devolution meaningful. What do we have today? Have we even got full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment? No. These are joint statements. Hon. Minister of External Affairs is here. He made a joint statement with the Hon. Minister of External Affairs of India in June, 2011. This is a phrase that was used: Full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and building upon it so as to achieve meaningful devolution". What is meant by that? If that assurance was given in 2011, in end 2013 do we still have that? Why do we not have that? If you need time to do that, very well, that is also possible; we will be patient.

( ( - , ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara - Minister of National Languages and Social Integration) There is a Select Committee on that. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will come to the Select Committee. Do not talk about the Select Committee, Hon. Minister. There are undertakings. I am glad that the Hon. Minister of External Affairs is here because he was privy to all of those agreements. He was a member of the Government team that negotiated with the Tamil National Alliance and he knows that on the 16th of September, 2011, - it was minuted and which minute was confirmed on the 20th of October, 2011 - the agreement that we came to with regard to the Parliamentary Select Committee. Now, that has not been done. We have never said, Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, that we will not come to the Parliamentary Select Committee. In fact, the Hon. Leader of the House will attest the fact that we participated in the drafting of

the Terms of Reference to the Parliamentary Select Committee and it was our draft that was eventually agreed to in toto on the 21st of October, 2011 in this House, when the Hon. Leader of the House moved for the establishment of the Parliamentary Select Committee. If you look at the Order Book, the Terms of Reference contained therein is the draft that was agreed between the TNA and the Government. So, do not tell us that we are just sitting outside the Parliamentary Select Committee. I will tell you something about the Parliamentary Select Committee. It has 31 Members: 19 from the Government, 12 from the Opposition. How many Members do we have - three, four, or maximum five? The issue that we are addressing is the issue of majoritarianism. That has been the issue since 1948 - majoritarianism, because soon after the Independence, there were pieces of Legislation that were passed with majority votes depriving a certain section of the people even of their franchise, their citizenship rights.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam supported it. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, actually, he voted against the first Bill. I must be fair by him. The second Bill, Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) It is on record. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, it is on record. That is why I am conceding. Otherwise, I will also make that allegation. I do not want to make a wrong allegation against the Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam. It is the second Bill that he voted for, the first Bill he opposed. - [Interruption.] So, that is wrong. You know very well that the political party that I belong to, Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi was formed as a result of that. You know that very well. On 19th of December, 1949, when the Hon. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam broke away from the All-Ceylon Tamil Congress and established Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi it was on that issue, it was on that very issue. We do not say that was right; that was wrong. That is why he left the Party and started a new political party. Now, the point that I was making is not as to who supported it; the point I was making is the issue of majoritarianism is the root issue and that is why even in 1956, it was possible with majority votes to make Sinhala, the only official language. Despite the fact that under Section 24 of the Soulbury Constitution, there was a safeguard that you could not pass a legislation

39 40

2013 02

conferring on one community, a certain privilege that is not afforded to another community. Despite that safeguard -

( ) (An Hon. Member) It is Section 29 (2). .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am sorry, it is not 24, but Section 29 (2). Thank you very much. Section 29 (2) of the Soulbury Constitution offers that safeguard. When the Constitution was enacted, if somebody had asked for examples of such legislations that were being enacted, one could have easily given the Official Language Act as an example, where you made one communitys language the official language to the detriment of the other. But, that very Act was passed in Parliament. How was it possible? That was because of the majority numbers. So, simple majoritarian rule is the issue. Now, when the root issue is one of majoritarianism, how do we resolve that in a Parliamentary Select Committee consisting of 31 Members in which we will only have four or five Members? The issue of majoritarianism - [Interruption.] No, listen. The issue of majoritarianism is replicated in the Parliamentary Select Committee also. So, it is because of that - [Interruption.] The Hon. Minister of Justice is present here. During the Debate on the Second Reading of the Budget, he also made an invitation for us to join the Parliamentary Select Committee, but he is not there in it. The political party with the largest representation of Muslims in this Parliament has been left out of that Parliamentary Select Committee. Standing outside, having been kicked out of that, he is asking us to go in and join. I do not understand this logic. Now this is -

( ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Hon. Member, I made an appeal to the Government to revisit the composition of the Select Committee and include us as well. I did say that. In a sequel from that, I also made an appeal to you.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) All right. Thank you. So, there he has a problem about the Parliamentary Select Committee that does not include him. He wants it to be revisited. So, the Hon. Minister of Justice himself is crying out for justice and saying, Why did you leave me out? As I said, the issue of majoritarianism is replicated in the Parliamentary Select Committee. That is why there was an agreement between the Leader of the TNA and His Excellency the President, on the 4th of August, 2011 and it is recorded in

our Minutes on the 16th of September, 2011, that we would come into the Parliamentary Select Committee -

( ( - ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake - Deputy Minister of Health) You are not representing the TNA; you are representing the Tigers.

.. ( .. )

(The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I do not need to answer comments like this; I am making a responsible speech. I am making a serious speech that refers to facts as recorded in the minutes of our discussions. That is why that agreement was entered into, not with a view of us staying away from the Parliamentary Select Committee, but with an effort so that we could join the Parliamentary Select Committee, but that was not adhered to. We have said this over and over again, even when the Hon. Leader of Opposition made an effort on the 23rd of May, 2012. He made a statement in Parliament having agreed with the Government that he was going to make that statement in Parliament. We agreed to that statement being made. If it was only endorsed by the Hon. Leader of the House that day, we were going to nominate and go into the Parliamentary Select Committee. But, contrary to the agreement, the Hon. Leader of the House did not endorse it. These are matters of record. So, every time we raise the issue, just parroting the words, What about the Parliamentary Select Committee? will not do. You need to act a little more responsibly than that. I appeal to the Hon. Minister of National Languages and Social Integration, because he knows all of these matters. He should not, like an uninformed person, raise issues like this when we talk about these matters. He knows these things. So, this is the background. We have not irresponsibly stayed away. We have striven, as much as possible, to participate and bring this to an end. But, these things are going on and on without any resolution.

You have given the Secretary-General of the United Nations specific undertakings, signed it and given a deadline also for that as the end of the year 2009 and four years later, you have not done it. Not only have you not done it, but you are breaching it because almost a hundred thousand people cannot go back to their original places due to the acts of the Government. There are acquisitions of those lands; notices have been issued in violation of the undertaking given by the President on the 26th of May, 2009.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Chairman, I rise to a point of Order.

41 42

( ) (The Chairman) There is a point of Order being raised. Hon. Azwer, what is your point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I think it would help the House very much if you could give a Ruling on this. Today, we are discussing the Votes of several ministries. The Committee Stage is to discuss the votes of specific ministries. But, the Hon. Member is discussing a gamut of problems, Sir. If that is allowed, Sir, none of the Members will speak on the subject. This is the Committee Stage. We have to discuss all the Heads one by one. There are various types of Heads, for example, His Excellency the President, Office of the Leader of the Opposition of Parliament and so on. So, why is he discussing about rehabilitation and constitutional changes? He can take it up at another appropriate committee. This is the Committee Stage Discussion. It must be told to our learned lawyer, the Hon. Sumanthiran.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, please try to keep to the subject in discussion.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay, Sir, I will try and follow what you have said. But, the Hon. Prime Minister spoke about a lot of these matters and I was responding to that. These are the subject Heads that we are now discussing: Judges of the Superior Courts, I spoke about that; the Judicial Service Commission, I spoke about that. With regard to the National Police Commission, now there is no independent National Police Commission. - [Interruption.] So, you know that. Under the Eighteenth Amendment, you know that the independence of those Commissions have been taken away. How many times do I have to repeat this? The Human Rights Commission is not independent; the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption is not independent, and that is seen. So many complaints are pending still and they are on a witch-hunt. They are on a witch-hunt at the instance of the Government. The Department of the Attorney-General never before was under the President and now that is listed under the President; not just this year but for the last couple of years, it has come under the President. It has lost its independence.

Again, with regard to the Department of Elections, not even a Commission of Elections has been appointed.

Even if it is appointed, that would not be an independent Commission given the Eighteenth Amendment. But, even under the Eighteenth Amendment, no Commission has been appointed. Why is that?

Look at the recently-concluded Northern Provincial Council Election. It is true that elections were held. It is true that over 60 per cent of the registered voters voted. It is also true that the Tamil National Alliance won the elections. I must commend the Government for holding the elections. I must commend that it was possible for a result like that to come about. But, look at the reports of all the local election monitors and the two international observers that your Government invited: the SAARC Observers and the Commonwealth Observers. Look at those two reports? Can you be proud about the manner in which the Government conducted that election? No, you cannot. There was constant interference. There was abuse of State resources. All of that is detailed in that. The observers whom you yourself invited have given their report - [Interruption.] The fact that our people bravely went and voted despite these obstacles cannot be used to cover your sins, what you attempted to do. Why did you try to do that at all? Why did the military name three persons as their candidates and paste posters all over the place? I personally saw them pasting posters only of those three candidates and then guarding them. So, it was only those three faces that were there all over the place. Why did the military have to engage in acts like that? Even an English language newspaper had a photograph of one of those candidates distributing building materials with the army in Jaffna during the election campaign period. Why did all of these things happen? Is that the reason why that strength of soldiers are kept in the North? So, an Election Commission has not been appointed.

Now, we are discussing all of these expenditures. There is a huge amount allocated under the Head of His Excellency the President.

That raises another issue with regard to the expenditure that this Budget proposes for the other sectors. If one examines the percentage of monies that are to be spent by the Office of the President; tomorrow and the day after we will be discussing the Votes of the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development, the Ministry of Law and Order; then the Ministry of Finance and Planning, the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Highways, Ports and Shipping; these Ministries have the largest amount of expenditure. Almost 36.2 per cent of the expenditure of the Ministry of Highways, Ports and Shipping is through foreign funding. When you take all of that and you take the rest of the allocations, what is the picture that you see?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) A good picture.

43 44

2013 02

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, a good picture; you have to say that - [Interruption.] Some people say that the number of Ministers in this Government is the highest in the world and that we have entered the Guinness Book of World Records. I actually asked His Excellency the President about this and I congratulated him on entering the Guinness Book. He told me, No, there is one other country that has more Ministers than us. So, at least, Sri Lanka has the second place on the number of Ministers according to His Excellency the President - [Interruption.]

Why is it necessary to have this large Cabinet and this large group of Deputy Ministers and then all the financial power to be concentrated in one, two or three Ministries? It seems quite obvious to anyone that that is the very reason why you have to have this large number of Ministers and Deputy Ministers. At least, they have their titles even if they cannot have any power. They do not have any monies allocated to them; they do not have anything to do, but at least they have their titles. So, keep them happy with this large number of Ministers and Deputy Ministers, but all the power is concentrated in one family. Now, is this good governance, because the question is -

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) All are happy. Will you agree with that? There are no killings. How many Members of your Party have been killed?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Nobody is getting killed now. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Minister, you seem to be able to - [Interruption.] It looks as though, you are satisfied very easily. Just one incident is enough for you to live happily ever after. So, even if you do not have any powers, just with the title of Deputy Minister of Health, you are quite happy to continue like that and all the powers to be concentrated elsewhere merely because Prabhakaran was killed. That is your stand. That is not the stand of the people of this country. The people of this country are looking for good governance; the people of this country are looking for governance in which there will be transparency, there will be some accountability and power not concentrated in one family. That is because, if you concentrate power in one man, that is bad enough - [Interruption.] If all the residual power is also concentrated in one family, that is the worst situation that this country can ever have.

We talk about a sense of alienation of our people. I spoke about this on Friday, the sense of alienation that our people feel. But, actually, there is a sense of alienation that all the people of this country feel, except that one family, because powers of Government are only in one family to the exclusion of all others. So, there is a great sense of alienation that the whole country feels. - [Interruption.] Now, the Hon. Minister of National Languages and Social Integration speaks. Why? Is what I am saying affecting you? - [Interruption.] The great Socialist, who wants power to be exercised by all the people is in this state, where he is also one of those Ministers in that large Cabinet, not counted, not taken note of and he is quite happy to be there with that title.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) I only said that they happen to be brothers. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) They happen to be brothers. Thank you very much. - [Interruption.] The issue that I am raising is also a very serious one. It is not only the minority people of this country who feel alienated. We feel alienated; I am sure the Muslim people feel alienated; the poor people feel alienated. But, now it has come to a point where anybody who does not belong to this family, feels alienated. Even the Ministers in the Cabinet feel totally alienated. -Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Are you referring to the Sampanthan family? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, he is not in the Cabinet. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) His children are happily studying in London. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) There are others who shout, scream, disturb, behave clownishly with the hope that they too will be given some title even if it is bereft of all authority and financial power, and they can also become a Deputy Minister or a Minister.- [Interruption.]

45 46

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Not at all. He is speaking on behalf of the diaspora.- [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I did not name anybody. I said there are people like that and we can hear those people now standing up and speaking. People who feel that the cap fits have put it on, and have started shouting.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You have no cap. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We know about you. Hon. Azwer, is the one who immediately stood up and spoke when I talked about persons who have aspirations for titles but have still not been given it, because you need somebody in the last row to do this job.- [Interruption.] By the way the numbers of Ministers have grown in this House, I find that even the Government benches are not enough. We are very soon going to have Deputy Ministers sitting on this side of the House as backbenchers, because the very last row is also taken up by Deputy Ministers.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is jealous. Do not be jealous.- [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) This is some style of governance, I must say. ( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) The TNA Members are boycotting your speech. Nobody is here to listen to you. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am so glad that the Deputy Minister for Health is keenly following my speech and is present in Parliament. Thank you very much for being present and listening to my speech, Hon. Deputy Minister.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, ask him to wind up.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Some people here have been given a particular task to perform and they perform that. I have said this before. When I say this, the Chief Government Whip is smiling. He knows how he sets that in motion. He looks behind and immediately somebody at the back row stands up. And, then - [Interruption.] But, we have noticed you doing this. - [Interruption.] Of course, then you get up and tell people to sit down also a little later, having allowed them a little leeway, as it were. We can observe what is happening, but that does not change it.

There are serious concerns, as I said at the beginning of my speech, with regard to the style of governance that has been adopted by the concentration of power in one person and one family, and that is what is described as this country, more and more travelling in an authoritarian direction.

If people who are seated in the Government benches do not take note of it, if you are happy to let this pass, I am afraid you will have to pay a grave price for this, a very heavy price because history has always shown that if you permit power to be concentrated in one person or one family like this, changing that will not be very easy. We know very well that you are not happy, but merely being not happy and grumbling, looking over your shoulders is not enough. You need to act with a little more courage; you need to act on your conviction and you need to speak on behalf of the people who have elected you. - [Interruption.] People have not elected you to sit there and support one family. So, that is not what is expected of you.

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) You support your leader. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You support a good leader. That is good; that is right. - [Interruption.] No, no, a good leader must be supported. There is no question about that. You must support a good leader, but supporting a good leader does not mean that you leave all the powers in that leaders hands.

( )

(The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) No, no. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is not democracy. You must support a good leader. That, you do, but you must not leave all the powers in that leaders hands. Democratic values demand

47 48

2013 02

( ( ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara - Deputy Minister of Labour and Labour Relations) Hon. Chairman, - ( ) (The Chairman) Yes, Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara. - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I cannot hear you, Hon. Deputy Minister. ( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara) Hon. Member, give me just one minute to respond to - ( ) (The Chairman) You can raise only points of Order. - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Is it not a point of Order? Sir, if he wants to interrupt and ask a question, I will give way. - [Interruption.] No, I will give way. Let him ask that.

( ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara) Hon. Chairman, just give me one minute to respond to the Hon. Sumanthiran on two points that he just mentioned. Firstly, he mentioned that power is concentrated in one family. But, I must tell him very clearly that all these family members were elected by the public. They were not appointed by the President. - [Interruption .] Wait, wait, just give me one minute. So, all the family members were elected. That is number one. - [Interruption.] I have been given one minute by the Hon. Chairman. So, just give me one minute.

Hon. Member, the second point that you have been harping on is that you are not coming for the Parliamentary Select Committee because there is no majority. But, Hon. Sumanthiran, you should be happy that at least an invitation has been given to you to attend the Parliamentary Select Committee because -

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Sumanthiran, you carry on.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Chairman. I will respond to what the Deputy Minister said secondly about the Parliamentary Select Committee. I did not say that we are not coming because there is no majority. I very clearly set out that there is an agreement between His Excellency the President and us as to when we would join the Parliamentary Select Committee. It is there in writing as well; that was agreed to. But, that is not being done. - [Interruption .] No, I want to clarify it because you seem to have misunderstood what I said. - [Interruption.] Hon. Deputy Minister, you asked a question and now, I am answering. - [Interruption.] I am sorry that the Hon. Member misunderstands. We welcome all the goodwill and I do not want to spurn it. - [Interruption.] I thank you, Hon. Deputy Minister, for saying that we do not need to fear.

We take what comes from a good heart in a good way. We would like to respond to that in kind. We know that there are several people on the Government side who want to do that. But, we also have to safeguard the rights of our people. - [Interruption.] Now, the Hon. Azwer shouts about something else. - [Interruption.] What is he up to?

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, you have only one more minute. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We want to safeguard the rights of our people and for that reason, we spoke to His Excellency the President and came to an understanding. His Excellency the President cannot all the time breach the understandings and the agreements that he comes to. He gives undertakings to the international community and breaches them, as I listed out today. He gives undertakings to us and breaches them. So, he cannot keep going on like this all the time. That is the point I am raising. It is well and good that you support a good leader, but you must also check your leader. You cannot blindly follow a leader merely because he did one good thing. You must always check the powers that he exercises. You also have powers, you also have responsibility and that is why I am asking the Government Members to be more serious in exercising their responsibility and not merely leave all the powers to be exercised by one family and one man. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Chairman) Thank you, Hon. Sumanthiran. The next speaker is the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris.

49 50

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Mr. Chairman, if I may raise a point of Order, I think giving 50 minutes to a speaker at the Committee Stage of any debate is not fair and it has never been so in the history of the Committee Stage of Parliament. So, I would like you to reconsider this matter even by having a Party Leaders Meeting. I think the TNA would agree on that. You can have two speakers. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition is here and he also would agree with me, most likely. We should come to an understanding on that, Sir.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) He went to Kankesanthurai. There were two temples that had been bulldozed by the army. He was going to see it, but he was stopped by the military. How can the military stop him? Is there a law which says that somebody cannot go to that place?

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Well, there can be security reasons, which maybe the reason, I do not know. The Chief Minister must make representations to the Minister of Defence, who is the President and the President will give you an answer to this. I am not aware of the facts. Therefore, I cannot give you an answer. You are aware of the facts. So, please represent matters to the President and the President for sure will give you an answer as to why he was prevented at that moment or whether that prevention was not lawful. One of the two will be said by him. There is a national security question. I cannot go to the United States and go anywhere I like because the United States has its own national security concerns. How is the affairs of the Guantanamo Prison conducted?

Mr. Deputy Chairman, we are so concerned about those happenings. So, please permit me to highlight the present plight of the judicial system. I say that there is a very serious deterioration in the Judiciary in todays context.

The appointment process of Judges to the Superior Courts and the Court of Appeal and the process of appointing members of important commissions such as the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and the Human Rights Commission are all in jeopardy with the repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment and the lack of representation of members from both the Government and the Opposition.

The Constitutional Council must consist of representatives appointed with the consent of all recognized political parties. However, it only consists of representatives appointed by the ruling party and the President, posing a serious threat to democracy.

In the Supreme Court, there are two vacancies that were created by the retirement of Justice P.A. Ratnayake and Justice Amaratunga. These vacancies have existed for nearly six months and three months, respectively. Why has there been a delay in filling these vacancies? There is serious delay in the administering of justice by the courts. In such a backdrop, a legitimate question arises as to why there has been a delay in filling these vacancies. Unless there is an ulterior motive, we cannot see any justification for such an undue delay.

The Court of Appeal, presided by Justice Sriskandarajah, referred to the Supreme Court for examination and determination, the applicability of the judicial decisions on the Parliamentary Committees. The

Judges of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal are under tremendous pressure to issue decisions to please the rulers. In the Supreme Court, a determination was made by a bench presided by Justice Amaratunga. Justice Amaratunga suffered a stroke after a few months of the judgment given. Justice Sriskandarajah, conquering with the two other Judges, quashed the Parliamentary Select Committee Report. Justice Sriskandarajah is now bedridden and almost a vegetable. So, we are very sad about incidents of this nature. He was overlooked on his promotion to the Supreme Court on five occasions. Finally, he was prevented from being promoted for nearly five to six months. Now, there is no need to promote him anymore.

Decades of judicial experience and independent judgments have been destroyed. Even the minor Judiciary is under tremendous pressure. Very soon, even to hold a political rally, we may have to obtain permission from the Government and the Judiciary. They have been coerced to trespass on fundamental rights. If they do not comply, they will have to face brutal consequences and sacrifice their entire professional career.

Take the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. One person makes the appointments to these bodies and they act on the political dictates of such persons. A number of complaints have been made against the Government politicians who have squandered millions and billions of rupees. These persons are roaming around scot-free. Not a single one of those complaints has been inquired into. Be assured that we will not only inquire into these crimes against the society, but also inquire into the conduct of those who are tasked with the duty of inquiring into these crimes, who have been acting in a dishonourable and dishonest manner.

Sir, in the recent past, one of the honest Customs officers who nabbed a racketeer was planted with a concocted or fabricated charge of bribery. There are allegations against very high people in the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption.

The courts are most unfavourable in matters when they are called upon to hold against the Government because they are under immense pressure. Soon this country will come to a far-exceeding situtiaon than that exists in Colombia, where the judges have to go home creeping through the windows after issuing judgments.

The Rule of Law is of little concern. The Chief Justice himself was quoted in a public function saying: One should not pay lip service to the Rule of Law. The civil society is shocked and dismayed. Government harassment of their political opponents through the law enforcement authorities is rampant. Police powers have been vested on the armed forces very much in violation of Section 12 of the Public Security Ordinance. This is why there was shooting by the armed forces in Rathupaswala killing

77 78

three people, injuring many others and desecrating places of worship. The law that applies to Government supporters is one and the law that applies to their political opponents is another. It appears that not only the King, but his men and all of their henchmen can do no wrong. It appears that the Presidential immunity applies to all the hoodlums. The civil society is shell-shocked.

When a person who had no money in a bank account is prosecuted with the passport being impounded in a political witch-hunt, I say that it is a political witch-hunt, and others who do not declare their assets at all are enjoying the immunity that they do not have, with impunity. If the Judiciary conducts itself in a partisan manner as they do, soon will come the day when the public will have no more respect for the Judiciary. Today, people have started talking about this serious erosion of the judicial system.

Sri Lanka is now the proud Chair-in-office of the Commonwealth. We are happy as Sri Lankans about His Excellency the President getting this Chair. There were two independent opinions that were sought by the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Mr. Kamalesh Sharma. These two Reports are now in the public domain. They were issued by the former Chief Justice of South Africa and Sir Jeffrey Jowell, Queens Counsel. These Reports go to the extent of stating that the 43rd Chief Justice was never removed from office and that she still remains in office. Will the Chair-in-office of the Commonwealth, His Excellency the President, take immediate steps to restore her in office and remove the constraints that have been placed preventing the 43rd Chief Justice from discharging her functions as the Chief Justice of Sri Lanka?

Mr. Deputy Chairman, I made these observations in good faith. As the Chair of the Commonwealth, we have set standards. We have to be a model nation for others to follow. We want to die in a democratic country; that is my wish.

Finally, Mr. Deputy Chairman, I thought I should add one more thing.

[1.26 p.m.] ( ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Mr. Deputy Chairman, I am pleased to take part in the Committee Stage Discussion of several institutions coming under His Excellency the President.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, one look at the institutional structures and the commissioners will show us that these are all vital cogs in the wheel of the architectural governance in this country. Therefore, though I have very limited time, I would like to deal with a few of these institutions. Particularly, I would start with the Human Rights Commission and then the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and if time permits, I will speak about the Auditor Generals Department and of the Elections Department.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, it is a known fact that most of these institutions derive their authority sometimes from the supreme instrument of State power, that is the Constitution itself. Some of the members, commissioners and others are protected in their tenure of office. They do not hold office at the pleasure of the Executive but their tenure is protected by the Constitution itself. Some are governed by special legislations that have been passed by Parliament.

Therefore, in dealing with these institutions, my mind first comes to the subject of the Human Rights Commission and, I believe, it is now time for us to start looking at strengthening the Human Rights Commission and this, perhaps, is one of those tasks that have been also taken over by His Excellency the Presidents able Secretary, Mr. Lalith Weeratunga as the Head of the Task Force that looks into the LLRC Recommendations.

I find even in the CHOGM Communiqu, they have generally commented on the need for all countries to address the question of strengthening the National Human Rights Institutions or regional mechanisms, where suitable in compliance with the Paris Principles.

I believe there are many areas which needs to be looked into and I was pleased to have a document passed on to me by the Chairman of the Human Rights Commission, Justice Priyantha Perera, which has virtually set out some guidelines as to the amendments and new inclusions that are necessary in the Human Rights Commission Bill.

I believe this is something that is quite important since all of us know that invoking the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under the fundamental rights chapter is not an easy thing for everyone. The commoner normally looks up to the Human Rights Commission and it has been widely believed that though there are a large number of complaints that are being entertained by them, the enforceable mechanism is very much lacking. Therefore, the viability and the usefulness of the Human Rights Commission has been called into question. Therefore, some very important suggestions have been made. I am sure, Mr. Lalith Weeratunga, being the Head of the Presidential Task Force that is looking into the recommendations of the LLRC recommendations will look at some of the progressive measures that need to be put into. Particularly, monitoring the executive and administrative procedures and policies with a view to ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Constitution relating to fundamental rights and promoting respect for and observance of fundamental rights and human rights is an important element because that, perhaps, was lacking in the original Bill.

Then, inquiring into and investigating complaints relating to human rights violations, both infringements and imminent infringements of fundamental rights, and also providing for a mechanism to refer for conciliation and mediation, which is the new area of alternate dispute resolution mechanisms which even my Ministry is looking at very seriously when it comes to the judicial process in this country.

And, also the need for us to set up a number of regional offices in the regions, empowering them to exercise such powers and functions of the Commission, as may be delegated to them, is another suggestion that I

83 84

2013 02

believe is very important for us to keep in mind. Then, it is recommended to intervene in any proceedings relating to the infringement or imminent infringement of fundamental rights pending before any court, either with the permission of such court or if referred to by such court.

Then, we also have an important inclusion, which is also being clamoured for by some of those critics of this Government. That is, to have an amendment to the Act, to enable without any distinction, monitor the welfare of persons detained either by a judicial order or otherwise, including persons in detention in prison or elsewhere under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Special Provisions) Act and also in case there is an emergency prevailing, regulations made under the Public Security Ordinance. And, also to permit Commissioners the regular inspection of their places of detention and to furnish quarterly reports with recommendations, I think, is a very timely and important element that should be included in the Human Rights Commission Bill.

Then, there is also a suggestion that there must be provision to make special fact findings and/or hold national inquiries in relation to any matter with a public and/or national interest, systematic and/or gross human rights violations, when it comes to weak and vulnerable groups that need special attention in relation to protection of women, children, elders, disabled, migrant workers and internally displaced persons. To have special fact finding missions by the Human Rights Commission, there must be some provision in the Human Rights Commission Bill.

Then, even if there is no complaint made, on its own motion, the Human Rights Commission should be able to investigate and inquire into an allegation of an infringement or imminent infringement of a fundamental right, when they come to know that there is some serious allegation to be looked into. I believe this is important and this is also among the suggested changes.

Then, the need to have - [Interruption.] No, no. That is also being suggested. I will come to that. What I believe is, - like how the courts make interim orders - to have space for the Commission to make interim recommendations if they think fit to the appropriate authority or persons concerned with a view to preventing the continuation of such infringement until a final determination is made by the Commission, which provision is not available. To make an interim order while the inquiry is pending before the Commission, is something that we must have included in the Human Rights Commission Bill, and to make an interim recommendation that the practice or omission giving rise to the infringement or imminent infringement of a fundamental right should be reconsidered or rectified. This is also something that is very timely.

The most important feature of it is what the Hon. Member here brought to my notice, and that is the

question of enforcement. This is something that has even come up very regularly before the Public Petitions Committee in Parliament. The Members of the Public Petitions Committee have been heard to say that all complaints that have come before them - the decision being made even after the Human Rights Commission has looked into it - have been overlooked by those authorities to whom the orders have gone out and, therefore, there should be some kind of strengthening of the enforcement mechanism to see that those persons in authority who fail to comply with the recommendation within a stipulated period, the Commission should be able to submit a certificate to the Court of Appeal or the Provincial High Court, as appropriate in the circumstances, for the purpose of implementing such recommendation.

This is something that is lacking and I believe this is an important element we must have implemented soon.

Also, there is a suggestion to allow an aggrieved party applying to a court of competent jurisdiction to have such recommendation given effect to. Not only the Commission itself, out of its own volition, can issue a certificate, but the aggrieved person also can go to courts and have it given effect to.

Then, it is suggested to have, subject to rules as may be prescribed, to admit notwithstanding the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance, to admit any evidence, whether written or oral, which might be inadmissible in civil or criminal proceedings, provided that such evidence could reasonably ensure justice. This, I believe is also a very novel feature. I hope this will not found to be inconsistent with the Constitution. In that case, we could have that provision also be included.

Then, a new subsection has been suggested - in special circumstances identified by the Commission, when a summons is served, upon any person named therein, and, if such person without any valid reason fails to attend the proceedings of the Commission......" - which happens very often and I am told people in authority do not give any regard to the Human Rights Commission. People in authority sometimes fail to appear or send very junior officers. Therefore, in such cases, in special circumstances - ".. the Chairman of the Commission shall issue a warrant under his hand to ensure such attendance. Such warrant shall be final and conclusive, and, such person would be liable to be dealt with, under Section 21 of this Act". That should also be something that has to be added as a new subsection.

The important thing is - I think the Hon. Member from the TNA would be happy to note - that the Government has taken cognizance of this issue that has been often raised about people who are being arrested and detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act or under any regulation made under the Public Security Ordinance. With regard to this, it is suggested to inform the

85 86

Commission of such arrest or detention, as the case may be, and the place at which the person so arrested or detained is being held in custody or detention and whether that person is to be released or transferred to another place of detention. These are matters that should be brought to the notice of the Human Rights Commission and to make it mandatory for those officers of the Terrorist Investigation Division of the police to implement them.

I think this is very timely, since there have been concerns expressed. We believe these are important elements that the Government would seriously consider. I am sure, as I told you before, the Secretary to the President will be taking action on some of these recommendations, so that we will be able to strengthen the Human Rights Commission and that is something that has been requested for a long time.

Then, coming to the area of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, I believe that the Commissioners themselves are given security of tenure, their removal being similar to the removal of Judges of the higher Judiciary. Therefore, this is an important element in the governance structure of this country, to have a Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, which has such security been ensured for the Commissioners and where an offence is disclosed, the Commission shall direct the Director-General to institute criminal proceedings in an appropriate manner.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Minister, now wind up please. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, give me one or two minutes. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) I will give you one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, we have now formed a Sri Lankan Chapter of the Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption, and I am privileged to be the elected Chair of that Chapter. Therefore, it is important for us to strengthen the available mechanism of our own Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, which has run into some difficulties during

the former administration, when Commissioners were at each other's neck. There were some controversies where even the Director-General had to be moved out to the Ministry of Justice previously. That has, to a certain extent, affected the credibility of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. I am sure, in time to come, with some new measures being taken to strengthen the hands of the Commission, also by having also an independent policing arm - not to have it under the IGP but to have a separate number of police officers who will come under the purview of the Commissioners - would be useful to investigate complaints, because what we now normally see is, the public impact of the Commission is limited to politicians rushing to it to highlight allegations against the opposing party members. Then, a large array of media persons follow them and photographs appear showing them walking in and out of the Commission. This alone is not going to be enough. What is important is for us to see that some substantial measures are taken to curb corruption. That is an important element that I thought to highlight.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, as for what the Hon. Arundika Fernando mentioned about the Auditor Generals Department, the "value for money audit" which we are not doing in this country is something that we must bear in mind and should introduce. As a former Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, this is something that I have observed. Wastage and other pilferages are being totally neglected because we do not have a "value for money audit" approach to the audit of Government institutions. This is something that is important for us to bear in mind.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, I also must thank the officers of Parliament, the Votes of which is also being discussed today, for having assisted us in many ways to conduct our affairs as Members of Parliament in this House. Thank you very much.

That is an extrajudicial killing. You cannot deny that. It has become the order of the day because the legal process has crumbled. The police are too lazy to file complaints; they are too lazy to file cases in court. So, the Government turns a blind eye. Even the IGP turns a blind eye. When people who commit serious offences are arrested, they are bumped off. Can you be proud of that? I have had over a hundred instances in the last one year where people were arrested for serious crimes and the police were too lazy to file complaints. What happened to them? They were bumped off.

I say that the UN Human Rights Councils Resolution in March, next year, once it is approved, is serious because under international law, genocide is a basis for partition. You look at the UN websites. Genocide is a basis for partition. If we do not do justice to the civilians who were killed, what is going to happen to our country? So, will you give me a debate? ?

( . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) What makes you think that genocide is going to be referred to in that Resolution? Why are you making these assumptions which are so inimical, not to the Government, but to the people of this country?

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Please sit down, Hon. Minister. Will you give me a debate? ?

( . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Who has raised about genocide? You are the one who is speaking of genocide. There is no reference to genocide in the Resolution. - [Interruption.] No, this is wishful thinking.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I will tell you why I speak of that. The "Darusman" Report confirms what I say. - [Interruption.]

( . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) The "Darusman" Report is one thing and the Resolutions of the UN Human Rights Council is another thing. The two are totally different.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, you have only two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , ?

[5.37 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Mr. Chairman, I am glad to be speaking while you are in the Chair on the first day of the Committee Stage Discussion of the Appropriation Bill, 2014.

I would first like to say that there are many amendments that have been brought forward and among them there are two significant amendments: one is to do with the total sum of the expenditure, which has been increased and the second one is to do with the amount that is above the borrowing limit. - [Interruption.] I think these two figures are very significant figures in a Budget or in an Appropriation Bill: one is the expenditure and the other is the borrowing limit. The borrowing limit has gone up from Rs. 1,100 billion to Rs. 1,278 billion and actually you could have said from the beginning that there was some mistake in it, but somehow or other - I do not know whether it was due to some carelessness - that that proper figure was not actually in the Appropriation Bill and this was an Appropriation Bill that had also gone to the Supreme Court for its determination.

I would like to specifically focus on the role of the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General is the key officer in terms of the control of finance. One of Parliaments most important functions, as per Article 148, is basically to monitor, control and approve finances. The Auditor-General is the check and balance on the Executive in terms of expenditure and how finance is being managed. The Auditor-Generals position is a constitutional position. It is an important constitutional position and we know that before the Seventeenth Amendment was abolished, Article 41A mentioned how the Constitutional Council is composed: the Prime Minister, the Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition, five persons nominated by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and one person nominated by Members of Parliament. And, there was an apolitical process in actually making nominations to the Commissions. In addition to that, it was specifically said in Article 41C that no person shall be appointed to any of the offices specified in the Schedule to this Article, unless such appointment has been approved by the Council upon a recommendation made to the Council by the President. It was this Amendment to the Constitution, which had been passed with an unprecedented majority in an earlier Parliament, where the Opposition and the Government acted collectively with 223 Members voting in favour of it, that was abolished.

It was a few months after this Parliament was called into session, when we appeared one morning in Parliament, we suddenly saw for the first time, the Eighteenth Amendment. According to Schedule 41C, which came under the Seventeenth Amendment, the Chief Justice and the Judges of the Supreme Court, the President and the Judges of the Court of Appeal, the Members of the Judicial Service Commission, the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, the Inspector-General of Police, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration who is the Ombudsman and the Secretary-General of Parliament were to be nominated by the Constitutional Council.. This was the check that Parliament had on the Executive and that check was removed. It was removed suddenly and very quickly.

The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution was introduced hurriedly within 72 hours. Members of Parliament like myself saw the Amendment in the morning and by evening we had to vote on the Amendment. It was no ordinary Bill. It was an Amendment to the Constitution of the country itself.

There was no public debate in this country as to how this Constitution should be adopted or amended. It was brought in using a provision in the Constitution for urgent Bills, to amend the Constitution itself. It was cloaked in secrecy. Legislators had very little option in both debating it and voting for it. It was a significant change where it changed the very nature of the Sri Lankan State. It opened the door for a constitutional dictatorship. The President arrogated to himself the powers of making appointments that were formerly vested with the Constitutional Council. An apolitical process was giving way to a process which is now the sole jurisdiction of the Executive. Good governance determines that there has to be a balance between the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. These are the principles that the Commonwealth has enunciated. In the Communiqu issued by the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held in Sri Lanka recently, they reiterated their commitment to respect, protect and promote the core values set out in the Charter. In that context, they noted that the people of the Commonwealth, through the Charter, had emphasized the importance of democracy, human rights, international peace and security, tolerance, respect and understanding, freedom of expression, separation of powers, rule of law, good governance, so on and so forth.

But, that was not to be. Then, Mr. Chairman, No. 45 of the same Communiqu talks about audit institutions. It states that the Heads of Government recognized the contribution that strong, properly-resourced and independent supreme audit institutions play in improving transparency, accountability and value for money to ensure that public funds are appropriately spent.

It also has a section on Public Accounts Committees. It states that the Heads of Government further reaffirmed

that strong and independent Parliamentary oversight plays an important role in preserving the trust of citizens in the integrity of government through Public Accounts Committees that are effective, independent and transparent. It is that independence that was actually lost on that day.

Sir, the Auditor-Generals position is a constitutional position. Article 153 (2) of the Constitution states that the salary of the Auditor-General shall be determined by Parliament. When the Auditor-Generals salary was brought up last year, we stated in this House that there were certain anomalies in his salary where even in the Auditor-Generals Department, there are officials who receive salaries higher than the Auditor-General himself. How can that be? The Auditor-General was receiving less than Rs. 50,000. There is no independence without financial independence. It is the responsibility of Parliament actually to propose the salary of the Auditor-General. Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to the notice of the Hon. Speaker that we need to fulfil this obligation, that we have to look at the salary of the Auditor-General. We have to look at the salaries of the positions which are constitutional. Parliament should take that responsibility. Parliament should have a mechanism in proposing it. We have raised before the same point regarding the judges in this country; from Magistrates to District Court Judges, High Court Judges, Appeal Court Judges and Supreme Court Judges, that their salaries be revised from Rs. 100,000 for a Magistrate up to Rs. 500,000 to a Supreme Court judge. Financial independence is a prerequisite for people to be independent. We do not want to see our judges or high public officials being appointed as advisers or into diplomatic positions or receiving funds at the discretion of the President or scholarships for their children. We do not want to see favours done by the Executive for these independent positions. That is why these positions need financial independence. We would continue to make the point that Parliament needs to take responsibility in doing so. Unfortunately, the Auditor-Generals annual salary in 2010 was Rs. 742,000. In 2013 it was Rs. 780,000 and in 2014 it is coming down to Rs. 650,000. I do not know what the explanation is, maybe somebody can give an explanation. But, if you do a simple calculation, if you divide it by 12, you would just get a figure of little over Rs. 50,000.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) That mistake was done by Parliament. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne)

Okay. - [Interruption.] I am glad that it is being corrected. It is good. But, I am arguing not just for that

correction, I am arguing for a Parliamentary process. I am arguing actually not just for the Auditor-General, even for the other parties, that their salaries be seriously looked at and substantially revised.

When we look at the allocation made under the Head of the Auditor-General, we see that the Recurrent Expenditure is Rs. 705,000,000, the Capital Expenditure is Rs.169,000,000 and the total is Rs. 874,000,000. Again, it is less than the figures that were there in 2011 and 2012.

So, we are making the point that if these officials are to be independent, if these important departments are to act independently, then certainly there needs to be a revision.

Sir, we heard today many people talking proudly about Sri Lanka assuming the Chair of the Commonwealth Heads of Government. I want to basically make a short statement on it. When it was decided to have the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting here, I was at a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Meeting in the Maldives. The news was conveyed to me to ask the Leader of the Opposition for a meeting because they wanted the participation of the Leader of the Opposition. They came and met the Leader of the Opposition and it was his instant reply that it was an honour for the country and that the Opposition would support the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. I, myself, was due to attend the Opening Ceremony of that Meeting and I was flying from overseas for that occasion. But, unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition and his vehicle were attacked and many people made statements about that. There are pictures of even members of the Government including Municipal Councillors from Colombo present on that occasion. We are calling on the Government to have a very independent investigation and bring to book those who have violated the law. The Leader of the Opposition, whoever he may be, needs to be protected by law if we are to preserve democracy, as we know it. And, that unfortunate incident led to the fact that we were not able to fully participate in the process of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Azwer, what is your point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) My Friend is casting aspersions on the Executive and the Judiciary. The people of this country elected the President, his brothers, the Hon. Speaker and the Hon. Minister of Economic Development, the Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa and also the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa. So, it is the people's wish. Of course, he should know about the Standing Orders of Parliament.

( ) (The Chairman) No aspersions could be cast. If there is any reference contrary to the Standing Orders, such portion will be expunged.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Sir, it is very unfortunate that some Members of this House have not been able to distinguish between the powers of the President and the conduct of the President. It is unfortunate that they do not even understand that distinction. Therefore, I shall continue.
