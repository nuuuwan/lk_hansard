. . Question proposed. APPRECIATION TO GOVERNMENT FOR CONSTRUCTION OF EXPRESSWAYS ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, I move,

Turning a new leaf in the annals of highways in Sri Lanka, the southern expressway was declared open in the year 2011. Today, it is being used by a large number of people.

The second expressway of Sri Lanka from the Katunayake airport to Colombo is scheduled to be opened on 27th October. The opening of this expressway will enable people to travel from Colombo to Katunayake airport quickly. It will also be immensely beneficial to local and foreign airline passengers. Further, since this road has been constructed with a picturesque setting, tourists arriving at Sri Lanka will be able to have a clear idea about the development taking place in Sri Lanka.

Therefore, it is moved that this House should express its appreciation to the Ministry of Highways, Ports and Shipping for constructing such excellent highways.

It is the "Mahinda Chintana" that paves the way for all types of development in Sri Lanka. Now, highways and expressways also fall into that category. It is the vision of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, through his Mahinda Chintana, that has taken Sri Lanka to great heights in the international arena. I know you would remember, Hon. Presiding Member, in times of yore, people said, All roads lead to Rome. Now, people would say that all roads lead to Katunayake; all roads lead to Galle, Matara, and from there to Beliatta and Hambantota. That is the new picture that has been created about the topography of Sri Lanka.

Now, look at this photograph in today's "Daily News". How wonderful and how nice it is! The President himself is in the Daily News of today. He is leading in front. Yesterday, he took a walk, he was almost jogging, along the new expressway.

In the front page, it states, I quote:

The employees attached to the Ports and Highways Ministry and the Road Development Authority staged a walk along the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway yesterday to mark the opening of the Expressway scheduled for October 27. President Mahinda Rajapaksa is seen joining the march at its starting point at Peliyagoda. Minister Nirmala Kotalawala, Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa and Ports and Highways Ministry Secretary R.W.R. Premasiri also participated.

How happy the people of Sri Lanka are to see this fantastic picture and also enjoy the right to use the new expressway. In this picture, I also see our dear Colleague, the Hon. (Ms.) Kamala Ranathunga, also walking wearing a T-shirt, together with His Excellency the President and others.

Sir, now we must understand why we are calling this country a "Wonder of Asia".

President Obama by getting elected as the first coloured person to head the United States was praised for making the impossible possible. A black man in the White House as President of the United States was even unthinkable in a dream. But it happened. The same was said about defeating Velupillai Prabhakaran - an impossibility. However, the strong reserve of the Sri Lankan armed forces under the command of its equally determined

Commander-in-Chief Mahinda Rajapaksa made the impossible - possible and the people of the North and East of Sri Lanka were liberated from the ruthless killers commanded by Velupillai Prabhakaran for thirty long years.

Jaffna and its immediate suburbs have undergone a marvellous transformation from a war torn area to complete rejuvenation to the extent that some British tourists who were visiting Jaffna about the same time as us, ..

This was in front of the big library which was burnt down by the former government. It is a well known fact.

. were asking the question from the army personnel in Elephant Pass, what war? when listening to the narration at the foot of the monument in Elephant Pass.

In conclusion, Dr. Haris Z. Deen states, I quote:

The Military Officers are going to great lengths to cultivate trust and provide the Jaffna people, Tamils, Muslims and of course some Sinhalese, who lived in utter distrust, hate and most importantly terror for thirty years the confidence of a government eager to build bridges between all the communities part and parcel of the greater Sri Lankan family.

I must also mention that in his team was Mrs. Khairiya Deen, Hussein Deen, Ameena, Ameen and also Zaharan. This is the team that went to Jaffna and spent a night in the jungle. There is a holiday resort there. It is called the "Nature Park", a forest rest. Those places were earlier infested by the Tigers. Therefore, it is no wonder that he is writing an article like this so that the British people will be educated about the true picture of Sri Lanka.

What more? Within another 25 days, we are going to stage one of the most important conferences - the CHOGM - that could take place the world over. The Commonwealth Heads of States are coming here. How happy they will be to see an expressway. They will never imagine such a thing. Some of the leaders have come here earlier through the Ja-Ela-Kadawatha Road. Her Majesty the Queen had come and even Prince Charles, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the Pakistani Prime Minister, the New Zealand Prime Minister and the Australian Prime Minister have come through that way. This time they will be amazed and bewildered to see the transformation that has taken place in this country. More than anything else their hearts will be filled with joy and happiness of the great achievement of the Mahinda Rajapaksa Regime.

I do not want to take much time because our able and always on-the-run Hon. Nirmala Kotalawala has to speak.

( ) (The Presiding Member) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Vasantha Senanayake) Mr. Presiding Member, it gives me great pleasure and it is a privilege to second the Motion proposed by the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer.

I think on this occasion, we must view with great gratitude the opening up of the second highway in the history of this country, particularly myself, because, in part or partially, it goes through my electorate, Mirigama and benefits its people as well, tremendously. So, I take this opportunity to thank this House, particularly the Ministry of Highways, Ports and Shipping for constructing this highway, which will benefit the people of Gampaha immensely as much as it benefits the majority of Sri Lankans; in fact, I would say, all the Sri Lankans living in this country.

Unfortunately, Sir, I do not quite comprehend how some Sri Lankans can see this as a progress and how a few cannot. I think this is the myopic vision of whom we can term as "frogs in the well", who cannot see anything beyond the little well they have been born in, brought up, raised in, will live in, die in and ferment in and are entirely unable to see and comprehend any sort of development which happens in a constructive manner. This is extremely sad because this country did not have a single highway at any point of time. Today, we have understood that we must move on with global trends; we cannot act in isolation; we cannot act as an independent island cut away from the rest of the world particularly in the light of increased globalization where the world is now a single unit, which we cannot differentiate ourselves from. We must understand this point of view and that the Government's ability to dream realistic dreams is in our best interest as a country. If the President did not have a

vision to see this country as a country free of war and if we believed in the age-old myth that guerilla warfare cannot be combated militarily, today we would still be fighting a war. It is this way of being able to perceive one's nation out of the box in an innovative sense that has enabled us to progress to win what they thought was an unwinnable war. So, to dare to dream the impossible dream is not necessarily a bad thing if one can make those dreams a reality, which had been proven right with the war and the first express highway - the Southern Highway - already been constructed and being used.

So, the second highway to be opened, as I said before, will immensely benefit my own Electorate and the peoples from there as well. For that, I must say, Sir, I could not thank the House before, but I am pleased on this occasion that I am able to do so. I was able to, in my last address to this House, speak particularly about the University of Lancashire which is coming also to my Electorate, the Electorate of Mirigama, and will undoubtedly benefit the people of Mirigama. To get a university that is recognized so highly in the international rankings and placed above the highest of the Sri Lankan universities - I think it is the Moratuwa University that is regarded as Sri Lanka's premier educational institution when it comes to higher education or university education and the University of Lancashire, in world rankings, is about a thousand places higher than the University of Moratuwa - is of tremendous benefit to us as a nation. When you have institutions of that calibre coming into this country without fear, you must also have the infrastructure to support and sustain such development.

When we talk about sustainable development itself, Sir, we must bear in mind that in today's world, particularly of commerce and industry, time is of essence and therefore, moving goods, particularly perishable goods, to ports is very vital, very crucial in the sphere of international trade. Therefore, having highways which increase accessibility within our nation causes or brings about tremendous benefit and commercial viability as well .

Therefore, we must thank this Government for initiating such innovative and valuable contributions in the infrastructure development of this country. It is also going to be a boon to tourism and there is no doubt about it because tourists tend to travel to countries where access is free; it does not take hours to travel from one destination to another and where they can get to a destination quickly without much discomfort. That is one of the main reasons why any tourist chooses a particular destination in this country. Therefore, the improvement in highways will open up to tourists, previously inaccessible or less visited places in this country.

I do not wish to speak at length. I think it is manifestly clear that the introduction of a second highway - it will not end up at that but culminate in more

599 600

highways being developed - will help this country to progress from further prosperity to even more prosperity.

Therefore, I wish this Government the very best in its endeavours and also wish to state categorically that I feel proud to be a part of such development. I also feel proud to be a Sri Lankan as much as a Parliamentarian in this Parliament that has brought about so much development through the Government for this country.

Thank you.

( () ) (The Hon. (Ms.) Kamala Ranathunga)
