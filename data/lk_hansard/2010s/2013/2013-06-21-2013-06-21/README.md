[4.00 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I get up with a sense of sadness to speak on my Colleague and Friend who is no more with us. The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana was a man for all seasons. It can be from his medical fraternity, from his educational background, from his political background or even representing the very devoted Catholic that he was; he did it with a lot of zeal and commitment. That was the same idea that was thrust on to me by him because he was very instrumental in the political journey that I have come along.

Jayalath Jayawardana was a devoted a Catholic but he did not use this as a tool. He embraced that all religions are one and the same and it is the same hill that we climb, but basically it is the manner we live that represents our true religion. At times, he was questioned with regard to certain things that he did but he was able to prove to the people who accused him, of the genuineness of whatever he did. So, that was what Jayalath Jayawardana was.

As explained by the other Members, he was a doctor who treated others but neglected himself. Today, at the young age of 59, he is no more. That was simply because his political commitments overran his true medical commitments that he had to undergo. As a matter of fact, I can still remember his son, Kavinda and his daughter Vindya telling me with tears in their eyes, that when he should have done a bypass in London, owing to the fact that he had to take a rest in London, he said, No, I will have a stent put rather than a bypass that needs additional time. That was the type of the person he was, whom we are talking about here today. It was an untimely death, but he was a person who needs to be spoken of and certain things need to be emulated and to be taken forward.

As I said, he was multifaceted and was also able to represent himself anywhere. He finally contested for the Gampaha District but he was a person who had an ability to move around in the Colombo District very well. He first represented Avissawella, thereafter Kaduwela and today, until our Leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe said, I did not know that he has also represented Colombo West. That was the reason why he was able to help me so much. When I was thrust into politics - I was a National List MP - I was challenged also by my good Friend, the Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, a person who is no more, to come into active politics. At that time, I still remember Jayalath giving me all his assistance, all his connections and I was able to make an impact; thanks to him.

So, here we are; many speak of the good virtues after a person is no more. But, here, today everybody is able to speak of one thing across the Floor: the good things that he did and the negatives that have been proven wrong

1359 1360

even in the late stage. At this particular moment, I would like to mention certain things over which he was very sad. Owing to the very close relationship that he had across the divide, he did certain things personally from the belief that Sri Lanka is a multicultural, multi-religious society and he embraced the same sense of vision that the Rt. Hon. D.S. Senanayake had - the Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims, the Burghers and the Malays, be it Buddhists, Catholics, Hindus or the believers of Islam, all of them have the same right to live in this country as Sri Lankans and that was the true spirit he fought for. He went overseas and represented his views and when he did that in the last couple of months, he was tagged with certain names. But, today people are saying, Sorry, for uttering them. Even just before his death, there were Ministers of the Government who said, If the Government could pursue what Jayalath did, we would not be in the mess that we are in today.

So, all we can basically say today is that we must learn from politicians who are able to reach across the Floor to either side and have the ability to move people into various quarters. As the Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva said, he was very close to the Vatican. His connections were able to help many. The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe was able to get the first appointment this year simply because of the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana.

Likewise, he was very close with the Buddhist clergy. Sometimes, he was able to get things done from the Mahanayake Theros more than a Buddhist Member of Parliament could do. That is what you have got to learn from him. His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith as well as the Bishop of Mannar were very close to him. As a matter of fact, at the funeral of the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana, the Bishop of Mannar uttered something and he thereafter also called me and said, What Jayalath did should continue within the Party. So, at this particular moment, I would like to say on behalf of Jayalath, we will certainly help and continue what Jayalath has been doing.

In the last couple of days when he was medically unfit, through the tearing eyes of his daughter, Vindya and son Kavinda, we knew that his days were nearing. Just before he was taken to Singapore - I know the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne did a lot on that score - when Mela and I went to the Intensive Care Unit to see him, he looked at us, held our hands and said, Pray for me. I remember that with a sense of sadness. When he was operated in Singapore, Kavinda came down and said, The operation was successful and we thought everything was all right.

Sir, what I want to say is, he had a close relationship not only with me but with Mela as well and more than that with our Party because he was able to bring together

people who had different opinions. I know today there are Ministers in the Government who were non-existent politicians but he was able to bring them into active politics and all of them in one voice say, If not for Jayalaths inspiration and motivation, we would not have been in politics".

Sir, the only other thing that I need to say is that his genuine political pursuit needs to be carried forward. I am happy to hear that his son, Kavinda, has expressed desire and that he will be able to fill the vacuum that my good Friend and our good Colleague has left. While Ujitha, Kavinda and Vindya will miss him, we will also miss his absence and all we could basically say is, let his soul rest in peace. We will certainly continue the job that he wanted to do in the best of our spirits, to the best of our ability, so that his name will be remembered for long.

Thank you.

[4.59 p.m.] .. . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, who is a gentleman?

He is a Gentleman, because his nature

Is kind and affable to every creature.

This was said by Richard Barnfield in his "The Shepherds Content". The word "Gentleman" is another word for intense humanity.

Today, Sir, I rise in this House to pay my respect to a Gentleman who added colour to this Assembly. I feel sometimes isolated in the Government Benches in the absence of the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana because from the time we separated from each other, we intensely quarrelled with each other in this House. But, when we walked out, I have not found such a gentleman, a genial personality and a close Friend like the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana. That is why I call him a Gentleman. Sir, we sometimes meet downstairs, have arguments, climb up the lift, enter the Lobby of this Parliament and then, he turns left and I turn right to enter the Chamber.

But, Sir, one fact that I must emphasize today is that I had a long association with him which many of my good Friends in the House did not know. We first met each

other at "Sucharitha." He was almost a family physician of the Hon. R. Premadasa, the then Prime Minister and later the President. He attended to almost every small work involving the Sucharitha Movement. At times, Sir, he was so quick, articulate and active, he did not walk but he ran. He would have made a first grade Olympic athlete, perhaps, I thought sometimes.

Then, Sir, we both were at the President's House in Fort during the period of His Excellency D.B. Wijetunga. We had very close contacts and participated in many functions. I remember going throughout the Island with him for political meetings and other social functions. He always laughed, smiled and carried a countenance of happiness all over him. He bore no anger in his heart, no revenge, no malice nor hatred. That was the quality of the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana.

He entered Parliament through the National List. Subsequently, he contested two or three General Elections from Gampaha District. Sir, the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana was a well-known doctor here and abroad. He cut his figure in the medical field very well. Also, he had created a record in the Guinness Book for his health programmes conducted on TNL. He conducted a thousand programmes; thanks to TNL Chairman, Shan Wickremasinghe.

After convalescing, he returned to the TV programme as soon as possible. Sir, I remember him discussing every field of medicine meant for the old and the young alike. He also discussed through his TV programme, some topics which cannot be discussed in public. He would say, This is for adults only. So, keep the children away from this programme. I have seen even on such occasions, the not too young children used to - escaping the sight of their parents somehow or other - watch his programme. On one occasion one parent castigated his child saying, " ? , . , ...."

He was captivating to that extent, Sir.

The Hon. Joseph Michael Perera, his good Friend and our former Speaker, who represents the Gampaha District said, . Sir, it was not done by anybody with any bad intention. Certainly, he was an international figure who went from one country to another. He went to the Rehabilitation Centres that the Sri Lankan Tamils were occupying and saw for himself their plight. I remember the late Mr. Manavai Thambi who started the " -

".

.

1375 1376

. From there, Jayalath flew to Geneva, London, Norway and the rest of the continental countries. Whenever he went to those countries, intentionally or not, some people raised eyebrows. Those visits caused consternation among certain quarters. But, I remember very well when the news of his death reached us, I was with His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa in China. He spontaneously said, ", , . ? ."

As soon as he returned to the country, he hurried to the Ja-ela residence to pay his last respects which was followed by the other leaders only later. When the Hon. (Dr.) Jayawardana was hospitalized too, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa visited him. Also, when he was sick and wanted financial assistance, at the request of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, not once or twice but on several occasions, His Excellency the President ordered sufficient funds to be released from the Presidential Fund for his medical needs. That was the magnanimous gesture of the President who had a very close association with the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana. Also, His Excellency the President likes to move with the people. He is a peoples man. That is why he told the doctors and all his friends around that everything must be done so that he will have a speedy recovery.

Even at certain functions held at the Presidential Secretariat or Temple Trees, we could always see the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana closer to the President and they would have a hearty laugh. Perhaps in that mood, they enjoyed life. It never dawned on us that the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana was in the Opposition, that he was an Opposition MP.

Sir, as I told you, we quarrelled. Once in this House, he told me, " " . " , ? ? , " . You know, a few minutes later I was presiding the House. He came closer to the Chair and said - he called me "Haji" - Haji, do not get angry. I just wanted to tickle you. Then I said, I also wanted to tickle you. That is why I said, ' , ' ".

, from the time when I was Minister of State for Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs, I used to get dates from my friends who are here and abroad in Arab countries, and distribute to so many people including my Friends, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama and former

leader, the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, who would vouch for it. Also, I was able, at one stage, to get those from that Embassy to the Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera when he was the Speaker and those were distributed among the Muslims of Negombo.

When I talk of Negombo, Sir, it comes to my mind that when the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana expired, condolence messages were issued by . :

" . ."

Sir, he moved closely with the Muslims of the Gampaha District, particularly in the Negombo area. He used to visit constantly my good friend, Mr. I.L.M. Thassim, veteran social worker of the area, at Porutota, Kochchikade and had a very close association with him and also with his son, Mr. Nasmiyar Thassim, who is a very senior Member of the Negombo Municipal Council. Therefore, Sir, we feel his loss today.

He was one person who gave his support to the Islamic Centre for the Physically Handicapped in Doolmale, Thihariya although it is not exactly in the area he represented but because it is situated in the Gampaha District. He was helping them in so many ways. Sir, today, Jummah day, when I walked out of the Battaramulla Jumma Masjid, I was reminded of this because a leaflet of the Islamic Centre for the Physically Handicapped signed by Alhaj N. Jiffry Haniffa, JP, the Managing Trustee and Director and also by Alhaj A.T.M. Zubair, the Treasurer was handed over to me. I would like to table* that leaflet, Sir, because that would give us much thought and the Hon. Members of the Parliament would also be able to see through that because .

. . " - Disability is not Inability, the motto of that Centre states. The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana was present on some occasions when foreigners came there and helped the Centre. So, in such a frame of mind, the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana worked for the people although at times, as he said, we had altercations with each other.

Then, I must say that there was a Motion to be moved against him in this House, which entered into the Addendum.

But, although it was in the Order Book, it never came into the Order Paper; thanks to the words of wisdom of the Hon. Speaker. It was a very good thing done. We must be very thankful to our great genial Gentleman, the Speaker, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa, who gave it a bit of thought, shared it with us and said, " . " .

The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana was a distinguished Member of this House. He had a steep climb in the United National Party. He was given a due place and also when there were vacancies or places that should be filled, the Party had a ready Working Committee Member in the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana. He was ultimately made the Deputy General Secretary. He was heading the Party's trade union movement, the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya, which has now been taken over by our good Friend, the Hon. John Amaratunga.

We have so many things to say about the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana. One thing is, he was a very good pal of the Fourth Estate - the mass media; he associated closely with them.

" " 2013 2 "" :

" . . . . . " " ."

:

" . . . . . ."

So, he moved not only with the Catholics and the Buddhists but also with the Ulama class, that is, the Moulavis of the Muslim community. He used to salute the Muslims saying, "Assalamu Alaikum, Hajiyar and Moulavi!" He was so close to them. When he spoke like that, some Muslims thought that he was a Muslim. So, he was a man loved by everybody. He carried humanness in him.

While concluding, I would like to place on record our deep appreciation of the work he had done and also convey to his beloved wife, Ujitha and the two children, Doctors Kavinda and Vindhya, our heartfelt condolences. It was reported in the newspapers that his doctor son is going to embark on the fathers footsteps and enter politics. I wish him well!

Sir, the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana was a distinguished Member who served this august Assembly for 18 years, four months and one day.

Thank you.

[6.23 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Sir, for the opportunity given to pay tribute to a Friend, a Colleague in Parliament, a colleague in the United National Party and a co-trade unionist, the Hon. Dr. Jayalath Jayawardena.

More than all this, as many Members in this House described, he was a true Sri Lankan. He was the representative of the true Sri Lankan identity. Nobody would grudge him, his unique position as a person who was accepted, loved, appreciated and honoured by every community in this country because he never thought as a Sinhalese or as a Catholic but as a true Sri Lankan and embraced every community in this country as equals. I have seen him in Hindu Temples in Colombo. I have seen him at the Catholic Churches and I have seen him lead many special programmes for Buddhists. He was never considered as a person who belongs to any one of these communities but as a true Sri Lankan.

As the Hon. Ajith P. Perera said, we have had the longest tribute-paying session today and I think I am the last speaker. I do not have to repeat everything that the others said but I should say a few special things about him. He was considered a friend of the minorities and this was reflected by the opportunity given by my Leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, in the Cabinet of 2001 to 2004 by appointing him as the Minister of Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Refugees. Though his electorate was Ja-Ela, he was mostly found in the North or the East even neglecting his own electorate. However, his people appreciated him for the service he was doing without bias and re-elected him even afterwards. He was a true lover of these people because when he was discharging his duties as the Minister of Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Refugees during the period of ceasefire, he was able to do a lot of development and to assist people for true reconciliation though there was no end to the war but only a temporary stoppage of war. That was what was great about him.

Similarly, he took up the issue of human rights of Members of Parliament. He took it up to the international forum; he took it up to the IPU; he took it up to the CPA and the UNP honoured him by appointing him as the Deputy Secretary of the United National Party in charge of human rights. He was always committed to the policies of the UNP. He fought wherever we went without any fear. He was a vociferous defender of the partys cause at all forums and he never gave up.

1395 1396

The last occasion that I saw him was in Negombo when he was doing a membership drive for the UNP in his electorate. Though he had illnesses, though he had undergone treatment and operations, he did not bother about it. He walked around; he was active and I believe, soon after that, he became ill and we lost him.

We lost him at the early age of 59, which is a very young age for a politician when he had so much more to do for our party and for our country. We feel so let-down and we miss him. On this occasion, I must convey my condolences to his family personally on behalf of our party as well as the people of Nuwara Eliya from where his wife is. The people in the city of Nuwara Eliya remember him as a friendly person who belonged to a good family and wedded into a family of Nuwara Eliya. So, they appreciate him and on behalf of them also, I wish to convey my deepest sympathies and condolences on this great loss to his family and also to the family of the United National Party. Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by both sides of the House on the death of the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana, ex-Member of Parliament. I shall direct the Secretary-General of Parliament to make a Minute of the Proceedings of today's Meeting and send a copy thereof to the members of the bereaved family.

BEAUTIFICATION OF TOWNS

.. . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I move,

"Areas such as the City of Colombo and Battaramulla have been developed by now by the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development. At the same time, places such as the Vihara Maha Devi Park and Crow Island are also being developed.

The City of Colombo and around as well as the area on both sides of the Lake Diyawanna in Battaramulla have become picturesque; thanks to the urban development carried out in this fashion. A trend of both local and foreign tourists being attracted to these areas can also be seen at present.

Therefore, while thanking the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development for its action to beautify Colombo and its suburbs, I move in this House that it will be appropriate to develop other towns of Sri Lanka as well in this manner."

I table* the Sinhala and Tamil versions of the Motion to be included in Hansard.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. Y.G. Padmasiri) , ... .

.. . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) .

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, Colombo is the largest city in the country and contributes to over 50 per cent of the national GDP and compared to other Asian cities, Colombo has much more room to grow. The economic density of Colombo is approximately US Dollars 15 million per square kilometre. In comparison, the economic density of Ho Chi Minh City is US Dollars 73 million; in Bangkok it is US Dollars 88 million and in Singapore it is US Dollars 269 million. This indicates the growth that Colombo should aim for, especially in the current context.

After many decades, with the country at peace, it was finally possible to realize its true potential. Colombo had a great role to play in unlocking this potential. However, before this rejuvenation could succeed, there were many problems that needed to be addressed, one of which was the prevention of floods.

Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the Secretary to the Defence Ministry, has said that he had to face the problem of unauthorized structures which blocked the drainage systems and he had to clear them. He has also contended that it is not only the low-income segments of the society who have erected unauthorized structures on reservation land but industrialists, the middle-class and high-income segments as well. All these structures are being demolished and would greatly improve the

1399 1400

efficiency of the drainage system. The Sri Lanka Navy, the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation have been engaged in dredging and developing the canal system in the city. Medium-term plans are being prepared to improve the entire drainage system in the Metro Colombo region.

Under a project funded by the World Bank, the Beira Lake and other vital water retention areas have been completely dredged, de-silted and fully rehabilitated alongside significant improvements to the existing canal network. We all know that those days, when we were walking around the Beira Lake, we could not bear the stench of it. All those seem to be cleared and now it is like the Geneva Lake. It has been beautified to attract not only the tourists but also the local population. There is a Seema Malakaya and next to that there is an island with a bridge connecting. Children come there in large numbers, enjoy and have fun in that place.

This is so with the Viharamahadevi Park also. The Viharamahadevi Park was earlier known as the Victoria Park. I and my friends from school, S.M.A. Jabbar, M.S.M. Nizar, M.A.A. Ansari and H.I.M. Cassim, Abba Tayoob, M. Velu Mail, S.M.M. Kamaldeen and others do visit the park. I remember we used to take our books there and do revision sitting under the shade of green trees in that park. Such a beautiful park it was. You can always enjoy its environment. It is an eco-friendly park. Now, we can walk through the Cinnamon Gardens Police Station and then through the racecourse area. It has now been transformed into a new and beautiful city yard.

Sir, the other day my cousin, Dr. Haris Deen telephoned from England and said, We want to come and see the beauty of the Colombo City. My nephews and nieces, Shiraza, Shireen, Hussain, Hassa and Haseena, all wish to come and enjoy in Colombo.Also, my close friend, Mr. Ismeth Abdullah, who has been in UK for a long time, and had not visited us said: I am particularly coming to see the new beautiful Colombo. So, this is the message that we get from around the international capitals.

Then, Sir, the Shangri-La Group has agreed to construct a luxury hotel and a residential complex on 10 acres of land that was allocated to the army near Galle Face. A Chinese company, CATIC, has undertaken to establish a skyline hotel on an adjacent block of land. These agreements have already generated a large influx of funds, which has been allocated to the combined Defence Headquarters Complex, which is currently being constructed at Battaramulla. Another project which is being expedited is the second phase of the Sethsiripaya Complex.

Then, the Independence Square area is being developed and the other parts of the city are also being developed as pedestrian-walks, scenic locales. This will do a great deal to uplift the character of the Capital City as a green and a clean city of fame.

While urban development is the common theme of all the projects mentioned so far, the Government also intends to further develop Colombo by creating new city space.

This is a gigantic task undertaken by our good and able Secretary, Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and his staff.

Then, Sir, about Fort; the high rising buildings once completed will house many of the remaining government offices in Colombo.

Then, the historic buildings like the Dutch Hospital and the Cargills Building are being redeveloped to cater to the modern day business requirements. I think, the day before yesterday, they opened a new venture there. It is like a promenade. Go and see. The World Trade Centre and the surrounding area is transformed into a beautiful park. We never imagined this.

The garbage problem has also been solved. There is no garbage now. There is no dirt. The other day, a good Tamil gentleman - when you are in the Chair I must say - who is 73 years old from Wellawatta, rang me up in the midnight and said, !

.

.

?

. ,

. So, there is the environmental police being employed. It is a very good thing. I told him,

!. And told the police that he is a very elderly person to leave him alone.

Then, Sir, there is the Gaffoor Building in the centre, in the heart of Fort. It is one of the original buildings that came up in Fort. It was built, owned by the Late Alhaj N.D.H. Abdul Gaffoor, one of the well-known and biggest philanthropists this country has seen. Now, it has changed hands and I would request the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development to give it a new face. It will be a big showpiece in Fort. When the Europeans came those days, they got down from the Jetty in Fort area and after going to the Gem Museum of Caffoor Hajiar, they came to shop at the Gaffoor Building. Therefore, Sir, it also must be developed. Close by is the YMBA building. That must also be given a facelift. These are the tremendous work that the new Secretary and his staff - after they were given this onerous task - are doing for Colombo.

1401 1402

Then, Sir, there was a fine project called Your Tax Rupees at Work inaugurated by the former Colombo Mayor, Mr. Omar Kamil. He initiated the work of expanding the Galle Road from Bullers Road Junction, Bambalapitiya up to Kollupitiya and also had a scheme to modernize Horton Place and the road up to Parliament. He was at that time helped by very talented and capable officers of the Colombo Municipal Council, like Engineers Jayantha Guruge, S.G. Gunasekara, M.H.M. Fazal, Mrs. Visaka Dias and Dr. Nimmi Wickremasinghe Madugalle and others of their calibre.

Today, following that example - whoever the Mayor is, or whichever party do they belong to - the present Mayor, my very good friend, Alhaj M.J.M. Muzammil, is also working very closely, hand in glove with the Urban Development Ministry and the Secretary to develop the city. That is his only intention. He does not get involved in having discussions with foreigners at Sirisevana in order to topple the Government or have lectures by foreigners in order to brainwash their party people to take a path towards disaster. No, he is not that.

Now, read the Selalihini Sandeshaya , , " " . . . :

, Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh came to this Parliament and viewing through a window of the Members Dining Room, he exclaimed, This is one of the marvellous sights I have ever seen in any part of the world. This is one of the most beautiful spots to have the Parliament. Can I take this Parliament and this water home? That is how he expressed his amazement about Sri Jayawardenapura area. Then, Sir, :

I moved this Motion in order to develop the other cities, the urban areas. Now, see for example, Puttalam in the North Western Province. The Chairman, K.A. Baiz, of Puttalam Urban Council is developing the town splendidly. Spending a large sum of money he has founded a new Science College. There are new libraries, children parks, bus stands, markets and various other projects. He has also created "Colombo Face". Here, we call in Colombo "Galle Face". In Puttalam, they call it "Colombo Face" because it was such a beautiful promenade he has created. I think the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development could further help Puttalam to be upgraded into a Municipality, because Puttalam has more people than the Municipal Council of Kurunegala. Also, there is Eravur in the Eastern Province. The present Eravur Urban Council is headed by Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana, a distinguished old Colleague of our's in this Parliament. We must also help develop Eravur - because it is completely an urbanized area. I think the majority of them are Muslims and Tamils but there is a Sinhalese Viharaya and some Sinhalese people also live there - so that they will have a fully-fledged Municipal Council with further development.

Then, Sir, take for example, Matale in the hill country. The Matale Mayor, Hilmy Mohammed, is doing a splendid job. The Mahatma Gandhi International Centre for Peace is coming up there. Our very good friend, the former High Commissioner of India, Mr. Ashok K. Kantha came and restarted that. The original foundation stone for which was laid by none other than Mahatma Gandhi, when he visited Matale area, was the first entry point of Mahatma Gandhi. There are spices, cocoa, ceramicware and all the by-products that go to the market. Throughout the year, in the Matale City, you can enjoy the climate and its scenic beauty.

There maybe so many other areas of interest in the rest of the Island which should receive the attention of Mr. Gotabaya Rajapksa. The Chairman of the Urban Development Authority, Mr. Nimal Perera, and others are also doing a great job of work. I must also place on record the great services rendered by the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation.

There is a canal going by the side of the school near the Redi Mola - Wellawatte Weaving Mills - at Havelock Town. That canal was not guarded properly and a child fell into the canal and died sometime ago. I immediately brought it to the notice of the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development. He ordered the Chairman of the UDA to put up a fence and now a fence has come up fortifying the area providing safety to the school-going children. They are very quick to act.

The other day when we were passing Colombo, he stopped me at the Viharamahadevi Park area and said, See, this Gamage Company is not doing this properly; take it up in Parliament; they are not completing it. They have taken the money. This is the way they are playing out the money of the people. I want to complete this project. He is very quick. His speed cannot be matched by anybody else. Not only here in Colombo but also in other parts of the country, wherever you go, everybody says, ;

. I think His Excellency the President is very lucky to have a brother of that nature. There is a Tamil saying - I said it yesterday also - which means, "One who has a brother shall not fear any army".

, . . Infrastructure facilities in Maharagama area have also got be developed. In Maharagama, there are Sri Vajiragnana Dharmayathanaya on one side and Ghafooria Arabic College on the other. I have requested the Mayoress, Mrs. Kanthi Kodikara of Maharagama to construct a road leading to the burial ground inside the Ghafooria Arabic College premises. She has promised to do it. Her husband, Hon. Upali Kodikara is a Minister of the Western Provincial Council. He will also assist the Mayoress of Maharagama, because they work in amity. During our younger days we lived in that area - Pamunuwa Road and then Temple Road.
