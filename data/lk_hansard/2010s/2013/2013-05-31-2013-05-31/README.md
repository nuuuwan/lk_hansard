Hon. Prime Minister, Hon. Ministers, Hon. Leader of the Opposition, Hon. Members of Parliament and distinguished visitors, I am honoured and privileged to welcome to our Parliament at this special Session, Her Excellency Madam Yingluck Shinawatra, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand, one of the most dynamic and outstanding leaders in South-East Asia. She is also the first woman Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand.

In the year 2003, we were honoured and privileged to have had the opportunity to welcome His Excellency Dr. Thaksin Shinawatra, the then Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand and the beloved brother of Your Excellency, who graciously accepted our invitation to address our Parliament.

Today, we are equally privileged and honoured to be able to listen to your Address, Madam Prime Minister, which will be delivered after ten years from the Address of your distinguished and illustrious brother, Dr. Shinawatra, which is a historic event in our Parliament.

Madam Prime Minister, your visit to our Parliament will strengthen the long-standing relationship with Thailand, which dates back to many centuries. Both our countries have a predominantly Buddhist culture based on the Theravada tradition. We are also grateful to your country for the assistance rendered to revive Buddhist practices at a time when Buddhism suffered a decline in our country.

The Parliament of Sri Lanka and the Parliament of Thailand have had a close friendship for many decades. Our Parliament is privileged to have formed a Sri Lanka-Thailand Parliamentary Friendship Association to further consolidate and strengthen the relationship between the two Legislatures.

Our Parliament greatly appreciates the continued and steady growth of bilateral relations between the two countries in recent years and the high-level interactions between the State Leaders through reciprocal visits, such

277 278

as the visit of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of Sri Lanka, to your country in the year 2012, which has given the necessary impetus to strengthen and consolidate the existing ties.

We are also very grateful to Thailand for its support to Sri Lanka at international and regional fora, particularly at the UN Human Rights Council. Sri Lanka and Thailand are active members of the BIMSTEC. We are looking forward to the next BIMSTEC Summit, where Your Excellency would be meeting His Excellency the President of Sri Lanka along with other BIMSTEC leaders.

Similarly, we are dynamic members of the Asia Cooperation Dialogue - ACD - and Sri Lanka is happy to take part in the next ACD Summit to be held in Thailand in 2015.

Madam Yingluck Shinawatra has read for her Bachelors Degree in Political Science at the University of Chiang Mai and is also the holder of a Master of Public Administration Degree from the Kentucky State University, USA.

Madam Shinawatra has had a long and a brilliant career with the corporate sector and she has held many executive positions in some of the top-ranking companies in Thailand.

Now, I have great pleasure in calling upon Your Excellency, Madam Prime Minister, to address this House.

() ADDRESS BY HER EXCELLENCY MADAM YINGLUCK SHINAWATRA, PRIME MINISTER OF THAILAND ( () - ) (Her Excellency Madam Yingluck Shinawatra - Prime Minister of Thailand) Hon. Speaker of Parliament, Hon. Members of Parliament, Ladies and Gentlemen, Ayubowan and Vanakkam!

First of all, I would like to say that I am so excited to speak in your Parliament. Ten years ago, my brother had that opportunity. So, I am the second Prime Minister of Thailand who has got the honour of speaking in this Parliament. I really appreciate it.

It is a great pleasure for me to be here in Sri Lanka, a beautiful island nation at the opposite end of the Bay of Bengal. Although, we are separated by an ocean, our two countries share common religious faiths and close cultural and political beliefs.

I am also greatly humbled to address this Parliament. I feel privileged to speak to the elected Representatives of the people of Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan people have always shown great courage in protecting their nation and the values of their democracy.

On a personal level, I am deeply honoured to be addressing the same Parliament where the worlds first female Prime Minister, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, once led the Government.

Hon. Members of Parliament, I am here in Sri Lanka with the intention to build an even closer partnership between our two nations and to seek Sri Lankas support in building bridges of multi-dimensional cooperation throughout Asia.

In the religious dimension, the reference to the Thai word Lanka Wong carries a noble meaning for Thais. It signifies the establishment of Buddhism from Sri Lanka to Thailand some eight centuries ago. And, 260 years ago, a group of monks from Thailand performed higher ordination for Sri Lankan monks.

This eventually led to the establishment of the Siyam Maha Nikaya here, in this country. This makes our Buddhist links unique and this is the reason why our people are so firmly connected.

More importantly, in these days of rapid changes in the world, with cut-throat economic capitalism, political turmoil and social disruptions, we must work together to strengthen Buddhism as a religion and a way of life. I would like to ask you all to join this quest, so that Buddhism can be a force of tolerance that brings peace, not only to the individual mind but the human community as a whole.

Hon. Members of Parliament, in the political dimension, both our countries care deeply about democracy. Despite challenges that try to destroy our beliefs in democracy, democracy survived since it is the peoples will. Democracy is the best form of government to protect the rights and liberties of the people and advance society's interests. Democracy is not an internal affair of one country alone. Democracies around the world must join to preserve and protect the people. Our

279 280

[ ]

2013 31

two countries, with our experiences and lessons can contribute greatly to the advancement of democratic forces.

Hon. Members of Parliament, the world is facing the common threat of climate change and natural disasters. Our countries shared the fate of tsunami in the year 2004. Thailand had to face one of the worst floods in our nations history two years ago. As climate change threatens the human security, we need to work to protect our people by reducing risks from natural disasters. I call for a closer cooperation and collaboration with an action plan of coordinated warning systems and disaster relief operations.

In the economic dimension, Asia is home to almost 60 per cent of the worlds population with emerging new centres driving the global economic growth. Today, around three billion people from Asia and Africa, live around the Indian Ocean. Enhanced regional connectivity will strengthen links in the Indian Ocean rim. This is a strategy being pursued by Thailand and ASEAN. We are building better transport links between ASEAN and other regions, including South Asia.

On Thailands part, we are investing US Dollars 66 billion in infrastructure development that will link up with the region. Better connectivity leads to more trade, investment, tourism and better links between people.

One of the key projects is the Dawei Deep-Sea Port, which we are working with Myanmar on the Andaman Sea. This will link with the LaemChabang Deep-Sea Port in the Gulf of Thailand, while along the way, a new economic corridor linking with the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean could become a reality. Indeed, Sri Lankas Development of deep-sea ports will allow Sri Lanka to benefit from trade with Dawei and other ports in Southeast Asia.

Thailand is also engaging Asian partners through the Asia Cooperation Dialogue - ACD - to develop this vision. A "New Silk Route" would connect all comers of Asia and beyond. Ultimately, enhanced connectivity extends to Africa with whom we hope to create a common development agenda. Thailand has started the Thai-African initiative in which Thailand will host a high-level dialogue with Africa in November this year.

So, I hope Sri Lanka will join us in this long-term effort to connect Asia and beyond. This will help promote peace and prosperity in our region and ensure that it remains the engine of the global economy.

Hon. Members of Parliament, in closing, I would like to express my appreciation for the warm hospitality extended to me and the honour of addressing this Parliament.

In the light of our rich past and our exciting present, Thailand and Sri Lanka have opened a bright chapter for the future. This modern partnership, based on shared values and shared interests, will bring the best of friends together for the peace and prosperity of our two nations and our region as a whole.

It is a great honour to be here and to stand among the friendly Hon. Members of Parliament.

Thank you.

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva - Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management and Leader of the House of Parliament) Hon. Speaker, as the Leader of the House, I consider it a privilege and a very significant event in my Parliamentary career to be able to offer the Vote of Thanks to Her Excellency Yingluck Shinawatra, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand following her Address to Parliament.

Madam Prime Minister, an address by a foreign leader is a rare occasion in Sri Lankas Parliamentary tradition. In this regard, we are very proud that you are among esteemed company. Former British Prime Minister, Rt. Hon. Margaret Thatcher addressed this House in 1985. The "Iron Lady" as she was known to the world, the late Madam Thatcher was the first foreign leader to address a formal session in the history of our Parliament. After that, it was your esteemed brother, His Excellency Thaksin Shinawatra, the former Prime Minister of Thailand who had such an opportunity. That was in 2003. It is indeed a very significant coincidence and a great honour to the Sri Lankan Parliament that Your Excellency has now become the third world leader to address this House.

Madam Prime Minister, it is my understanding that you hail from a family dedicated to public service and the well-being of the Thai people. I am told that your father was also a Member of Parliament with a proven track record of public service. This makes you no stranger to politics and Parliamentary traditions. Building on these strong foundations, Madam Prime Minister, you have reached the highest levels of political office in Thailand. We, in Sri Lanka, admire your determination, political courage and leadership that has been enormously beneficial to the people of Thailand. You had the

285 286

privilege to be the first Lady Prime Minister as well as the youngest Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand.

Under your able leadership, Thailand is heading towards the apex of development day by day, making the optimum use of science and technology, and literacy. We highly appreciate the steps taken under Your Excellencys leadership to uplift the quality of life of the people of Thailand.

Madam Prime Minister, I wish to recall that during the past three decades, women have rendered exceptional leadership to the people of our region. Sri Lanka too can boast of such exceptional leaders. The late Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike, whom you mentioned in your speech, became the worlds first female Prime Minister following the assassination of her husband. Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was the first female President of Sri Lanka. These two ladies were leaders of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, which I represent. Madam Prime Minister, you have joined the ranks of such outstanding women leaders from our region that also include Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi, Benazir Bhutto, Begum Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina.

Madam Prime Minister, the bilateral relations and the closeness between Sri Lanka and Thailand stretch as far back as the 5th Century AD. It is said that this fact has been mentioned in a stone inscription found in central Thailand.

History refers to the fact that when Buddhism in Sri Lanka was deteriorating, Theravada Buddhism was re-established in the country by Bhikkus who arrived here from Thailand.

It is significant that Your Excellencys visit to Sri Lanka coincides with the 260th anniversary of the establishment of the Siam Nikaya. We proudly refer to this historical event as the second Mahindagamana, or the second most important event in Buddhist history in the country after the religion was introduced to Sri Lanka by Arahat Mahinda in the 2nd century BC.

The cordial relationship between our two countries has continued to grow through the centuries. The bilateral agreements signed by our President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa having met you in 2012, have resulted in greater cooperation in the agriculture, fisheries and education sectors. These developments are extremely encouraging and would be an enormous source of assistance as Sri Lanka moves forward. It is with pleasure that we acknowledge Thailand as a vibrant partner in Sri Lankas socio-economic and cultural development led by the Government of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa which envisions making our country The Wonder of Asia.

Madam Prime Minister, on this occasion, I wish to recall with gratitude the cooperation and support extended by Thailand to Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2012 and 2013, having appreciated the hardships our country has gone through facing terrorism for the last three decades and the ongoing reconciliation process. The cordial relationship which has existed between our two countries for several centuries is further strengthened by your visit to Sri Lanka and your address to the peoples Representatives in this august Assembly.

It is, therefore, my great pleasure to thank you, Madam Prime Minister, for your inspiring address to this House. I have not the slightest doubt that under your able leadership, the aspirations of the Thai people will be fulfilled and the friendly relationship between our two countries will grow from strength to strength.

May the blessings of the noble Triple Gem and the sacred Tooth Relic be with you and the people of Thailand!

Thank you.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, our two countries have a unique relationship based on trade, rice cultivation and Theravada Buddhism. Today, we are privileged to have Madam Prime Minister here when we are commemorating the 260th Anniversary of the Restoration of the Upasampada in Sri Lanka by the Lankawamsa Sangha from Thailand. It was actually completing a circle. It was from Sri Lanka, from Polonnaruwa, that Theravada Buddhism travelled to the City of Nakhon, Sri Thammarat, which in Pali we know as Negara Sri Dharmaraja. In recognition of it today, the UNESCO has declared your famous temple Wat Mahadhatu which we know in Pali as Wara Maha Vihara as one of its heritage projects. The architecture there is similar to that of Polonnaruwa and the Bo sapling again was brought from Anuradhapura sacred Bo-Tree. From there, it was taken to the Kingdom of Sukhothai where King Rama himself got down the Sangha from Sri Lanka and moreso, a lot of craftsmen from Gampola, the electorate of our Prime Minister. They settled there and they took the Sri Lankan architecture including the Sacred Footprint of Lord Buddha. I am fair to Ayutthaya; not only to Ayutthaya, to Northern Thailand to the Lanna Kingdom from which Madam Prime Minister is today representing. It is from there that Reverend Upali came to Sri Lanka. But, we have to remember in the 19th Century, the revival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka was strengthened by King Rama V who promoted Buddhism at the peak of colonialism and it was he, together with Anagarika Dharmapala, who was responsible for the restoration of Mahabodhi in India.

The Waskaduwa Temple today in Kalutara bears testimony to the correspondence and the relationship that existed between the Monarchy of Thailand and the Buddhist Sangha at that time. "Deepaduttaramaya" which Madam Prime Minister is visiting which was visited by King Ananda Mahidol, is also remembered, and we still regard His Majesty the King as the only living Buddhist Monarch of Theravada Buddhism and we all revere him and wish him long life to continue in that position .

But, our friendship is not only based on religion, we were a part of the Silk Route of the sea. Sri Lankas strategic locations, the great Ports of Mantai and Trincomalee, and the Isthmus of Kra enabled trade to be carried from the Indian Ocean to the Bay of Bengal. Today, around us are over two and a half billion people. We can make a market of our own: South East Asia and South Asia, maybe more. This great joint project that Myanmar and Thailand has undertaken would open up for connectivity from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific without having to get jammed in the Strait of Malacca. We represent the other end of it. The great Port of Trincomalee would be a beneficiary of this new arrangement that is being made and we should be a partner in this exercise.

But, we are also unique in another way, Madam Prime Minister. We are the only two Theravada Buddhist democracies in the world. I must thank you for your advocacy of populist democracy. Your brother, the Hon. Dr. Thaksin Shinawatra, came here and I had the privilege of inviting him and hosting him as Prime Minister. But, the vicissitudes of politics are such that neither of us are no longer Prime Ministers. I have the opportunity of going before the people and asking for re-election because the people in any country can elect us to office, throw us out of office, throw us out of Parliament. They never throw us out of the country because democracy is not merely one of elections but the rights and liberties of the people, and the rights and liberties of the people to decide who they want and who should be in Parliament.

Therefore, I know the struggles that you and your brother, who we fondly remember, have had in respect of democracy. We respect you for that. You have engineered the art of how to form parties when parties are dissolved which has now become in itself another factor in politics. Nevertheless, democracy and the people's will have to prevail throughout the world. So, I agree with you, Madam Prime Minister, when you say that democracy is not an internal affair of any country. And, we ourselves have to hold together to see in the whole world that democracy prevails.

In that way, we respect you and what you are doing for democracy. We hope this visit of yours - and it is a

291 292

[ ]

2013 31

unique occasion that the two Prime Ministers who have come here have been brother and sister - in this unique occasion will lead to closer ties between our two countries.

I wish you all the best, Madam Prime Minister, in your career, and I have the pleasure in seconding the Motion which has been presented by the Leader of the House in thanking you for addressing us.
