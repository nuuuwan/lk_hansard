    "text": "( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, our two countries have a unique relationship based on trade, rice cultivation and Theravada Buddhism. Today, we are privileged to have Madam Prime Minister here when we are commemorating the 260th Anniversary of the Restoration of the Upasampada in Sri Lanka by the Lankawamsa Sangha from Thailand. It was actually completing a circle. It was from Sri Lanka, from Polonnaruwa, that Theravada Buddhism travelled to the City of Nakhon, Sri Thammarat, which in Pali we know as Negara Sri Dharmaraja. In recognition of it today, the UNESCO has declared your famous temple Wat Mahadhatu which we know in Pali as Wara Maha Vihara as one of its heritage projects. The architecture there is similar to that of Polonnaruwa and the Bo sapling again was brought from Anuradhapura sacred Bo-Tree. From there, it was taken to the Kingdom of Sukhothai where King Rama himself got down the Sangha from Sri Lanka and moreso, a lot of craftsmen from Gampola, the electorate of our Prime Minister. They settled there and they took the Sri Lankan architecture including the Sacred Footprint of Lord Buddha. I am fair to Ayutthaya; not only to Ayutthaya, to Northern Thailand to the Lanna Kingdom from which Madam Prime Minister is today representing. It is from there that Reverend Upali came to Sri Lanka. But, we have to remember in the 19th Century, the revival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka was strengthened by King Rama V who promoted Buddhism at the peak of colonialism and it was he, together with Anagarika Dharmapala, who was responsible for the restoration of Mahabodhi in India.",

Today, around us are over two and a half billion people. We can make a market of our own: South East Asia and South Asia, maybe more. This great joint project that Myanmar and Thailand has undertaken would open up for connectivity from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific without having to get jammed in the Strait of Malacca. We represent the other end of it. The great Port of Trincomalee would be a beneficiary of this new arrangement that is being made and we should be a partner in this exercise.",

But, the vicissitudes of politics are such that neither of us are no longer Prime Ministers. I have the opportunity of going before the people and asking for re-election because the people in any country can elect us to office, throw us out of office, throw us out of Parliament. They never throw us out of the country because democracy is not merely one of elections but the rights and liberties of the people, and the rights and liberties of the people to decide who they want and who should be in Parliament.",
