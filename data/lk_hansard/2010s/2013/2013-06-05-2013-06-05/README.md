: : PRIVILEGE: VILIFICATION CAMPAIGN

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker for giving me this opportunity, and I must thank the Hon. Speaker for being magnanimous because not only has he accepted the things that have gone on but he also called the Chairman of the ITN, and did get certain things, which I will explain hereafter.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I wish to raise an issue of breach of Privilege, where my reputation as an Hon. Member of this august Assembly is at stake. I have been a Member of Parliament continuously for over 19 years, and at no time have I behaved in a manner that has brought disrepute to myself or the position I hold or to the country.

The Independent Television Network news broadcast has been carrying out a well-orchestrated vilification campaign against me as a Member of Parliament, as well as a law-abiding citizen of the country. The daily newspapers, the Ceylon Today and its sister paper, the Mawbima are in league with the ITN in carrying out this campaign. First, I did not take much notice of it but the continuous attacks have brought me to a situation that cannot be ignored anymore.

Initially, they picked on a totally legitimate programme carried out by our Party, the UNP, in association with the German-sponsored organization, namely, the Friedrich Naumann Foundation projecting it as a conspiracy to topple the Government. Sir, the role of the Opposition in a democracy is to strive for power through all democratic means.

445 446

The Ceylon Today and the Mawbima daily carried false news items as their lead news trying to connect me with their story. An appropriate correction has been sent by the Mayor of Colombo on these two news items, while the Leader of the Opposition, our Party Leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and the Parliamentary Group of the UNP have already brought this issue to your notice.

Sir, as a follow up to the newspaper articles, the ITN News Department commenced their unscrupulous vilification campaign by targeting the Friedrich Naumann Foundation and its Country Representative, Ms. Sagarika Delgoda.

I would say, Sir, that the Friedrich Naumann Foundation has been working for 45 years. Sir, then, I was told to leave out three lines from my script and I will do so. I am personally aware that many Hon. Members of both sides of this House have benefited immensely by participating in programmes organized by the FNF locally and internationally. The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella, the Hon. Dilan Perera, the Hon. Navin Dissanayake, the Hon. Manusha Nanayakkara, the late Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle and the late Hon. Nalanda Ellawala are only a few of the Government Members who had participated in the programmes organized by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation. The Hon. Prime Minister was the Chief Guest at the Dudley Senanayake Oration in 2011. I am aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Nivard Cabraal has worked closely with the organization for many years. Therefore, it is unfair to categorize them as partisan.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I was told to leave out four lines but it would bring certain things out of context. So, I would leave it for you to change it if there is anything out of context.

The Institute for Democracy and Leadership is one such organization that the FNF has extended its partnership as the vision and the objectives of the Institute for Democracy and Leadership matches with their principles. -[Interruption.] [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, please confine your speech to - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Certainly, but I have a difficult task because the Hon. Speaker told me not to read certain lines in my script. So, I do not want to go beyond the mandate that he gave me. But, I do not want unwanted interference by those who do not know what democracy is in this country .

The Institute for Democracy and Leadership has been in existence since 1998. It is the successor to the Democracy Guild, an initiative of the late Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali in 1991. He was a great believer in liberal democracy who ultimately sacrificed his life for a cause. The IDL has been engaged in civic education, leadership and capacity-building programmes for young leaders based on liberal principles.

Here, Sir, I was told to leave out certain lines and I am doing so.

At no time during this period, neither has the IDL or any of its members had any links or dealings with any anti-national organization or persons, particularly with the Tamil diaspora as alleged in the ITN news. The IDL will never engage in any activity that would undermine the sovereignty of the country or the cherished ideals of its founder.

Sir, I have got copies of all the ITN news clippings in this regard. There are 14 such DVDs. The daily News Bulletins of ITN from the 17th to 23rd of May, 2013 and once again on 27th, 28th and 29th of May, 2013 carried lengthy news items on an alleged Friedrich Naumann-UNP conspiracy. In these news segments, they dragged in the Institute for Democracy and Leadership, Ms. Shyamila Perera, Mr. Sandun Gamage and myself into the conspiracy. The news stated that Ms. Shyamila Perera went to India on the 10th January, 2010 to attend the funeral of Thiruvenkadam Velupillai, father of Velupillai Prabhakaran and she represented the Friedrich Naumann Foundation and carried funds for the funeral.

Further, in order to drag my name into this concocted story, they also stated that I sent a message of condolence through her, that was handed over to the funeral committee. This is a totally fabricated story planted by the ITN news producers. At no time did Ms. Perera attend the said funeral or visit India during this period nor did I send any condolence message. Further, I am informed that the funeral of Thiruvenkadam Vellupillai was held in Sri Lanka and not in India. The ITN, an institution that is being run by the taxpayers' money, should first check their facts as well as the credibility of their so-called reliable informants before they set out to malign innocent people.

Then, Sir, again, the next four to five lines were told to be left out. But, I will just read the first two lines.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

whose names I was told to refrain from mentioning and I am doing so. But, once again I would like to say that none of the people I mentioned, - whether it is Sandun Gamage or the Western Provincial Council Member, Mr. Rajakaruna, has been in Switzerland at any given moment.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

So, this is pre-fabricated and a very concerted attack just to malign the UNP, the Friedrich Naumann Institute and myself.

447 448

[ ]

2013 05

Sir, the motive of all this mud-slinging was revealed in the News Bulletin of the 27th May where they said, We are also receiving more information of the activities carried out by the UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake against the country. We will reveal more details on the programmes launched by Sagarika Delgoda, the UNP-Naumann Parliamentarians headed by Ravi Karunanayake against the country maintaining close links with number of countries. They added a new charge that I, together with the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, am making an attempt to rekindle communal unrest in the country through their news items of 28th and 29th May, 2013.

Sir, you will see from the chronology of these facts, the conspiracy that is being hatched against me to vilify me and tarnish my image. It is sad that they are dragging the names of innocent law-abiding people into this having committed no crime. All these fictitious stories are only a figment of their imagination. Had there been an iota of truth in these fabricated news, I would not for a moment thought of bringing this matter before you. You know that the ITN has been sued by me and in many instances they have apologized and even paid for their charges against me.

It is the duty of the media to act responsibly, truthfully and fairly. They have no right to go on a journey of their own on character assassination and mislead the people with untruth, false information and defamation. This is not the first occasion the ITN has done this. They have failed in their attempt and has apologized and also paid for their charges against me.

Sir, you are the custodian of our rights and privileges. So, I am requesting you to refer this matter to the Committee on Privileges for appropriate inquiry. I would also mention that this is the 17th time that a privilege matter is being referred to the Committee on Privileges but never during my 19 years in Parliament has a single one been investigated.

So, what is the purpose of referring these matters to the Committee on Privileges? At this particular moment, I must thank the Hon. Speaker for speaking to the Chairman of the ITN yesterday and asking for a report to be sent to him by tomorrow. I would greatly appreciate if this matter is taken up on a fast-track basis and ensure that such malign activity or this concerted attack on the UNP and ourselves is stopped as I will be pursuing legal action on this matter to rectify it.

Thank you. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Why was his passport impounded by the court?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) This matter will be referred to the Committee on Privileges and appropriate action will be taken.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, the Hon. Member is asking me a question. I would like to tell him that if he does have facts, ask it outside without asking it under the cover of Privileges of Parliament so that I can sue him for that matter.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I was saying that the Hon. Member from Galle told us that on a Sunday, 90 per cent of the news that one finds in the Sunday newspapers is anti-Government. I wonder which country he was talking about, certainly not Sri Lanka.- [Interruption.] He has been monitoring the activities of the Ministry of External Affairs and been flying around and has got confused with the Sunday newspapers published in this country with other countries that he has been travelling to. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) My dear Friend, Hon. Sumanthiran, with the new attire today, you are the one who looks confused -[Interruption.]

( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake) He looks very handsome. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) He is fighting for the leadership with his new attire. After the Hon. Sampanthan decides to retire -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) His recent visit to China, I am sure, would have shown him that the press freedom in that country is much greater than the press freedom one enjoys in Sri Lanka today. There are many ways in which the Government attacks the media. There are inducements, there are threats, there are physical attacks and there are even killings. The Hon. Member of the UNP from Colombo who opened the Debate, referred to the statistics given to this House by the Chief Government Whip as to the number of journalists who were killed. Now, the question is, how many of these crimes against journalists and media institutions have been solved? That is the litmus test to see who is behind these killings and these attacks. If the Government is unable to solve even a single attack on a media institution, an abduction or a killing of a journalist, then it can only mean that the Government is behind all of those crimes. If not, at least some of these would have been solved. You cannot say that our police force is that inefficient, that they cannot solve any of the crimes that are committed against media institutions.

You only have to look at the status that Sri Lanka has attained with regard to press freedom. It is way down. A couple of years ago, it was the second most dangerous place for journalists in the world. It is not something that you can be proud about.- [Interruption.] The Hon. Member from Kandy has changed seats. Why do you not come and sit in your seat? Then, you can ask me questions.- [Interruption.]

Now, I want to advert to one example and demonstrate what I have been saying up to now. That example is the Uthayan newspaper, as was stated, the Managing Director of which is my Colleague, the Hon. Member from Jaffna. So, that shows where the ownership lies. That then, also reveals the background and the reasons for the attacks that have been made against this one newspaper. During the last seven years, the number of attacks on this newspaper, the incidents, was over 30. I do not think any other media institution in this country has

465 466

suffered this amount of attacks. Two of their employees were shot dead inside the premises. Gunmen came and opened fire; two died and three others were seriously injured. That has not been inquired into nor has that crime been resolved. This was sometime ago. If one is to look at the recent incidents, just this year alone, their newspaper distributor was attacked, then, their distribution centre in Kilinochchi was attacked by armed personnel and you know, you cannot have an armed group in Kilinochchi doing this kind of operation and getting away. If that can happen in a highly militarized environment in Kilinochchi, it can only be the act of the Government. The latest of that is in the month of April, when their main printing press and the main printing machine was set on fire to totally incapacitate them from printing and distributing this newspaper. None of these has been solved. If in Kilinochchi and in Jaffna, you can have such blatant attacks carried out by armed thugs and not getting caught, it can only be an indication of the fact that these are carried out by agents of the Government.

Now, I want to get on to something more important. In the context of all of these physical attacks on this newspaper, there is something else also that goes on parallely. That is the vilification campaign carried out in the State media about this newspaper. This is a very strange thing that is happening, particularly in the Daily News and I will read one by one. Now, practically everyday there are news items published in the Daily News targeting the Uthayan newspaper. The Uthayan newspaper has been subjected to such harassment, which can only be harassment by the Government and its agents. But, now, on top of that, you have the State media targeting a hate campaign against this newspaper. It is a hate campaign. It is to instigate violence against this newspaper and its owners. It started sometime ago but if I limit myself just to this year alone, one by one, several news items come and almost all of those have to do with the military personnel in Jaffna.

Now, just two days ago, that is, onTuesday, 4th June, 2013, page 3 of the Daily News states, I quote:

Udayan undermining govts resettlement progress - Major General Boniface Perera

What has Major General Boniface Perera got to do with resettlement? What has Major General Boniface Perera got to do with what the "Uthayan" newspaper publishes? Who is he? A military official. There was a huge news item in the "Daily News" stating that the 'Uthayan" newspaper is undermining efforts of resettlement.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Is there any truth in that?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The "Uthayan" newspaper most certainly publishes about resettlement, the slow progress of resettlement. It mentions about the fact that there is no resettlement in Valikamam North and the Government is acquiring lands, - just in one place alone 6,400 acres, 25 square kilometres; Colombo is only of 31 square kilometres of land - a large extent of land where people are not being allowed to resettle. Is that not the duty of the newspaper to voice that concern? When that happens, what role does a military official have in this scheme of events at all? A military official says that this newspaper is undermining the Governments resettlement progress. Is he not ashamed to call this resettlement a "progress", in the first place? There is no progress; there is no resettlement.

The same newspaper only highlighted that and this news item states, I quote: The Udayan newspaper has published another article arousing communal hatred

Udayan has destroyed and defaced information about the resettlement process in the Northern Province,

If the "Uthayan" newspaper publishes wrong information, there are remedies available that the Government must take; the Minister of Resettlement must take umbrage at that. Who is a military official to publish in a Government newspaper, news items like this about another newspaper? On the previous day, there was an editorial in this regard in this newspaper. We know much about this Editor of the "Daily News". He wears high heels and even that does not bring him up to any stature. On the same day, 4th of June, in the editorial he states, I quote :

what with the Uthayan breathing down their necks with the days anti-militarist diatribe each morning

What has this editor got to do with the "Uthayan" newspaper? He is talking about ethics for journalists. Look at your own newspaper editor, what he says about another newspaper on the 1st of June in the "Daily News"? This news items states, I quote:

Udayan attempting to create bad image about Lanka - Maj Gen Hathurusinghe

Great guardian of Lanka, Major General Hathurusinghe is offended that the "Uthayan" newspaper is creating a bad image about Lanka. What has Major General Hathurusinghe got do with this?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is a man who saved - [Interruption.]

467 468

[ .. ]

2013 05

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Major General Hathurusinghe - [Interruption.] Sit down. He has been named in this House. He has been named in this House by the Leader of the Opposition as a person who is running a private militia in Jaffna, not once but many times. After the Leader of Opposition visited Jaffna, with facts and figures he complained. Even last month, he raised the issue that when he named the Major General Hathurusinghe as a person who was running a private army in Jaffna, that several newspapers - he mentioned even the "Daily Mirror"- have been scared to publish his name. When "The Island" newspaper published his name -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! What is the point of Order, Hon. Azwer?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, he is a topless advocate. Major General Hathurusinghe does not have a private army. He is from the Sri Lanka Army. He has saved the lives of all the Tamils. Hon. Member, you are wearing the Vetti today to give the works to the Hon. Sampanthan. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A.Sumanthiran) Then, on the 30th of May, another news item states that the former IDB Chairman, Udayasri Kariyawasam, is sending Letters of Demand. That is a news item in the "Daily News". Then, on Wednesday, 29th of May, 2013, the "Daily News" states, I quote:

Udayan in futile attempt to mislead people about Northern polls

It looks like that one page of the "Daily News" has been set apart to monitor what the "Uthayan" publishes and then publish information. - [Interruption.] This is a very serious matter. Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, will you listen to me?

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Try and get 100 votes at the next provincial council election.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am talking about something very serious, not about the provincial councils. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena and Hon. Azwer, please sit down.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) This is a very serious issue. This Government not only hires people and physically carries out attacks, - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer and Hon . Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, please sit down. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Editor of the "Uthayan" was attacked; the Deputy Editor was attacked physically when none of them -

..... ( ) ( ..... - , ) (The Hon. M.K.A.D.S. Gunawardana - Deputy Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs) . [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A.Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs, there is no purpose in your sitting there and shouting

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] at me. - [Interruption.] Why do you not conduct yourself in a better fashion without sitting in the last row and shouting at me like that? You are the Deputy Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs. So, why do you not conduct yourself in a better way? - [Interruption.] I am raising a serious issue with regard to attacks on newspapers. You have no spine to answer me; you have

469 470

no information to tell this House as to why no inquiry is conducted, as to why no one has been apprehended. You can only sit there like a jackal

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] and call me names. That is all you can do. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) What is the point of Order, Hon. Azwer? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, he is calling the Hon. Deputy Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs "jackal". [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] He is the reincarnation of the . [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] There are no jackals

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] here. So, he cannot do that. Sir, he must withdraw that.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That is not a point of Order, Hon. Azwer. You carry on, Hon. Member. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is not a point of Order. ( ) (An Hon. Member) You called him . [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Then, Sir, on the 24th of May, 2013, this is what the "Daily News" states, I quote:

"Udayan attempting to undermine sovereignty - Major General Leonard Mark" Now, another Major General, Leonard Mark. What all of these "Generals" - this is the third Major General in a space of a few days - do there is, commenting on what the "Uthayan" publishes. Is that their job, to monitor what the newspaper publishes? If they want to do that - call and tell the "Daily News" - let them do that and it publishes this hate speech. This is classic hate speech by the Government and it is backed up by actual physical attacks on these media institutions. And, you have no shame. Even when this is pointed out in the House, all you can do is shout; all you can do is raise a noise. Hon. Minister of Mass Media and Information - you only presented the Regulation and said that you will reply later - I want you to reply to this. Is this proper conduct by the Government, to use your media day after day -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Sumanthiran, please wind up now. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir. I am going to wind up.

Within the time allotted to me and the time that was permitted by the shouting, I have been able to refer to only two or three news items. I have a whole file here. Day after day, the "Daily News" indulges in this campaign of hate against the Uthayan and on the ground, those military officials send their goons to attack the newspaper office, to burn the newspaper printer; you attacked their delivery vehicle. All of this is being carried out and you talk about media freedom; you say there is media freedom in this country. - [Interruption.] Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this to the only regional newspaper that is published in Jaffna? This is the only regional Tamil newspaper that is published in Jaffna. Is it because the owner belongs to an Opposition political party? This is entirely unacceptable.

Thank you. [.. 3.06] ( ) (The Hon. Shantha Bandara) , 1973 63/5

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) I propose that the Hon. Mohan Priyadarshana De Silva do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to. , .

, , . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. MOHAN PRIYADARSHANA DE SILVA took the Chair. [4.15 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Presiding Member, while we are debating a Regulation, which is actually about the amounts for registration that need to be paid, and I want to use the opportunity to discuss the issues relating to the media and specifically, to the press. The freedom of expression and the freedom of information are rights that every human being, wherever he may be born, basically has. From time immemorial, subjects of the kingdom as well as citizens of a country have expressed their views, and it has been the struggle of those subjects in a kingdom or citizens in a Republic to maintain their freedom. This struggle continues even today. I speak today as a Parliamentarian, a citizen of the Republic and also as a citizen of the free world.

The judiciary and the media are two very important institutions which help us to protect our freedom. Unfortunately, when we think about the judiciary today, its subjugation to the executive, the more recent history of the irregular and unethical removal of the Chief Justice and also the appointment of members of the executive to the judiciary are a part of our unfortunate history. However, the media, though somewhat frightened and weakened, is still the fourth estate of this Republic. Today, we have an opportunity to actually speak on its behalf. I see the activation of the Sri Lanka Press Council Law and also the attempt to bring in a code of ethics for journalists as dangerous and to be viewed with suspicion. I have reasons for saying this. I would say that even some Ministers of the Government are actually not completely responsible for the instruments that are used to execute the plan guiding Sri Lanka to use an Indonesian term "guided democracy"- I make it a euphemism - moving in the direction of more and more of a totalitarian State. Now, if you look at history, I have reasons to say this. If I look at the World Press Freedom Index 2013 made by

493 494

Reporters Without Borders, Sri Lanka is ranked 162 out of 179. People could contest any index and I would invite you to contest the Index subsequently. But, I have to refer to these because otherwise it will be like, "we set the examination paper; we mark the paper and we consider ourselves good" but we have to get others to actually mark our paper internationally and then decide whether our performance is good or bad.

In the Committee to Protect Journalists Index of 2013, which is another index, Sri Lanka ranks fourth and only Iraq, Somalia and the Philippines ranked worse than us. The Committee to Protect Journalists state, I quote:

But four years after the end of the nations long civil war, President Mahinda Rajapaksas administration has shown no interest in pursuing the perpetrators in nine journalist murders over the past decade. All of the victims had reported on politically sensitive issues in ways that were critical of the Rajapaksa government.

Today, we heard the news that one court in this country had upheld a murder conviction against a politician. Even though we make no comment on the case itself as we do not know the facts of the case, it is interesting to note that a politician has actually been convicted.

"The Freedom of the Press 2013" published by the Freedom House has ranked Sri Lanka 164th out of 196 nations and the status given is, Not free".

The "Committee to Protect Journalists" - CPJ - states that 13 journalists have been killed since 2005. That is one of the worst records of impunity. Impunity here is defined as "unresolved murders as a percentage of the population of that particular country" and Sri Lanka has been ranked fourth in that.

Then, according to "Journalists in Exile", there are, at least, 23 journalists in exile. So, that is the reason why we are having this Debate today and talking about the necessity to continuously fight for the freedom of the media and the freedom of the press.

The Press Council Bill was first introduced in 1973, during the time of the 1970 -77 Government, soon after the takeover of the "Lake House" and Dawasa. It was in that background that this Bill was introduced.

Today, there were references made to many Parliamentarians here and the press or the media that they own. There was also a reference made to the illustrious "Wijewardena" family and also to the "Uthayan" newspaper that is being singled out by the "Daily News". Actually, it is more than a matter as to who owns the newspaper. We are talking about the freedom of

journalists. Anybody could own it. In every country, even in the Western countries, different vested interests own the press but it is clear which particular person owns it and which particular overall stance the particular media institution will take. The public can filter and decide after they have an array of views, which view that they want to subscribe to.

Then, I would like to say something about the attack on the Editor and the Deputy Editors of the "Uthayan" newspaper. I am not holding the Minister of Mass Media and Information responsible for this. But, I am certainly holding the Board of the "Daily News" and its Chairman responsible for this. The Minister of Mass Media and Information could take note of the fact that it is the Government media that first needs to have a code of ethics than having a general code of ethics. It is also unfortunate to note that the Sri Lanka Army is drawn into media debates due to statements made by senior officials of the Sri Lanka Army. Its honour is best defended by the Government and a regulated press, and I wish its honour will be defended in that particular way.

In 2002, the UNF Government led by the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, was able to repeal the Criminal Defamation Provisions in the Penal Code and the Press Council Law in 2002, including the repeal of Section 118 of the Penal Code. - [Interruption.] The establishment of the Sri Lanka Press Institute, the Press Complaints Commission and the Sri Lanka College of Journalism were welcome developments. But, very little has happened since then to improve the press freedom and the citizens right to information.

Restrictions are needed and in every country there are restrictions. But, these restrictions should be confined to the exceptions permitted under Section 3 of Article 19 of the ICCPR, which specifically refers to the respect of the rights and reputation of others, and secondly, for the protection of national security, public order, public health and public morals. That is the restriction. In time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation, the existence is officially proclaimed and then there is a necessity for restriction. Such measures, however, must not be inconsistent with international law. We live in a globalized world. We live in a world which has instant information. We live in a world in which we are born in one country, we study in another country, we work in another country and we are also a very important part of the global community. Therefore, we cannot ignore in any way our responsibilities to the universal family.

As we talk of press freedom, one important thing in press freedom is the right to information. With India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Maldives, Bhutan included, every country in South Asia has a Right to Information or

495 496

[ ]

2013 05

a Freedom of Information Act. Sri Lanka is the only country that does not have such an Act and it becomes the exception. A right that the citizens of Scandinavia have enjoyed for more than a hundred years is denied to the citizens of this country. The right to information is needed because of the principles of transparency and open government. So, I would like to say this. I would like to say that the Governments attempt to bring in a code of ethics for the media has to be looked at with suspicion, because when you have a State-controlled media as at present, there is defamation, slander, baseless reporting, adopted by the media. Why is the Government not self-regulating its own media at present without attempting to bring a code of ethics, which will inevitably control only the private media?

( ) (The Presiding Member) , 2 . ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Thank you. Will these guidelines be applied to the State media? Who will adhere to this? Who will enforce this? Ultimately, is it going to be again the Government itself? The issue dominating media today - their problem is not that there is too much freedom. The country ranks, as I said earlier, near the bottom in terms of press freedom, the world over. What is the moral basis on which this Government is contemplating to further control press freedom? I think what they should do is actually get out of the way of the free media. Stop leaning on editors and publishers. Stop buying newspapers and TV channels indirectly or directly. Self-regulation is necessary. The Press Complaints Commission of Sri Lanka was set up more than ten years ago. The Editors' Guild, the Sri Lanka Press Institute, they have undertaken to ensure that the newspapers abide by certain criteria and standards. The PCCL guidelines are on the website and the fraternity needs to take the responsibility in protecting the rights of every individual. A supplicant judiciary will ensure that the State media is insulated from the danger of laws, while the independent media will report with the sword of Damocles over its head. A free press and an independent judiciary are enemies of totalitarianism. The attempt at subjugating these two vital democratic organs offers the best clues of the future direction of this Government.

Thank you.

As a media man, I am doubly happy to take part in this Debate. I know the woes of the media persons, the ups and downs and the progress that they are making in the journalistic world. Sir, take for instance, the Lake House. In which era was it completely free? When the UNP came into power, you had your control over it and the SLFP did the same thing. Even the UNF and the other governments did the same thing.

Today, I must pay a tribute to Mr. Bandula Padmakumara and his able lieutenant Mr. Seelaratne, Director, Editorials; Mr. Senerath, Director; Mr. Upul Dissanayake, Director, Operations; Mr. Abhaya Amaradasa, general Manager, and others for producing newspapers that are worth reading. We can hold our heads high and show to the entire world how free our newspapers are. There was a time, Sir, when we said: Your name is appearing in the paper." "Which paper?" "Brown paper - because newsprint was not available those days. Now, for instance, the "Sunday Observer" newspaper. It has 104 pages. We cannot even carry it. You might have to bring a cart in order to carry the "Sunday Observer". Not to be outdone, see "The Sunday Times" newspaper, which is not controlled by the Government. I think it has 148 pages and there are so many other newspapers that have over 50 pages, especially the Sunday editions. "The Sunday Leader" newspaper has 40 pages, the "Lankadeepa" newspaper has 62 pages and the "Silumina" newspaper similarly has a large number of pages. The "Rivira" has 40 pages and the "Divaina" has 76 pages.

What does this prove, Sir? It proves that more and more people are reading newspapers now than ever before and they are all getting a large number of Government advertisements. I must say with all humility, our Government is so liberal and so free minded that they are giving advertisements to the newspapers which has made it a habit to attack the Government morning, evening, day and night. Advertisements are given to those newspapers as well. There are several newspapers here. For instance, I will show you the "Virakesari" newspaper

" 2013 05". The Government has given one full-page advertisement to the "Virakesari" newspaper; that is good, and to several others. I hope all are getting it. It is being published by

, by our Hon. Minister, to mark "World Environment Day" or "World Green Day".

I see Muslim students wearing purdahs just leaving the Gallery. Some people send messages through SMS, twitter and other websites to say that in Sri Lanka these purdahs are being grabbed by people on the roads.

I do not see the Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka. Today, Sir, I am very happy to say that the "Mahinda Chintana" has been internationalized. The other day, I had the great opportunity of going along with His Excellencys delegation on the four-day official visit to China. Now, this "Mahinda Chintana" has been translated there into Chinese language and issued there because everybody was asking for it. There was a press conference in Xiang City, Sir. At that press conference, hundred odd Chinese girls; very good journalists - media personnel who were speaking the English language said, We want to know what is this? We also want copies of it. Those people are now researching what "Mahinda Chintana" is. It is called "Mahinde Soosiang" in the Chinese language.

( ) (An Hon. Member) .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . - The country which has the largest population in the world is now researching into "Mahinda Chintana". That is how you can see to what extent the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime has made tremendous advancement in the whole of Asia.

Then, Sir, the Vice President of the People's Republic of China, Li Yuanchao said at the banquet - I have a copy of his keynote speech here - I quote, it states:

As a Myanmar saying goes, 'when the water rises, the lotus flowers grow taller'. Since the outbreak of the international financial crisis, Asian countries have been trying to find opportunities out of crisis and accelerate transformation of the development modes."

Now, look at this "Mahinda Chintana". He says, I further quote:

.... 'Mahinda Vision for the Future', the inspiring blueprint for Sri Lanka......."

This is a Chinese Leader. The Vice President says, I further quote:

...inspiring blueprint for Sri Lanka designed by President Rajapaksa, plans have been outlined to transform Sri Lanka into 'a hub of sea transport, aviation, business, energy and knowledge.' "

Today, what has happened? Here in this country, these people are suffering. As I told you, Sir, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

and others are suffering there from Mahinda phobia. They are gushing out their venom against even his children. What can we do? If the leaders cannot find children who can run races, who can play rugger, who can lead "Tharunyata Hetak," what can we do? That is why . -

( ) (The Presiding Member) . . [5.31 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana) Mr. Presiding Member, first of all, let me thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak a few words on the role of the Press Council and the media in Sri Lanka. I come from a family that has been involved in the newspaper industry even before Sri Lanka achieved Independence. So, I am proud to be standing here today in Parliament to speak a few words on this subject.

Sir, the role of the media in Sri Lanka has been a topic that has been debated throughout for many years. Since Independence, successive Governments have, through laws and even illegal methods, found ways of suppressing the media. The pressure that is exerted on journalists from the recent past to the present day has been so intense that some had lost their lives for doing their duty and many had left the country for fear of losing their lives. The remaining majority of journalists have no option than to practise an extreme form of self-censorship or become spokespersons for powerful and prominent politicians and businessmen. However, I must commend the handful of

those who still value their independence and are not scared to speak their minds.

From the Government point of view, its main criticism of the role of the media is that because of the intense competition between various publications and electronic media institutions, the media today sensationalizes news, thereby trying to grab a healthy market share. By doing this, the Government says, the media corrupts public morals. I do not wholeheartedly disagree with this view. Lately, we have seen the standard of reporting among certain publications and electronic media come down to new lows. Sensationalism of news, violation of media ethics and defamatory conduct is now rampant. It is for this reason, we are told, that the Government decided to bring back the Press Council and have a code of ethics that journalists will have to follow.

Sir, I have got a draft of the Code of Ethics that the Government plans to hand out to the media institutions. While I do not agree with this as a whole, there are certain regulations that I do agree with. For example, one is, No publication should be published which contain derogatory remarks on religious groups or communities or promoting communal or religious discord which may affect religious and communal harmony. That should be followed by all media institutions in Sri Lanka. However, there are certain regulations that are sending alarm bells as well. - [Interruption] I am just giving my observations on this.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) This is not a regulation. That is all. I just wanted to make that correction.

( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana) Thank you.

Then, there is a certain regulation which states "No publications should be published which contain criticism affecting foreign relations". This seems to be a very broad statement. If that is the case, in the future, if Sri Lanka goes into a trade agreement with another country and if we find that the trade agreement is not actually favourable to Sri Lanka, then does the media not have the power to give that opinion against that certain country? Or in the future, if the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa decides to go and hold a protest march in front of the American Embassy or the High Commission of the United Kingdom, is the press not allowed to publish that news? So, that seems to be a very broad statement. The Code of Ethics also states "No publications should be published which contain anything obscene, defamatory, deliberate falsehood and suggestive innuendos and half truths or willful omissions". This, I say, is very hypocritical

521 522

because, in my view, the very perpetrators of these ethics are the State media.

The Press Council has thus far taken no action against the State media institutions which blatantly defame opponents of this Government. The UNP has been a constant target of the State media. My Colleagues and I have also fallen victim to these despicable attacks. The Hon. Harin Fernando, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the Hon. Eran Wickaramaratne, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva and I have been branded by the ITN as traitors to this country. Some of us have been accused of seeking funds from the LTTE diaspora to topple this Government. These accusations are vile, baseless and downright defamatory. It is unfortunate that this Government would sink to the lowest depths to ridicule and defame its opponents. But, this is nothing new. The Opposition Leader, Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe has been a constant target of mudslinging by the State media.

Sir, during the last Presidential Election, when General Sarath Fonseka came forward as a common candidate, the ITN went so far as to air a film on Idi Amin the night before the election. It did not even bother to censor the explicit scenes in that film. This is why I find the Governments new Code of Ethics for journalists as somewhat a joke. If their own journalists do not adhere to the basic principles of journalism, then are these new regulations only to be adhered to by the private media institutions? If so, it is absolutely unfair and these regulations should be placed in the dustbin.

Sir, are we to air our grievances to the Press Council when we are defamed in such a manner? What redress can we expect by a Government body when the Government media themselves are the perpetrators? However, we as politicians and Members of Parliament must expect and accept a certain degree of propaganda against us. We may not have a place to go for redress, but at least we have an audience in Parliament to voice our concerns. But, what of the common man? Where can he go to voice his concerns and his plight when subjected to such harassment? If the private media have no faith in the Press Council, how can we expect the common man to do so?

It is no secret that the independent media oppose the Press Council regulations. Though the Council states that one of its primary goals is to protect the freedom of the press, the Sri Lanka Press Council Law is an archaic law and it is a tool for the Government to use as a method of controlling the media in this country. A Government body such as the Sri Lanka Press Council should not in any way have the right to fine, charge and jail journalists. In short, a Government body should not have the right to regulate the press. A free and independent press is a pillar of a vibrant democracy.

I believe the media should be accountable to itself and most importantly, to the general public. The press should be left to regulate itself. This is the practice in the neighbouring India and in many other countries. For the past ten years, Sri Lanka too, through the Press Complaints Commission, has been self-regulating its press.

Sir, the Press Complaints Commission is an independent body headed by the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinhas father, Mr. Sam Wijesinha, who is greatly respected and admired by the public. It is a non-profit making organization supported by the Newspaper Society of Sri Lanka, the Editors' Guild and the Free Media Movement. It has shown to be effective in the past where complainants have been able to get redress without spending a cent. It is a free service and since it is a non-governmental organization, the Government too does not have to bear any cost. If the press is willing to regulate itself under a Code of Ethics, there is no reason for the Government to formulate their own regulations on the media.

However, while I am an advocate of self-regulation, I admit that there are flaws in it. It is a sad fact that some owners and editors of independent press choose to sacrifice objective and responsible journalism so as to achieve their own ambitions and profits. More and more politicians and businessmen are becoming publishers for the sole reason of using their newspapers as tools to promote their private agendas or to tarnish the image of their opponents and some editors would spin vicious lies as long as they get a fat pay cheque at the end of the month.

What they forget is that they are accountable to the public. The media is the watchdog that informs and protects the public by monitoring the Government and informing on social ills. It is the duty of the publisher, most importantly the editor, to give balanced, unbiased and objective information to the reading public. When such newspapers and broadcasters have vested interests, it is unlikely that they will conform to self-regulations. However, if there are proper laws that protect the ordinary citizen from defamation, then the media has no option but to self-regulate or be subjected to damages through civil law. Rather than enacting laws to regulate media, the Government should do more to protect the citizens from defamation, libel and slander.

Sir, every citizen of this country should have the right of access to information. So, it is imperative that this Government brings into law Right to Information Bill the soonest. This law not only helps the journalist, but most importantly the ordinary citizen of this country. Sir, the Right to Information Bill will empower the citizen to question various Government Ministries and Departments on the decisions and policies that are taken by these authorities in the interest of the public. It helps promote

523 524

[ ]

2013 05

transparency and good governance, thereby keeping a check on Government spending and corruption.

In fact, having such a law is beneficial to this very Government that has been riddled with accusations of rampant corruption. By having the Right to Information Bill, the Government can show its transparency and quash these rumours. However, denying it means that there is a certain element of truth to such rumours of corruption.

The standard Government line in regard to this Bill is that it infringes on national security. Right to Information Bill does not in any way infringe on national security. It merely gives the citizen the right to find out how monies are spent, not the information on how many fighter jets or what kind of battle tanks the military has purchased.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana) Okay, Sir, I will wind up.

For example, it will give an ordinary person in the village the power to question his local council on how much they have spent on tarring the village road or who has been given the contract to tar the road. To deny this Bill is to deny the ordinary citizen of his basic fundamental right to know what his elected government is doing with his tax money.

So, Sir, I urge this Government in the name of transparency and good governance to repeal the archaic law of the Press Council Act and give the ordinary citizen his fundamental right to information.

Thank you.
