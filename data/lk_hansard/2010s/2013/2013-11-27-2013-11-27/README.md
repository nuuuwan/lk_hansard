I quote:

With the setting in of the Global recession, the economy took a downward swing until the third quarter of 2009....

That was all during our time.

... when the growth rate had fallen below 3.5 % of GDP. Despite the still unabated recession in the West, the Sri Lankan economy reversed upward in the third quarter of 2009 and attained a high growth rate of more than 8 % (Table 1), with falling unemployment and poverty, in the following two consecutive years.

I would like Table 1* to be included in Hansard.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) What is that document? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) This is what Prof. A.D.V. de S. Indraratna written to the "Sri Lanka Economic Journal" on The Impact of the Global Recession on the Sri Lankan Economy. Of course, Prof. Indraratna has other views in relation to our borrowing. That is a different matter but he appreciates the economic growth that has been made and how the economy has grown.

Even in 2013, the Opposition was predicting that there will be less revenue and the economy will be collapsing. But, our export earnings have attained a level more than last year; the tourism sector has achieved more than last year and we have picked up in the third quarter. Normally, the economy picks up in the third quarter. The economy does not pick up in the first quarter because most of the payments, transactions and income comes after the mid-year. So, the Oppositions forecast has failed.

It is the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce; . The President of the Tea Exporters' Association has commended the Budget and said that they would deliver more as surplus on tea exports.

, , the IMF and Fitch both have commended that we are on the correct path. I quote the "Financial Digest" of 25th November, 2013:

The International Monitory Fund expects Sri Lanka's economy to grow at 6.5 per cent this year and in 2014.

1053 1054

It further states that:

Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy Managing Director of the IMF, said measures taken to achieve macroeconomic stability were commendable, but the government still needed to build a policy buffer to address unexpected events. We expect 6.5 per cent GDP growth for this year and the same for the next year."

- IMF -

Then, we go to the Fitch Ratings. The Financial Review of The Island newspaper of 26th November, 2013, under the caption Fitch: Sri Lanka Continues Gradual Fiscal" states, I quote:

"Sri Lanka's 2014 budget highlights continuing success in gradual fiscal consolidation, says Fitch Ratings."

The world economic centres have collapsed. The UK has no more control over the world economy. Please understand. The world economy has shifted to the US. It will remain to play a major role. But, this Century is Asia's century. China, India, the Asia will emerge. That is what the US economists - [Interruption.] , . Read the book "The Future of Power" written by Joseph S.

It states, I quote:

Like the proverbial father - over anxious to get his ageing daughter married at any cost - who hides certain details of the groom's dubious past from the relatives, you too had to resort to many manoeuverings to overcome the objections of some of your powerful members.

In fact, in your enthusiasm to go ahead with this unholy alliance, steps were taken to conceal the legal opinion sought by you regarding the scandalous impeachment of Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranaike, earlier this year. You invited two senior jurists to tell you whether removal of the chief justice was consistent with Commonwealth values and principles.

Again, this is what I wrote, I quote:

Jeffrey Jowell, a QC who directs the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law, found that the chief justice had been ousted by an unfair process that did not comply with ....Commonwealth values and principles. The second lawyer you consulted, the late Pius Langa, a former chief justice of South Africas Constitutional Court, was even more forthright."

Here, I am quoting from the report, which was a lengthy report.

"Sri Lankas government, he concluded, had not merely contravened Commonwealth values and principles: it was sowing the seeds of anarchy and directly violating the rule of law. This opinion was also echoed by the International Commission of Jurists and the Commonwealth Lawyers Association. Not only did you ignore the opinions provided by these eminent jurists, but you failed to make these reports available to CMAG (Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group) when they met in London in April and September this year.

"" . . , . . , - 2011 - , , . * . .

I further quote:

Perhaps emboldened by apologists for this regime within the international community like you,."

By you I mean, Kamalesh Sharma.

" the Rajapaksa regime continue to violate the core values of the Commonwealth Charter with impunity. The witch hunt against the Chief Justice"

which is the real Chief Justice, Bandaranayake.

". is continuing and the Supreme Court has now become a mere appendage of the executive. Shirani Bandaranayake was summoned to court in mid-September on charges that would be laughable if they werent so vindictive: her failure to disclose."

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) If there is anything against the Standing Orders, that portion will be expunged.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, I take full responsibility for what I read. - [Interruption.] I am talking about a Resolution of the House, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. I further quote:

". empty bank accounts, it is alleged, amounts to the corrupt concealment of valuable assets. The pliant figure that Rajapaksa chose to succeed her, .. a former attorney-general and cabinet adviser, is meanwhile supervising Supreme Court judges who are soon going to be asked to rubber-stamp Bandaranayakes removal and his appointment. If, as looks likely, some of the judges prefer instead to retire, the president will get to pick their successors, at which point the last significant obstacle to executive domination will disappear.

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation which reported a Rs. 9.8 billion profit in 2005 sustained a Rs. 89.6 billion loss in 2012.

I think the Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie was in charge of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation earlier. When you were the Minister, you actually contributed to the Treasury; you contributed to the country. But, now when the Government is boasting that the GDP is moving so fast and rapidly and we have become a developed nation, all State-owned enterprises, according to their own reports, are crumbling and crumbling.

The Sri Lanka Transport Board reported a Rs. 1.1 billion loss in 2005 - of course, there was a loss in 2005 - but it increased to Rs. 4.6 billion in 2012. I cannot remember who the Transport Minister was in 2012 . Was it you, Hon. Fowzie? I do not think you were the Transport Minister. Again, I do not blame the present Transport Minister either because things are beyond his control.

The Sri Lanka Ports Authority - I am not trying to compliment myself - saw profits fall from Rs. 13.2 billion in 2005 to Rs. 5.3 billion in 2012. So, the profits are rapidly falling and what I am asking you is, why is this so

Actually, that is why I welcomed the Communiqu issued immediately after the CHOGM. I said that it is good and if these are implemented even at this late stage; we must welcome it; we must not criticize it. But, you must make sure that you implement these because, for example, in direct contravention of the Communiqu, Sri Lanka has now systematically been transformed into a major centre for money laundering. I do not think that anyone of you is aware of this. I am not blaming anyone in this House. Maybe, one or two may know but no one in the House is aware that our whole economy is being geared towards money laundering of the ill-gotten wealth so that the ill-gotten wealth of a few people can be laundered.

Item No. 49 of the Communiqu' of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting states, I quote:

"Heads of Government expressed their commitment to fight money laundering and financing for terrorism, and encouraged all countries to tackle the risks raised by the opacity of legal persons and arrangements. They agreed, in this context, to take measures to meet the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards,...."

I am sure the Hon. Minister is aware of the FATF standards. Actually, the FATF recommendations are the internationally endorsed global standards against money laundering and terrorist financing. In the FATF Recommendation 24, under"Regulation and Supervision" it states that, casinos also, if you are opening under this agreement - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon.

Now, you are trying to make this into a centre for casinos; so are you actually complying with these FATF recommendations and standards before doing so?

I do not wish it, but please remember that this two years' stint is not a permanent thing. Let our Chairman not be the first Chairman to go down in history as the person who was removed from his post while sitting on the Chair.

. . . ( ) ( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Urban Affairs) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, let me thank you for the opportunity afforded to me to speak on the Budget - 2014 presented by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa just after the conclusion of the CHOGM 2013, very successfully.

As far as the economy of Sri Lanka is concerned, it is the most productive Conference and most colourful event in the recent history of Sri Lanka, which will be written in golden letters.

As a Senior Minister, I feel proud to have associated with CHOGM 2013 and had the privilege of pleasant

1081 1082

* . * . * Produced at end of speech.

meetings with a number of Heads of Governments who attended the CHOGM, as much as I had the privilege of meeting and associating myself with the Sri Lankas first-ever international meeting of the Heads of the Non-Aligned Countries held in Colombo in 1976, during which time I happened to be the Mayor of Colombo. I was happy that many Heads of Governments who had attended previously-held three CHOGM Conferences were pleased with and appreciated the manner in which the Colombo CHOGM was organized. They said that out of the three, this is the best Conference that they have attended.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hear! Hear! ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) The President has brought a great fame to our country by hosting this event. I take pleasure in congratulating His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa for his brave action in hosting CHOGM 2013 successfully and concluding it while, at the same time, being elevated to the high position as Chairman of the Commonwealth Heads of Countries, which is a rare opportunity to serve the people of 53 Commonwealth countries.

Talking of the Budget, I wish to state that there is great relevance between CHOGM and the Budget, which is aimed at achieving for Sri Lanka, many development goals towards carrying forward the country to make it the "Wonder of Asia". However, I find that these days the Opposition has been spending much of its energy on criticizing the Government for spending on CHOGM. I wish to remind the Opposition that this spending is as good as investment that is bound to give good returns.

There is no venture without any risk. Success comes to those who dare and risk. It was because the brave President dared and undertook risk, he was able to return victorious in crushing terrorism totally and successfully. It was due to the same inspiration the country has been able to be put on a new track of development.

Impressive achievements have been made in infrastructure development including the construction of expressways, Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, overhead bridges, Hambantota Port including the expansion of Colombo Port and the countrys road network.

Information Technology has been taken to the villages through Nenasala which numbers over 3,500 centres in the country. The e-Sri Lanka Development Project has

given the people more knowledge in computer to do their routine work with Government departments and institutions more easily. The Government now plans and has proposed to venture on the next phase to launch on the project of Smart Sri Lanka.

The Government is making an economic drive towards achieving the goal of US Dollars 4,000 per capita income for Sri Lankans by 2016. The economy of Sri Lanka continues to progress and has registered a growth of 7.8 per cent in the third quarter of this year. This is well in excess of the inflation, which is expected to be around 5 to 6 per cent.

The businessmen who attended the Business Forum of CHOGM 2013 have confirmed that Sri Lanka has all the ingredients to become a tourist hub in the region because it has the necessary ability, political stability, strong leadership and infrastructure facilities in the country. The outcome of the Commonwealth Business Forum is bound to provide new energy. The Business Forum delegates were impressed with the development in the country and the conducive environment for investment. According to information, the delegates of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have decided to form into a consortium to facilitate regional development.

The Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Nawaz Sharif, during his talks with His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, has offered to put up a sugar factory in Sri Lanka, either by the Government of Pakistan or by private investors of Pakistan. Besides, they have also agreed to increase their bilateral trade to the volume, from the present US Dollars 460 million to US Dollars 1 billion in the next few years. This is one of the beneficial outcomes of the CHOGM.

A welcome feature is the increase in the inflow of Foreign Direct Investments. Sri Lanka attracted US Dollars 1.2 billion in FDI last year following the eradication of terrorism. The Board of Investment is set to sign agreements with several foreign investors, on the sideline of CHOGM for that purpose. Export industries have picked up a growth of 2 per cent. The apparel industry has shown a growth rate of 6 per cent and is expected to generate US Dollars 4,000 million export earnings this year. The total export earnings are expected to generate US Dollars 10,000 million, while the earning from foreign employment is expected to be around US Dollars 7,000 million.

This being a development-oriented Budget, the President has also taken into consideration the needs of the rural population and has made allocations to develop 1,000 bridges throughout the country. He has also considered providing allocations for the implementation of project proposals forwarded by peoples representatives with emphasis on minor irrigation

1083 1084

[ . . . ]

2013 27

projects, agricultural roads, protection from wild animals, sanitation requirements of rural schools, access roads to plantations in remote areas, lagoon rehabilitation and such improvements.

The President has also not forgotten to ease the burden of vulnerable segments of the population and has provided relief measures such as granting an increase of Rs. 1,200 Cost of Living Allowance to Government servants, an allowance of Rs. 500 to pensioners, and farmers over 63 years of age to get Rs. 1,250 as minimum pension. An interest- free loan of Rs. 250,000 to be given for women entrepreneurs under 68 years to enhance self-employment opportunities. An innovative scheme for encouraging household economy of rural areas have been announced in the Budget by offering Rs. 10,000 to the five best home garden cultivators under "Divi Neguma" in every grama sevaka division.

Apart from these welfare measures, large sums of money have been allocated to health and education paying particular attention in containing non-communicable illnesses such as stroke, cancer and kidney disease.

The main criticism of the Opposition has been that the Government is borrowing largely from foreign countries. The Government has not borrowed for consumption purposes, but for investment in development projects. As far as the Government is concerned, it has been prompt in its repayment of debts.

I am concerned, as the Senior Minister for Urban Affairs, about upgrading facilities for the urban population. The estimated increase in our urban population during the period 2005 to 2015 is about 3 per cent while the population increase in the entire country is about 1.2 per cent. It has also been estimated that 50 per cent of the total population will live in urban areas by the year 2015. Our Government has given priority to a planned approach, having understood the importance of strategies to be followed for developing infrastructure facilities in urban areas in order to provide basic facilities to the poor urban population with a view to minimize the difficulties developing fast in those areas, towards sustainable urban development depending on the speed and extent of urbanization.

I have coordinated with the Central Government, the provincial councils and local authorities individually and jointly regarding the common problems pertaining to water supply, sanitation and waste disposal, which are common features seen not only in the City of Colombo, but also in the cities outside. Sir, I have also taken action to coordinate some of the Divi Neguma programmes for the benefit of the urban poor, especially in Jaffna, Mannar, Vavuniya, Polonnaruwa and Galle.

Sir, the Budget, 2014 has given priority to extend the Government's present urban development activities to cover Kandy, Badulla, Kurunegala, Galle, Ratnapura, Anuradhapura, Jaffna and Trincomalee. The expressways proposed to be constructed next year will connect the neighbouring township to important services.

As I mentioned earlier, people living in urban areas without proper facilities are leading their lives with great difficulty. The proposal made in the Budget to upgrade and modernize the existing housing schemes in Colombo and the suburbs, the increase of the allocation of Rs. 1,200 million to Rs. 2,000 million to also develop the other housing schemes and allocating Rs. 500 million to double the housing construction programme undertaken by the NHDA for low-income people are commendable.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, please wind up now as we have to suspend for lunch.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Sir, please give me one more minute.

These programmes will bring immense benefit to the people living in urban areas. The decision taken to guarantee that nobody would be moved out of Colombo in this resettlement process is also commendable.

Sir, the Budget, 2014 has also allocated funds to construct 50,000 new housing units with facilities in 15 locations to house all currently living in temporary shelters. These facilities will bring many benefits to the people living in the urban and semi-urban areas. They will be able to start their own small businesses, generate more income and live happily in a very conducive environment. Although the Opposition has criticized the allocation of so much money to this sector, as the Senior Minister for Urban Affairs, I am very happy that His Excellency the President, as Minister of Finance and Planning, has made these proposals to upgrade the living standard of the urban poor and I thank him for considering their plight.

The Opposition has been critical of the Budget every time it has been presented. But, the Government has been proved right by the people who had endorsed its proposal at every election that has taken place in the past years. I am sure that this Budget too would be endorsed by the people at the forthcoming provincial council elections. I, therefore, request the Opposition to be realistic and support the Budget without objecting as the economy of the country is strong and steadily growing. The country had withstood the economic recession in the powerful Western countries due to the economic strategy adopted by the Government. In short, the President wanted to

1085 1086

ensure quality life for the people and save the country from economic downfall.

Sir, I wish to conclude with the words of His Excellency Tony Abbott, the Australian Prime Minister, who said Sri Lanka has a bright future under the leadership of President Mahinda Rajapaksa and added, Today is better than yesterday and tomorrow will be better than today".

Sir, I will quote now from an article in "The Sunday Times" of 10th November, 2013 titled, "Absence of Kadirgamar: Tragedy for minorities, disaster for the majority", because it is very important.

In 1996, he told parliament why he entered politics. 'I am here only to do one thing, and that is to help my country as best as I can to solve the gravest problem of our time and if I can make a miniscule contribution towards that effort, that will be enough for me till the end of my days. I seek nothing else.'

Listen and take his advice. The article goes on to state, I quote:

Having said that, he went further: 'Our approach to our national problem must surely be bipartisan because the task ahead of us is one of immense magnitude and of utmost gravity and under those circumstances, you will never find that I will run away under fire.'

We owe it to the memory of Lakshman Kadirgamar

He was a great man. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) Learn from him; stick to that policy. Do not act as babies. You all are immature politicians. You and your leaders are telling "Cinderella Stories" and this country is being ruined.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . .

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) You are going to be under India; not only under India. What happened to Iran? Iran's economy has collapsed. Then, Iran had to surrender to the Geneva package. Do not go into such an economic crisis, I am warning you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . . 12 .

[2.00 p.m.] ( ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa - Deputy Minister of Water Supply and Drainage) Hon. Presiding Member, the 9th Budget of the UPFA Government presented by His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa on 21st November is an inclusive Budget, granting benefits and relief to all sections of society. This Budget, presented in the wake of the dividends of peace and tranquility achieved after the conclusion of the 30-year war in 2009, is driven by long-term development goals. It does not emulate the traditional budgets, which addressed the needs of only one year, hitherto presented by previous governments.

In this context, it is important to state here that His Excellency the President is the only leader of our State who has been able to unite the minorities through regional economic development. In fact, the successfully concluded recent elections to the Northern Provincial Council held after almost 25 years clearly reflect the confidence the people of the North have in the democratic process offered by our Government.

His Excellency the President gave leadership to the recently concluded first ever Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held in South Asia, which brought Sri Lanka into the limelight. The CHOGM has set the foundation to enhance the ongoing economic development of the country further, attracting foreign investments from the 53 nations and the connecting global markets.

Our tourist industry got a tremendous boost due to the CHOGM. The consequent economic and social benefits of the Meeting to our population are extensive, and I might add that the seeds for close collaboration among the Commonwealth of Nations have been sown, which will ensure our future prosperity.

Sri Lanka, under the able leadership of our President and embracing the ideals of the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future, is surely in the process of attaining the status of a developed country.

Sir, we all know for a fact that currently Sri Lanka is undergoing a dynamic revolution in infrastructure development. The Colombo-Katunayake Expressway, the Southern Expressway, the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, the Colombo South Harbour Development Project, the Magam Ruhunupura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port, the Northern Railway Project, the Colombo South Port Project and a host of mega and mini construction projects all over the Island will broaden the economic activities, and consequently our horizons.

These development projects vastly improve our access within and outside the country. They greatly enhance the efficiency of delivery of products and services, eliminate delays, reduce production costs through improved access to markets and thereby improve our productivity.

Within merely four years since the end of the war, our Government has made quantum leaps in planning and implementation of infrastructure development not only in roads and rail transport, but also in telecommunication, aviation, tourism, electricity, postal services, water and sanitation.

I must make special mention of the Ruhunupura Water Supply Project, for which a sum of Rs. 2,440 million has been provided. This will ensure clean, safe drinking water for the people of Hambantota.

Another significant step undertaken by our Government is the beautification of the cities and environmental protection. Roads, parks and walkways have been constructed in the Colombo City to enable the urban population to exercise and keep fit and healthy. Currently, the Metropolitan areas of Colombo and outstation cities are undergoing the same changes, which will provide our population better facilities and peaceful and pleasant environments.

In this context, I wish to thank the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development, Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, without whose direction and guidance this would not have been achieved.

Analysing the direction of the overall economy of Sri Lanka, under the UPFA Government, the country has registered a 6.4 per cent economic growth in 2013 and it is expected to exceed 7 per cent this year. The Budget deficit has been reduced to 5.8 per cent of GDP this year. Inflation is projected to be below 6 per cent in 2014. Foreign employment continues to be the foremost foreign exchange earner. Tourism is booming and arrivals will exceed over two million before the end of next year.

The Budget Proposals have been prepared by His Excellency after consultations with all sections of the society. So, the Budget reflects the aspirations of farmers, trade unions, both public and private sector, womens organizations, civil society organizations, small and medium sector industrialists, major industrialists, exporters, banking organizations, plantation companies, small holders et cetera.

The Budget provides relief and development proposals to benefit each sector.

A core intent of the Budget is to revive and enhance the productivity of both State and private sector institutions. In the post-CHOGM era, Sri Lanka will be able to initiate closer multilateral cooperation in all fields.

Agriculture is our main industry. To support and encourage our farmers, the President has proposed that fertilizer subsidy will continue. Paddy farmers will get all varieties of fertilizer at Rs. 350 per 50 kilogram bag. A subsidized price of Rs. 1,250 per 50 kilogram bag will also be continued for all other crops.

Another milestone victory for the farmers is the Budget Proposal to implement a pension scheme to provide a minimum of Rs. 1,250/- for those over 63 years of age.

I must also mention the efforts of the Minister of Economic Development, Hon. Basil Rajapaksa in transforming the villages into economic centres of production. The Budget proposes to develop 125,000 model home gardens under "Divi Neguma" and grant Rs. 10,000/- each to the five best "Divi Neguma" home gardens in each grama niladari division. Further, loans up to Rs. 25,000/- are to be given to the "Divi Neguma" families to develop greenhouse farms, poultry, livestock and fish farms and handlooms and small industries.

The Budget also proposes the construction of 1,000 bridges in villages situated in difficult and inaccessible areas to provide our rural folk with ability for quick transportation and distribution of their products and easy access to facilities.

As I said earlier, the Budget provides incentives and relief to almost all sectors. A womens micro enterprise credit guarantee scheme is to be implemented under which capital loans of Rs. 250,000 are to be given to women entrepreneurs without collateral security. This will empower the rural women to undertake many micro projects especially in remote villages.

The Budget Proposals also provide relief to small businesses and the self-employed by the issue of "Divi Neguma" entitlement cards at a cost of Rs. 500. This will exempt them from making multiple payments to local authorities. A large number of self-employed persons will receive benefits under this scheme.

The health and education budgets have been increased substantially and major reforms have been proposed. The creation of child-friendly school systems, developing laboratories, teacher training, quality improvement of text books and teaching materials and the introduction of technology streams will be given priority. Heavy investment in infrastructure development in health sectors is planned to provide free medical services to the public. Rupees 1,000 million has been voted for development of the fisheries industry.

The Government has expanded welfare support for the elderly, the differently-abled and the low-income families. Infusion of funding on skills education for the youth has been proposed. Hostel construction for

1117 1118

university students at a cost of Rs. 15,000 million is undertaken. Sri Lankan youth will have the opportunity to participate in the United Nations World Youth Conference to be held in Colombo in 2014.

Another major step of the UPFA Government is to build 50,000 houses for plantation workers and to elevate the standards of living of the plantation workers. Incentives and relief have been provided to both smallholder plantations and large-scale plantations. Milk production is to be increased by the importation of 20,000 high-quality cows.

I am happy to note that the parents of the three Forces have been provided with living allowances. The Police Force will have three new housing schemes constructed to ease their housing problems. The pubic servants' Cost of Living Allowance will be increased by Rs. 1,200 per month from January 2014.

His Excellency the President has not only submitted a working Budget but a forward-looking and development-oriented Budget. It is an unparalleled humanitarian Budget that will propel Sri Lanka towards becoming the "Wonder of Asia".

Finally, I respectfully ask the House to unanimously endorse the 9th Budget of the UPFA. Let us support His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa to lead our nation to the ideal state where each and every Sri Lankan, regardless of religion, ethnicity, caste, creed, social or economic background can live peacefully with dignity and contentment.

At the outset, Sir, let me refer to two important studies that have recently been carried out by two important agencies. The first is the study that has been carried out by the Royal Commonwealth Society which, all of you are aware of. In that study, they have considered some important parameters like peace, democracy, gender gap, education and social development indicators. The Royal Commonwealth Society has placed Sri Lanka at the 68th position out of 190 countries - that is something very important - and out of the 52 Commonwealth countries, Sri Lanka is placed at the 15th position.

The second is the study conducted by the Global AgeWatch. You know that Sri Lanka's population is one of the fastest ageing populations in the world. In their study, the Global AgeWatch has considered the facilities provided for the elderly population in different countries. They have analysed almost 100 countries and have placed Sri Lanka at the 36th position. So, Sri Lanka, as a country, has now gone very far in the social level and they have very clearly indicated that Sri Lanka would be positioned further ahead, at the 30th or 20th position, in the years to come.

(Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of the Budget - 2014, which as in previous years, has a number of very innovative ideas. These, if implemented coherently, will do much to alleviate poverty and ensure the equity which this Government has driven to promote. It is a remarkable achievement that despite the difficulties of the last few years, we have continued to have what The Sunday Times in England described as a rate of economic growth that would inflame the loins of George Osborne, which I believe is meant to suggest jealousy rather than sexual excess. This was in a hard-hitting attack made on David Camerons arrogant behaviour that ended up suggesting that he should apologize. But, for this growth to continue, we need to ensure that we have clear-cut policies to attract investment as well as better human resource development policies with mechanisms to monitor performance. These and systems of grass-roots consultation as laid down in the "Mahinda Chintana" are essential if growth is to be sustainable and equitable. Such consultation has contributed to the formulation of the Budget as is clear from the account of agrarian development.

1181 1182

I, myself have drawn attention to the problems identified by farming communities, Muslim, Sinhala and Tamil, following discussions at the divisional secretary's level and to their urgent need for comprehensive water policy as well as protection from wild animals. I am happy that the Government is responding so readily but as noted it is important to ensure that those in need are kept informed of measures that will be taken together with a time frame.

It is also important that the Budget notes to deal swiftly with the kidney disease that has taken such a toll in rural communities and I hope the large allocation made for water purification plants will be used swiftly and sensibly. I should note that these are needed in other provinces too as I found in the Western divisions of the Trincomalee District.

It is encouraging, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that much is being done to strengthen agriculture extension services. As an enlightened Divisional Secretary in the East put it, the people should be selling, not paddy but rice. They should also be selling rice products. That is why we need a comprehensive policy with regard to value addition which the Ministry of Agriculture was not in a position to promote this year but to which, I trust, much attention will be given in 2014 as the Budget suggests. This is particularly true with regard to milk production and the investment that the Budget details with regard to cattle, is most welcome. But, this should go hand in hand with reservation of grazing grounds which has not taken place leading to great hardships to both cultivators and herdsmen. It would also be useful if productivity in this area were tied to another very good idea in the Budget, namely, the promotion of entrepreneurship amongst women with increased access to credit. Given the crucial position of women in the North, we would have done better in winning hearts and minds had we made efforts to ensure adequate facilities for women to engage in business activity and to encourage co-operative efforts. But, I should also note that this is necessary all over the country and I trust the provisions in this regard that the Budget introduces will promote the empowerment of women that this country so solely needs.

In this context, Mr. Deputy Speaker, of moving from dependency to empowerment, I must commend the imaginative Commonwealth Youth Forum Declaration, which stresses the need to promote entrepreneurship. Given this perception of our young people, it is vital that our education system and our human resources development policies do not lag behind. The Budget promises much, but we have to make sure that implementation is swift and cohesive and that the imaginative new approach to education, which we all agree is essential is not destroyed by hidebound thinking.

The new technical stream in schools needs to be taught not just in 100 schools, but in at least two schools in each division. Skills training for which the Budget has made a lot of funding available needs to be fast-tracked as the Budget Speech envisages with more training centres in each division. We must also popularize a modular approach that will ensure soft skills too and progress not simply to diplomas but to degree level since otherwise our youngsters will not be competitive. This should be done also through partnerships where possible and for this purpose, we must encourage a range of service providers including those based in other countries who will be able to promote productive employment elsewhere too for talented youngsters.

With regard to youth, it should also be noted that one grave problem they have faced has been lack of attention to leisure facilities. Leisure is ignored in our planning but leisure can be immensely productive. As the imaginative Secretary to the Ministry of Child Development has noted the right to leisure is as important as any other. It is thus extremely satisfying that the Budget recognizes the importance of this amongst the other services that are the responsibility of Pradeshiya Sabhas, but which have generally been neglected. This has been because of the lack of resources as well as the lack of understanding of the scope of local government. But, the Budget makes it clear that these responsibilities must be taken seriously. In this context, the recent initiative of the relevant ministries together with the UN to promote coordination and attention to productive outcomes of what the Budget terms Community Infrastructure Facilities is most welcome. It is hoped that this will encourage efficient and effective use of the resources the Budget provides to local government bodies.

There is much more to commend in the Budget. But, since time is short, let me refer to just two or three more areas in which innovation in the interest of efficiency and better service to the public has been suggested.

I hope the commitment to adopt technology in legal matters will lead to more comprehensible legislation instead of the current practice of piling amendments upon amendments. In most modern dispensations, new legislation is introduced through repeal of preceding legislation and introduction of a clean new bill as it were, instead of relying on lawyers to interpret amendments to amendments. At the same time, we must reduce recourse to legislation and the commitment, therefore, to develop arbitration which should be extended to mediation also is most welcome. It is also welcome that Government plans to simplify regulations since the profusion of restrictions we have built up does not help the public and contribute to the worst forms of rent-seeking. In this context, I hope the Government will swiftly implement at least a few of the recommendations of the Committee on Public Enterprises, which his Excellency the President complimented understandably, since it seems to be the

1183 1184

[ ]

2013 27

only productive committee in Parliament, given our failure to address the gaps in the existing Standing Orders.

I hope the proposals I have made in this regard will be looked at swiftly in terms of the procedures laid down in the Standing Orders, without our continuing to ignore them as though to suggest that due process is not important. Such an approach is not conducive to the strengthening of Parliament, which all agree, is a necessity.

With regard to a very different matter, Sir, I was pleased with the mention made in the Budget Speech that renewable energy generation has increased up to 422 megawatts. However, while I can understand the stress on coal power, given the prohibitive cost of oil, I am sorry that the commitment to encourage new investments that would increase the production of renewable energy has not been spelt out. We need to move swiftly to develop solar, wind and Dendro energy and we should not allow those who have been involved in the importation of oil and even of coal to stand in the way of new plants.

In addition to helping with protection of environment, such initiatives will also enhance the incomes of farmers and herdsmen. The Renewable Energy Authority - the Minister is here now - has prepared plans for glyricidia plants. Farmers and planters should be encouraged to grow glyricidia on a large scale since this can be done along with traditional crops. But, given the scale of production that would be needed, it is vital that Government encourages such initiatives.

Finally, let me note the importance of the understanding expressed in the Budget Speech of the anomaly of so much child abuse and violence against women in what we would like to think of as a value-based society, we must develop cohesive mechanisms to deal with this and to ensure better counselling mechanisms for the victims. For years I have been urging greater attention to counselling. But, unfortunately, many officials have been in a state of denial about the gravity of the problem. They have built up a myth of a society that is free from such problems which has aggravated matters. So, the commitment in the Budget to dealing with such matters in a more realistic fashion is welcome.

As previously, His Excellency the President has alliterated a wide ranging vision and allocated resources to the support mechanisms and development initiatives that we need. But, we must hope that implementation will live up to this vision. Thank you.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Chief Government Whip? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The Hon. Member raised the question of him being deprived of time to make a speech. This House has adopted, at times, a certain criterion: the Chair has given rulings recognizing such Member. According to the relevant Standing Order, the Member who first catches the eye of the Hon. Speaker has to be recognized, if the Member gets up on that basis. I am supporting this

position because no Member should be deprived of speaking in Parliament, especially on the Budget. If it is on any other debate, we can understand.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Certainly. Since he declares himself as an independent Member, we will have to, at the Party Leaders Meeting, take a decision on his right to speak in Parliament as a Member of Parliament. So, Hon. Member, according to you, if you continue to be an independent Member from now onwards, I will take it up with the Hon. Speaker and let him take an appropriate decision in agreement with the Chief Government Whip.
