In the history of the Sri Lankan Tourism Industry, we were able to receive more than one million tourists up to 30th November, 2013. Accordingly, our total income from tourism is more than Rs. 1 billion. The Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau is making many arrangements to promote Sri Lanka in Russia, Ukraine, Japan, China, India and in many places. We are making all efforts to promote Sri Lanka internationally.

During the CHOGM 2013, over 150 travel and tour operators from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, China, India, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, UAE, Saudi Arabia and the UK participated at the Tourism Forum. Thirty five travel industry representatives from other countries also participated.

After the establishment of peace in Sri Lanka, a special mechanism was formed at the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority to facilitate investors who are interested in investing in tourism-related projects.

Finally, I take this opportunity to express my thanks and gratitude to the Minister, Hon. Basil Rajapaksa for his leadership and guidance to develop the country manifold. He shows great enthusiasm in the Ministrys administration, regional development, investment and projects, livelihood development, tourism promotion, self-employment, poverty alleviation, investment and

tourism, and school development. Our Hon. Ministers hard work is par excellence and it is very lively to work with him.

Thank you. [.. 3.23] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , .

It is the barometer of the economy. So, how will these two Ministries certainly reflect the overall view on the countrys economy for the perception of the people? I think there is a big question mark regarding that. , 200 300 . 10 15. . .

A realistic value of the rupee is essential at a time when you basically have an export-driven economy. My political Guru, the late Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali said, Either you export or perish. We are not second to that stage at the moment. Our Balance of Payments is having a deficit because of this problem. So, on that particular score, we need to ensure that the export-driven approach and import-substitution approach are taken into account not only in terms of Balance of Payments, but also in terms of the labour unemployment problem that prevalent. So, on that particular basis, I would like you to ensure that -

Hon. Minister of Plantation Industries, I am making only one request. Now, everything is going very well in the estates. We are so happy with the Government because many proposals in the Budget are partly for the Plantation Sector. Unfortunately, in the estates of the JEDB-[Interruption.] On the other hand, your department always files cases against staff in the estates.

( ) (An Hon. Member) Is it bad? ( ) (The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam) It is not bad. They are finding ways. We have already found some ways . Within one or two months we will solve that. What I am trying to say is, do to take any action in between. That is the only request I am making.

During the UNP period, so many cases were filed in the courts against estate workers who retired. They were called "squatters". They are not squatters; they had no place to go. After their retirement, they have to remain in these estates. That is our fate. Now, it is not the case. No cases are filed against estate workers. If there are any cases - [Interruption.] He knows it. That is why I am telling him. I am asking you, why are you interpreting? You do not have to interpret my speech, because I know what I am talking about and the Hon.Minister can also understand. The only request I make to the Hon. Minister is, as far as employment, electricity and housing are concerned -

551 552

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Plantation Industries) Sir, with your permission, may I say that I will certainly look into it.

( ) (The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam) Thank you. You will do it. You are seated with my Minister. I think he has already told you to look into this. Thank you very much. I know him. He is with the poor people. The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa is known by over two billion people in Sri Lanka. We say, '' in Tamil. In Sinhala also they say, Kooti. Two billion people know who the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa is, because everybody is benefited by his toiling.

( ) (An Hon. Member) What about the Hon.Thodaman? ( ) (The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam) Everybody knows the Hon.Thondaman also. I think you do not know. - [Interruption.] You and I always complain to Colombo - only to cities and not to the rural sector.- [Interruption.] I have worked with you. I have been with you and I was elected in your list sometime back. - [Interruption.] Nothing happened. - [Interruption.] Who? - [Interruption.] Even if he contested, these people would have come. At that time, we wanted to help you to bring more Members to Parliament. That is the reason why we were with you. If we were not with you, of course, you would have been in the same position that you are in now, even at that time.

With these words I conclude. Thank you very much. [.. 4.11] ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) , . . . . , . , . . . , ?

[4.46 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana) Mr. Presiding Member, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak a few words on the Votes of the Ministry of Economic Development.

Sir, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has stated that the development of this country has risen to about 8 per cent per annum. It is evident that there is considerable growth with infrastructural improvements such as new highways, airports and ports. However, whether these infrastructure developments will bring the necessary foreign investment to the country is still to be seen.

Sir, the President, in his speech at CHOGM declared that under his leadership, the Government has reduced the poverty rate from 15.2 per cent in 2007 to 6.5 per cent in 2013. However, according to the Central Bank Report of 2012, there are 1.6 million families living under the poverty line. Taking an average of about four persons per family, we have 6.2 million living under the poverty line, and therefore, they are poor. Sri Lanka has a population of 18 million; so 6.2 million means that one-third of Sri Lankas population is poor. If that is so, then it does not correspond with the remarks made by the President at CHOGM; either the President has got his facts wrong or the Central Bank has got its facts wrong. But, one thing is certain. Even with an 8 per cent growth, the disparity between the haves and the have-nots has widened. While the super rich can drive around in Lamborghinis and participate in night races, the middle-income earners have been burdened by increases in taxes on reconditioned vehicles.

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera - Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare)Sir, I rise to a point of Order. The Hon. Member said that the population of Sri Lanka is 18 million. It is wrong. .

( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana) Sir, the Presidents statement on the reduction of families in poverty must be scrutinized more thoroughly. The statement raises more questions than answers to a national problem. For example, the poverty line is a creation of the Department of Census and Statistics that comes under the purview of the President as the Finance Minister. According to the Department of Census and Statistics, any person who earns les than Rs. 3,545 per month lives under the poverty line, that is US Dollars 28 a month or less than a dollar a day. According to a report

571 572

by the Institute of Policy Studies, 23 per cent of the population earns less than US Dollars 2 a day, that is roughly Rs. 260 a day. This is in a country where the Government stated, that last year the GNP per capita was US Dollars 2,400, further reinforcing my point about the rising inequality.

However, Sir, according to the Fiscal Management Report that was handed to us, a family of four requires an income of Rs. 49,000 per month to live, somewhat, comfortably. It is evident that there is no clear picture as to whether there is a drastic reduction in the poverty level in this country.

Further, whilst the Budget has allocated Rs. 16.8 billion for Samurdhi relief and a further Rs. 10 billion to the Samurdhi Authority for administration purposes, I cannot accept that the money is going to the people who really need them.

If the Government is true to its word, and poverty has in fact reduced, then it is high time that Samurdhi funds are stopped from being given to people as political favours but the huge bureaucracy administrating it, is used to identify those in real need and disburse a fair Samurdhi grant only to them. During the time of our Government, the Janasaviya Programme helped poor people to a much greater degree than this Governments Samurdhi. The Government just used this to add a further level of bureaucracy that resulted in a programme that now costs Rs. 10 billion per annum to administer. It shamefully has not identified the people in need and instead doles out small amounts that do not even cover the cost of a packet of 400 gm. milk powder to over 1.5 million families and political friends in a very haphazard manner, while the real poor often do not get anything and are often victimized politically by refusing to grant their need.

Mr. Presiding Member, one initiative that was taken by the Government to eradicate poverty is the "Divi Neguma" Programme. Under this Programme, it was proposed to set up 100 home-garden based economic units in every Grama Niladhari Division. There are 14,000 Grama Nildhari Divisions in Sri Lanka. However, most Grama Niladhari Divisions do not have 100 families with home-gardens. So, we will have to see, in the future, whether this "Divi Neguma" Programme is successful or not.

Then, there is the "Divi Neguma" Fund, and it is essential that you ensure - with all the data available at the Governments fingertips - that only the people who deserve assistance get these funds and it is not used as just another entitlement. Either the Government is lying about the true extent of poverty in Sri Lanka by misleading this House and making false statements around the world, or they are disbursing funds to people as a bribe or a threat to get their support.

The Budget Estimates of the Ministry of Economic Development last year contained over 60 pages of analyses of the proposed spending. This year it has come down to 30 pages with all the previous details removed. There are no details given as to how the Rs. 25 billion allocated for the regional projects is to be spent. Is it because the Budget process is now proved to be not worth the paper that it is printed on, as it can be changed at the whim of the Government without Parliamentary approval? That is my only conclusion. The level of misleading information would have probably become too much for the creator that he dropped it as it was meaningless anyway.

Mr. Presiding Member, it is clear that this Government is not following the path towards sustainable development. Poverty reduction, reduction in inequality and protection of the environment are imperative in achieving sustainable development. Sustainable development is a development process that considers economic and social development along with environmental development and protection. In 2009, the Government launched an Action Plan on the "Haritha Lanka" Programme for sustainable development. In its Action Plan, it defined 10 broad areas such as clean air, fauna and flora, ecosystems, climate change, coastal belt and sealand resources, solid waste, green cities, industries and knowledge dissemination.

However, according to a study, the air pollution in Sri Lanka is at 73 per cent.

Drinking water pollution is at 52 per cent. It is imperative that the people, especially in a district with a very rapid increase in population, where people from other districts move there for employment and housing, are provided with adequate quality drinking water.

When one talks about infrastructure, the provision of clean drinking water is part of this, not only the massive spending on expressways. The people of the Gampaha District who suffer numerous problems in obtaining clean drinking water must have their needs looked into immediately.

Sir, the promises made by the Government are merely promises to win elections and forgotten soon after.

Mr. Presiding Member, the latest threat is the Governments intention of permitting the cutting down of forests in lands under the Ministry of Plantation Industries to fund the EPF payment of its employees. What have they done with the funds deducted from the workers' wages? Why has it not been paid to the EPF? Who has purloined this money? Why should our trees be cut to pay for the inability of State institutions to manage their affairs and thereby put a further threat on our already fragile environment?

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Plantation Industries) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. The Hon. Member referred to the Ministry of Plantation Industries and the EPF payments. There is no such shortfall from our side.

( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana) I am talking about the forests which are under the Ministry of Plantation Industries, not the EPF.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Not under the Ministry of Plantation Industries. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Okay, thank you very much, Hon. Minister. Hon. Member, now please wind up. I will give you one more minute to please conclude your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member.

So, not a day passes without an incident of tree felling or encroaching on forest land. Most of the incidents point to the culpability of Government henchmen, Members of the Pradeshiya Sabhas and Chairmen, all faithful supporters of the Government. So, it is time that the Government tightens the regulations that do exist to protect the environment and not use development as an excuse to degrade the environment.

Therefore, I implore the Government to put more resources into achieving the sustainable development that is needed for this country and cut down wastages on spending by this Government.

Thank you.
