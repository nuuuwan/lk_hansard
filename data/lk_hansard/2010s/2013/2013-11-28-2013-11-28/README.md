Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. CHANDIMA WEERAKKODY] took the Chair.

[11.05 a.m.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am happy to follow the Hon. Minister of External Affairs, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris. His Excellency the President in his capacity as Minister of Finance has presented his 9th Budget. When he presented his 9th Budget, he had also assumed duties as Chairman of the Commonwealth. This would, no doubt, entail additional duties and responsibilities, which hopefully would have a beneficial impact on governance in this country.

The Budget has been formulated so as to satisfy most segments in this country in some way to keep them generally happy. I do not see any particular effort being made to address wasteful expenditure in the country; that there is a great deal of waste in this country of the wealth of the common people is without question. I am sure the people would much prefer such wasted resources being more beneficially utilized so as to benefit them.

The issue of enhancing our exports, in my view, could have been given greater attention because eventually, the future of our economy in its various aspects is going to largely depend upon how much we are

able to earn in foreign exchange. In passing, I might say that running casinos may not be the most sensible way to address this need.

With these few preliminary observations, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I wish to address some of the serious issues that afflict this country. Governance in this country is based on the premise that this country was for a long period, around two-and-a-half to three decades afflicted with a serious menace, the LTTE, and the assumption that the physical elimination of the LTTE has restored peace and normalcy with equity and justice. Nothing, I submit, can be further from the truth. The LTTE was the manifestation of a grave problem that had long existed in this country from shortly after Independence consequent to justice and equity not being meted out to all its peoples on equal terms. The incipient phase of this manifestation in the form of the LTTE occurred only in the late '70s, almost three decades after the country attained Independence. At the earlier stages, the manifestation of the LTTE seemed inevitable and even justified. It was the several aberrations, primarily the adoption by the LTTE of an authoritarian approach and the disrespect for democracy and human rights that tarnished the image of justification and eventually resulted in several countries the world over, branding the LTTE as a terrorist organization.

It is those countries which so banned the LTTE and which indeed crippled the LTTE thereby, that are now stating quite clearly that there must be a political solution because these countries realize that there were valid causes for the conflict to emerge, that the said valid causes continue and are a recurring phenomenon and that unless there is a political solution that addresses these causes effectively, there can be no reconciliation. The Sri Lankan Government, on the contrary, seems to think quite erroneously that with the physical demise of the LTTE, peace and normalcy have returned to the country, however spurious such a claim maybe, and that everything is indeed hunky dory. This is the quagmire in which Sri Lanka is presently entangled and Sri Lanka, it appears, needs a great deal of assistance to disentangle itself from this situation. This basic reality, in my submission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, needs to be borne in mind in addressing the current situation in Sri Lanka.

Judging by what is happening in this country today, Sir, I would think that there are two critical words that have a bearing on the future of this country and those words are "accountability" and "reconciliation". Genuine reconciliation is not possible unless there is credible accountability. Unfortunately, one observes impunity in every area of activity moving towards authoritarianism. The treatment of the Tamil people is worse than what it has been ever before. Since the LTTE, an armed Tamil organization, has been defeated, anything can be done to the Tamil people in whatever field, and they have to accept it, however unjust such actions maybe. This is the

1261 1262

2013 28

attitude currently prevalent. The position, I might repeat, Mr. Deputy Speaker, has never been as bad as at present ever before. The primary cause for this is the all-pervasive military environment in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, even from the positions of the Governors of those provinces to a military Government Agent, the ubiquitous involvement of the military in every sphere of activity, a general sense of fear even amongst Tamil Public servants to do the right thing by the Tamil people and the Tamil people feeling utterly helpless and destitute in this deplorable situation.

The attitude seems to be that the Tamil people must be made to realize that it is only by supporting the Government, that they can expect equal or just treatment. If they do not, they will be punished. The Tamil people are too resilient a people to put up with such insult and indignity; the consequence is that their suffering continues and the question is, for how long can this continue?

This is demonstrated, Sir, in the electoral verdicts in the Provincial Council Elections in the North and the East conducted in 2012 and 2013 respectively, despite the most troubled conditions, despite numerous difficulties and deficiencies faced by the Tamil people. Out of the 12 Tamil Members elected to the Eastern Provincial Council, 11 were from the Tamil National Alliance and of the 32 Tamil Members elected to the Northern Provincial Council, 29 were from the Tamil National Alliance. It was virtually a clean sweep of the Tamil vote, indicating beyond any manner of doubt, the legitimate aspirations of the Tamil people for an acceptable political solution granting the people of the Northern and Eastern Provinces substantial, genuine political autonomy within the framework of a united, undivided Sri Lanka. This was the platform, Sir, on the basis of which the elections were conducted in both the Northern and Eastern Provinces. The Tamil people are beginning to increasingly think that though this is their clear democratic verdict consistent with their democratic wishes ever since Independence, their verdict will not be respected and that they will be punished for not supporting the ruling party. Is this not, Mr. Deputy Speaker, unbridled authoritarianism? The highest institutions at the national level such as an independent higher Judiciary, independent civilian institutions such as independent Election Commission, independent Human Rights Commission, independent Public Service Commission and independent National Police Commission, independent Judicial Service Commission, independent Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption are suborned and made ineffectual by the nullification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution and the abolition of the Constitutional Council depriving the people of this country, in particular, the badly-affected Tamil people of equality, equity and justice at the hands of these institutions manned by independent and impartial persons.

The hasty and vindictive, purported impeachment of the Chief Justice, Dr. (Mrs.) Shirani Bandaranayake in violation of all principles of natural justice, I submit, for the reason that she upheld the provisions of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution relating to provincial autonomy immediately after she delivered the said Judgments, are clearly indicative of the true authoritarian attitude of the current Government.

On the vital issue of powers pertaining to State land, the judgment delivered by the new Chief Justice by the Court presided over by him, who was appointed by this Government after the impeachment and who prior to such appointment was an adviser to the Chief Executive and other Senior Executives and which judgment is inconsistent with other judgments delivered by the Supreme Court thus far pertaining to State land, has been a grave denial of provincial autonomy and is in keeping with the present Governments current thinking on the vital issue of State land. This demonstrates the true position.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, Elections to the Northern Provincial Council have been held more than four years after the conflict came to an end. The elections were held on account of intense international pressure. The question of elections being held was even included in the last resolution adopted by the UN Human Rights Council in March, 2013. While it may be said that nothing brazen happened on election day, fortunately, there were international and also national observers of the election process. The Northern Provincial Council Election was discussed at international fora. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting was due to be held shortly. The international spotlight was on the Northern Provincial Council Election and therefore, as I said, nothing brazen happened on election day. It was not, however, without serious blemish. I will deal with this issue, Sir, in the course of the debates on some other vote.

However, I must record that strenuous efforts were made to frustrate the democratic wish of the Tamil people. But, the people were resilient and through their peaceful vote they demonstrated their strength. I want to on the Floor of this House, express to our people our strongest admiration of the determined resoluteness that they demonstrated.

The people are waiting to see what would happen at least in the Northern Province. Will the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution under which the Elections were held be fully implemented in letter and spirit? Will it be the commencement of a process that will lead to an acceptable, reasonable, workable and durable political solution in keeping with the several commitments that this Government has made since assumption of power and other Governments have made before? This remains the million dollar question.

1263 1264

Around a million Tamils have already fled the country. They constitute the Tamil Diaspora in different parts of the world. It is the view of most Tamils that it is the deliberate thinking and policy of this Government that rather than enabling the Tamils to live as equal citizens in this country, they should be harassed to such a degree in every conceivable way that they are compelled to leave the country themselves. If that were to happen, Sir, without the Tamil people, there can be no Tamil issue and the Sri Lankan Government would have solved the Tamil issue as it desires, towards the achievement of which, we feel, on the basis of what is happening on the ground, the Sri Lankan Government is currently working very assiduously.

The word reconciliation is bandied about quite frequently in this country. The Government claims to be seriously committed to bringing about reconciliation between the different peoples. May I ask, Sir, how many places of religious and cultural importance to the minority peoples in this country - the Tamils, the Muslims and the Catholics - have been desecrated, damaged and destroyed recently? Everyone knows about it. Some of these acts clearly seem to have overt or covert official sanction. Can the Government honestly state that it has taken appropriate action in regard to any one matter? Will this not encourage impunity on the part of the offenders? Will this not encourage the offenders to think that the arm of the law will not reach them and that they have the support of the Government?

How much of land belonging to the Tamil people in both the North and the East is being arbitrarily expropriated by the Government for military and other purposes, causing immense pain of mind, deprivation and suffering to the Tamil people?

Can such actions bring about reconciliation? This seems to be a fundamental question that needs to be addressed.

This brings me, Sir, to the issue of accountability. The issue of accountability mainly revolves around how the war was conducted, particularly in its final stages. The Sri Lankan Governments position is that a humanitarian operation was conducted on the policy of zero civilian casualty. In fact, I remember that just after the war was over, a rather prominent Minister of the Government said that the war had been concluded without causing a single casualty. There was a Joint Communiqu issued by His Excellency the President and the Secretary-General of the UN shortly after the war came to an end. It was issued on the 23rd of May, 2009. The Communiqu, in regard to accountability, stated, I quote:

Sri Lanka reiterated its strongest commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, in keeping with international human rights standards and Sri Lankas international obligations. The Secretary-General underlined the importance of an accountability

process for addressing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. The Government will take measures to address those grievances.

This joint commitment made by the President of Sri Lanka and the Secretary-General of the UN is today being pursued in order to ensure that the Sri Lankan Government addresses the question of accountability and the UN is holding the Sri Lankan Government to that commitment. Subsequently, the Secretary-General to the United Nations appointed a Panel of Experts comprising of three eminent persons to conduct certain investigations and give him some advice in regard to how he should deal with the question of accountability. It is a long Report, Sir, that contains very revealing information, but I will read just one paragraph from that Report. In page ii, that Report states, I quote:

The Panels determination of credible allegations reveals a very different version of the final stages of the war than that maintained to this day by the Government of Sri Lanka. The Government says it pursued a humanitarian rescue operation with a policy of 'zero civilian casualties'. In stark contrast, the Panel found credible allegations, which if proven, indicate that a wide range of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law was committed both by the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE, some of which would amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. Indeed, the conduct of the war represented a grave assault on the entire regime of international law designed to protect individual dignity during both war and peace.

I will not read any further from that Report, Sir, for lack of time.

Then, we have the LLRC Report released by some eminent persons from this country who were appointed by the Government. I will comment on the LLRC Report, particularly in regard to their recommendations pertaining to a political solution before I conclude my speech.

There were several other matters that were referred to in the LLRC Report, many of which have been incorporated in the two Resolutions adopted by the UN Human Rights Council in March 2012 and March 2013. Very unfortunately, those recommendations of the LLRC incorporated in the Resolutions of the UN Human Rights Council do not seem to have been quite implemented yet.

There is graphic photographic evidence in the form of several videos that have been released by Channel 4, the authenticity of which has been accepted by many. But, I must say that the authenticity of same has been denied by the Sri Lankan Government. I would think that the videos released by Channel 4 are a professional execution of duty by an intrepid media. We have known, Sir, the world over that media is sometimes quite independent and quite intrepid -

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) There is no credibility. Channel 4 is a dubious channel.

Dinesh Gunawardena) It is not independent. They are paid to do a job. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) May I carry on, Mr. Deputy Speaker? I am moving on to my next point.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Member. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) My Friends, as Members of the Government and citizens of this country, are entitled to have their say; we respect what they say; we do not deny you the right to say it; but, please do not deny me the right to continue with my speech. I am a senior Member in this House; I am an elderly person; therefore, please do not disturb me. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You are a senior Member. We respect you because you do not say the same thing as the Hon. Sritharan.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, after the war was over, certain questions were raised about the manner in which the UN authorities discharged their duties and it was decided that the UN must conduct its own internal investigation in regard to the manner in which the UN performed its duties. There was a panel appointed by the Secretary-General to go into this question of how the UN performed these duties and there was a report. I would refer to some parts of that report. It states that it has estimated that there were 360,000 persons or more crowded in a small part of the Vanni in Northern Sri Lanka. Almost 280,000 survivors who came out were subsequently kept in military-run camps outside the area of conflict. The difference is 80,000. What happened to those 80,000 people? Half of them may have been LTTE cadres, that is even too much. The other half must have definitely been civilians. What happened to them? That is a fundamental question.

The report goes on to say, I quote:

"The UN's failure to adequately counter the Governments under-estimation of population numbers in the Wanni, the failure to adequately confront the Government on its obstructions to humanitarian assistance, the unwillingness of the UN in UNHQ and Colombo to address Government responsibility for attacks that were killing civilians, and the tone and content of UN communications with the Government and Member States on these issues, contributed to the unfolding of dramatic events.

Ultimately it goes on to recommend, I quote

Sri Lankas peaceful and stable progress will require a process of accountability and reconciliation and a political solution to the long-standing grievances of all communities, as well as a response to ongoing and new concerns, and prevention and protection in the future. Working closely with the Government of Sri Lanka, the UN needs to take on this further challenge.

This is what the Panel appointed to oversee the actions of the UN agencies in Sri Lanka in their report said.

Quite recently, in fact on 25th September 2013, the Secretary-General of the UN has made a statement at the UN General Assembly in regard to this matter. I quote:

In a rare admission of systemic failure of the UN, its Chief has said the world body had failed during the final stages of the ethnic war in 2009.

Ban made the remarks while addressing the UN General Assemblys 68th session - where Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa was also present.

The Secretary-General said as an immediate first step, he will organise a senior-level team to give careful consideration to the reports recommendations and advise him on the way forward. Other action will follow in short order.

I am saying this because as Sri Lankans we all need to be concerned with this developing situation. It would be rather short-sighted to think that everything is hunky-dory, that everything is moving along quite well and that

1267 1268

there is nothing that we have to do. We must realize that this matter is possessed in the UN and it is being pursued in the UN in different fora and it is a matter that needs to be very carefully examined and scrutinized in this background.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, not only the present High Commissioner, even the former High Commissioner, Madam Louise Arbor was very much involved in Sri Lanka.

The present UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has come up with several statements that commenced when the war was in progress, that were issued after the war was concluded. She has been to Sri Lanka recently, had a press conference here and issued a statement. She has subsequently made an oral statement at the UN. She is due to issue a written statement in March 2014, and we need to be conscious of the fact that various issues have been raised by her even in those statements that she has issued.

I might also before I refer to the LLRC Report refer to a very interesting thing that happened some years ago. There was an International Independent Group of Eminent Persons comprising of eleven eminent persons from different countries the world over. They were appointed to oversee the work of a Commission that had been entrusted with the task of investigating certain grave violations of human rights such as the murder of 5 students in Trincomalee, 17 aid workers in Mutur and so on.

These eminent persons, Sir, withdrew at a certain point of time and before they withdrew, they had a Press Conference on the 14th of April, 2008 when the war in the Northern Province was in progress but had not reached its height yet. They were asked about what the relationship was between the conduct of a war against an organization which had been banned a terrorist organization and the question of human rights, and they were asked for their comments in regard to that matter. The 11 Members of the Commission presided by Justice Bhagwati, the former Chief Justice of India, had persons from several other countries and this was their unanimous view. It states, I quote:

All Members of the IIGEP are keenly aware of the security situation presently prevailing in Sri Lanka. The Government is faced with an insurgency in which the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam conduct their hostilities through ruthless methods, not sparing the civilian population. Sections of popular opinion suggest that human rights and respect for the rule of law should take second place to measures necessary to repel these hostilities ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Member, what about the human rights of the

Muslims killed in Kattankudi and Bikkhus killed in Aranthalawa? Talk about them also. Do they not have human rights?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) The IIGEP rejects this opinion. They go on to state, Sir, I quote:

Summary executions, massacres, disappearances, wanton destruction of property, and forcible transfer of populations can never be justified. No efforts should be spared to uncover responsibility, including recognition of command responsibility, for such actions. The IIGEP has, however, found an absence of will on the part of the Government of Sri Lanka in the present inquiry to investigate cases with vigour, where the conduct of its own forces has been called into question.

This is the view, Sir, of the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Azwer, what is the point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, it is very pertinent to ask, Sir, this question at this moment as he is speaking about the violation of human rights. What about the Muslims in Jaffna, Muslims in Kattankudi, Bikkhus killed in Aranthalawa and people killed in Kebithigollewa? Why do you, as a responsible leader, not talk about them? ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not a point of Order. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) No, he must - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Sampanthan, you continue with your speech. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I must be allowed to speak in this House. If this Member cannot behave, you must name him and send him out. -[Interruption.] I would appeal to the Chair.

We respect the Chair. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I am entitled to ask a question. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, I wish to draw the attention of the House to a salient feature. All this does not do good to the country. -[Interruption.] This is being watched by the whole world, where even the Members of Parliament of the Opposition cannot speak in this House. You are doing to the country immense damage. Mark you, today the whole thing is televised and the whole world can see it.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Yes, I am also talking about that. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, I wish to draw the attention of the House to a salient fact. There is a link between the violence against the Tamil civilians and the non-evolution of an acceptable political solution.

We have had anti-Tamil pogroms in this country in 1956, 1958, 1961, 1977, 1981 and in 1983. There was no LTTE until 1983. There was no violence on the part of the Tamils. There was not even retaliation by the Tamils when they were attacked. Why did this happen?

. ( . ) (The Hon. P. Piyasena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is your point of Order? . ( . ) (The Hon. P. Piyasena) , . LTTE

. . , LTTE .

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] . . . " " . TNA , , . .

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Piyasena, I think you are delivering a speech. It is not a point of Order. Hon. Sampanthan, you may continue with your speech. -[Interruption.] Order, please! Hon. Azwer, please sit down. - [Interruption.] Hon. Piyasena, please be quiet. Let the Hon. Sampanthan speak. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, before I commence speaking, may I say that 10 minutes of my time had been taken and you will kindly bear that in mind.

As I said before, there was not even retaliation by the Tamils. Why did all this happen? Why were the Tamils subjected to violence in the earlier period? Was what happened in 2008 - 2009 a repetition of what happened earlier in a much more virulent form as a result of the armed struggle of the LTTE? Was it the policy of this Government to decimate the LTTE at the same time to beat the Tamils down into political submission?

The entire world helped the Government against the LTTE, politically, diplomatically and militarily. They helped with vital intelligence information. Over a dozen LTTE ships carrying arms were destroyed by the Government consequent to information given to the Government by important countries. LTTE was banned in over 30 countries. They were crippled in the whole of Europe; in the whole of America. They were crippled in important countries in Asia, like in India. They were banned in India. Were all these countries conspiring against you? Did they not help you to finish the war

1271 1272

against the LTTE successfully? You made commitments to all these countries in regard to a political solution. You now want to renege on those commitments. Why should they turn against you? Why should they conspire against you? Let us look at your own conduct while the war was in progress. At its height, you estimated that there were only 30,000 people in the Vanni. We estimated that there were almost 400,000 people in the Vanni.

Eventually, almost 290,000 came out. Your estimate was 30,000. How did the number increase to 290,000? -[Interruption.] NGOs were evicted; INGOs were evicted; the UN was evicted; the ICRC was evicted from the conflict zone in September 2008. They could not execute their humanitarian and protection mandates. The international and domestic media were kept out. They could only go on guided tours. Members of Parliament were kept out. I wrote to the President and wanted approval for all the Members of Parliament of the TNA to go to Vanni. We could not go. The civil society could not go. People who came out of Vanni, out of the conflict zone were confined to camps, in which they were detained. They could not interact with their relatives or their friends. Why did you have to maintain all this secrecy? Why did you have to insist on this lack of transparency? Was it because you were trying to hide something? Were you not hiding the fact that Tamil civilians were being massacred? Was not that the reason you took all these steps to prevent any information going out?

On the question of missing persons, we have made several appeals to the Government, that there must be some finality and these poor mothers, wives and children should have some peace. Have you acted with sensitivity? I will deal with that question when I deal with some other Votes. This cannot go away and will not go away. Things will only get worse. Nobody seeks revenge. I want to say that very frankly in this House. But, there must be justice. There must be equity. That must prevail. This cannot be swept under the carpet. This cannot be left only in the hands of those who are denying justice and equity. So, Mr. Deputy Speaker, this is a very grave situation, which needs to be addressed. Please do not find excuses in the Tamil diaspora and Tamil Nadu. Those are disingenuous excuses, which no one will accept. Please do not deceive yourself.

Sir, before I conclude, may I refer to the LLRC Report. In regard to a political solution, I think it is important that this matter be placed on record.

Paragraph 9.184 states, I quote:

The Commission takes the view that the root cause of the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka lies in the failure of successive Governments to address the genuine grievances of the Tamil people.

Paragraph 9.185 states, I quote:

A political solution is imperative to address the causes of the conflict. Everybody speaks about it, though there is no agreement about the diagnosis and the prescription.

Paragraph 9.186 states, I quote:

The grievances of the Tamil community have figured prominently in the discourse on the ethnic conflict and its causes.

I now want to move on to another paragraph. Paragraph 9.236 states, I quote:

The Commission wishes to underline the critical importance of making visible progress on the devolution issue, in order to ensure the success of any process of lasting and sustainable reconciliation. The Commission therefore recommends that .....

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have only one minute left. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Okay, Sir.

...the present opportunity be utilized to launch a good-faith effort to develop a consensus on devolution, building on what exists - both, for maximum possible devolution to the periphery especially at the grass roots level, as well as power sharing at the centre. This consensus should be one that will enable peoples participation in governance decisions affecting them and avoid costly and unnecessary duplication of political, bureaucratic and other institutional structures that hamper efficient, cost-effective and transparent governance.

Para 9.237 states, I quote:

To this end, the Government must take the initiative to have a serious and structured dialogue with all political parties, and those representing the minorities in particular, based on a proposal containing the Governments own thinking on the form and content of the dialogue process envisaged.

The LLRC wants the Government to come up with its own proposal in regard to the proposed political solution to enable a constructive dialogue.

I might, at this point say, Sir, that bilateral talks took place with the Government from January, 2011; we had 18 rounds of discussions. At the third round in March, 2011, we placed our proposal for a political solution within a united and undivided Sri Lanka, in writing, before the Government Delegation. They committed to come up with their own proposals. Up to date, they have not come up with their proposals. They did not attend the talks fixed for 17th, 18th and 19th of January, 2012 and they were responsible for the talks being abrogated.

1273 1274

They have appointed a Parliamentary Select Committee. Important alliance partners in the Parliamentary Select Committee have made several statements in regard to the Parliamentary Select Committee. We do not have trust in that Parliamentary Select Committee. We think that the Parliamentary Select Committee has been appointed at the instance of important alliance partners to scuttle the prospects of a political solution and not to arrive at a political solution. We do not have any trust in that Parliamentary Select Committee; we cannot take part in that process.

So, I want to say, Sir, very clearly, I have been disturbed in this House once again, today. I am sorry to say, Hon. Deputy Speaker, that such disturbances were permitted. Consequently, my speech has been interrupted; my speech has been disturbed; my trend of thinking has been disturbed and I think Members in this House are entitled to speak with greater freedom. But, we do not have freedom in this House, we do not have freedom in this country and I want this message to go to the whole world. I want all members in the international community to know that this is how we, minority Members, are treated even in this House.

[2.06 p.m.] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, I am pleased to mention that under the leadership of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Sri Lankas trade and industrial sectors have increased steadily. As the Minister in charge of exports, I commend the many measures taken to enhance our exports even with the difficult economic situation in the key developing areas.

The first among them is the proposal to remove certain items from the negative list of Sri Lanka for the strategic development of trade. That is, 208 items under South Asia Free Trade Agreement - SAFTA - and 10 items under India-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement - ISFTA - have been removed from the negative list of Sri Lanka. Sir, several items among these products are used in our local manufacturing and therefore, I believe that

1301 1302

[ ]

2013 28

this is a fillip to our industrial sector. Therefore, there is no question of importing them to Sri Lanka at zero duty as that would greatly help Sri Lankan industries to increase the quality of the products whilst also increasing value addition in the long term. As the Minister in charge of Industries, I thank His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa for this far-sighted initiative.

Not only the industries benefited from the latest visionary Budget of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, but also exports by market development initiatives and infusion of innovation to the companies engaged in international and local trade.

I commend the proposal to extend the concessionary rate of 12 per cent applicable to profits and income to all exporters of goods and services of Sri Lanka. Previously, this concession had been given to the garment exporters. I also commend the decision to extend the concessionary rate on qualified export profits under Sections 51 and 52 of the Inland Revenue Act. Let me thank His Excellency the President for his special consideration for exporters in this Budget.

In fact, I am happy to inform this august Assembly of the good news on the steady improvement in our export performance by identifying the key product sectors that Sri Lanka can focus on to the dynamics of the global market conditions.

Sir, our positive export trend in September is continuing with this focused strategy and accordingly, the January- October 2013 exports turnover increased by 3.07 per cent, to US Dollars 8,379.93 million in comparison to January-October 2012 turnover of US Dollars 8,130.20 million. But, Hon. Sajith Premadasa, you said, it has decreased by 40 per cent from 2006 to 2010. It is a forged document that you read out. I do not know who gave that to you. - [Interruption.] I will show it.

According to the provisional data provided by the EDB under my Ministry, apparel exports increased by a strong 9.39 per cent to US Dollars 3,549.94 million while industrial products rose by 2.32 per cent to US Dollars 6,139.64 million. Export of agricultural products and tea also increased strongly. Agro-product exports increased by 8.63 per cent to US Dollars 2,015.85 million while tea exports also increased by 8.96 per cent to US Dollars 1,237.82 million. Other export crops such as spices, vegetables and fruits joined the trend rising overall by 42 per cent to US Dollars 430.01 million. Even fisheries exports have increased by 15.03 per cent to US Dollars 196.35 million while coconut, natural rubber and petroleum products registered declines.

It is important to note that with the implementation of strategic budget policies this year, even with difficult economic conditions in the West, the export of apparels in October has continued to increase by a strong 9.39 per

cent to US Dollars 3,549.94 million and thereby continue to be the lead export industry for Sri Lanka.

It is therefore highly commendable that we continue with the consistent policies implemented from last year by way of extending specific stimulus to the apparel sector so as to become one of the top-ten apparel manufacturing countries in the world by 2020. Therefore, I welcome the triple deductions provided by His Excellency the President for research and innovation carried out within apparel business, while recognizing the cost of purchasing international intellectual property rights and the cost of operations relating to such rights for tax deduction. In fact, apparel royalty income will be made tax free for a period of seven years from now on.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa)

. . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Hon. Member, you are a Member of the Consultative Committee of my Ministry. So, you can come and discuss any matter there.

With these initiatives, we will continue to drive value addition in the apparel industry and thereby become an international marketer of apparel than just being an exporter.

I am also happy to state that the Reflection of Sri Lanka export and trade exhibition attracted key buyers into the country and also was successful in showcasing diversified quality products that Sri Lanka manufacture to 1,000 delegates who came for the CHOGM.

Reflection of Sri Lanka was an inter-ministerial effort co-organized by the Ministry of Economic Development, my Ministry and the EDB functioning under it joined by the Sri Lanka Tourism, and the Board of Investment with the participation of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority. It opened the door to approximately US Dollars 1 billion potential FDI in global investment through 37 serious project interests, which will materialize in the near future.

This event took Sri Lanka closer to the passionate vision of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa in the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future of making Sri Lanka the Wonder of Asia and accordingly, realizing the immediate export goal of US Dollars 15 billion by 2015 and thereafter, US Dollars 20 billion by 2020.

1303 1304

The success of the event illustrated by its visitor composition alone is a strong proof of confidence in the international trade, investment and business communities on Sri Lankas new growth towards an upper middle income market economy.

According to the Reflection of Sri Lanka final performance report, there were 242,176 visitors including an unprecedented number of international buyers representing 66 countries and this exhibition led to 1,428 serious buyer visits, 101 promising B2B meetings and 195 negotiations for business partnerships leading to 37 negotiations being confirmed. There were positive outcomes in 11 sectors while another 897 event participants were served by a novel concept called specific export industry seminars that took upon timely topics such as How to Export Under FTAs.

The confirmed 37 partnerships have opened the door to approximately US Dollar 1 billion global investment through 37 serious project interests. The Minister of Economic Development, Hon. Basil Rajapaksa too personally briefed the international journalists from Japan, India, New Zealand and Australia. In fact, it was the Hon. Basil Rajapaksas own idea to hold an integrated awareness exposition involving trade, tourism and investment to global visitors so that our product and manufacturing capabilities can be highlighted to the world during the first CHOGM held in Asia after two decades.

At the Reflection of Sri Lanka, the mini-BOI one-stop shop recorded almost 4,500 inquiries out of which about 500 were from international business visitors. There were many investment inquiries and among them, four large-scale investment inquiries positively stand out. The Spanish BOI wants to bring a strong investment delegation to Colombo for automobiles, machinery tools and light engineering.

Mr. Presiding Member, I welcome the Budget proposal to remove the lower rate of tax applicable to companies with taxable income not exceeding Rs. 5 million. This is a great step taken to sustain our SME sector, which is the driving force and the backbone of our economy. I also welcome the Budget proposal to provide interest-free loans up to Rs. 250,000 for women entrepreneurs. This is an innovative step taken for womens empowerment and it will support their own income generating activities, enabling them to play a stronger economic role in their communities.

More importantly, I wish to thank His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa for the initiative taken by him in this Budget to exempt income tax from the National Enterprise Development Agency coming under my Ministry, which will help expand enterprise capacity development and strategic development of this sector.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) What are your proposals for export diversification? ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) We are working on that. If you have any ideas, you can share them with me at the Consultative Committee. -[Interruption.] We are working on that. Now, we are having improvement in the exports - [Interruption.] Please do not disturb me, Hon. Member. I did not disturb you. - [Interruption.] You brought a lot of forged documents and explained here but I did not disturb you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, you go ahead with your speech. ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) NEDA has been playing an important role in enhancing Sri Lankan entrepreneurs and the SME sector. Along with NEDA and several other committed institutions coming under my Ministry, we have been able to facilitate industrial growth in Sri Lanka. In fact, over the years our industrial growth rate has surpassed the GDP growth rate.

According to the Industrial Production Index of 2012, textile, paper products, chemical products and fabricated metal reported growth rates of over 10 per cent. Our overall industrial sector itself was able to show an impressive growth rate of 10.3 per cent in 2012. Within this growth rate, processing industries grew by 6.5 per cent; factory industries grew by 5.2 per cent and cottage industries grew by 4.6 per cent in the same year. We believe that our industries can perform better and behaviour of the industrial sector needs to be more strategic, so that it will become a viable input towards achieving the US Dollar 20 billion export revenue targeted by the year 2020.

The Central Banks Factory Industry Production Index, which stood at 98.4 per cent in December, 2010, has climbed to 105.9 per cent by December, 2012, which is a rise by 7.5 per cent. Food products were the biggest item with a share of 23.7 per cent, which showed a slight decline from 101.5 per cent in December, 2010 to 99.1 per cent in December, 2012. However, many other sectors including the apparel sector had increased. In fact, the apparel industry has increased from its 94.4 per cent in 2010 to 128.9 per cent by December, 2012.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, please wind up now.

1305 1306

[ ]

2013 28

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Please give me two minutes, Sir.

What is equally important in this achievement is the vision of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, whose efforts are highly commendable. Thanks to His Excellency the Presidents efforts, new industries such as IT/BPO are increasingly playing an important role in our exports and employment.

In this context, I commend the Budget of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa to promote IT as a major industry in Sri Lanka and to double the jobs in the Information Technology sector.

I also welcome the removal of custom duties on IT-supportive printers and optical fibre cables to enable our IT/BPO sector. This industry brought in foreign earnings of about US Dollars 600 million; created around 70,000 well-paid employment opportunities and the country is rapidly shifting towards the use of internet, making this sector one of the top export earners for Sri Lanka in the years to come, in the true spirit of innovation.

Finally, stressing that the impact of this Budget is far-reaching and long-term for Sri Lankas exports, investments, SMEs, women entrepreneurs and overall economy, I praise His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa for yet another policy level national development-oriented Budget that also effectively aims to reduce the fiscal deficit.

It is very clear that the Budget 2014 is an inclusive and development-oriented Budget that goes across the different layers of industry and commerce.

I would also like to thank Dr. P.B. Jayasundara and his team for the valuable support extended to prepare this Budget.

Thank you.

I quote:

"The Rt. Hon. Sir John Kotelawala (Prime Minister): What is the Hon. Member reading from?

Mr. Samarakkody: For the first time-

The Hon. J.R. Jayewardene (Minister of Agriculture and Food and Leader of the House): I rise to a point of Order-

Mr. V. Nalliah (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Defence and External Affairs): From what documents is the hon. Member reading?

Mr. Samarakkody: I am reading from my notes.

Mr. Speaker: Is the hon. Member reading his speech or making use of his notes?

Mr. Samarakkody: I am reading from my notes.

Mr. Speaker: I take it that the hon. Member is aware that our Standing Orders prohibit the reading out of a speech?"

You can make use of the notes but you cannot read out the speech. This happened in 1955 in Parliament and at that time, the Hon. Speaker was the Hon. Sir Albert F. Peries. So, this is the way Parliamentary proceedings were conducted by high-level Members and Prime Ministers in this House.

of potential for tourism. The beaches are wonderful and the different angles of sightseeing, from hiking in the national parks and highland experiences like Kandy and Nuwara Eliya, cultural experiences in Sigiriya and Ella or wellness and rejuvenation with traditional Ayurveda treatments are definitely hooks for the various visitor groups. We also noted CHOGM during our stay, which we valued as a big potential for the island to position herself in the competitive environment worldwide and we got excited to visit the same tea plantation like Prince Charles did the same day.

NORTHERN EXPRESSWAY

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, it is my privilege to move the Adjournment Motion today regarding a very important subject as far as the development and the future prosperity of the country is concerned.

Hon. Presiding Member, I move,

"Time and fuel of the public is saved to a great extent with the commissioning of the Southern Express Highway in 2011 and the Katunayaka Express Highway in 2013 as people are able to reach destinations of the express highways swiftly resulting in positive influence on the economy as well.

Recently, the Project Minister of Highways, Hon. Nirmala Kothalawala, had stated to the media that work on the Northern Express Highway too shall begin in January next year. A great economic revival is taking place within the country. This is highly instrumental for the growth of tourism industry. People of our country will be able to save a lot of time and money by using the aforesaid road for their day-to-day activities. It is expected that the aforesaid highway will be built with easy access to tourist attraction sites such as Kurnegala, Kandy, Dambulla, Polonnaruwa, Anuradhapura and Jaffna. This would also lead to growth in the local tourism industry.

Therefore, it is moved in this House that it is necessary to explain to this august House in detail, the period of time in which the commencement and completion of the Northern Express Highway shall take place and the manner in which it will be constructed."

, , . , . . , " " . , , - miracle of the silk route - - 2013 27 . .. . - . . "I will further develop 4,000 kilometres of roads during the next six years. Of such networks, 1,200 kilometres would be roads in the Northern Province".

. 1,200 - - . , .

He, in fact, threatened the House and the country that he would go before the international community in order to represent the case of the Tamil community. The Tamil communitys case has been rightly addressed by the President himself.

In the Northern Province, 1,200 kilometres of roads would be built. He has never neglected the Northern Province. I must also tell the international community from this House that when the Hon. Member was uttering all this nonsense in this House during the time of the war, the Uthuru Wasanthaya was launched by the President and a lot of work was done for the Northern Province.

Then, he was talking about human rights violations of their people, in fact, of the Tigers , I raised a question on a point of Order, as rightfully allowed by the Standing Orders for a Member to interrupt and ask a question. Then, he said, You are disturbing me. I will go to the international community. Go to the international community and take this message also that the Tigers chased away 100,000 people from the North.

Then, with regard to the Muslims, I asked, What about their human rights? The Tigers killed Muslim people worshiping in the Hussainia Mosque in Kattankudi, and massacred villagers in Eravur the following week. The Tigers killed at Arantalawa. The Tigers shot and killed people. They cut and chopped children who were like small flowers, at Kebithigollewa, when they were travelling in a bus to their schools. This is how the Tigers - whose proxy and agents is the TNA today - treated the people of other communities in the North and the East

Muslims were chased away. Where were their human rights? Sinhalese were chased away. Where were the human rights of those people?

Sir, today I am very happy to say that through the A-9 Road people from the South, particularly Sinhalese, are travelling to Jaffna and Nagadeepa. They are buying products of the Jaffna farmer in the Jaffna bazaar. If you go to the grand bazaar in Jaffna,you can see that the Tamils there are beginning to speak the Sinhala language in order to sell their products. That is the change, the change in the minds which the Mahinda Chintana or the President himself has brought about.

Then, Sir, the other day, the Hon. Nirmala Kotalawala explained about the North-South Expressway that entails the construction of a 480-kilometre expressway road network that will connect the "K" cities. What are the "K" cities? The "K" cities are; Kankesanthurai, Kataragama via Kurunegala linking Kandy, Kalpitiya, Kattankudi and Ratnapura. Those are the cities. This is the revival of a civilization.

Therefore, Sir, I would only want this House to be very careful of the dead. We believe the Tigers are existing in the form of the TNA in this country. It is because of that, the Hon. S. Shritharan described in this House the ruthless murderer and killer Prabhakaran, as a hero. . . . . .

. ? Daniel Rexian alias Rajiv, the

Chairman of the Delft Pradeshiya Sabha, was shot dead. This is a warning to the entire nation. Hon. Sampanthan, tell the international community also that this is a warning. We do not know whether they are starting their game once again. Therefore, we, Members of Parliament who come here have to be very careful. The security, Hon. Speaker, of all Parliamentarians and the staff are in danger. We do not know how they would behave.

My two Friends are yet to speak. Therefore, I do not want to take much time. I should say that the Hon.Nirmala Kotalawala is a very able and a formidable Project Minister. The President has given him the Project Ministry of Ports and Highways as he truly deserves it and would execute his duties well. Whatever the work that has been entrusted to him, he has proved himself. He is a highly qualified and a successful Minister who has won the hearts of the poor people of the country.

We are still helping, and, we are still speaking on behalf of the Northern Province. Hon. Sampanthan, go and tell that to the international community. We are also telling the same to the international community.

We would only like to ask the Hon. Minister, when the construction of the Northern Expressway will commence?

In all sincerity, I want to tell the country that the President himself has not only opened the carpeted the A-9 Road to the North, but he has also opened the minds of the Southerners and the Northern people. Therefore, in mind and spirit, they are now bound together. That is how today the Government is carrying out its functions.

The "Sunday Observer" of 27th October, 2013 under the heading "A giant leap towards the Wonder of Asia Colombo-Katunayake Expressway" states, I quote:

"The Outer Circular road, the Northern expressway and Kandy expressway will come to a reality soon. Sri Lanka constructed this high mobility link between the Bandaranaike International Airport and Colombo, the commercial airport was set up at Katunayake 4 decades ago."

Within a year or two, the President, with the dynamic leadership of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Minister of Economic Development, has initiated all these projects and completed them in a beautiful way. It is amazing. Sri Lanka is now dazzling because of these roads.

I think the Hon. Nirmala Kotalawala must correct himself because the Government has told that within 20 minutes you can come from the Katunayake Airport to Colombo through that expressway. But, I would say that last morning, I picked up my cousin, Dr. Haris Deen, who came from London and within 14 minutes our driver Ruwaiz brought us to Colombo. What a wonderful thing this is! People could have not imagined.

Therefore, Sir, I would only say that this is a great achievement. I think I must recommend to the Minister and to the Government that - when you go to India, you can see at Bombay and Delhi, a huge board: "Gateway to India" at the airport - when you land in Katunayake, let the foreigners know that this is the gateway to Colombo or Sri Lanka. In India, what they say is, "Gateway to India". So, let us have a massive sign board or an arch at the Exit at Katunayake to tell the world: "Gateway to Sri Lanka".

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Tharanath Basnayaka) , . .
