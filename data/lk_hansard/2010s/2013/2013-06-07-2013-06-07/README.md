[3.13 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to pay a tribute to a great son of Sri Lanka, a person with whom I had the rare opportunity of associating in the Western Provincial Council and also in this Parliament.

I have observed him when he became the Chief Minister of the Western Provincial Council in 1988. He was devoted to service and he shunned all perks that were due to a Chief Minister. He never used an official car. He had the best car but it was a privately-owned car. Similarly, he never drew a salary. He donated it to good causes and he never enjoyed any salary as the Chief Minister or as the Leader of the Opposition in the Provincial Council or as a Member of Parliament.

I must state that he was a person who believed in the Provincial Council system. That was why he took the responsibility of the Chief Minister of the Western Provincial Council, the largest Provincial Council. During his period as the Chief Minister, he always strived to get more powers for the Provincial Councils. He believed that devolution was necessary for this country and he strived to safeguard the powers that were available and always tried to get more and more powers.

I can remember, when I entered the Western Provincial Council in 1993, the Chief Minister of that Provincial Council was Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. The Hon. Susil Moonesinghe was the then Leader of the Opposition and the leader of our group in the Provincial Council. There was an incident. The then Chief Minister of the Western Provincial Council, Madam Kumaratunga, wanted to use the police powers available under the Provincial Councils Act and she brought a Special Resolution before the Provincial Council, urging the then President, the late Hon. D.B. Wijetunga, to grant permission to bring the Police Commission Act to life. The Police Commission Act stipulated that the date for it to become effective was to be set by the President. So, a Resolution was brought before the Western Provincial Council to give life to the Police Commission Act. At this time, when the Chief Minister who belonged to the Peoples Alliance was asking for police powers, the Hon. Susil Moonesinghe who was the Leader of the Opposition of the Provincial Council and a member of the United National Party, took up the stand that we should support the devolution of police powers to the provinces. At the Group Meeting, many Members argued that we should not allow a Chief Minister of the Opposition party, a party opposed to us, to have police powers. But, the Hon. Susil Moonesinghe said, We all are Members of the Provincial Council. It is our duty to strive for more powers for the Provincial Councils. So, we should support the Motion brought by the Chief Minister, Madam Kumaratunga.

So, we participated in the Debate. We all urged for more powers to the Provincial Councils, and for police powers and the Resolution was passed in the Provincial Council. However, the then Chief Minister, Madam Kumaratunga, soon after that became the Prime Minister of this country and subsequently the President of this country. But, when she did become the President of the country, she did not honour the Motion passed at the Provincial Council by herself and never gave police powers to the Provincial Councils. Up to date, we have not realized the full powers of Provincial Councils because those who get into power at the Centre have never wanted to concede power to the Provinces. Today, we are seeing again an argument over whether land and police powers should be given to the Provincial Councils. Since the Hon. Susil Moonesinghe then thought, even as the Opposition Leader, that more powers should be devolved to Provincial Councils, I am sure he would have thought even today that the Provincial Councils should have more powers.

The Hon Susil Moonesinghe was a very simple person and a good leader. He led the list of candidates at that Provincial Council Election where I contested for the first time and he was so supportive of his team. He did give us good advice and lead us in that election. Even afterwards in the Council, he was very simple; he was very wise and gave us good advice. He was a person who never flaunted his power. He was a very refined person and never argued. He was always willing to listen to other people. I was then in the Ceylon Workers' Congress while he was in the UNP and we decided at that time to support the Government. He used to argue about it with me but never with any anger. He was always willing to accept the views of the other person.

The Hon. Susil Moonesinghe was a special acquaintance in my life. I will always cherish his memories, pay tribute to him and pray for his next life the way his religion propounds.

Thank you. [.. 3.21] .. ( ) ( .. - , ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha - Minister of Environment and Renewable Energy) , - - .

, , , , , , , , . . [3.36 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, Mr. E.C. McKenzie had collected 14,000 quips and quotes and included those in a book called 14,000 Quips & Quotes for Writers & Speakers. I would like to read one quote from it: There are no great men except those who have rendered service to mankind.

Today, when we are recalling the memories of a respected leader, the Hon. Susil Moonesinghe, this quote comes to my mind. He rendered service to mankind and was always available in their needs. Although he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, he rendered yeoman service to the poor and needy. .... " " .

Sir, the Hon. Susil Moonesinghe hails from a very distinguished Buddhist family in this country. He excelled in every field of activity: politics, social services, religious services, sports and in every other human activity. Therefore, he amassed a vast wealth of knowledge and experience. He, very ironically - it is a little interesting to recall - worked in the Electorate of Avissawella, where Boralugoda formed the base of socialism in this country with the Father of Socialism, the late Hon. Philip Gunawardena, leading the way along with his brother, late Hon. Robert Gunawardena, under whom I also did politics with my cousin Haris Deen, when he was the Member of Parliament from Kotte. Now, in Parliament, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena and the Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena are excelling as their late respected father did.

Another queer thing that happened was this. Susil had brothers: Anil was his elder brother and Mangala, his younger brother. When Anil was presiding over Parliament, I used to quote from the Erskine May and the Hon. Susil Moonesinghe always walked up to me - we were seated close to each other in the Opposition benches at that time - and asked, How did you learn this because it is very difficult to quote? The Erskine May runs into about a thousand odd pages. I said, "I followed the

797 798

footsteps of Anils leader, the late Hon. (Dr.) N.M. Perera", who quoted the Erskine May copiously in this House, to whom we, as school-going students, always listened sitting in the old Parliament Gallery.

Also, the Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe is another distinguished gentleman, I should say. He was liked by everyone, particularly the peace-loving people. He wanted peace in this country; he wanted unity in this country. He did not want this country to be pawned to a foreign power under any circumstances because the Moonesinghe family is firmly rooted in the soil of this country. Therefore, they always endeavoured to promote internationally the cause of Sri Lanka, not something else. I also had the privilege of serving in the Mangala Moonesinghe Parliamentary Select Committee, which subsequently submitted a Report to Parliament.

Then, Sir, he was the first Chief Minister of the Western Provincial Council. I remember vividly that when he was to be declared the Chief Minister, there was a meeting at "Braemar", the residence of the late President J.R. Jayewardene at Ward Place, Colombo. He summoned me there and the late Hon. Gamini Dissanayake was present. He said: Mr. Azwer, only the people in Colombo want to occupy big positions, positions of status and hold all ministerial posts. There is a young Muslim elected from the Kalutara District called M.A.M. Yoosuf. Do you know him?" I said, Yes, Sir, I know him quite well because he was working very closely with the then Member of Parliament - later the Hon. Speaker, Deshamanya Alhaj M.A. Bakeer Markar. The Hon. Gamini Dissanayake said, Hurry, run to that place and bring him over here soon. It so happened that I forgot the Ward Place residence and took Mr. M.A.M. Yoosuf straight to Susil Moonesinghe's house opposite the Museum. Then, he said, My dear young man, you will be a Minister - the first Muslim Minister - in my Cabinet; you will feel happy". He was overwhelmed, choked with emotion. He never expected that because people in Colombo were displaying currency notes in millions to snatch this post. But, they stood their ground firm. Mr. M.A.M. Yoosuf is the first Muslim Minister in the Western Provincial Council. He is a very distinguished member of the Western Province serving the people from the inception and is now celebrating 30 years in politics. We wish him Good Luck!

Sir, the Hon. Susil Moonesinghe also had a deep knowledge and liking for the broadcast service in this country. As a result, he became the Chairman and the Director-General of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. Yesterday morning, Sir, we heard in the "Dasa Desa" Programme, which is a very important and valuable programme, the voice of the late Dr. N.M. Perera. It was very interesting to listen to what Dr. N.M. Perera said about this country and the future. The

Chairman, Mr. Hudson Samarasinghe included his voice-cut in that programme. I would also like to ask the Chairman of the SLBC, if possible tomorrow, to include a voice-cut of the Hon. Susil Moonesinghe as well.

Then, Sir, he became the Chief Minister in 1988, which was the Beeshana Samaya, and held the portfolios of Public Security, Police, Finance and Planning, Housing, Trade, Information and Transport. Then, he left the portals of this majestic building and went to Iran as Sri Lanka's Ambassador. I happened to go to Iran when his successor Mr. Omar Kamil, the former Mayor of Colombo, was appointed as the Ambassador. The Hon. Karu Jayasuriya knows those facts very well. The Hon. Susil Moonesinghe has left his footprints firmly in the diplomatic services in Iran, I learnt. He was a man who always laughed and made others laugh and lived happily.

Sir, he was very well disposed towards our fraternity as well. Although he was a Buddhist leader who helped Buddhist causes, temples, devalas and schools, when he was the Chief Minister we found him readily available for Ahadiya schools in the Colombo District, particularly in the Colombo-Central area where even today we find the schools in the Colombo-Central area has got to be developed to the extent of other schools in the rest of the Island.

Sir, he was also an administrator of the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall. From 1970 to 1972, as I mentioned earlier, he was the Chairman and the Director-General of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation.

I may end my speech, Sir, by again quoting E.C. McKenzie. A man is not really poor if he can still laugh. The Hon. Susil Moonesinghe laughed, made us laugh; he was a straight forward man. He stood tall even in his national attire and I should say he was elegant.

He served this House well for 6 years and 1 month. According to his belief, I pray for his Nivan Suva!

Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by both sides of the House on the death of the Hon. Susil Moonesinghe, ex-Member of Parliament. I shall direct the Secretary-General of Parliament to make a Minute of the Proceedings of todays Meeting and send a copy thereof to the members of the bereaved family.

The next Vote of Condolence is on the Hon. P.R. Ratnayake.

Anyway, I would like to explain to you all these in detail because this is a serious allegation, a baseless allegation. I would like to call it a "baseless allegation" because pardon had been requested by several governments including the Government of Sri Lanka from the Saudi Arabian Government and it was given after several years to all illegal immigrants. "Illegal immigrants" means those who have gone there for religious purposes and are staying back even after their visas have expired; people who are working without visas and people who have gone on tourist visa and are overstaying.

This is not a plight only for Sri Lanka. We are thankful to the Saudi Arabian Government for acceding to our request to grant pardon and for providing necessary offices to repatriate illegal immigrants to Sri Lanka or for allowing them to continue working for new sponsors in Saudi Arabia.

The Saudi Arabian Government has taken a policy decision to repatriate all illegal residents presently in Saudi Arabia and informed on the 11th of May, 2013, the embassies and consulates of labour-sending countries in

829 830

Saudi Arabia that all illegal residents or workers should leave Saudi Arabia on or before the 3rd of July, 2013. That is within less than two months, not even two months.

The illegal residents in Saudi Arabia include expatriate workers who have run away from their places of employment and thereby they forego the sponsorship through which they entered Saudi Arabia. These workers require exit permits issued by the Saudi Immigration Authority to leave that kingdom. Haj and Umrah pilgrims who have overstayed their visas also come under the category of illegal residents. For repatriation, illegal residents or the workers require:

(1) Temporary travel documents - TTD - if they do not have valid passports issued by their respective embassies or consulates.

(2) The exit permit issued by the Saudi Arabian authorities. They must be given an exit permit to leave the country once the contract is over.

(3) The Saudi Resident Permit (Iqama) number.

Illegal residents who wish to rectify their status and continue to work in Saudi Arabia are required to find new sponsors for which they would require to regularize their passports or to have non-Machine Readable Passports from our embassy.

Illegal workers without Saudi Resident Permit number would have to wait till repatriation of those who possess the Saudi Resident Permit number is completed. Haj and Umrah pilgrims who have overstayed their visas would come under this category of illegal residents who are without Saudi Resident Permit number.

Saudi Immigration Authorities have allocated one working day per week for each labour-sending country for processing exit permits. About 14,000 exit permits have been processed for nationals from Sri Lanka. It is not 7,000. I would like to mention that. For India, 25,000 exit permits have been processed; Pakistan - 40,000; Bangladesh - 14,000; Indonesia - 20,000 and the Philippines - 14,000.

Saudi authorities have allocated every Monday of the week for processing exit visas for illegal Sri Lankan residents. It was initially expected that 1,000 exit permits would be processed per day by the Saudi Arabian Immigration Authorities. However, it has been observed that approximately only 400 to 500 exit permits have been processed per day.

The Additional Secretary of the Ministry of External Affairs, Mr. Rodney Perera was instructed to visit Jeddah on the request of His Excellency the President, the Hon. Minister of External Affairs and the Hon. Dilan Perera, to

oversee the repatriation process and to report to us of any shortcomings. He was also requested to look into the welfare of Sri Lankan nationals in Jeddah with a view to ensuring provision of consular assistance needed to repatriate them early. The Government of Sri Lanka released sufficient funds for the Sri Lankan Embassy in Riyadh and the Consulate- General of Sri Lanka in Jeddah to meet initial expenses relating to the repatriation process. The Additional Secretary is of the view that the process for repatriation and registration and issuance of travel documents by the Sri Lankan Missions is well organized compared to other countries. I must tell you that it is the best because we have already completed registering all workers and they are now waiting at the Saudi Immigration Authorities to collect their documents. The Additional Secretary has spoken with the Consulates-General of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia and the Philippines in this regard.

All staff members of the Missions have been working long hours; they have been working at least till midnight everyday since this was started. Since May up to now, they have been working late to complete the process and register the issuance of travel documents. Additional staff members with Arabic language proficiency have already been sent from Colombo and they have been asked to recruit translators from Saudi Arabia to expedite the process. Other resources required for this process have also been provided by the Government of Sri Lanka. The Missions provide regular updates to the Ministry and the situation has been continuously monitored by the two relevant Ministries and the two Ministers.

Translators of the Sri Lanka Missions and other staff members have been stationed at the Saudi Immigration Offices in Riyadh and Jeddah to assist the Sri Lankan nationals, to talk to them and sort out their problems, at the Immigration Authority as well as in the airports. Action has been taken to create awareness through TV channels, which are available in that area for Sri Lankans, through the internet and newspaper advertisements have also been published by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Saudi Arabia.

( ) (The Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake) In which language? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) They are, of course, in Sinhalese, English and Arabic languages.

Considering the situation in Jeddah, the Consulate-General has informed the Ministry that there have been no stranded Sri Lankans residing under the Sharafiya

831 832

[ ]

2013 07

Kandara Bridge as of today. I would like to mention that there are no Sri Lankans living under that bridge as of today or for the last few days.

Up to the 6th of June, 2013, approximately 9,000 illegally-residing Sri Lankans have been registered with the Sri Lankan Consulate in Jeddah. All of them have been issued with temporary travel documents and they are awaiting the issuance of exit permits by the Saudi Immigration Authority. All the necessary documents have been issued by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Riyadh and the Consulate in Jeddah, in Saudi Arabia.

About 200 Sri Lankans are temporarily staying in the Khalidiya Childrens Park located in front of the Consulate. They all are being looked after by the Consulate and also by the nearby Mosque. So, facilities have been provided. Fortunately, we have our Consulate in front of the Mosque. So, they are being looked after by the Mosque on the request of the embassy and its staff.

So far, only 900 exit permits have been issued by the Saudi Immigration Authority, after which approximately 400 Sri Lankans have left Saudi Arabia for Sri Lanka. Exit visas are distributed by the Saudi Immigration Authority at the Detention Camp in Jeddah - Tarheel, which is located closer to the Sharafiya Kandara Bridge. Mobile services are being organized for Abha/Khamis Mushayet which is about 700 kilometres away from Jeddah; Najaran, which is about 900 kilometres away from Jeddah; Jezan, which is about 950 kilometres away from Jeddah; Tabuk, which is about 850 kilometres away from Jeddah; Medina, which is about 400 kilometres away from Jeddah and Yanbu, which is about 400 kilometres away from Jeddah. These are the mobile services which have been provided in order to facilitate Sri Lankan workers who are there after the pardon was given by the Saudi authorities.

Considering the situation in Riyadh, up to 6th June, 2013, approximately 6,000 illegally-residing Sri Lankans have been registered with the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Riyadh. All of them have been issued with temporary travel documents and they are awaiting the issuance of exit permit by the Saudi Immigration Authority. So far, only 850 exit permits have been issued, after which approximately 500 Sri Lankans have left for Sri Lanka from Riyadh.

The embassy has conducted mobile services in Dammam, Qaseem, Sakaka and Hail, and the last mobile service was held today in Hail. The Sri Lankan Embassy in Riyadh and the Consulate in Jeddah have issued travel documents to all registered Sri Lankans. However, the Saudi authorities would have to issue exit permits, without which repatriation is not possible. The Government would continue to extend all possible assistance to Sri Lankans in Saudi Arabia and other countries.

Therefore, my dear Colleague, the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake has misled this House by saying that there are people living under the Sharafiya Kandara Bridge as of today. There are no people living under that bridge. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) ? ( ) (The Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake) Sir, the Hon. Deputy Minister has mentioned my name. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) I take responsibility for what I say because I have sent the Additional Secretary to Jeddah to see the position. I would like to tell you that you should speak responsibly because that is the reason the media has not reported and given adverse publicity to the allegations that you are making.

Sir, I would like to make those points and I say that the Government of Sri Lanka is committed and will be committed to serve the people. Now, there is no necessity to send additional staff but if the embassy requests or if more people come to our embassies, we will be doing that to continuously support the staff and the workers in Saudi Arabia or any other country..

Thank you very much.
