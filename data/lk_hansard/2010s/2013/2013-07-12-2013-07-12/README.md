The Court has determined that in terms of Article 123 of the Constitution, the Petition filed by the Petitioner is misconceived in law and premised on a footing in contravention of the jurisdiction conferred on the Court by proviso (a) to Article 120 read with Article 124 of the Constitution.

(i) the key officials of the Ministry;

(ii) the work experiences of each official

mentioned above; and

(iii) the areas covered by them?

(i) the number of Sri Lankan employees

working under the Ministry of External Affairs worldwide; and

(ii) as to how they report to the Ministry with

the organizational reporting chart?

(c) If not why?

(The Hon. Neomal Perera) , .

Hon. Member, shall I read out the Answers one by one?

( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, the microphone system is malfunctioning. I cannot hear what is being said.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Member, you have asked for the list of - ( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am sorry, Hon. Deputy Minister. First, I want to get the House in order because what you are saying cannot be heard.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Okay. ... ( ... )

(The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . .

( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . [ ]

The mike system is not functional. Hon. Deputy Speaker, when the Sittings finish today, please ensure that these archaic things are restored to the proper order and functional so that we can hear what is being said.

( )

(The Deputy Speaker) I, of course, can hear it.

( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is because you are at the head table.

( )

(The Deputy Speaker) But, I do not know about the other Members. Can you all hear it?

... ( ... )

(The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) , . . -

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Deputy Speaker, can I go ahead with the Answer now?

( )

(The Deputy Speaker) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera)

(a) Hon. Member, the information you have asked

for in a(i), (ii) and (iii) are given below as a table.

561 562

(b) (i) 515.

(ii) Through the relevant Head of Mission.

(c) Does not arise.

( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Minister, for the Answer. With the revelation of the information about the key officials, I am sure the Ministry of External Affairs has a reservoir of talents. Every official whom you mentioned has an experience of more than 15 years. Is their experience being put to use by the Ministry of External Affairs or is there a political dimension to the work of the Ministry because latterly, you have been making more enemies than friends around the world. So, this reservoir of talents, I hope, is put to good use so that we will have more friends internationally than enemies. Hon. Deputy Minister, would you please elaborate on that?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Member, we are carrying on the "Mahinda Chintana" policy of the leadership and those officials who are capable of handling any issue are doing it very well and we have made more friends than enemies.

( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is your perception. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) That is what is happening. ( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, my second Supplementary Question is this. Latterly, you have made more non-

career appointments to the diplomatic positions rather than career diplomats in the Ministry of External Affairs. As a result, 54 per cent of your ambassadorial positions have been selected from outside. With this, there is also militarization of the diplomactic corps and three countries have rejected the nominees you have put forward. So, I would appreciate, if whatever chintanaya that you believe in carries forward the countrys policy, that it does not alienate itself from the European Union, the USA, Japan, India et cetera. I would appreciate if a spontaneous answer comes from you.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) If I am to mention two officers, Admiral Thisara Samarasinghe and the Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Japan, both of whom had served as the Commander of the Navy, are doing a fantastic job.

( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, if you can answer my Question rather than go on a voyage of discovery, it would be better.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) I am telling you about the military appointments and non-career diplomats.

( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I asked about the rejected nominees. If you answer to that, it would be easier.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) You were asking me about non-career diplomats. So, I mentioned two non-career diplomats who had been in the military as well. I am answering both your questions with the same answer.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My Question was not about that. My Question was about the 55 per cent non-career diplomats appointed and about the two military people who have been rejected. If you answer that, it would be easier.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) For political reasons, they may get rejected but we have sent the best officers to serve the country. So, that is

the situation. We pay more attention to security intelligence rather than face the consequences of the war. So, we would like to prevent issues rather than face issues.

( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, I know that you have a very difficult brief to make at this particular moment. But, the question that I posed to you is -

( )

(The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, that is your third Supplementary Question.

( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, the time seems to be against you today. Your amiable, generous disposition -

( )

(The Deputy Speaker) Look at the time. It is past 2.00 p.m. ( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, we are on the 14th Question. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) No, this is the 13th Question. ( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, the Labour GSP, which is so important to the commercial activities of this country, was taken off from Sri Lanka two years ago. At that particular moment, we said the loss to the country would be roughly about Rs. 1.4 billion. Today, collectively, the loss is about Rs. 5 billion. Now, I am informed that the Government, which rejected certain policies that had to be implemented earlier, has stealthily applied back again to the European Union for that. So, have you now accepted those conditions or things they expected you to do or have you not applied again?

565 566

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Actually, that does not come under our Ministry although we facilitate it to be achieved through other Ministries.

( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But, Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha - ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) That is only facilitated by us but it is the task of the Ministry of Labour and Labour Relations or the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The GSP Plus comes under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; labour comes under the Ministry of Labour and Labour Relations. Therefore, we are only facilitators of those Ministries. So, I will not be able to answer you regarding those matters.

( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But, Hon. Deputy Minister, facilitation comes under you.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) For us, it is a matter of forwarding the documents; taking decisions is for those Ministries.

( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, you are only a postman, is it? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) The Question you are asking is not relevant to our Ministry.

( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But, facilitation for what purpose? If you say that you are only facilitating -

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Member, it does not come under the Ministry of External Affairs.

(b) Will he state -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I have to bring to your kind notice the validity and the operation of the Standing Orders of Parliament, which should be strictly adhered to by the House. Sir, Standing Order No. 10 is about the Quorum, which states, I quote:

"The quorum of Parliament required by Article 73 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka is twenty members including the person presiding. If at any time the attention of Mr. Speaker or other person presiding is directed to the fact that a quorum is not present he shall order the division bells to be rung and if at the expiration of five minutes a quorum be not present he shall adjourn Parliament without question put."

So, Sir, I raise, according to the Standing Orders, that there is no Quorum, which I am entitled to. Therefore,

Sir, I am once again raising it when you are in the Chair, that you have to call for the Quorum and if the Quorum is formed, then you can continue with the Debate. If not, Standing Order No. 11 states, I quote:

........If a quorum be not then present Parliament shall adjourn as provided in the preceding Order but if a quorum be proved to be present Parliament shall forthwith resolve itself into Committee."

So, Sir, according to that, you have to call for the Quorum.
