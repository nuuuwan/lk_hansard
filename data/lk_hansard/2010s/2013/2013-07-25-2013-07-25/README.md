The Government debt at the end of 2012 totalled to Rs. 6,000.1 billion. This consisted of Rs. 3,232.8 billion of domestic debt and Rs. 2,767.2 billion of foreign debt. The total debt accounted for 79.1 per cent of GDP in 2012 in comparison to 78.5 per cent recorded in 2011 and the highest ratio of 105.6 per cent which was recorded in

2002. Accordingly, even though the debt has increased in absolute value, as a percentage of GDP it has gradually decreased over the period from 105.6 per cent in 2002 to 79.1 per cent in 2012.

Sri Lankas per capita income has increased to US Dollars 2,923 in 2012. During the last eight years, the per capita GDP has more than doubled in comparison to the period of 15 years that took us to reach the US Dollars 1,000 mark in 2004. This reflects that the country has reached a faster phase of growth during this period.

The Government has been able to manage an average budget deficit of 7 per cent of GDP during the period of the last eight years in comparison to 19.2 per cent of higher deficit in 1980 and 10.4 per cent in 2001. The targetted deficit in 2013, which is 5.8 per cent of GDP, in the context of the last three years achievement in reducing the deficit, reflects the Government commitment in strengthening fiscal consolidation towards lowering the deficit to below 5.0 per cent of GDP by 2015.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, I thank you even though you tabled the answer. I would like to ask more generalized questions as you have the ability to answer. Hon. Minister, you are taking pride in saying that the debt to GDP has reduced drastically but the more alarming factor is that revenue to GDP had reduced even more drastically. It is from 16.9 to 13.1 per cent. That impact is far greater than the debt to GDP. Now, what I would like to reflect on the GDP, which I am sure you would also agree, is that the increase in the GDP on one side, artificially maybe, has created this distortion. Hon. Minister, can you give a reason as to why your revenue has dropped against GDP?

[5.01 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Presiding Member, before I discuss the subject that is before the House, I think it is a duty cast on me, not only as a Member of the Government but also as a Sri Lankan to meet certain unfounded charges made by both the JVP, who were earlier Gathakayas in this country, the Hon. Anura Dissanayake, and also my good Friend - I call him a "baby" because I carried him as a baby. It is a far cry from a man who wanted to build up -

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. This Hon. Member is misleading the House. What the Hon. Sajith Premadasa said was that he has nothing against the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. He only criticized the way it is to be conducted.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) 0 0 '''' 0

0 He brings statistic from all over. His job during the Question Time is to bring in statistic. He never recognizes or honours the Standing Orders followed in the House. When three Supplementary Questions could be asked from the Answer given, he goes around and asks the same thing.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) There is no point of Order, Sir. I have not spoken anything against the Standing Orders.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Sir, according to the Standing Orders, the speakers have to have capabilities in proper pronunciation. It is statistics. Please ask him to pronounce it well.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I taught him I taught him A, B, C, D before he went to London and took a certificate from a pavement tutory. Sir, he took a certificate from a pavement tutory; I feel very sorry for him. What a character he has turned out to be! That is far, far away from the image His Excellency R. Premadasa wanted to build up.

Sir, with regard to the CHOGM, Mr. Raj Pal Abeynayake, the Editor of the Daily News has a premonition. He has written a timely, appropriate editorial on the 22nd of July, 2013. Perhaps, he knows that the Hon. Sajith Premadasa and the Hon. Anura Dissanayake would be castigating the CHOGM. Now, look at this. I quote:

The Powerful CHOGM Message

The Cassandras are at it again, and their droning on is worse

than a lethal U.S government unmanned aircraft assault..People are free to fantasize about such positions in a free country such as ours...

You can speak freely because there is freedom in this country. - [Interruption.] You do not know Sinhala. How can you teach me English? You had better pronounce Sinhala words correctly. I further quote:

..but one needs to wonder about the productivity of such

fantasies in the long term. People should indeed be more worried about their long term prospects and without a doubt these will be served by the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting. All countries which have had events such as CHOGM on their calendar during a phase of growth and development have benefited enormously from the visibility that these events afforded such countries - Malaysia and Singapore being the two prime examples.

Sir, the reality is powerful. He is not ready to listen. He cannot understand English. He is running away; he cannot understand what is there in the "Daily News".

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. (Mrs.) Sriyani Wijewickrama to take the Chair?

1015 1016

) ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I propose that the Hon.(Mrs.) Sriyani Wijewickrama do now take the Chair.

. . Question put, and agreed to.

.

, , () .

Whereupon THE HON. UDITH LOKUBANDARA left the Chair, and THE HON. (MRS.) SRIYANI WIJEWICKRAMA took the Chair.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) 0 I again quote:

This reality is powerful - and a few chatterers on the sidelines

will merely represent the pathetic state of denial of the chattering classes, and thats what mainly underlies the recent spate of predictions by the Cassandras to the effect that the next months are make or break, or that there is irredeemable division within the government. All this provides a sort of a comic backdrop to a happy upbeat scenario. Its as if the clowns are doing their bit before a very riveting show begins.

They have turned clowns. I am not worried about the Hon. Anura Dissanayake. But, there is a new clown.

What is the reason behind this? It is a conspiracy, an international conspiracy, and the local conspirators have joined hands with them. The other day, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera said that Callum Macrae of Channel 4 will not sleep until we solve the human rights problem. What is the human rights problem that they are speaking of? They must look at their figures in the mirrors. Then, they would see what is in the West. Day in and day out, the Palestinian people are suffering. We know about the torture camps that are conducted in certain Western countries. They are the people who are violating the human rights day and night. You had better turn to them.

Now, what is happening? The conspiracy is this. After CHOGM takes place in this country, our President elected by a majority of nearly 20 lakhs of votes will be the Leader of the Commonwealth for the next two years.

The Vel cart and procession went through the streets without any problem and in the absence of His Excellency the President, Madam Shiranthi Rajapaksa received the Vel cart at his official residence, "Temple Trees". Now, we proceed further away to the Colombo Tamil Sangam in Wellawatte.

See how the Tamil Language is being fosterd and developed. Everyday, they hold seminars at Tamil Sangam. The Indian lecturers are coming, lecturing and launching Tamil books here. At the Ramakrishna Mission, there is also the Kamban Vila festival held annually. There is no problem whatsoever Our ladies -
