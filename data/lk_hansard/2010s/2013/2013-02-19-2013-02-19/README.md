QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE INCIDENTS OF ATTACKS IN MOSQUES IN KURUNEGALA AND HIRIYALA ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, on the 6th of February, 2013, I had occasion to raise a question relating to a matter of public

441 442

2013 19

importance, namely, the ethnic and communal incidents that were taking place in the country and referred to the Statement made in the House by the Deputy Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs, the Hon. M.K.A.D.S. Gunawardana who denied that there were such incidents.

The Leader of the House replying on the 7th of February, 2013 stated that I had distorted the facts. He went on to inquire which were the mosques that had been attacked and what was the period during which these incidents had occurred and challenged me to give details. He also stated that the Inspector-General of Police had referred that there had been no incidents of attacks on mosques or religious groups other than what had been referred to in the Statement.

As I had stated, I will be writing to the Minister with details because I do not want to make a public issue of all those incidents but I would like to make a statement regarding the incidents which occurred in Kurunegala and Hiriyala, which the police had denied.

In the first instance, I would like to refer to the front page report of the Tamil newspaper Sudar Oli of 26th July, 2012 which refers to an incident where some Bhikkus had forcibly entered the Mosque at Inguruwatte and demanded that the Mosque be shut down. Another incident referred to in the same newspaper refers to the Ambanpola Mosque where some people have forcibly thrown away the Holy Quran.

As the police say that there have been no reports on these incidents, I want to refer to the letter dated 14th April, 2012, addressed to the President by M.T. Baddurdeen referring to an incident at the Akram Mosque, Makulwewa with an attached petition and a letter dated 29th December, 2011, addressed to the Viharadhipathi of Makulwewa by the Divisional Secretary of Ganewatte, Nikadalupotha. I do not want to read out all these details. What I have been saying is that these issues have not yet been resolved and the problems are continuing. I think the Hon. Minister of Justice also wrote at that time about the Al-Akram Jummah Muslim Mosque. He wrote to the DIG of North Western Province. I do not know how the police can say that they are not aware of it.

The Police Report that no incidents have taken place in Hiriyala and Kurunegala are incorrect. There is continuing tension in the area. Therefore, will the Government have an independent inquiry into this matter on what the police have said after consulting the Provincial Council Members and Members of Parliament who have made complaints and brought this to the notice of the police? Many of them are on the Government side. That is all that we are asking, Sir.

I also have another issue to raise. I spoke to the Hon. Leader of the House about this, Hon. Speaker. It is an important issue. That is, vacancies in the local authorities

445 446

are not filled. The Commissioner-General of Elections has stated that the amendment is unclear as to whether the vacancies should be filled according to the earlier method or whether it has to be filled under the new law to represent a ward.

Our intention in this House very clearly was that the new system applies when the next elections are held. Therefore, the vacancies should be filled now. It affects all the parties.

Secondly, Hon Speaker, I think we all agreed that the elections to a local authority is done on the basis of the local authority. Everyone in the area voted for one of the parties. Then, you apportioned it and gave a certain number of members for each of the parties. Now, you cannot go and set this aside by trying to elect people who are part of the ward. That means, the whole value of the votes of the voters in that area is dislodged. It is against the sovereignty of the people. In 1977, we came up with a Constituency system. We made provision for the PR system and, if necessary, to hold by-elections also. But, here we are going from a PR system into a Constituency system. So, that can only operate, as we decided, at the time that the new system comes in. I think we should ask the Ministers to go into it. I am told that the Attorney-General is going into it. The best that we can do is, the Party Leaders can speak with the Attorney-General and the Commissioner-General of Elections and ask them to fill up the vacancies and we can bring any covering legislation that is required. Otherwise, you cannot do it. In any case, you cannot fill it up ward-wise because then, you will be going against the franchise exercised under the PR system.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, can I just have a clarification on one matter?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes. - [Interruption.] About this? Yes, I am telling you.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You said Sinolanka Hotels and Spa (Pvt.) Limited. Who are the shareholders of that?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I will give you the details. Sinolanka Hotels and Spa (Pvt.) Limited is a subsidiary of another company by the name of Canwill Holdings (Pvt.) Limited operating with two other minority shareholder companies: the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation and Litro.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister - () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Let me finish. After that, you can raise any question. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I have here a copy of the Application for the registration of that company, Sinolanka Hotels and Spa (Pvt.) Limited. Annex I of that gives the following four names as its Directors: Gamini Sedara Senarath, Piyadasa Kudabalage, Adambarage Modantha Mohan De Alwis, Hapuhinne Karunadhipathi Divarathna Wasala Mudiyanselage Neel Bandara Hapuhinne. Then, Annex II also gives the same names as its shareholders.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) So, they are Directors of the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) A share is Rs. 10 each in cumulative terms and the entire share capital is Rs. 40. So, Hon. Minister, if the Government of Sri Lanka is permitting a strategic development company, Hyatt Regency, which is supposed to come up through Sinolanka Hotels and Spa (Pvt.) Limited such tax advantages, what is the benefit that is accrued to the country?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is exactly what I am trying to explain. .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, Parliament must know who the owners are. - [Interruption.] Of the four shareholders, one is at the Presidential Secretariat. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) , .

He told me, Harsha, if there is one thing that is going to ensure a sustained flow of foreign direct investments into an economy, that is good governance. Unless and until you have good governance, it is impossible to attract the kind of investors that you like to bring in.

Sir, a heading from the online edition of The Island newspaper of Tuesday, 19th February, 2013 says, Wimal calls for sweeping changes at Finance Ministry. I do not know whether he is taking a potshot at the very President who appointed him. Is he now sulking because he is unable to execute all the promises that he gave during the election? Is he not able to perform the work that he basically said he would be doing? He said he will build two hundred thousand, three hundred thousand houses a year. Has he not been able to fulfill this? Because of the non-fulfilment, are the President, the Secretary, Finance now held responsible for this? I do not know. These are matters that need to be looked into. All what we as the Opposition say is that we appreciate at least in this late stage all these people are suddenly accepting this.

The total number of beneficiaries and the amount of loans granted by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to the Northern Province under "Uthuru Wasanthaya" from 2010 to 2012 is contained in Annex I. Since I do not have time to read the whole thing, I will table* it.

The total expenditure incurred for the development of the Northern Province by the Government of Sri Lanka during the period 2009 to 2012 is contained in Annex II, which I table*.

Sir, all these amounts are stated in millions.There are so many ministries that have contributed to this development. The Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development and the Ministry of Transport including other ministries have spent a total sum of Rs. 33,343 million. All the details are mentioned in Annex II. If you want more details, you can ask from Mrs. C. Premaratne or Roshan Bukhari. They are ready to help even the Opposition MPs to get these statistics straight. Sir, the "Northern Spring" which is the "Uthuru Wasanthaya" - " " - is a development programme which caters to the needs of those in the Northern Province in regard to infrastructure development, electricity, water supply and sanitation.

The estimated development expenditure under "Uthuru Wasanthaya" for the year 2013 is contained in Annex III which I table*.
