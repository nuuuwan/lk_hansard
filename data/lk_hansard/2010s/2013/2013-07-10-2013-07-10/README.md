... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Azwer, what is your point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I would refer to the Standing Order No. 31, especially 31(7) and 31(10). I want to raise the propriety of entertaining a Question of this nature to which a comprehensive answer has already been given by the Minister.

Standing Order No. 31(7) states, I quote:

A question may not ask for an expression of opinion, or for the solution of an abstract legal question or of a hypothetical proposition.

Standing Order No. 31(10) states:

A question making or implying a charge of a personal character shall be disallowed.

So, how can this Member purport to ask a question in this House from the Hon. Minister whether he knows that these women are being made use for prostitution, which cannot be entertained. Sir, this is not a good Parliamentary procedure that we are trying to follow. Not only that, this Member has a habit of insulting the Shariah Law, the Divine law, Allah's law. He is always abusing and insulting the great Kingdom of Saudi Arabia which has close friendly relationship with Sri Lanka.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, I will bring this to the notice of the Hon. Speaker for appropriate action. Thank you very much.

Then, there is another headline, Cabinet Ministers brother released due to pressure from above. It refers to one of the Cabinet Ministers from Kandy.

Yesterday, the Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Minister of Investment Promotion informed this House that gambling is illegal and no licences are given for casinos.

"Govt. misses revenue target by Rs. 51.2 b or 14% up to April; expenditure overshot by Rs. 16 b or 2.5% Year on Year dip in revenue is 4% expenditure up by 7% "

So, the gap is 11 per cent. Now, this 11 per cent in reflection of the total GDP of the country, basically represents a huge figure. You all are not talking of rupees and cents. It is like the exchange rate depreciation.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I was informed that the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara will not be speaking. He has been allotted 15 minutes. Out of that, I will take eight minutes and the balance will be given to the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne. 4.5 ) 7.5 . ) . . . . 4.5 . ) , 13.2 ) ) .

Not only balance sheet items but off balance sheet items should also be verified, questioned and investigated. That is the role of an Auditor. As an Accountant, I would love to propose to the Chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprises - I know that you will be presenting the COPE Report within the next couple of days on behalf of us - as discussed, to meet the Hon. Speaker and ensure that the Standing Orders are amended to include this type of thing because it is not only the figures seen in a balance sheet, but also the off balance sheet figures, that will make or break an institution. That is what happened to the SriLankan Airlines. That is what happened to the CEB and it is the same thing that is happening to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. So, these are areas that need to be rectified.

Off balance sheet items should be verified, scrutinized and perused. These are matters on which corroborative evidence can be obtained. That is why I thought that it is my duty to state here today that they should not just be investigating and looking at the historical performance of an institution but also proactively look at what could happen and what did not happen through the process of management decision making. Management decision making is a very clear cut opportunity.

The Hon. Dilan Perera, Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, is a clear cut example. He works off the normal course of activity. I saw the debate he had in the morning. His amiable and generous disposition got somewhat perturbed because of the pressure exerted from the Opposition but he is one person who tries to, at least, be innovative and not stick to the rules because by sticking to the rules, you can sometimes be more corrupt than otherwise. So, I pay this tribute to him because of the experience I had. I addressed three or four matters and there were spontaneous responses. The efficacy and the economic viability in running the Ministry will be left to others to discuss but I thought a tribute needs to be paid where it is due.

Likewise, I urge the Hon. Ministers, instead of just raising your hands and being just by-standers in the Cabinet, to come out. As I said, we are the Government-in-waiting. What happened in 2001? You all had ruined the economy and gave us a negative growth economy. It was we, the United National Party, that was able to resurrect the economy and push it to some level and even today, dividends are obtained because of the push that you got at that particular moment. So, ensure that these

249 250

2013 10

are checked because after all, it is the national economy that we are speaking of. This is not a blue colour economy or a green colour economy, it is the national economy that we are speaking of.

Purchasing an aircraft is one area that I urge you all to pay attention to because it is not fun to buy Rolls Royce engines from one area and buy airbuses from another area. Sometimes there is corruption when you do not go directly. But, when you go directly, if you do not go to the correct people, there will be more corruption. If you go to a company like GE Engineering, which basically deals with aircraft, or to the leasing company - I forget the name - they buy 10,000 to 20,000 and you can get a quicker delivery as well as a bigger discount than going direct to a particular institution.

[4.49 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Karu Jayasuriya) Mr. Presiding Member, a lot has been said about the salary scale applicable to the Auditor-General and also the good work done by the Auditor-Generals Department. I, for one, coming from the private sector, always believe that the Auditor-General is grossly underpaid. The salary that we are talking about is actually, in American terms, "peanuts" because a position of this nature deserves a much higher salary.

The Hon. DEW Gunasekara, as the Chairman of the COPE, explained in detail the enormous amount of work that is done by the Auditor-General and his team and the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne also expressed his views on the principal involved. Therefore, we do not intend to object to the salary increase proposed. That, I would like to tell the House because we have a responsibility especially to defend and protect the Office of the Auditor-General.

Talking about the history, I think public accountability dates back to King Mahinda in the 10th Century AD, a long time ago. The Auditor-General's Department itself has a 214 year-old history. During this period, we must say, they have done exemplary work, carried out their duties to the best of their ability and history says that the work they have done, dating back to the colonial days, had received wide acceptance and was to the satisfaction of everybody.

Sir, of course, we have to strengthen this position because I always believe that in this country, financial discipline is not there: we do not believe in forward planning, financial prudence and much about internal auditing. So, there have been occasions where public money had been wasted without any plan, approval or any valid reason. Therefore, the role of the Auditor-General is very important here.

Looking back, I must say that during the last couple of years, we have been able to, through the COPE, work very closely with the Auditor-General and they have been bold enough to come out with and highlight facts and to follow through. But, let me ask whether we have the required number of competent people in the Auditor-Generals Department. Are they well-resourced and well equipped? They must be trained; they must adopt the best tools and techniques and must be compensated well. As I have said before, to get the best talent available, they must have an attractive remuneration package and must be exposed to the other countries' best-in-class practices. Do they have all the modern techniques and tools, equipment and methodologies? These are the areas on which the attention of the Auditor-General should be focused and we, in turn, must support him to make his Department a very viable and strong body.

Sir, I remember that as far back as the early '70s, we had a Corporations Division under the Treasury and that monitored the performance of public corporations and statutory boards. That Division survived many regimes. Its first Director, if I remember right, was no less than Mr. P.M.W. Wijesuriya, who was later to become the countrys most revered Auditor-General. During the regime of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, the Corporations Division was renamed as the "Department of Public Enterprises". I think the then Director General was an exceptionally capable lady, a professional and chartered accountant, whom I had the distinct privilege of working with. As a Member of the Presidential Commission on Privatization and also as a Member of the Public Investment Management Board, I was able to work very closely with that Department.

They did an exemplary job. That Department made sure that every government institution, State-owned enterprise or statutory board was externally audited and on time. The performance of these entities was monitored. The reports of that Department were actually feeders for the COPE and it was extremely helpful. I am not sure whether that exists today.

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara - Minister of National Languages and Social Integration) It exists. ( ) (The Hon. Karu Jayasuriya) Very good!

In the discharge of my duties with the COPE, Sir, I also have come across the Auditor-General and his staff on many occasions and I found them energetic, committed and brave. They also highlight very serious breaches of financial indiscipline. I am sorry to say that Reports of the Auditor-General are not taken very seriously, as I said before, by some quarters. This is very unfortunate because the Auditor-General is the watchdog of public finance. It is the peoples money that we have to take care of. So, he is really the watchdog of public funds. We have seen gross abuse of funds by some government departments and sometimes, by provincial councils and even local government institutions. I also remember instances where these were highlighted by the Auditor-General in his Report but no proper action had been taken. I think one of the Hon. Members of Parliament said that these accounts sometimes drag for five to ten years. It is true. They raise a query but no action is taken.

Therefore, it is time that we take some very serious steps to correct this anomaly. I think it is a very serious

crime that no action is taken on the Reports submitted by the Auditor-General. It is here that we advocate strict Government surveillance.

Today, Sir, there is a very serious waste of public funds. The media highlighted several instances of extravagant spending of public funds by powerful people. In the name of development, we indulge in various projects, wasting enormous amounts of money without a feasibility study or a project report. This is something very unfortunate happening in Sri Lanka. Huge amounts, billions of rupees, have been spent and we have come across instances where no proper study or feasibility study has been done.

In my view, Sir, it is very important that we make the respective Ministry Secretaries accountable. I know, by law, they are accountable but it has to be followed strictly. There are several Ministries and institutions coming under various Ministries which have fallen behind in replying to audit queries or correcting the misdeeds. Therefore, even the Minister should give the required strength to the respective Secretaries of Ministries.

In the modern world, Sir, financial reporting can be done pretty fast. I recall that in 2003, the then UNF Government appointed a Cabinet Subcommittee. It comprised of the then Finance Minister, Hon. K.N. Choksy, the then Trade Minister, Hon.Ravi Karunanayake and it was chaired by me. We came across some State accounts which were over 10 years old. So, at that time, we realized that there was no point in bringing these accounts before Parliament. Therefore, the Subcommittee sat and with the help of the then Auditor-General, it was able to clear most of the outstanding accounts. By the end of that year or within a period of about 18 months, it was possible for us to get 90 per cent of the accounts cleared and then we found that most of the accounts were coming before Parliament within six to nine months. So, that was quite creditable and even now, I must say that quite a large number of Government institutions submit their accounts to Parliament within that period. I mentioned this to the Chairman of the COPE, that we should make it mandatory. I do not think any institution should take more than nine months to submit the accounts.

Also, those who violate financial discipline must be held responsible. I must cite just one instance where a State media institution had an outstanding amount running into several millions of rupees for services extended for political purposes. This was highlighted in the media and had been taken up at the COPE for the last several years, but nothing happened.

These are the type of incorrect financial procedures followed or the authority that has been used by certain people for political purpose and we certainly must put an end to this.

283 284

)

With regard to appointment of right people to most of the Government institutions, I must say here that, in principle, we always believe that COPE should be chaired by a Member of the Opposition. But, I must also say that this argument is not valid for the Hon. DEW Gunasekara. Although he is a Member of the Government, he has discharged his duties extremely well. We are very happy to work with him and it was probably a historical process that most of the institutions have gone through without favour. In this process, we have come across very good and profitable Government institutions which are professionally-run and professionally-maintained. They are run by good, competent management teams, management boards and chairmen. Also, we have come across some institutions run by political appointees who are not worthy of appointment. Hon Presiding Member, even today when we make appointments to the Diplomatic Service, there is a system of screening. There have been one or two occasions where we had to decline the appointments of some of the people who came before the Committee on High Posts. Therefore, even the Chairman felt that we must look into the possibility of introducing some sort of screening of the top appointees to large public corporations to see that, at least financially they have done no wrong. So, these are little thoughts that came to our minds.

Sir, I also feel that with the development of accounting and auditing in the world, the time has come for us to invite the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions - INTOSAI - to further strengthen to evaluate the Auditor-Generals Department, to determine how well-equipped with people, tools and techniques we are and how effective the Office of the Auditor-General is amidst various attempts to obstruct good work.

This is said in good faith because I have seen the vast developments made in India. I would like to cite a comment made by Mr. Vinod Rai, former Controller and Auditor-General of India about INTOSAI. He said this in this very month, July, in the International Journal of Government Auditing. As some of us believe in good governance, transparency and accountability, we try to keep abreast of these developments.

Mr. Vinod Rai states, I quote:

I recently completed my term as Controller and Auditor-General of India.

Building on the foundation laid in Lima and its reiteration and consolidation in Mexico, INTOSAI has emerged as a champion of the independence of supreme audit institutions. Today, it is recognized as the leading standard-setting body in the field of public audit. Examples of INTOSAIs growing stature and confidence include formulating auditing standards and guidance on best practices for good governance; building a partnership with multilateral international donors and national development agencies to promote capacity building in supreme audit institutions in need of such efforts; and having the United Nations adopt a General

Assembly Resolution acknowledging the main principles of the Lima and Mexico Declarations and recognizing the role of supreme audit institutions in promoting the efficiency, transparency and accountability of public administration.

These developments also underscore the fact that INTOSAI is a catalyst in a paradigm shift in the way public audit is perceived today and its relevance to modern societies is demonstrated. In a few months, INTOSAI will be adopting a standard that asserts the values and benefits of supreme audit institutions.

Roles that required auditors to express an opinion about whether financial statements were free from material misstatements. While this will continue to be a key role for all auditors, the increasing complexity in governance today and the demand for greater accountability place an onerous responsibility on auditors. Our minds are occupied as never before with questions about whether we have obligations beyond those achieved by traditional audits, whether governance is actually improving the lives of our citizens and whether public policy and programs are responsive to the needs of those for whom such programs are intended."

Sir, I believe that we can take a lesson from these wonderful words of Vinod Rai, former Controller and Auditor-General of India, from the land of the Mahatma, our friend and neighbour.

In conclusion, let me once again pay tribute to the Auditor-General and the Auditor-General's Department. There is a tremendous responsibility lying ahead of them. There are quite a large number of public bodies that run at a loss. These are the areas that need to be looked at because these are people's money. We have to look into them in detail and find out why these are going wrong. I have seen a few instances of obstructing but it is our duty to support this institution.

Once again, in conclusion, let me say, as I said before, we are not objecting to the salary increase; it should be done. It is only a matter of principle that was highlighted and I wish the Department well.

Thank you very much.

COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, I move,

The 58th Session of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association was held very successfully in Sri Lanka under the guidance of the Hon. Speaker.

Preparations are being made to hold the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sri Lanka this year. It is of utmost importance that the general public is made aware of the significance of holding an international conference of this nature in the country. Therefore, it is moved in this august House that, programmes for making the public aware of the 23rd Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting be implemented at national level.

I table* the Sinhala and Tamil versions of the Motion to be included in the Hansard. Before I commence, the Hon. (Ven.) Ellawala Medhananda Thero would second the Motion and after that I would carry on.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Presiding Member, Sri Lanka, which was called earlier "Seylan", "Serendib" and "Taprobane" has a long, colourful and unenviable relationship with foreign states from time immemorial. This land, "The Pearl of the Indian Ocean", has attracted the Arabs even before the advent of the Holy Prophet in Arabia. The world famous Globe-Trotter, Ibn Battuta of Morocco landed on this island of serenity and put little Sri Lanka - or Ceylon at that time - on the world map. Then, Sir, a great seafarer, Fa-Hien Bhikku from China also made a great impact on the island in the global scene. The Siamese Bhikku brought Upasampada from Thailand and so is our intimate relationship with Burma throughout the ages.

After such an intimate and long relationship with the countries the world over, preparations are now being made to hold the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting - CHOGM - in November, 2013 in Sri Lanka. Sir, Heads of Governments of 52 member countries have been invited for this Conference. The theme of the CHOGM, Growth with equity: inclusive development has been proposed by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. On the margins of the CHOGM, the Commonwealth Business Forum, the Commonwealth Youth Forum and the Commonwealth Peoples Forum will also take place. The Commonwealth Business Council - CBC - envisages that there will be

approximately 1,000 participants from which about 500 would be from abroad. Non-Commonwealth countries have also been invited to participate in this event. About 80 projects in Sri Lanka have been detailed to be promoted among the participants. So, Sir, the CBC envisages that generation of investment business of about US Dollars two billion to Sri Lanka. These are the benefits that are going to accrue to our island as a result of holding the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.

Now, Sir, it is significant to note what our Excellency the President has promised in "Mahinda Chintana" at the last General Election.

I quote from the subheading, "A Non-aligned foreign policy" on pages 56 and 57 of "Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future: A new Sri Lanka - A Brighter Future",

"I will continue Sri Lanka's non-aligned foreign policy. During the last four years we witnessed the benefits of maintaining friendly relations with India, Japan, China, Pakistan and other Asian countries. I am committed to continue these friendly relations in the political, economic, defence, trade and cultural arena.

I will maintain the dignity of my country in foreign relations and will initiate a new programme to forge relations with countries."

This is what His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa promised to the nation at the last General Election. Today we see the fruition of its full results. Although there have been various vicious attempts made by certain quarters - NGOs, the diaspora and even local conspirators - to dissuade Commonwealth countries from attending the CHOGM, nothing worked as they dreamt; everything is going very smooth.

The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 54 countries that supports each other and works together towards shared goals in democracy and development. The Commonwealth is a home to two billion citizens of all faiths and ethnicities and includes some of the world's largest, smallest, richest and poorest countries. Over half of its citizens are 25 or under. This is the most significant factor to note.

Now, when you hold this Conference here, these Heads of Nations will represent two billion citizens of the world. The Association has roots as far back as the 1870s. It was reconstituted in 1949 when the Commonwealth Prime Ministers met and adopted the London Declaration where it was agreed that all member countries would be freely and equally associated. The Commonwealth believes in the best democracies achieved through partnership of government business and civil society. When we are holding this in our soil, it is a very opportune moment for us to showcase the post-conflict developments in Sri Lanka and the opportunity available for economic co-operation.

God has given this opportunity for us! The values are protected at Government level by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group.

So, my endeavour today, through this Motion, is to make an appeal to the Government to make our people understand and realize the value of such a massive Heads of Governments converging here because it is such a gigantic task to achieve by a small country like ours. I believe this will be the most significant event after the Non-Aligned Summit which took place in 1976 at the newly-built Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall under the Chairmanship of the late Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike. This certainly will help our nation to leap forward. We have to admit that all the countries are convinced that there is peace in this country and this country has a future. We can impart the rich qualities of our histroy, culture and heritage to the West, the East and to the Middle-East countries. That is why I say that no power will be able to dissuade those countries from attening this Commonwealth Moot. All those will be simply futile attempts.

Sir, I would now like to quote St. 60 of "Everlasting Mercy" by Masefield, this important axiom:

"States are not made, nor patched; they grow, Grow slow through centuries of pain, And grow correctly in the main, But only grow by certain laws Of certain bits in certain jaws."

Then, look at what is stated in Section 6 of "Annals" - Book iii by Tacitus on Commonwealth. I quote:

"Chiefs are mortal, the commonwealth is eternal."

Then, again, Edmund Burke in his speech in the House of Commons on 11th February, 1780 beautifully portrays the beauty of the Commonwealth. He said, I quote:

"Individuals pass like shadows; but the commonwealth is fixed and eternal."

So, we are going to have eternal peace and prosperity in this country after holding the CHOGM.

I am very much confident that our amiable, genius, genial, great Professor, the Hon. G.L. Peiris, who is heading the foreign sector of our country as the Minister of External Affairs has taken all the initiatives and he has left no stone unturned, to make this momentous event a success that is so well deserved.

? [ ] , , plantation sector . . " " . .

Some people who are born in this country, breathe the air of this country, and drink the water of this country, go abroad and say, "Do not come to Sri Lanka, do not give aid and assistance to Sri Lanka". Certain other devious methods they adopt unashamedly. His Excellency the President himself has said, "Of course, we are getting loans. They are well spent for development projects. Which is the country that do not get loans?" Even America is supposed to be borrowing loans from China now. The impression that has been created in China about Sri Lanka is amazing.

Recently, I had the good fortune of going to China with His Excellency the President on his official visit. The Minister of External Affairs and others were in this entourage. The Chinese are very convinced about Sri Lanka. A record number of bilateral relationship and "Leader to Leader" agreements were signed on that occasion. Not only that, they are very convinced about the progress and development that has been made after 30 years of prolonged war, which the world has not seen in recent history. The country is progressing tremendously. So, they are willing to help. ), ) ; . . I have the "Mahinda Chintana" here with me. The Chinese Government is so convinced that they have translated the "Mahinda Chintana" fully into the Chinese language.

Sir, I must relate this story to you:

The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, Minister of External Affairs held a press conference after signing the agreements between our Leader and the Chinese Leader, Xi Jinping. At that conference, a young talented Chinese female journalist asked, "What is 'Mahinda Chintana'?" They know English very well. They have mastered the language. They are masters at everything. At that time, the Hon. Minister told Ambassador Ranjit Uyangoda to please make available to them the Chinese translation of the "Mahinda Chintana". The "Mahinda Chintana" has been translated into the Chinese language by Professor Ma Zhongwen of Jinan University in Guangzhou. Sir, this is an amazing story of modern Sri Lanka. Where on this earth has a policy statement of a leader or a political party been translated into another language and published as a book in this country? Later, Ambassador Ranjit Uyangoda told me that copies of the "Mahinda Chintana" have been distributed to them and they are doing an in-depth study about the significance of the "Mahinda Chintana."

They want to study how this revolution - a miracle - has taken place in Sri Lanka. Therefore, we all are very happy that the Heads of Government from Commonwealth nations are coming to Sri Lanka. Not only that, Sir, as the Head of the host country, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa will be entitled to be the Chairman of the Commonwealth for the next two years. This will grant him an unparallel opportunity

to be a leader on the world stage. He will be the leader of the 54 Commonwealth nations for the next two years. Feel jealous, if you like.

; . . , . . . , .

So, Sir, the Heads of Government will participate in conferences and visit various parts of the country. The main meetings will be held in Colombo, Kandy and Hambantota - the new "land" of Sri Lanka. Our economic revival will be showcased to the world through Hambantota, for sure.

There was a recommendation made on Cricket. I would also agree with it. The Commonwealth has a wealth of cricketers. It is the Queens country, the Great Britain, that introduced Cricket to the world sports. England, New Zealand, Australia, Zimbabwe, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh all play serious Cricket. They can play a match - Sri Lanka Vs. the rest of the Commonwealth countries. We welcome such a move. We understand that such a move is being very seriously worked out.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Earl Gunasekara - Deputy Minister of Plantation Industries) A business forum will also be there. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Yes, a business forum will also be there. Now, you can see we are inviting foreign investors to our country. They would be going to Jaffna through the A9 road or they would fly. What would they see? They would see a completely different land of revival and survival. Last time when a Commonwealth Parliamentary Delegation came here, I had the opportunity of accompanying them to Jaffna through the A9 road. I took the microphone in that luxury coach on the way and gave a full description of the landscape before and after the war. The Hon. Abdulla Shahid, the Speaker of the Peoples Majlis of Republic of Maldives and some delegates who came from Canada told me We want to come here with our families to see Jaffna and enjoy our holiday next time.

( ) (The Hon. Earl Gunasekara) Including the "Mahinda Chintana".

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Yes, I explained to them that all these great strides made in the field of development in the North has taken place after the implementation of the "Mahinda Chintana". Then, of course, they said, We want to come here with our families to see Jaffna and enjoy a holiday. They were convinced to that extent.

I was talking about cricket. His Excellency the President is very eager to recruit talented cricketers from Jaffna to the National Team. Three lads have already been selected from Jaffna and are being coached in Colombo. A coaching camp was held in Colombo with the great speedsters Chaminda Vass and Ravindra Pushpakumara.

This is the new world we see! As I told you the other day, people who cannot see the good side of life are really blind, not the people who are blind at their birth. So, we see the road is open for us. We see a great future for us and I want the Hon. Minister to exercise some more powers and also to put more pressure. I am very much convinced and I know the talented, able and amiable staff that the Secretary to the Ministry of External Affairs, Mr. Karunatilaka Amunugama has. I have accompanied them on several visits with our President to other countries. They are very clever; they can match - may I say - any able bureaucrats or foreign service staff in any other country. You could see that they are perhaps unmatched and they are the wealth of the Ministry of External Affairs. So, we are going to have a wealth of expertise, knowledge and development.

( ) (The Hon. Earl Gunasekara ) . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) , . . .

Therefore, Sir, as I said earlier, it is a golden opportunity that we have. Colombo will be the centre, the Capital hosting the CHOGM. After it was held in Perth, Australia, we are going to have it here now. Therefore, Sir, I only appeal to the good senses of the Hon. Members of the Opposition, including the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, do not attempt to defile our culture, our status as a nation and our good name; do not spread scurrilous literature abroad.

Today, what happened when the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake spoke? He condemned the Shariah law. It is practised in Saudi Arabia. You know, Sir, the seriousness of that statement. He should be declared an apostate. I asked the Hon. Leader of the Opposition at that time, What do you say? Is this your party policy? Nobody can challenge the Quranic laws, the Divine law. You can speak about or criticize Buddhist history or other history but you can never challenge or find fault with Pirith or Dhammapada. So, the Quran, in its pristine form is unchallenged in the world.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please, try to wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay. Therefore, Sir, I would ask them to refrain from such dubious attempts. In the name of Allah, I would say we are on the correct path and this country would be further blessed after holding the CHOGM. We hail the leadership of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa to whom Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of the United Nations said - when we had a meeting with him outside the UN General Assembly - You are a great leader that we find in Asia. I would ask you take the leadership of Asia". So, that is our proud President!

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you very much. The next speaker is the Hon. Sri Ranga.
