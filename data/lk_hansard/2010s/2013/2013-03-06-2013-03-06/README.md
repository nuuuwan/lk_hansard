Mr. Presiding Member, we are witnessing today the birth of a new era in sports. I must initially congratulate the Minster of Sports, the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage, for the great strides he has made in so short a period in order to build up a healthy nation

313 314

[ ]

2013 06

through sports. Sir, the President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, will go down in history not only as a great leader of a nation, but also as a great captain who dealt a terrible blow to Prabhakaran and won the match at Nanthikadal.

Sir, as far as sports is concerned, this is what the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future states.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! .

, [ ] .

, , [ ] . Whereupon THE HON. JANAKA BANDARA left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. CHANDIMA WEERAKKODY] took the Chair.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Speaker, this is what the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future states on sports, I quote:

Sports are not confined to the energetic youth but encompass the young and the old. Fitness, mental development and a team spirit are interconnected with sports and I believe that the development of sports is an essential investment for the future. Therefore I will strengthen sports to ensure the balanced development of all citizens.

This is the pledge the President has given to the nation and he is implementing those proposals contained in the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future.

Sir, if we are to make Sri Lanka a leading country in sports, it is imperative for us to be a healthy, disciplined, united, prosperous and a proud nation in our mission. Accordingly, the Hon. Minister of Sports, the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage, has become the first-ever Minister in the history of sports who has enforced the Sports Association Orders in a more practical way. In this regard, my respect and thanks are due to him.

Also, I recall the name of the Hon. K.B. Ratnayake, who was the first Minister of Sports in this country. In 1975, I remember, with a vivid memory, watching the first Limited Overs World Cup held at the Kennington Oval in London. The Hon. K.B. Ratnayake came at that time accompanied by the then Speaker of Parliament, the Hon. Stanley Tillekeratne. They were returning after attending a Commonwealth parley at the Isle of Man.

Sir, I think it is very essential that all these things are done in the proper way. As far as cricket is concerned, I

must recall that about 30 to 40 years ago, a very high standard was maintained. There was not much competition among schools at that time. Then, there were good coaches, masters of the game. The coaches of these days want to win by hook or crook. But, in those days, they always looked at the child, whether he had got the talent and also they ensured discipline in children at that time.

Then, I recall one of the prolific writers of today contributing useful articles to the local newspapers and one of our early Nalandian players, Mr. Premasara Epasinghe. He also writes on various other subjects like Buddhism, archaeology, education and business management. Those are very educative and informative.

When he was playing for the Nalanda College at that time, the Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera played the role of fast bowler, and Epasinghe recalled that he was in the mould of Chaminda Vaas or even better at that time. He established a record by taking five wickets for 55 runs. "Epa" took two catches off his bowling.

Sir, there had been several able coaches and I do not want to quote all the names. But, one name that comes to my mind at this moment is B.J.H. Bahar, who established the First Indoor Cricket at Zahira College, Colombo.

Then, in 1969, I think Epasinghe selected a team to go to India, which consisted of players like Mithra Wettimuny, Ajith de Silva, Bandula Warnapura, Lalith Kaluperuma, Tony Opatha and various others. I am happy, Sir, that Bandula Warnapura, although he dented his name by taking part in the South African Tournament, Kerry Packer's, together with Tony Opatha, had come back to help develop cricket in this country.

I must also congratulate the new Chairman of the Selection Committee, our Colleague, the Hon. Sanath Jayasuriya, the "crackerjacker" in world cricket. He is doing a very good job. He intervened at the correct time and saved a very big catastrophe from befalling cricket. The senior players refused to sign the contract. Sanath convinced them to sign it and now, they are playing as a team. Otherwise, what would have happened is, against Bangladesh, we would have to field a "B" team. Today, Bangladesh is an upcoming cricketing nation. At the first preliminary match they played at the Sanath Jayasuriya Playground in Matara, 400 odd runs were scored by the Sri Lankan Team and Bangladesh overtook that score. So, we have to be very careful in these matters.

While speaking about cricket, one name that we cannot forget is Tony Greig, who had done a great job. Tony Greig and, I think, Epasinghe had the distinction of commentating on the World Cup Finals in 1996 played at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore, Pakistan. While Tony was describing on television the win hit of Sri Lanka, when Arjuna Ranatunga glided McGrath through the vacant

315 316

slip position, "Epa" described it to Sri Lanka over the airwaves of the SLBC, which are unforgettable memories for the two of us.

Then, Sir, I must also pay tribute to the SLBC or the then Radio Ceylon, as it was called earlier. Radio Ceylon " " . . - live cricket commentaries - . .

, , M.S.M. Bilal won the Colombo Billiards Championship at the Moors' Sports Club only last week well organized by former MP, Shafeek Rajabdeen, the President. The first World Champion that Sri Lanka produced was M.J.M. Lafir of the Moors' Islamic Cultural Home - MICH. I think we have to honour his name in a more positive way, which should not be forgotten.

Then, about putting up of a new stadium, I would kindly request the Hon. Minister to have the Stadium at Santhankerny -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, your time is up. You have to wind up now.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, give me one more minute.

Regarding the Santhankerny Stadium in Kalmunai, I moved a Motion earlier in this House to highlight that matter.

Then, an Hon. Member talked about the ", " - D.S. de Silva and Suraj Dandeniya. But, the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga himself played under D.S. de Silva. - . What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander as well, it should be remembered.

At this moment, Sir, I must also pay a tribute to Mr. Anura Jayawickrama, Secretary to the Ministry, and the Director-General of Sports, Ms. Ranjani Jayakody for helping the Minister to "score" well. I wish the Hon. Minister of Sports all good luck in promoting all sports in this country!

ADJOURNMENT

. . Question proposed.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The Adjournment Motion is to be moved by the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara.

MISLEADING INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF SITUATION IN NORTH

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara) Sir, I move,

With the conclusion of the war, our country has embarked upon a massive development drive with a colossal sum of money being channelled by the Government for the development of the North. When the economic development rate of the country in general is 8 per cent, it is 22 per cent in the North. This is a clear demonstration of the pace with which the Northern Province is developing. The Army has cleared the areas of landmines and almost all displaced persons have been resettled. Housing and educational facilities have also been put in place.

Despite these massive development activities taking place in the North, certain political parties have started issuing statements that completely distort the real situation in these areas. They are hell-bent in discrediting and betraying the country both locally and internationally by propagating diabolical lies such as that the Military is constantly harassing the Tamils; the displaced people have not been resettled and that the demining process is a deception.

Despite having a comprehensive understanding of the activities taking place in the North, these elements conduct themselves in a manner with the objective of deceiving the people living abroad. One of their objectives can be seeking foreign funds to resuscitate the LTTE by spreading the lie that the Tamil people are subjected to harassment.

Therefore, it is resolved that all groups engaged in spreading these lies be asked to desist from engaging in such treacherous acts.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, we know the Government has destroyed one of the most ruthless terrorist organizations in the world, the LTTE, and brought peace to our country. We, the three communities in this country suffered for 35 years, till 19th May, 2009.

After the war, it can be observed that there are massive development projects being carried out. Also, we see very clearly that the Government is giving extra-special attention to the North by commiting a huge sum of money to develop the North. Mainly because the LTTE has destroyed the lives of the Tamil people and I, as an officer who was in the Service for 39 years, have seen the massive destruction caused by the LTTE to the lives of the Tamil people and their property. Also, today, I see how development has taken place, the change that has occurred for good which is unbelievable. The Tamil people have obviously benefited, which is confirmed by the fact that the growth rate in the North today is 22 per cent whereas that of the rest of the country is only 8 per cent. But, with all these, what do the Tamil parties, specially the TNA, do and say to the world? They say that there is a systematic campaign against democracy and the Tamil people. They say that there is no development in Jaffna, the Tamils are ill-treated, the demining story is a bluff, the IDPs are not properly looked after and there is continuous harassment of the Tamils by the Army et cetera. Now, the TNA is travelling to Geneva to campaign against Sri Lanka. Their consistent treacherous attempt to paint a wrong picture in the eyes of the international community is to undermine the economy in Sri Lanka to dissuade investment, persuade tourists to boycott the country, reduce volumes of international trade and strike at the root of economy in Sri Lanka which is, at the moment, vibrant.

Sir, before I appraise this Assembly about the development in the North, first, I would like to ask the TNA whether they have any moral right to speak on behalf of the Tamils in the North.

In terrorism, Sir, there is no middle man as we know; either you are a terrorist or not a terrorist. Why do they call the TNA a proxy of the LTTE? It is because they never condemned any of the atrocities committed by the

325 326

[ ]

2013 06

LTTE. When the LTTE killed reputed Tamils like the Hon. (Dr.) Neelan Tiruchelvam, the Hon. A. Amirthalingam, the Hon. A. Thangathurai and the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, and systematically destroyed the entire democratic leadership of Tamils, the TNA kept mum.

During the peace time when the LTTE came to the Government-controlled areas and extorted Tamils in broad daylight and forcibly took away children for their army, where were the Hon. Sumanthiran and the Hon. Suresh Premachandran? I was the Commander, Northern Naval Area based in KKS at that time and I protested when the LTTE regularly came into the schools and by force took away children for their protest marches.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer to take the Chair?

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) I propose that the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

, ... .

, , ... . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara) Mr. Presiding Member, I know how the principals who protested were brutally assaulted by the LTTE and some were even shot at. Where was Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam at that time? In his suite in USA? What were the responses of the TNA or TNPF towards the Tamil students whose education was consistently disrupted by LTTE at that time? If they did behave in that cowardly manner during that period, what right do they have today to speak when the Army entered the Jaffna University for one day only to stop commemorating that ruthless killer who was responsible for the total devastation of Tamils?

Mr. Presiding Member, during the last days of the war, when the Tamils were fleeing into the Government controlled-areas, how many were point-blankly killed by terrorists? Even at that moment, did the TNA ask the LTTE to stop that? What about that 12-year old innocent

little boy whose both legs were chopped off by the terrorists when he was running into the arms of his parents? Only a terrorist or a terrorist sympathizer could abstain from condemning such a barbaric act and we know that the Hon. M. Sumanthiran, the Hon. Suresh Premachandran and the Hon. Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam did abstain from it.

So, Sir, I do not think that these Tamil parties have any moral right to speak about the Tamils now because they were waiting like eunuchs when the Tamils were really harassed, extorted, conscripted and killed by the LTTE.

Now, having said about the nature and the genuinity of those who criticize the Government, I would now like to mention briefly about the post-war development activities in the North.

As you know, Sir, the most important post-conflict development challenges the Government faced were the demining of approximately 5,000 square kilometres, resettlement of approximately 300,000 IDPs, rehabilitation of 12,000 LTTE cadres and reintegration them into society, reconstruction and economic development.

The LTTE laid a large amount of anti-tank mines, anti-personnel mines and improvised explosive devices as it ran away when the Army was advancing. As at present, the Army has removed 469,000 anti-personnel mines, 390,000 improvised explosive devices and 1,400 anti-tank mines. This, they have done with great risk to their own lives. As a result, the innocent Tamils who were forced to vacate their houses within 10 minutes notice by the LTTE could come and resettle safely. I do not want to ask the TNA whether they have even offered a cup of tea to these noble soldiers who were engaged in demining. I do not want to even state that the TNA is now shedding crocodile tears for Tamils, because I do not want to insult the crocodile.

As of today, 142,300 families have been resettled and the balance will be resettled by mid 2013. Many houses have been built and the Army alone from the soldiers' money has built more than 5,000 houses for the poor Tamils.

His Excellency the President also must be commended for conceiving an Army for designing and implementing a very successful rehabilitation model. It resulted in total reintegration of 11,000 ex-LTTE cadres to society within just three years. Also, 212 ex-LTTE cadres have been already selected for university education and will be doctors, lawyers and engineers in a few years' time. All 512 child soldiers are now with their parents. Matrimony, according to their wishes, was facilitated irrespective of their level of radicalization. Peace villages were established to facilitate re-unification

327 328

of married persons who were undergoing rehabilitation at different centres.

Recently, 200 women were recruited to the Army and 3,500 ex-LTTE cadres, after rehabilitation, including women were recruited to the Civil Defence Force. They get a monthly salary of about Rs. 20,000. They have realized their mistakes and now joined hands with the Civil Defence Force to rebuild the nation.

So far, the Government has spent more than Rs. 425 billion for the reconstruction and development of the North and East Provinces. After May 2009, the Government has initiated Uthuru Wasanthaya, a mega development drive to develop the Northern Province. This massive plan is aiming to make the five districts of the North; Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya and Mannar to be the most-developed parts in the country.

Under this, projects are carried out to expedite demining activities and resettlement, build and repair houses, roads, bridges, develop health and education, boost livelihood of people and social infrastructure. Projects to construct irrigation systems and water supply and sanitation are also carried out to develop the Northern Province.

Today, in the North, 900 schools are functioning with 260,000 students and 13,967 teachers. When compared to other countries under similar circumstances, the achievements of the Sri Lankan Government in restoring the damage done for 30 years within just three years are highly commendable.

The TNA Members of Parliament are the Members of DDC and in actual fact, they are fully aware of the massive development that is taking place. But, so far, they have not uttered a single word about it, let alone appreciating same. On the contrary, there is a diabolical attempt on their part to distort the real picture and give a wrong picture to the international community with ulterior motives. One of their objectives can be the seeking of foreign funds to resuscitate the LTTE by spreading the untruth that Tamil people in the North are not looked after properly.

Therefore, it is resolved that all groups engaged in spreading these untruths be asked to desist from engaging in such treacherous acts.

Thank you.
