The Budget 2014 is well aligned with the "Mahinda Chintana -Vision for the Future" which aims to transform Sri Lanka as a poverty-free, upper-middle income country with a per capita income of US Dollars 4,000 by 2016. The objective is to make Sri Lanka an emerging "Wonder of Asia. The country has already graduated to a middle income country with a per capita income of US Dollars 2,800 in 2011 complemented by an economic growth rate of 6 to 7 per cent. Considerable progress has been achieved in the macroeconomic indicators. Poverty level has steadily declined from 15.2 per cent in 2006 to 6.4 per cent in 2013. Inflation has declined to a single digit of 5 to 6 per cent. The country has almost achieved the targets set under the Millennium Development Goals.

The Government is making all efforts to ensure sustainability of the hard earned peace through national integration. The Government has taken action to implement the LLRC Recommendations. The promotion of a trilingual Sri Lanka is one of the key strategies identified by the Government for social integration.

The tourism industry has sustained its growth momentum with foreign tourist arrivals reaching 1.5 million in 2013 recording foreign exchange earnings of around US Dollars 1.5 billion. The target for 2016 is envisaged to have tourist arrivals around 2.5 million with foreign exchange earnings of US Dollars 2.75 billion.

Then, Sir, with regard to Traditional Industries, Handicrafts and Small Enterprise Development, my Ministry has prepared a comprehensive five-year strategic plan aligned with the "Mahinda Chintana -Vision for the Future" and the Budget Proposals, to upgrade traditional industries, handicrafts and micro, small and medium industries and enterprises. Accordingly, the following programmes and initiatives are being implemented.

The Industrial Development Board, which comes under my Ministry, is modernizing and upgrading the SME Industrial Estates. Under this programme, 18 main and mini-SME industrial estates are being modernized and upgraded. The five main industrial estates such as Ekala in Gampaha, Pallekele in Kandy, Horana in

1471 1472

Kalutara, Pannala in Kurunegala, and Panaluwa in Colombo are being modernized and upgraded to facilitate small and medium industries to reach export market. Further 13 small and medium industrial estates including Wavulagala in Kalutara, Kaludawela in Matale, Beliatta in Hambantota, Karandeniya and Baddegama in Galle, Lunuwila in Puttalam, Poonthoddam in Vavuniya and other industrial estates are being developed and supported with Treasury funds.

Further, the Ministry has planned to develop supra class model SME Industrial Estates in each province. Under this programme, the Atchuveli Industrial Estate in Jaffna is being developed as a model environmental-friendly SMI industrial estate with the support of the Indian Small Grant Development Assistance Programme. This type of similar initiatives will be expanded in all other eight provinces in the medium term.

With regard to the streamlining of the supply of scrap to industrialists, the Cabinet of Ministers has already approved the request of the IDB that all the scrap belonging to Ministries, Departments and other Government institutions are sold to the Industrial Development Board. An Action Plan on the modus operandi of a transparent procedure for the procurement and equitable distribution of the scrap to small-scale industrialists is being drawn up and the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers is awaited. Once this Action Plan is implemented, not only the handicraft manufacturers and SMI sector would get the raw materials at a reasonable price, but also intermediate moneymakers would be sidelined.

Under the Production Village Programme and Enterprise Village Programme, action has been taken to revitalize the industrial and enterprise villages islandwide through technology transfer, training and skills development and provision of common services facilities. Under this programme, Halambawatawana Village in the Puttalam District for pottery-based products; Anthiran Village in the Jaffna District and Niraviya Village in the Anuradhapura District for leather-based products; Kebithigollewa Village for clay-based production;

Moraketiara Village in Hambantota for coir-based products; Ambagolla Village for clay-based products and the Blacksmith Village in Udugoda, Kandy have been supported and strengthened. Further, furniture-production villages in Kurunegala, Gurupokuna, Nikaweratiya and a remarkable clay-based production village in Rukmale have also been supported and strengthened.

The National Kithul Development Programme was fully supported by Treasury funds and has focused its attention in the Sabaragamuwa Province covering the Kegalle and Ratnapura Districts in line with the Budget Proposals 2013. The programme also covered other districts such as Kandy, Badulla, Matara, Kalutara, Nuwara-Eliya, Matale, Monaragala, Kurunegala, Hambantota, Ampara and Galle Districts. The performance of kithul jaggery and treacle exports have been expanded from Rs. 26 million in 2011 to Rs. 58 million in 2012, recording an increase of over 120 per cent.

With regard to the National Craft Council, National Design Centre and the Traditional Handicraft Village Programme, the Ministry with Treasury funds has taken action to strengthen 12 traditional handicraft villages islandwide, covering jewellery and musical instruments in Kandy; sesath and lacquer in Matale; masks in Kalutara; wood-carving in Galle; musical instruments, coir and bobbin lace in Matara; clay in Anuradhapura; and palm leaf handicrafts in Batticaloa and Jaffna, linking handicraft villages with tourism sector.

The Ministry conducted the Shilpa National Craft and SME Exhibition and Trade Fairs to promote market facilitation, and also conducted national, district and provincial level awards to creative craftsmen and small and medium industrialists to encourage, promote and develop their talents and skills. In all nine provinces, provincial exhibitions were conducted in close collaboration with the provincial councils to support and promote the crafts sector.

With regard to the Palmyrah Development Board, an expanded handicraft training programme is underway in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces and in the Puttalam and Hambantota Districts. This is being carried out in collaboration with National Design Centre and a package of assistance in the form of raw materials, tools, bank loans, market facilitation and extension support is provided on completion of the training. So far, 1,973 people have completed the training. Action is also taken to convert the Karainagar Industrial Complex into fibre production, pulp extraction and handicraft training centre.

With regard to sap training, due to the attitudinal change of the younger generation, the number of trees tapped are on the decline. Therefore, the following interventions are being planned out: Introduction of

alternative methods of extracting sap; provision of insurance coverage for tappers; provision of safety kits for tappers; expanding training on tapping; mindset and attitudinal change training.

The Palmyrah Research Institute was reactivated and it started operations in July 2012, and is currently carrying out researches in partnership with universities and research institutions in order to develop the sector. The research activities are focused on quality improvement, value addition, preservation and increasing yield and productivity of Palmyrah-based products.

Action is also being taken to increase value addition, enhance production and marketing. Then, with regard to the Thickam Distillery, action is being taken to revamp this distillery, to upgrade it into a more viable venture with many value-added products.

The Ministry has strengthened the fishnet production capacity of the Gurunagar, Weerawila and Lunuwila Factories of the Northsea Limited by replacing the outdated machineries and providing working capital augmentation. With the Indian grant assistance of Rs. 162 million and the counterpart - Government of Sri Lanka - component for taxes of Rs. 22 million, the Gurunagar Fishnet Factory has already been upgraded and this enhanced facility has resulted in increased fishnet production at this factory. I take this opportunity to thank the Government of India for their generosity.

My Ministry also closely works with the Ministry of Economic Development to support the Divi Neguma Cottage Industry Programme in close collaboration with 4 industrial cluster ministries namely, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Ministry of Technology and Research, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Skills Development and Ministry of State Resources and Enterprise Development and the 16 agencies and institutions that come under these Ministries. The programme includes island-wide district exhibitions, training, technology transfer, provision of raw material and basic tools, facilitation of access to credit through district level banking clinics and marketing facilitation involving private sector. Financial support is extended by the Ministry of Economic Development.

With regard to Divi Neguma - National Cottage Industry Programme, 24 district level exhibitions have been completed. Over 17,000 beneficiaries have been trained, over 4,200 cottage industrialists have been provided with basic tools and raw materials and over 2,700 cottage industrialists linked with banks to access concessionary credits through banking clinics conducted in 14 districts with the support of the Central Bank refinancing credit schemes. 3,100 kithul tappers were provided with tappers training, technology transfer and necessary tools and accessories to enable them to produce quality treacle and jaggery. I thank the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Minister of Economic Development for his continuous support and collaboration on this national effort.

New Interventions in 2014 The 2014 budget provisions are focusing on the following additional new programme interventions: i) Development of pottery villages will be taken forward island-wide and support will be extended to strengthen the pottery villages with new technology, product development, market facilitation, export orientation and linkage with tourism with a view to upgrade this sector.

ii) The Ministry will initiate women enterprise development programmes and support women entrepreneurs island-wide specially by strengthening women centered enterprise villages and train and provide technology transfer to enable women entrepreneurs to engage in micro enterprises and produce wide range of high quality products and services to generate family income and employment.

iii) A large number of women are actively engaged in micro small industries and enterprises including handicrafts. The Government in 2014 Budget Proposal will implement a Women Micro Enterprise Credit Guarantee Scheme through the Regional Development Banks and Commercial Banks to provide working capital loan up to Rs. 250,000 without requiring security. A revolving fund is to be set up to provide credit against confirmed supply orders from reputed buyers to promote small craftsmen engage in the crafts sector. The budgets also proposed the restriction on importation of household and office furniture and removed the restrictions on transportation of furniture within the country to encourage the local furniture industry.

iv) The Ministry will also further accelerate and establish and strengthen traditional handicraft villages, enterprise villages and production villages to support rural economic development in-line with the Mahinda Chintana -Vision for the Future.

v) The National Kithul Development Programme is given very special focus by the Ministry and support will be extended to train and encourage more kithul tappers, provide safety kits for tappers, improve quality of kithul treacle and jaggery production and support market facilitation both locally and internationally to enable increased kithul products. To improve marketing and export, many national level exhibitions and trade fairs will be conducted to support the kithul sector.

vi) With the support of the Treasury and the Department of Development Finance of the Ministry of Finance and Planning a revolving fund will be established to support working capital requirements of the craftsmen who are involved in various crafts sector products.

vii) The Ministry will focus its attention on market-oriented new designs in the craft sector with special focus on gifts and souvenir items targeting tourists.

Traditional Industries, Handicraft Sector and Micro, Small and Medium Industries and Enterprise (MSME) Sectors are big drivers of change for economic growth, entrepreneurship development, innovation, regional development, employment generation and poverty reduction. Strong and vibrant traditional industries, handicrafts and MSME sectors contribute to transform lagging regions into emerging regions of prosperity. In this endeavour the institutions that come under the purview of my Ministry such as the Industrial Development Board, the National Crafts Council, National Design Centre, Palmyrah Development Board and the Northsea Limited make significant efforts and contributions.

My Ministry will strongly contribute to strengthen the MSME Sector through innovative strategies and effective interventions to achieve the Mahinda Chintana -Sri Lanka: the emerging Wonder of Asia

I wish to thank my Deputy Minister, Secretary and the staff of the Ministry, Chairman and staff of the Industrial Development Board, National Crafts Council, National Design Centre, Palmyrah Development Board and the Northsea Limited and all my office and personal staff to take these development initiatives of the Ministry forward.
