( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You have to wait till my eye catches you.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Right.

Now, Sir, I will refer you to Standing Orders No. 25, which states, I quote:

An urgent motion directly concerning the privileges of Parliament shall take precedence of all other motions as well as Orders of the Day. The proceedings of Parliament may be interrupted at any moment, save during the progress of a division....."

Sir, I do not have to continue; I think you know this. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Then, Sir, Standing Order No. 84 (vii) and (viii) states, I quote:

"(vii) No Member shall refer to any other member by name.

(viii) No member shall impute improper motives to any other

member."

Sir, we spent about one hour on this. But, still my name has been mentioned and a proper Order has not been given by you.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The same issue was raised by the Hon. Sajith Premadasa.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Yes. So, I am saying that it is a draft - ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I have taken note of it. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) So, Sir, can you give an Order now? If my name has been mentioned, give a Ruling on that.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I will look into it. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, there is no Ruling given by you. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) If required, a Ruling will be given. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) No, this is not about an inquiry; I am not talking about an inquiry.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I will take note of what you say. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) No, Sir, I am not talking about an inquiry.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, I have taken note of what you say. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, it is not about an inquiry I am talking. Either you do not understand or your brain does not work!

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Now, you have raised your point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) I am saying that my name has been mentioned. That is all I am saying, not about an inquiry. And, there is no Order given by you. - [Interruption.] Sir, there is no Order by you. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . . ...

( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker)

Hon. Azwer, you can raise that in short. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker)

I listened to you, Hon Sajith Premadasa. I have taken note of it. I will do what is required.

... .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker. I also got up 15 times. It is the sixteenth time that you are permitting me to raise the point of Order. So, thank you very much, Sir, for the consideration.

Sir, whatever he said today or had said yesterday, you gave a definite Order. Now, they cannot restart this, going into the whole history. Sir, he cast aspersions -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) No, they are not canvassing. They cannot canvas as an Order has been given. - [Interruption.] . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) , Erskine May Kaul & Shakdher . [ ]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I listened to you. I took your point. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) . ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I cannot allow you to make a speech here. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Sir, let me say just four sentences. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You have already raised a point of Order. Points of Order have to be precise.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) 4 . ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You have precisely raised it and I have taken note of it.

Mr. Presiding Member, at this stage I seek your permission to read out the Statement of the Minister of External Affairs, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris who had to leave the Chamber early for an engagement, which he had undertaken where the Thai Ambassador is to be present in Galle.

"Sir, I wish to join the other Members of the House in paying a tribute to His Excellency the late Hugo Chavez Frias, who was the President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela from 1998 and sadly passed away on 5th March 2013. For a period of 15 years, he served not only as a very popular leader of the Venezuelan people but also was an outspoken voice of the developing world. President Chavez was only 58 years at the time of his death having been elected President of Venezuela at the early age of 43. Although Venezuela is a long way off from Sri Lanka, we mourn his loss because he reached out to this country as a friend and also championed the issues of developing countries as a leader of the Non Aligned Movement.

Early life The life of the late President Chavez was remarkable. He was born to a lower middle class family where, to quote his own words, he experienced humility, poverty, pain and sometimes not having anything to eat. He said in an interview that as a growing child he had experienced at first hand the injustices of this world. His childhood experiences of poverty ingrained in him a fundamental spirit against injustice.

Military career President Chavez joined the Venezuelan military and belonged to what could be best described as a group of nationalistic military officers, who believed passionately in the need for change both within their institution as well as in society at large. He rose steadily in the military ranks and gained recognition as a revolutionary voice calling for change in his country.

Bolivarian Movement President Chavez was an admirer of the South American Revolutionary Simon Bolivar and the Marxist Revolutionary Che Guevara. He named his country the Bolivarian Republic in honour of the late Simon Bolivar. The late President Chavez was an avowed Socialist who believed that the ruling elite in his country in the early 90s had done relatively nothing to eradicate poverty and injustice. He championed the cause of the poor but maintained to quote his own words I am not a Marxist, but I am not anti-Marxist. I am not a Communist, but I am not an anti-Communist. President Chavez has often been described as a Socialist, but his 15 years as President of Venezuela did not see the overturn of capitalism, but rather his policies did much to challenge the more extreme neo-liberal model of development.

While Venezuela has the worlds largest oil reserves and is today globally the 5th largest oil exporter, until the late President Chavez was elected to office, his countrymen remained in relative poverty. As a man who emerged from the working class, he was determined to bring about change in his countrys destiny. He was the founder of the Bolivarian Movement which called for rapid social and political changes. He travelled throughout Latin America seeking support for his Movement and it was during this period that he developed a close friendship with Fidel Castro of Cuba.

Election as President In 1998, he was elected President of Venezuela and he was re-elected 4 times to this highest office. It was only on the eve of his assuming his 4th term in office that he passed away. Throughout his 15 years as the leader of the Bolivarian Republic, he never lost his close contact with the people and had his own unique style of governance. He is a Head of State known to have presented his own Sunday morning radiotalk show called Hello President and a weekly television show called Face to Face with the President. He even published his own newspaper The Presidents Post. Through his direct media outreach and personal style, he answered calls from his citizens, discussed his latest policies, sang songs and joked with his people. The immense popularity of the late President Chavez is the political legacy that he had left his successors.

1237 1238

The late President Chavez was not simply a populist. During his successive 4 terms as President, he radically transformed his country. It was he who made Venezuela a welfare State introducing free healthcare and education. Within a decade of the late President taking over the reins, literacy levels rose sharply, health indicators improved and he was able to significantly reduce poverty and unemployment. The lasting contribution of the late President was that he was able to use the vast wealth of oil resources in his country which had hitherto only benefited a small minority of Venezuelans to develop his country and eradicate poverty. President Chavezs socialism was not limited to political rhetoric. It consisted of a solid economic programme where he championed the cause of the poor and brought home a sea change in their lives. President Chavez established an extremely elaborate network of state-owned cooperatives which provided credit and technical training to low income families encouraging them to become self-reliant. Over the 15 years of his stewardship, extreme poverty fell by 72 per cent, the countrys GDP rose by 55 per cent and government expenditure on health, education and public housing rose significantly.

International role Sir, the late President Hugo Chavez was not only a successful leader of Venezuela, he also reached out to friends overseas. He was famous for what is called his Oil Diplomacy by negotiating bilateral trade and reciprocal aid agreements. He supplied oil to Cuba at preferential rates in exchange for Cuban doctors and teachers who helped raise the living standards in his country. At the OPEC Summits, he called for stringent enforcement of production quotas and higher target oil prices. He also gave leadership to Latin American economic and social integration and worked closely with his Latin American counterparts to achieve massive strides in increasing intra-regional trade. The late President Chavez strongly believed that Latin America needed to assert its power and influence in the world.

The late President was an outspoken voice that challenged even the most powerful nations of the world. He often stated, We are going to play toughness against the toughest countries in the world. At international fora he revelled in speaking out for the rights of developing nations. It is significant that the United States-based "Time" Magazine included him in their list of the worlds 100 most influential people. The British magazine "New Statesman" voted him to the 11th place in a list of Heroes of Our Time. During his 15-year Presidency, he earned his place in history as a President who inspired the greatest zeal and love of his people.

Friend of Sri Lanka His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa has placed strong emphasis on the need for Sri Lanka to strengthen its relations with the South American Region. In pursuance of this policy, we have established diplomatic relations with over 17 countries in this Region within the last few years. Our two Embassies in Brazil and Cuba have been concurrently accredited to a number of countries in this Region. At international fora, we have increased our cooperation with the Latin American Region.

The late President Chavez has met with President Rajapaksa on a few occasions and his expression of strong support and solidarity for the Government and people of Sri Lanka is much appreciated. In 2006 when President Rajapaksa met President Chavez in Libya during the 40th anniversary celebrations of the Libyan Revolution, President Chavez praised President Rajapaksas leadership that enabled Sri Lanka to defeat the ruthless LTTE to quote the words of President Chavez a task that was deemed impossible by the world. He told President Rajapaksa that by vanquishing a most ruthless organization such as the LTTE, President Rajapaksa had succeeded in drawing the attention of the entire international community towards Sri Lanka. At the UN General Assembly in 2008, President Chavez demonstrated his warm personal rapport with President Rajapaksa by walking up to the podium and congratulating the President and spending a few minutes conveying

his solidarity with the Government and people of Sri Lanka. During bilateral meetings on the sidelines of Non-Aligned Summits he met with President Rajapaksa and appreciated Sri Lankas success in eradicating terrorism and demonstrated sensitivity to the challenges faced in addressing post-conflict issues.

Sir, President Chavez was an outspoken critic of some developed countries for their double standards on human rights and encouraged Sri Lanka to pursue home-grown solutions to its problems in the same manner he had done in Venezuela. His support was reflected in Venezuelas consistent expression of solidarity for Sri Lanka at international fora.

Over the last five years, our bilateral trade with Venezuela increased significantly with a trade balance in Sri Lankas favour and growing prospects for further expansion of our bilateral economic relations. Sri Lanka will continue to further strengthen her relations with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which I believe is the finest tribute we could pay to the late President Hugo Chavez Frias. I thank you, Sir."

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. DEW Gunasekara - Minister of Human Resources) Sir, on behalf of the Communist Party of Sri Lanka, I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by the Hon. Members of both sides of the House on the death of President Hugo Chavez Frias of Venezuela.

Hugo Chavez representing 29 million Venezuelan people, within the 14 years that he was in power as the President of Venezuela, blossomed as a charismatic leader of the Latin American Continent and a much respected world leader at the time of his untimely death. As a close friend of Sri Lanka, I consider it most fitting and appropriate that this House should record our appreciation of his role and contribution for the cause of anti-imperialism, socialism, peoples sovereignty and human dignity. He shook the world during the 14 years that he was in power as an anti-imperialist fighter who transformed the lives of the 29 million Venezuelan people through political, economic, social and cultural changes. He propelled a political tidal wave in Latin America that elected a galaxy of Left, Pro-left and Centre-left regimes in the entire continent. The revolutionary Cuba was of course the source of ideology, strength, knowledge, experience and inspiration.

He emerged as President of Venezuela in 1998, on the horizon of the 21st Century and at a time when the world balance of forces had changed decisively in favour of imperialism, neo-liberalism and unipolarity with the collapse of the Soviet Union. The US by this time had embarked on unilateralism as its foreign policy and pre-emption as its defence policy.

Sir, Latin America had been identified as a continent of military coups, political assassinations, colonial plunder, invasions and incursions, unbridled exploitation, poverty and misery for nearly three centuries. It was a backyard of US hegemony. It was a laboratory where neo-liberalism was experimented rigidly and vigorously under the heels of military dictatorships. It was where Economist Milton Friedmans theory of free markets was tried and tested. It was on the strength of this experiment that Margaret Thatcher made her infamous declaration that there was no alternative to neo-liberalism.

Chavez was raised by his grandmother in a house with a mud floor in rural Venezuela and evoked passion among the poor supporters who loved his charm and common touch.

1243 1244

2013 22

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committee will now take the Chair.

, .

, , .

Whereupon THE HON. UDITH LOKUBANDARA left the Chair and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. DEW Gunasekara) With the advent of Chavez to power in Venezuela, he reversed this trend through his radical, economic and social policies and through the Bolivarian Revolution, he propelled and provided to the Latin American people, a viable alternative economic policy. He survived the military putsch engineered by the US, as people walked into the streets in his defence. During his 14 years of rule, Venezuela achieved a dramatic reduction of poverty and inequality. He put the countrys oil wealth at the service for the people.

His vision, oratory, diplomatic skills for initiatives, his intellectual insight, cheerful disposition, charismatic glamour of his leadership, his spirit of internationalism and commitment for the cause of his people - all earned him the love and admiration of the people the world over.

Sir, as a member of Sri Lankan delegation to the UN General Assembly, I had the privilege and fortune to listen to this charismatic socialist leaders emotional outburst at US President George W. Bush, at the UN General Assembly sessions in 2004 during the Iraq war.

Referring to George W. Bush he said, The devil came here yesterday. It smells of Sulphur still today.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, he, under conditions of dictatorship started his political career in the early 1980s by founding a secret organization - the Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement, which was renamed The Movement of the Fifth Republic, which has now blossomed as the United Socialist Party of Venezuela merging with the other Left and radical groups and supported by the other Left groups from outside.

He languished in jail for two years and on his release two years later, he swept to power in the 1998 Elections.

Chavez kept oil revenues within Latin America unlike Saudi Arabia, which buys US Treasury Bills and other assets. Venezuela, at one point, withdrew US Dollars 20 billion form the US Federal Reserve and since 2007 has aided the other Latin American countries with US Dollars

36 billion, the most of which has been repaid. In fact, this, in effect, supplanted the IMF and the World Bank, weakening the US regional hegemony.

In 2011, to his credit the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States came into being. Today it is known as CELAC.

He promoted the International Humanitarian Fund in 2013 in order to provide assistance to social programmes without attacking the customary neo-liberal strings, as in the case of IMF. He gave life to the OPEC causing de-dollarization of international oil sales. He paved the way for a multi-polar world through his policy of national sovereignty and human dignity. He diversified commercial and military relations in order to lessen dependency on the United States, demonstrating his spirit of internationalism. The Latin American unity that Simn Bolvar dreamt of was realized to a greater degree before the demise of Chavez.

Though he played the leading role in the transformation of the lives of his people, his real strength lay in the active involvement of the social movements and in the coalition of the Left and radical forces. Last October, he won a new six-year term and his death within five months of his magnificent victory is undoubtedly devastating for millions of his supporters and voters.

Bearing in mind, the support he gave Sri Lanka through international fora and agencies, let us pay our deep respect and honour to that great patriot and internationalist for all what he stood, fought and gave his life for.

We have no doubt that the incumbent Acting President, Nicols Maduro, will lead the Venezuelans in defence of all what Chavez stood for.

Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you, Hon. Minister. The next speaker is the Hon. Weerakumara Dissanayake.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

I am indeed very happy to follow my very good Friend, the Secretary-General of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, perhaps for the first time in the House. Sir, today, I rise in this House to pay my tribute to one of the greatest leaders born in this world, in Latin America. Hugo Chavez Fras, born on 28th July, 1954, lived on earth for 58 years and breathed his last on 5th March, 2013. I may say that he left his people and the world at a very young age. Fifty eight years for a politician is not that much of an age and he could have lived longer than that. That is how China was ruled by Mao tse Tung and Chou En-lai. Even after they passed the age of 80, they gave revolutionary leadership to the outside world. Hugo Chavez shook the world for 14 years. Mr. Chavez transformed the lives of millions in Venezuela and fostered a new spirit of solidarity across Latin America. He was a wonderful person, a charismatic figure, a bold and a courageous leader.

President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela died of cancer in Caracas which was the Capital. He was not just a visionary committed to improving the lives of the great majority of his people, but a masterly politician who knew how to achieve that end. First elected in 1998 and then surviving a right-wing putsch in 2002 which collapsed in the face of huge public support for him, Mr. Chavez turned his nation of 29 million into a pivot for the political and economic renewal of an entire continent. With a clear commitment to his countrys and to Latin Americas sovereignty, the "Bolivarian Revolution" that Mr. Chavez set in motion sought to reassert the independence of a region that the Libertador Simon Bolivar had set out to unify in the 19th Century. Mr. Chavez started by nationalizing the biggest domestic oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela -PDVSA- and

1253 1254

negotiating vastly improved terms with the foreign oil companies which had been making colossal sums out of the worlds greatest known hydrocarbon reserves while paying a pittance in royalties.

Mr. Chavez put the revenues to good use, raising social spending by over 60 per cent to US Dollars 772 billion in a decade and reducing extreme poverty from 40 to 7.3 per cent. It was a remarkable achievement in that part of the world, particularly in a socialist country. Furthermore, one in three Venezuelans now gets free education up to and including university level. But, we, in Sri Lanka, have done very well in providing university education to all. As for the rest of the region, soon after assuming office, Chavez accepted the services of Cuban doctors in exchange for oil supplies to a country victimized by US sanctions for over 40 years. Other countries too benefited from his acts of solidarity.

Sir, Chavez and Fidel Castro of Cuba reshaped the destiny of the modern world. They were highly regarded. They were sincere in their approach and direction. They feared none. My good Friend, the Hon. J. Sri Ranga recalled the visit of Chavez to United Nations General Assembly. I was able to listen to him and watch the scene since I was in the delegation of the President Mahinda Rajapaksa to the United Nations General Assembly. When his name was announced, he was ushered to the podium. He stood there erect and as if he smelt something, looked this side and that side, shook his head and said, "There had been a devil in this Chamber yesterday, and it smells of sulphur still today.

He was mentioning about George Bushs appearance and the speech he made at the United Nations on the previous day. After he finished his speech, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa went to the special separate room that accommodates the leaders after speaking in the Chamber and congratulated him and the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama, who was the Minister of Foreign Affairs at that time and the rest of the delegation also had the privilege to meet him and wish him good luck. Incidentally, Sir, I have been privileged enough to visit the United Nations five times in my Parliamentary career.

I should now place on record the Condolence Message issued by our President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa on the demise of Hugo Chavez. An article which appeared in the "Daily News" of 8th March, 2013 states, I quote:

President Mahinda Rajapaksa in a condolence message on the

death of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said the late President Chavez was a friend of Sri Lanka and played a significant role in further enhancing bi-lateral relations between the two countries.

In the condolence message addressed to Acting President of the

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro, President Rajapaksa said, I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing away of His Excellency Hugo Chavez Frias, President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela after a prolonged illness. The government and people of Sri Lanka join me in conveying our deepest condolences to you, members of the bereaved family and the government and people of Venezuela. The late President was a true son of Venezuela and as the leader was deeply committed to the welfare and development of his country, and a strong advocate for the developing world.

The late President Chavez was a friend of Sri Lanka and played a

significant role in further enhancing our bilateral relations. I warmly recall my meetings with the late President, and his expressions of friendship and support for my country.

I made reference to that meeting earlier with our President at the United Nations parlour.

It further states, I quote: At this difficult hour, our thoughts and prayers are with you, the family of the late President and the people of Venezuela. The Government and people of Sri Lanka together with me stand in solidarity, as your country mourns the passing away of your great leader. Please accept Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration. Later, Sir, at the Afro-Asian Conference held in UAR, Egypt at Sharm el-Sheikh, we had the privilege to meet Raul Castro. The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena and my self, even Mr. Lalith Weeratunga, the Secretary to the President and others had the privilege of sitting with him for a couple of hours discussing various issues.

Sir, today, we mourn his death much more deeply because as His Excellency the President pointed out, Hugo Chavez was a great power of strength to Sri Lanka. That was evident at the voting held in the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva yesterday where Venezuela voted for Sri Lanka on the Resolution brought against us. Twenty five countries voted for the Resolution and 13 countries voted against it. There were eight abstentions which means, 21 countries voted against the Resolution against the Feudal Raj in the world, against the capitalist world.

The Muslim countries respect our Leader and they have accepted the leadership of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa. They have accepted him as the only leader who was able to crush the cruelest terrorist organization in this world and establish a free society. What is happening today?

When the Resolution was carried, some people were having - .

. He said that he is feeling happy. What a treacherous statement. I think the legal fraternity must understand what type of an anti-national and unpatriotic character this person is.

Then, there are several Tamil newspapers which are moderate, but see what the newspaper of the Hon. Saravanapavan, who is a Member of this House says:

The Seventh Schedule according to Article 157A and Article 161 (d) (iii) -

" I, Rajavarothiam Sampanthan do solemnly declare and affirm that I will uphold and defend the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and that I will not, directly or indirectly, in or outside Sri Lanka, " - It is very clear, in or outside Sri Lanka. - support, espouse, promote, finance, encourage or advocate the establishment of a separate State within the territory of Sri Lanka.

This is exactly what the TNA Leaders are doing. You must get some political lessons from your colleague, Mr. V. Anandasangaree. He has a very good say about Sri Lankan politics. He sees those things with far-sightedness and wisdom. Now, he is also being rejected and pushed into a corner by the late entrants like the Hon. Sumanthiran and others.

Sir, I am, as a Member pointed out, a media man. If I am not here I will take my pen in hand and write as a media man, a journalist and live. But, they should not write like this. Is this the wisdom you are giving to your children?

The children in Jaffna are playing cricket. They are getting all the benefits. Jaffna is developing fast. People from India came to Kachchatheevu, people from here and your leader, the Hon. Douglas Devananda also went to Kachchatheevu. How happily they had that Christian Church festival there and came back here. They talk there. These people go to Madras and other places and talk about in Tamil Nadu. What about our own

in Jaffna?

I asked her to take this case to Lok Sabha. She expressed her concern and was surprised. "Is that so? I did not know. She said. I think now with the intervention of the Government, the Hon. Douglas Devananda and others, houses are being allocated. In Jaffna, they want their areas to be demarcated. That is not happening. They do not know where the original areas are. So, it must be demarcated and given. As pointed out by a Member, we went to Vanni and Mannar, a lot of villagers want to go back. They do not want to have the seal "refugee" on their foreheads. They want to go and settle in their own villages. But, the infrastructure must be given to them.

There is another thing: Friend, strategist and a great leader, Hugo Charvez always wanted justice to be meted out to people.

Today, mention was made by Mr. Hudson Samarasinghe, Chairman of the SLBC. The problem is, I never spoke against the MTV. When I raised this question, Sir, I must correct it because they repeated it today. How did this go unedited? I am not blaming the media. How did it go unedited? The Deputy Speaker has ordered a probe into this. So, the facts and truth will come out.

Then, Sir, he was also misleading the House. He says the name was not mentioned by the Hon. Sujeewa

It is a great coincident when Hugo Chavez took the podium and spoke the same day, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa addressed the United Nations Assembly.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)

Order, please! Hon. Azwer, please wind up now.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Give me another five minutes, please. Sir, look at the Sea Street Tamils. The traders and the others led a demonstration against what is happening in Tamil Nadu. Bhikkhus were assaulted. This never happened in the land of the Lord Buddha. Lord Buddha was born there and Buddhism was spread here through Arahat Mahinda Thero.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees)

Order, please! Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana is waiting to make his speech. So, Hon. Azwer, please wind up now.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

Okay. Then, at last I bow down my head to the intelligent Tamil community in Colombo and elsewhere who have at their hearts, love for the country, their motherland. They are part and parcel of the Sri Lankan nation and they have the guts to get onto the roads and shout slogans against the Western powers and against the Resolution passed in Geneva. I salute them!

Tamil leaders such as scholars, Acharyas from the temples are coming here, as I told you, from India and other places. They are having Kampan celebrations at Ramakrishana Mission Hall. Then, the "Colombo Tamil Sangam" is releasing books printed in India and people are doing business freely, not only in the Sea Street, but anywhere here. They are going to Kataragama freely. Nothing is happening to them. When these scholars are coming, did anyone throw stones at them? I am asking you. That is the culture that we have built up in this country.

Therefore, Sir, I pay my tribute to them and say, do not be misled. You also go to India and explain the correct position in Sri Lanka, how the Tamils and Muslims are protected here and how their culture and religious concepts are being developed and protected in this country.

Lastly, Sir, I must pay tribute to and offer my thanks to Her Excellency Indira Lopez, the Cuban Ambassador in Sri Lanka, an effervescent lady who did a very good job by opening up a Condolence Book on President Chavez's death. All the leaders and political party representatives went to her Embassy and signed the book. Concluding, I salute President Hugo Chavez. May he rest in peace!

Thank you.

[6.21 p.m.]

() ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana - Minister of Scientific Affairs) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would like to pay my tribute to a great socialist leader, Hugo Chavez. Sir, Hugo Chavez is no more. But, in the short space of 14 years from 1998, as the President of Venezuela, he had given a message of hope to the poor of Venezuela, Latin America and the whole world. He had helped revive confidence in a future for humankind through socialism. He had joined Castro, Mao Tse-tung and Ho Chi Minh as revolutionary Third World leaders, who have held the world stage and contributed to the creation of history. In a world hit by the deepening capitalist crisis, he fought valiantly to revive the fortunes of the less fortunate before succumbing to the effects of the economic downturn and his own illness, one which certainly had foreign roots and possibly the other as well.

His political arena was the whole of Latin America, which the ruling capitalist class of the United States Empire, the most powerful empire the world has known, had made its own backyard. The USA established governments to its liking - the more dictatorial, the better - to fit in with its exploitative agenda and kicked out those who did not obey its dictates while preaching democratic rights to the world. The first democratically-elected socialist President was Salvador Allende of Chile. The USA was behind the military coup led by General Pinochet in 1973 that murdered Allende and established a brutal military dictatorship. Though the USA tried to do the same with Chavez in 2002, the coup was defeated in a few months due to the resistance of the people. The progressive political tide that is sweeping Latin America

1261 1262

will continue in Venezuela after Chavezs premature death, led by the Socialist Party with his successor, Nicolas Maduro, as the Head.

The political landscape has been changed by Chavez. During the 14 years that Chavez ruled Venezuela, he had not only altered the political landscape of that country, but also of the whole of Latin America. Only time will reveal whether the popular tide will sweep out to a greater success for the people or whether the ever-scheming ruling class of the USA and its allies, the local elite and the comprador capitalist class of each country will succeed in turning the tide.

But, the socialist leaders of Latin America such as Evo Morales of Bolivia, Rafael Correa of Ecuador, Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, Lula da Silva of Brazil and Mrs. Cristina Kirchner of Argentina, inspired by Chavez and Castro, have galvanized and mobilized the people, winning their hearts and minds. The movement for social justice leading to social change with the upliftment of the people while curbing the political and economical power of the ruling elite has begun. Our hope is that it will continue. But, the process will have its ups and downs, advances and retreats and successes and failures in the face of the sustained pressure of the forces of US imperialism and the multinational corporations or more correctly, the transnational corporations. Already, the socialist leader of Argentina, Mrs. Kirchner, has permitted the US-based agricultural multinational, Monsanto, to expand its harmful activities in that country.

The danger of direct moves to achieve regime change, as was done by the USA in Iraq or under the United Nations cloak in Libya, is on the cards for Venezela. But, with the weakening of the USA as a world power, both economically and politically, and the growing strength of China, Russia, Brazil, India and South Africa - the BRICS countries - the ability to use the UN system is also less. Further, the political culture of Latin America has undergone a change. Dictatorships, whether military or civil, are no longer acceptable and the respect for democratic processes is growing and becoming established. Thus, the process that the socialist leaders have set in motion in Latin America may continue to progress well into the future.

Some achievements in Venezuela need to be stressed. Chavez had achieved much in this short period. Within Venezuela, he had carried out many reforms of a socialist nature: he established a wide network of co-operatives and empowered the people through Workers' Councils and Communal Councils. There was extensive land reform. He nationalized key industries including the remainder of the oil sector, the main strength of the Venezuelan economy.

He has increased Government funding for health, education and promoted the campaign to eliminate illiteracy. He has greatly reduced poverty in that country and addressed the problems of housing, healthcare and lack of food. He has used more taxation of the rich to achieve redistribution of wealth. He has worked to establish a welfare state in which the imperialist hold on the economy was broken.

He introduced a new Constitution in which he has supported the marginalized, the indigenous people and the women. He has paid particular attention to environmental protection. A unique feature is the power given to the people to recall the President by a referendum so that the people could throw him out of power at any time. Where in the world have we heard of any leader taking a step like that where he told the people in other words, "If you are not satisfied with me at any time, I give you the power to throw me out".

He has been a flag bearer along with Cuba for socialist internationalism. He did much to support economically the countries with socialist parties in power in Latin America. Particular mention must be made of Cuba which he helped by supplying oil at greatly reduced prices in exchange for the services of doctors, engineers and teachers that Cuba has in great numbers. Chavez was a firm supporter of Simon Bolivar and his Bolivarian concept of a united Latin America was that could be free of US domination and could develop into a powerful regional bloc. Accordingly, he established the Union of South American Nations. He developed a regional TV network, TeleSur. He took the lead in establishing the Bank of the South as a counter to the World Bank to support the economic development of all countries of the South in their own interest, free of imposed conditions. I must mention here that in his concept of the Bank of the South he already put money into that and the bank has got going and while it is mainly helping the poor countries of Latin America, he envisaged that it would replace the World Bank as a bank of the Third World and I hope that the future will see the fulfilment of the dreams of Hugo Chavez.

He was a fearless critic of neo-liberalism and the misdeeds of the United States of America-led imperialist powers, for example, over Iraq, Baharain, Libya, Syria, Palestine and so on. He made full use of the United Nations General Assembly for the purpose of exposing the misdeeds of these imperialist powers. He established a regional anti-imperialist alliance. He was an ally of all countries of the Third World in their struggles against the West. He supported Sri Lanka in the UN Human Rights Council and we must say that even after his demise, we are happy that just yesterday Venezuela was among the 13 countries that supported Sri Lanka by voting against the US Resolution.

Chavez was above all a humanist. When global oil prices soared and the poor people of the United States were unable to keep warm and their travel was affected, he supplied them with oil at low prices through retail outlets in the United States itself. This is the type of socialist humanism that Chavez demonstrated as an example to the world which is being dominated by these murderous imperialist policies. He was indeed a practical socialist. He had an understanding of socialist theory was evident by his statement that he supported Troskys Theory of Permanent Revolution, and that he considered himself a Trostskyite.

We, of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, pay our humble tribute to this brave practical socialist and humanist. We dip our socialist banner in his memory as a great socialist

leader. His achievements and his memory will never die. We express our deepest sympathies to his family and the people of Venezuela. I thank you, Sir.
