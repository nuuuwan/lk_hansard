[3.31 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) I am honoured, Madam Chair, to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of Child Development and Womens Affairs, which deals with perhaps the most important subject we need to consider. I say this because, while the development programme which the Government has put in place with regard to infrastructure is vital, it will serve no purpose unless we also concentrate on human development. In this regard, we need to ensure that our children are in full enjoyment of all their rights, and that we also empower them so that any violations are minimized.

It is equally important to ensure that women are not only protected but also empowered. For this purpose, we must put in place coherent mechanisms that can identify shortcomings and address them promptly and systematically. We must move from simply reacting to problems but rather anticipate potential problems and avoid them, a strategy, I should add, that would hold us in good stead with regard to international relations as well as domestic politics.

With regard to women and children, I am happy to say that we have an active Ministry that is able to conceptualize and initiate new measures. Chief amongst them is the establishment of a Women and Childrens Unit in every Divisional Secretary's Division. If I might say so, this Ministry has been the first to recognize the importance of the Division, which is the first active interface between the Government and people. Indeed, this Ministry has also recognized the importance of the Grama Niladhari Division, which is the first actual interface, though it is for the raising of issues rather than solving them. But, it would make sense to set in place, even in GN Divisions, consultative mechanisms to resolve simple problems. The Division is the first level at which more important decisions can be taken, and where the frontline officers of various Government institutions can meet to discuss problems and plan responses, and where they can discuss trends that will help them to anticipate problems and avoid them.

In this context, Madam Chair, I would like to table* an organogram prepared by Mr. Asoka Gunawardena, formerly of the Finance Commission, which makes clear the need for systemic reform if we are to fulfil the commitments in the Mahinda Chintana about consultation of the people.

The organogram notes in direct lines the responsibilities of Government officers, but there are only broken lines to note mechanisms of accountability to the people. These need to be systematized, so that there is regular consultations and feedback, which is what this Ministry plans to do through the units that it has set up.

All this is more important because as His Excellency the President noted in his Budget Speech, the problem of abuse needs to be addressed swiftly and effectively. This is twinned with the need to establish better systems with regard to our migrant population, which is why it makes sense to bring the Ministry of Child Development and Womens Affairs together with the Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, in this Discussion. The latter Ministry has made immeasurable progress under a dynamic and dedicated Minister and Secretary and is, in fact, the only Ministry, I believe, to have received ISO Certification. But, there is still much to be done.

With your permission, I will table* the recent study by "Save the Children" entitled Sri Lankas Missing Mothers and in particular, the "Preface" of it that sums up the difficulties and possible solutions, which shows the extent of the needs that must be addressed.

It notes too that their roots lie in social problems which require concerted action.

This Debate takes place during the 16-day action programme against Gender-based Violence, a policy dialogue, which I was privileged to attend this month. After an inspiring address by the Secretary to the Ministry, there were presentations that made clear the problems so many of our women face. Amongst these is alcoholism which was again one of the principal problems brought to my attention during Reconciliation Meetings in four divisions in the North last week. I should note in this context that the Report on "Sri Lanka's Missing Mothers", whilst highlighting economic reasons, also notes that sometimes migration is an escape route for women from abuse at home. Concerted measures are needed to deal with this, and amongst these, better counselling is the need which His Excellency the President highlighted. In this context, this Ministry together with the Ministry of Social Services yesterday inaugurated a Diploma Course in Counselling. Such initiatives are most laudable.

We also need to set in place better awareness programmes, and for this we must provide Womens and Childrens Desks of the Police with better equipment. At Kandaveli, the police noted that they could only talk and

could not show the materials that they had been provided with to enhance the impact of programmes. We also need to involve the community in these efforts and I would strongly recommend the Guru-Deguru initiative of the Gandhi Centre, which involves parents too in what I would term "meaningful education for life".

Education, Madam Chair, is far too important to be left to our current educationists, who seem to think the killing of initiative is the purpose of the school system. Despite the admirable intentions of the Ministry, little is done to develop personality and social awareness. Extracurricular activities barely exist outside prestigious schools, and the reliance on tuition, which has increased geometrically in the last few years, is both economically and socially destructive. But, what can we expect when evaluation is based on rote learning? Recently I saw a Grade 4 Test Paper, set by a Zonal Office in the self-satisfied rent-seeking that dominates education. Children are asked in which District Sigiriya is and how many districts there are in the Northern Province. For English, examples of jobs, colours and flowers are cobbler, purple and orchid. They have to unscramble words, which is an exercise more suited to elderly English speakers in retirement. Perversely, the text books have no stories which would help children learn, and to understand what they are learning.

The Ministry had also noted that children have a right to leisure and, I hope, it will set up systems to ensure this right too by careful monitoring of the school system. Recently, I found that the police in the East had prescribed involvement of education and health personnel in their Civil Defence Committees, and I only hope that the Women and Childrens Units, working together with the police will ensure holistic consultation to promote a more user-friendly education system, with attention also to physical welfare of children. It is the community that must monitor whether schools have access to drinking water, adequate toilets, adequate transport facilities, leisure space and activities, in addition to enough teachers, buildings and furniture.

On a far more basic question, we also need to combat immediately a recent phenomenon, namely, increasing malnutrition, for instance, in Moneragala. This is not because of poverty, though that too contributes, but because of a lack of awareness of nutritional needs. It is shocking that, as was reported recently by a Health Ministry Official, the audiovisual material that they had produced on the subject was not telecast by Rupavahini. If we have a State Television Channel, it must fulfil a social purpose and not simply compete commercially with other channels. Indeed, even that it does absurdly, because it refused to show a programme on childrens clubs, even when paid, because it thought this would be competition for its own clubs, an example of the statist monopolistic mentality that we must get rid of in all spheres, not simply in commerce.

Community awareness is vital because it is the community, together with other frontline officials, who must agitate for services which are lacking now and markedly so in many rural schools. In Vavuniya, recently I was told that while many schools had received computers, hardly any had electricity. The poor school principals who are deprived are not in a position to expedite an electricity supply to remote villages. Perhaps, even parents and Child Rights Protection Officers will not be able to achieve this, since we know that much has been done with regard to the provision of power in recent years, and any shortfalls are because of constraints that cannot be overcome at once.

But, even while we accept this, there must be alternatives, perhaps having Computer Centres in at least a couple of areas in each Division where there is electricity, so that school children can use them at least on weekends. There should be partnerships with the National Youth Services Council to set up Computer Centres on the lines of the initiative of "Diaspora Lanka" in Mannar so that some school leavers can be trained to run a business while providing training to school children who are otherwise deprived.

All this requires coordination, which this Ministry must provide, given its comprehensive mandate. It must also take the lead in improving the situation of children who, in one way or another, come before the courts or who are in care. Recently, the National Child Protection Authority drafted excellent guidelines for Childrens Homes, which require better resources and better monitoring. The Ministry has also had discussions recently with the Judicial Service Commission, which is far more responsive under its new Secretary, to social requirements. Earlier, when I convened the Task Force on expediting implementation of the Human Rights Action Plan, I gave up that responsibility because I found I was getting nowhere despite goodwill in many institutions because of the incapacity to coordinate that seems endemic in our administration. I found that requests to the Judicial Service Commission for rules of procedure were ignored. Now, there is some willingness, which I hope translates into action, to introduce greater consistency and human sympathy into the Judiciary. I hope, therefore, that we will move swiftly from the days when a child can be charged for having stolen a pigeon, a horrifying example that happened a couple of years back of the Victorian mentality which we still suffer from in this country.

In this context, let me take this opportunity to congratulate those responsible for the Commonwealth Youth Declaration, which is a model of modernity and tolerance that should be an object lesson to those in the older generation who are stuck in prejudice and insularity. Since I am able to take part in only one Discussion in the Committee Stage of the Budget, I will express here my appreciation of the Draft National Youth Policy, and hope

that it will soon be adopted, and also that the Ministry will do more, especially in the North and the East and other deprived provinces of this country, to fast forward the skills training that our youngsters need. They should also work on developing entrepreneurship, as suggested in the Commonwealth Youth Declaration.

Let me conclude by drawing attention to an excellent initiative which has the blessings of this Ministry, namely, the Child-centered Budget Analysis, which draws attention to the need for greater attention to the specific needs of children. Since different agencies work with children, it is not clear as to how much is being done, and also where supplementation is needed. I hope therefore that this Ministry will take a lead in better coordination, so that we provide a better future for our children. There are many agencies working with women and children, who are willing to help, but they need to be heard and also guided so that their assistance is systematic and productive. I believe this Ministry, with its various agencies, can fulfil the task, and it should be strengthened for this purpose.
