[12.22 p.m.] () ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana - Minister of Scientific Affairs) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I have been directed by my Party to contribute towards the Budget Debate, for which I was expecting at least 20 minutes. But, as I have been given only 15 minutes, first give me permission to table* my speech, so that it would go into the Hansard.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Okay. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) Thank you, Sir.

. , . . . , . .

I would like to say that in Sri Lanka, we are following a path of economic development which is being successfully carried out in East Asia, not only by capitalist countries like South Korea but also by Vietnam, China and communist countries as well. So, here we are trying, instead of allowing our market forces a free play, to regulate our economy making use of capitalist forces within the country. That is the path that we are following. And, we are extremely glad as a Party, first to acknowledge the fact that His Excellency the President has categorically stated that there will be no privatizations, either of any Government enterprise or bank.

We are also very happy that the sale of land to foreigners has been stopped and there will only be leasing and for that too, there will be an upfront 15 per cent tax. The move in the Budget to improve the performance of the Government sector corporations and other organizations is welcome, but we would say that besides

spending money, it is important that the COPE Report and other reports be taken into consideration and whatever maladministration is there, that it be corrected.

We also welcome the fact that privately-run plantations are going to be brought under increasing surveillance, so that their performance will be improved. Again, as my Comrade DEW has mentioned earlier, the world is faced with a capitalist economic crisis, which has worst affected America and Europe. Sixty per cent of our exports go to those countries and these have suffered as a result. I am very glad that the Budget Speech quite categorically states that there is going to be a shift of our economic development towards meeting the demands of the emerging markets, especially of the BRICS countries.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the danger to Sri Lanka from the growth of this economic crisis, which is global and the growth of the black economy worldwide is something that we have to take seriously into consideration, because the way out for America and Europe is the way that was taken in 1939, when they resorted to war after following Keynes advice and the Government sector stepping in to prop up the private sector. But, we should realize that the American Empire is now intent on fomenting conflicts and wars in countries, localized ones, so that they can sell their armaments, and it is in this context that they are also having regime changes to get regimes that are favourable to them.

So, while accepting the positive outcome of CHOGM as stated in the Budget Speech, I would like to stress that the behaviour of the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, indicates that there is a US-led plot targeted against Sri Lanka, the ultimate aim of which is regime change and that this could lead to sanctions and grave economic consequences. It is the solution of the national question through a properly-conducted Select Committee process in Parliament and the effective implementation of the LLRC proposals that could defeat these efforts, while we continue to develop the North together with the elected Provincial Council there. So, we stress the importance of this course of action.

Besides the economic crisis confronting the world, there is the global climate crisis and there are extreme weather events and we have to provide extra budgetary funds to meet those situations including sea level rise.

The impact of the global energy and food crises is still there and that is also growing. Therefore, we are happy that the Budget has given the necessary support to implement the correct Government policies, which aim to achieve maximum self-sufficiency in these two areas. This also includes a shift to renewable energy and organic farming. I am surprised that there is someone who says that substituting importation of food, which is an essential thing, by growing our own food, is something that has to be discarded on some antiquated economic theories.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana, you may continue your speech after lunch.

The Sitting is suspended till 1.00 p.m.

, .. 1.00 .

, .. 1.00 . Sitting accordingly suspended till 1.00 p.m. and then resumed. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana, you may continue with your speech. You have only seven minutes.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, now, the path of capitalist economic development that the Government is undertaking needs to be properly controlled to avoid all the problems that arise which include corruption, maladministration and waste. For this, good governance has to be introduced and strong action has to be taken in this regard. I mentioned earlier the importance of overcoming the divisive tendencies of capitalism to build the national unity.

Thirdly, there is a danger of increasing inequity, debt and social tensions. The tax policy is a major factor and 80 per cent of taxes are collected indirectly through VAT and only 20 per cent are collected directly as income tax. The maximum slab is only 24 per cent for individuals, and 28 per cent for companies. Now, our opinion is, this should be increased to at least 45 per cent if we are going to get the necessary income and the burden that is being put on the poor people must be removed by removing on essentials, all taxes such as VAT . The adverse foreign trade balance and the foreign debt that is escalating, which arise from the fact that we are allowing the rich to import luxury goods, must be reduced by having higher taxes on luxury goods. There has to be genuine and effective national economic development based on maximum value addition to our raw materials. This should be the main thrust of our economic development effort. I developed the National Strategy on Science, Technology and Innovation, which was accepted by the Cabinet. Also, I have set up the COSTI mechanism for coordinating this process of development. I am glad that this time the Budget has appreciated what was done through the Nanoscience Park in Homagama and the development of nanotechnology in our country. We have to develop other technologies such as biotechnology, electronics and so on, in addition to ICT which is the area that the Budget gives the most support. I think the Budget should give more support for the other areas as well.

We welcome the concessions being given to the other sectors of the economy which are all essential for development such as agriculture, fisheries, plantation, dairy, livestock and poultry industries et cetera. We also welcome the importance given to Divi Neguma and womens enterprises but linking them with the Vidatha Movement would strengthen them and I hope more money will be spent on promoting the Vidatha Movement. The farmer pension and crop insurance schemes are appreciated.

The LSSP calls upon the Government to: increase the direct income tax, as I mentioned, the upper bracket to be 45 per cent for both individuals and companies; give generous tax concessions for actual investments; create a transparent investor-friendly economic, administrative and political climate; take strong action to eliminate corruption in the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise Departments; remove all indirect taxes on essentials so as to relieve the tax burden on the poor; increase the duties on all luxuries, as I mentioned. Also, take suitable action to reduce the cost of living. For example, cut the electricity bill by minimizing oil-powered generation; increase supply of medicines in Government hospitals and reduce price in the open market by applying the Senaka Bibile drug policy appropriately; supply essentials through genuine consumer cooperatives; revive the Paddy Marketing Board and the Marketing Department or expand State-run Fair Price shops to effectively compete with the middlemen for rice, vegetables and fruits. This could be combined with the ration card system for the genuine poor.

Next, prepare a national wage policy, in consultation with the trade unions, and implement it speedily within six months, if possible; double the budgetary allocations for health and education; cut down on military expenditure and increase Public sector and pensioner salaries and allowances; increase the management efficiency of State-run plantations and ensure that EPF and ETF dues are paid in time.

While stating this, we support the development of alternate energy through the Budget and also the move towards having natural agriculture and promoting organic fertilizer, which the Budget has done. But, it is important that these policies which are good should be properly implemented and the Government should take firm action to make sure that they are implemented.

We are also happy that there is money being spent on developing business service outsourcing to complement the development of ICT and along with that, there should be a promotion of the use of computers in the rural sector. The whole education mechanism should be strengthened in the area of technology. That trend is already there and I hope that this will be implemented properly when the Budget is being implemented.

So, those are the main points that I would like to make in the short time that was available to me.

Thank you, very much.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I must say that the National Budget is not merely a statement of revenue and expenditure of the Government but it is an important document setting out salient features of the future strategy of the Government. Therefore, all nine budgets presented by President Mahinda Rajapaksa are inter-connected in terms of vision, policy and strategy.

His Excellency the President certainly deserves praise for presenting nine consecutive budgets of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance Government. The central theme of all budgets has been to bring about national security, peace and economic progress for the nation.

Quite unlike my Friend, the Hon. Suresh Premachandran, who went on a vitriolic vituperative condemnation of the recently-held Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Colombo, I must say that the President and the Government deserve plaudits for successfully hosting the 23rd Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Colombo. The Heads of State and other leaders from 53 countries were able to see for themselves the peace and development we have been able to achieve during the last four years.

In the meantime, I must certainly say that the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress had been a partner of this Government for the last two and a half years and, as a constituent party, enjoyed the freedom at times to contest on our own and on rare occasions, conduct a joint campaign with the ruling party. The North and the East now have two elected Councils. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress has a certain leverage in the East while we have a nominal presence in the Northern Provincial Council.

It is our fervent hope that the Tamil National Alliance and the Government will find a win-win formula to work together, moving away from election time rhetoric, which I feel is still continuing. Some media reports tend to suggest that there is some acrimony developing when it came to working arrangements with Government Ministers in the North. My sincere appeal to the Tamil National Alliance and, in the same token, to the Government is that we should look for some healthy compromises. As a matter of fact, this has been echoed even by two previous speakers, the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne and the LSSP Leader, the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana, Ministers of the Government. We feel that there must be some way out to work out a win-win formula so that the enormous confidence that people have reposed in parties, both in the North and the South, and other parts of the country could be made effective in bringing some development to their areas. In order to do that, we need to find compromises and I would like to urge, as a constituent partner of this Government, that there must be a win-win formula that must be worked out and we should prevent other unnecessary interferences, which will affect the sovereignty of our country. That has been our continued position.

I must say that in developing this Budget, a novel feature was introduced by the President and practised to the full. That is, the consultation and deliberation process. In that process, during the time of preparation of the Budget, there had been a series of consultations and deliberations with stakeholders representing numerous sectors. This process, therefore, enabled the President and the Ministry of Finance to factor in the interests and expectations of all the sections of the population.

As the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr. P.B. Jayasundera, commented at a post-Budget seminar the other day, the message of the stakeholders to the

703 704

2013 25

Government had been very unequivocal: Do not interfere with us. That had been the message. That was said by Dr. Jayasundera himself. Nevertheless, the Budget Proposals of the President addressed a gamut of issues dealing with the economy, social welfare, infrastructure, public and private sector employees and many other important features. In spite of the economic slowdown experienced in developed countries and other factors affecting the global economy, Sri Lanka has been able to achieve economic progress at a very satisfactory rate. A growth rate of 6.4 per cent achieved last year in these circumstances, is certainly commendable.

I must say, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, that there is a clear shift in our fiscal legacy when it comes to the Presidents Term of Office. His Excellency the President drew special attention in his Budget Speech, to the break with the past practices of deficit financing when it comes to presenting the Budget in Parliament. It has been the practice in the past, while keeping the deficit in excess of 8 per cent and the debt over 100 per cent of the GDP, they have been tending to drastically curtail recruitment to the Public Sector, which was virtually frozen. I had been part of the United National Party Government then. When there was a Ceasefire Agreement and there was no war in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, there again there was this so-called fiscal prudence, which really resulted in recruitment to the Public Sector being frozen; public enterprises were to be privatized or privatized without looking at viable alternatives to privatization. While doing all that, there were no significant public investments either. This had been the feature of the previous Governments when presenting a Budget.

True enough, the end of the war has provided the regime the confidence to embark on an ambitious development drive. But, do not forget that we resisted unfair conditionalities sought to be imposed on the Government, impinging even on our sovereignty and thus some of the vital projects had to depend on commercial borrowings. But, those of you in the Opposition must admit that these projects are certainly not white elephants; perhaps what is needed, in some cases, is some aggressive marketing and further integration with impending projects, so that the viability of the completed projects are improved and brings in better yields. So, rather than criticizing it in a very vituperative way, it is for us to look at the vast improvements that have been brought about by very structured and well-planned deficit financing that has been the feature of this regimes history in the presentation of Budgets.

It was also dealt with by the earlier speakers. The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne dealt with the achievements of the Government when it came to Millennium Development Goals. There have been significant improvements in many fields. A recent report shows that Sri Lanka has achieved 13 targets even before reaching

the year 2015, which would be the year on which certain measurements are to be taken. The targets Sri Lanka has already achieved are: halving poverty, all three targets in education, all three targets in respect of gender equality in education, targets on skilled birth attendance, antenatal care, reducing TB prevalence, reducing ODP substance and providing safe drinking water and basic sanitation. There have been such developments. In the meantime, we must also understand that several other targets, particularly, under-five mortality, infant mortality and maternal mortality show slow achievements and is expected to meet the targets only after 2015.

Sri Lanka is regressing in achievements of targets such as underweight children, forest cover and CO2 emission. Even in respect of targets relating to partly off-tracked and completely off-tracked areas with no progress, are comparably at high levels as our targets began with a relatively high degree of achievement in the region. In other words, for example we have to start achieving infant mortality targets from an already low level of 11.3 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. Sri Lanka will have to make additional efforts to achieve the MDG target of 5.9 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2015. But, with the heavy investment in the Public Health Sector this Budget proposed to make - according to our health planners, Sri Lanka is spending Rs. 100 billion annually on the health sector, representing the third largest expenditure of the National Budget. There are over 60,000 beds available in the Island and one doctor serves approximately 1,500 patients and every citizen can access Government medical facility within a range of three kilometres.

When it comes to non-communicable diseases, particularly, strokes and kidney diseases, the Government has taken a very salutary step of improving certain important hospitals all over the Island. I would like to appeal to the Government to look into hospitals in the East, particularly that either the Batticaloa or Kalmunai Hospital be developed to set up a stroke centre or a kidney transplant section, so that the increasing number of patients could benefit from such facilities.

I must also say when it comes to natural disasters and flood prevention, there has been good achievement of the Government, particularly, land reclamation in the Colombo area, where the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation in their medium-term budget framework has made the Greater Colombo Area to be free from floods and environmental hazards. I would like to request that a similar flood protection initiative be taken in many parts of the East, which go under water with monsoonal rains almost every year. Fortunately, this year, the East has been spared of floods, but places like the Ampara District, which is in a low-lying basin, after the Gal-Oya Scheme was implemented, gets flooded very often and it would be advisable - I have taken it up with the Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera, the Minister in

705 706

charge of Disaster Management - to look at a proper flood protection mechanism for certain low-lying line areas of the Eastern Province, so that a similar programme that has been implemented by the Land Reclamation Development Corporation in the Greater Colombo Area, under the guidance of the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence being in charge of the Urban Development Authority, be implemented in such areas as well.

While requesting that these matters be attended to, in conclusion, may I come to an important aspect. I thought the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa was here. I want to talk about this aspect because we are talking about resolving the national ethnic problem. There has been a Select Committee appointed and I must place on record that we would like to earnestly request the Government to re-examine the composition of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Constitutional Reform. It is a matter of regret that some constituent parties have been deliberately left out, violating Parliamentary conventions and practices. While it is bad enough that the main opposition parties are boycotting the Select Committee, not to permit representation for your own partners in Government will certainly erode its credibility. I trust that the Government will try and resolve this issue without much prevarication, so that at least some of our Parties, which have got the mandate from the people to serve them in this Parliament will be accommodated in this all-important Select committee, which apparently is going full steam without the participation of main Parties in Parliament. I would also like to invite the TNA to consider coming back to the Select Committee so that we can try and make it a meaningful exercise.

Thank you very much. [..1.51] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Gamini Wijith Wijayamuni De Zoysa - Minister of Wildlife Resources Conservation) , , . , , . . , . .

I really appreciate the Minister, Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, who is here. He has done a marvellous job within these four years in the North and the East. We have to appreciate that. Two or three projects are now going on in Batticaloa. I must make special mention of the construction of one bridge, the Kambi-aru Bridge. Many people had requested from many Governments to construct the Kambi-aru Bridge. But, they never did it. Two thousand families live beside that river. They had to travel 40 kilometres round to get to their village. Now, after the completion of this bridge, they have to travel only 5 kilometres to reach their village. We have to really appreciate that. That is a special project that has been completed.

In this Budget also, the Minister, Hon. Basil Rajapaksa has included a 1,000-bridge project. These bridges will connect the villages. That is the important thing. No government did anything like this. They built small bridges, but those did not connect the villages. Therefore, if we build those proposed bridges, we can connect all the villages together. So, that is a marvellous project. His Excellency the President has included that project in the Budget, which we really appreciate.

Sir, not only that; Thoppigala is a vast area for the farmers. They produce all the vegetables and paddy there. On my request, the Hon. Minister has built a big market complex. It has already been built at the Kiran Junction. That too is a marvellous thing. Now, a number of our farmers benefit out of it. I think in January next year - the Hon. Minister will also come - we are going to open that market. In the same way, a lot of development is taking place in the North and the East.
