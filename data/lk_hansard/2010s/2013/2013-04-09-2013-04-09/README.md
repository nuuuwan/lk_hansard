QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

I

A/HRC/22/L.1 A/HRC/22/L.1 GOVERNMENT STANCE ON RESOLUTION NO. A/HRC/22/L.1 ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Speaker, soon after the Resolution No. A/HRC/22/L.1 on "Promoting Reconciliation and Accountability in Sri Lanka" was adopted, the Minister, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe is reported to have said that the Government of Sri Lanka does not concur with the Resolution or its contents and the reconciliation programme initiated by the Government is at a satisfactory level.

The Government officials position was that "Sri Lanka is being selected for this kind of attention not because of the gravity of the problem, but for other reasons which have absolutely nothing to do with moral or ethical considerations. They are considerations of a political nature".

Subsequently, the Ambassador to the USA, Mr. Jaliya Wickramasuriya stated in The Hill's Congress Blog" dated 27th March, 2013, "We agree that while much has been accomplished since 2009, more needs to be done". This has not been contradicted to date and therefore can be accepted as reflecting the official Government position.

The Ambassador also stated, Commitment is not just to democracy, but also to respecting the Rule of Law and the principles of sovereignty. This is in line with the Resolution which states, Welcoming and acknowledging the progress made by the Government of Sri Lanka in rebuilding infrastructure, demining, resettling the majority of internally displaced persons, and noting nonetheless that considerable work lies ahead in the areas of justice, reconciliation and resumption of livelihoods, and stressing the importance of the full participation of local populations, including representatives of civil society and minorities, in these efforts. This, in fact, reflects Item 3 of the Resolution which states, ...call upon the Government of Sri Lanka to implement effectively the constructive recommendations made in the Report of the LLRC.

This is a change of policy which amounts to accepting the Resolution No. A/HRC/22/L.1 and signals a desire to broaden the relationship with the United States. We should all welcome this reversal of policy. I request the Government to make a clear statement regarding the changed policy. The media has also commented on this change during the weekend. In particular, will this House be informed:

(i) Where these anticipated talks will take place; whether it will be in Washington DC, Geneva or Colombo?

(ii) Will the Government consult all the concerned stakeholders before proceeding?

(iii) Will the Government indicate the timeframe in which of the recommendation of the LLRC are to be implemented?

(iv) Will the discussions be confined to the US Government or include India, United Kingdom and the other countries who voted to adopt the Resolution?

Thank you. () .. ( ) ( () .. - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition for raising this issue because it gives me the opportunity of clarifying the matters that he has referred to. The whole basis of the question put to me by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition is that there has been a change of Government policy. I wish to state emphatically that that is not the case. The basis on which the Hon. Leader of the Opposition has come to the conclusion that there has been a change in Government policy is the statement attributed to Sri Lankas Ambassador to the United States of America, Mr. Jaliya Wickramasuriya.

The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe quoted a statement attributed to Mr. Wickramasuriya that was on the web dated 27th March, 2013. All that the Ambassador said was this.

I quote :

We agree that while much has been accomplished sine 2009, more needs to be done.

That is all that the Ambassador said. That is self-evident. The LLRC Report consists of no fewer than about 285 recommendations. A great deal has been accomplished, during the last four years that have elapsed. But, in regard to the wide range of matters encompassed in those recommendations, it is all too obvious that there is more to be done. No one can reasonably expect the entirety of this work to be

1391 1392

completed within the short period which has elapsed since the cessation of hostilities. So, that is what the Ambassador said.

Then, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition went on to quote from the text of the Resolution and he quoted the following words.

I quote:

"Welcoming and acknowledging the progress made by the Government of Sri Lanka in rebuilding infrastructure, demining, and resettling the majority of internally displaced persons, and noting nonetheless that considerable work lies ahead in the areas of justice, reconciliation and the resumption of livelihoods, ..."

That is also obvious. Substantial work has already been done and there is more to be done. This does not mean that there has been any change in Government policy at all. The position of the Government is very clear and I wish to state it explicitly on the Floor of this House. We do not concur with the Resolution and our Representatives in Geneva distanced Sri Lanka very clearly from the content of the Resolution.

Now, I would like to ask the Hon. Leader of the Opposition in a spirit of fairness and objectivity to reflect on the reasons why this country cannot possibly acquiesce in the Resolution that was passed in Geneva a short while ago. There are several reasons. I would like to outline the more important reasons. Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, this Resolution calls for an oral update on Sri Lanka to be presented by the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights at the 24th Session of the Human Rights Council to be held in September this year. That is not the end of the matter. The Resolution then goes on to require the Commissioner to submit a comprehensive report followed by a discussion at the 25th Session of the Human Rights Council which will be held in March 2014. So, what is the effect of this? Every six months this country is going to figure in the Agenda of the Human Rights Council. That is one of the most important objectives that had been achieved by the Resolution that was adopted a few days ago. Now, the Government of Sri Lanka does not accept this position; it never has, it never will. There is absolutely no change in that position. The reason, Mr. Speaker, is very simple. As we survey the global landscape, can anybody in their senses seriously suggest that Sri Lanka is in the most troubling situation in the world? There is no proportionality in this at all. In an increasingly troubled world where there are so many crises which are crying out for attention, how is it that this country which is living at peace with the violence of 30 years behind us, being specifically targeted in this way? Why this selective treatment? I would like the Hon. Leader of the Opposition to address that issue in a spirit of objectivity. These are not partisan issues. These are not matters that should be involved in the thrust and parry of

party politics. On the contrary, these are national issues which have a vital bearing on the well-being and the future of this nation. We cannot possibly accept that position why this sharp and exclusive focus on Sri Lanka is recurring over and over again every six months. That is certainly not acceptable. We will never accept it and there will never be the slightest change in that position, which is emphatically and explicitly adopted by the Government of Sri Lanka.

There is another reason why this Resolution is fundamentally unacceptable. The Resolution, Mr. Speaker, seeks to incorporate the Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The High Commissioner for Human Rights called for an international investigation in respect of this country, not this month or last month, but one week after the hostilities ended in May, 2009. On what evidence did she call for this international investigation? There was absolutely no material on which she could have based such a call. And then, subsequently, at regular intervals doggedly and persistently, she has repeated that call for an international investigation and her recent report which was presented to the Human Rights Council contains a reaffirmation. She reaffirms her call for an international investigation. Sri Lanka absolutely rejects that claim. So, that is yet another reason and, I am sure, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition would agree that it is a compelling reason why this Resolution cannot gain acceptance by us.

That is not all, Mr. Speaker. The text of the Resolution seeks to incorporate also the Report of the so-called Panel of Experts, which we refer to as the "Darusman Report". The Darusman Report has been categorically rejected by the African Group of Countries and the Organization of Islamic Conference. They have clearly and categorically rejected the Darusman Report. That is not surprising at all. It is a Report which was prepared in a bizarre manner because the people whom the three persons on that Panel spoke to asked for an assurance that their identity would not be disclosed for 20 years. So, Mr. Speaker, these were assertions made in the shadows: nobody knows who these people are; nobody knows the basis on which they made these assertions; there is no filtering process and there is no way of testing the veracity or the reliability of the statements that were made under cover of anonymity. You can say anything at all, Mr. Speaker. So, that is the evidentiary foundation of the Report which was submitted to the Secretary-General by the Panel of Experts.

I also wish to tell the Hon. Leader of the Opposition that this was a Report prepared entirely outside the inter-Governmental process. So, these are among the reasons why large swathes of the globe had no hesitation in rejecting this Report. Nevertheless, that Report has found its way into the text of the Resolution. So, there is absolutely no doubt or equivocality about this; the Government of Sri Lanka does not accept the Resolution

1393 1394

[ () .. ]

2013 09

that was adopted in Geneva. There is no change in that position at all.

Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I would beg to disagree with the Hon. Leader of the Opposition when he says that there is a change of policy which amounts to accepting the Resolution No. A/HRC/22/L.1. There is neither a change of policy nor acceptance, expressly or by implication, of the Resolution that is referred to by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition.

We reject this Resolution, Mr. Speaker, because it is perfectly evident to anyone who cares to be objective what the consequences are. This Resolution has been the most powerful catalyst for dissention, discord and even violence. It has divided the Human Rights Council; it has divided the world; it has divided this county and it has also divided some neighbouring countries. It has spilt over into areas like cricket, cinema and its consequences have certainly not been conducive to moving forward in a constructive way, a sensitive and delicate process on which we have embarked. So, against that background, Mr. Speaker, please allow me to respond to the four questions which have been put to me specifically by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition.

The first question he asked me is whether anticipated talks will take place and whether they will be in Washington DC, Geneva or Colombo. There are no talks which are anticipated. Therefore, the question of the venue of those talks does not arise.

The second question is, will the Government consult all the concerned stakeholders before proceeding? Since there is no intention whatsoever of engaging in this exercise, the question of consulting any stakeholders does not arise.

The third question is, will the Government indicate the time frame in which the recommendations of the LLRC are to be implemented. Again, Sir, I would like to tell my Hon. Friend that these are recommendations of different kinds; different clusters of recommendations. They are very different from one another. Some are capable of being implemented in the short term. We have already done that. For example, the recommendations with regard to the resettlement of Internally Displaced Persons, reabsorption of ex-combatants into society after exposure to programmes of vocational training, the demining process, housing, the useful things which have been done with regard to the revival of the economy of the North. Those have been done. But, by their very nature, there are some recommendations which are going to take more time. For example, the recommendations with regard to the land issues, which are incredibly complex and convoluted. Also, issues relating to land, linguistic capability and cultural cross-pollination. These are not matters in respect of which delivery overnight is at all feasible. So, they are obviously going to take longer. In

the public domain, information is available with respect to the time frames attaching to the different categories of recommendations. So, that is the position. They are not all recommendations of one type or kind which can be brought within a uniform time frame.

The last question which the Hon. Leader of the Opposition has put to me is, will the discussions be confined to the US Government or include India, the United Kingdom and other countries who voted to adopt the Resolution. There is no multilateral exercise of that nature, which is contemplated at all. We are talking to all these Governments. The Hon. Speaker, a few minutes ago, welcomed the distinguished Parliamentary Delegation from India and it will be my pleasure to meet them as soon as I complete this reply to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition; I will be meeting them in a few minutes. Only last evening, Mr. Speaker, I met with and had comprehensive discussions with a Parliamentary Delegation from Germany consisting of all three of the major political parties there - the CDU, the SPD and the Greens; I spoke to all of them last evening. So, these consultations are continuing, but there is no plan for the kind of multilateral exercise which the Hon Leader of the Opposition referred to because there is no need for that.

So, that, Mr. Speaker, is my reply on behalf of the Government to the questions which the Hon. Leader of the Opposition has been kind enough to put to me. I thank you, Sir.

II VIOLENCE AGAINST MUSLIM PEOPLE

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a Statement on a most grave issue of national concern relating to the safety, security and well-being of the Muslim people of this Island.

( ) (Hon. Members) Ah! . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) The Muslim people have been historical inhabitants of this Island and have contributed immensely to its development for many centuries. They have their own unique customs and traditions, food and dress and they are devout adherents of a very great religion. - [Interruption.] As the cultural beneficiaries of the Islamic

1395 1396

Golden Age, which spanned the Eighth to the Thirteenth Centuries, the Muslim people of Sri Lanka have scaled the heights of the whole range of human endeavour from art and music to medicine, law, science, enterprise, academics and so on.

Today, however, the purveyors of hate are unleashing a bitter and spiteful campaign against the Muslim people. I do not need to recount the many acts of mob violence against the Muslim people that have taken place in the last few months. Muslim women who choose to wear the conservative religious dress have been molested and abused by strangers in broad daylight. - [Interruption.]

Today the Muslim people are fearful; anxious and hurt by the invective surrounding them.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) What is your point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, it is the LTTE who chased away 100,000 Muslims from Jaffna and killed the Muslims in the Kattankudi Mosque. These are the proxies of the LTTE. Now, the Hon. Member has become the saviour. This is all nonsense and hypocrisy at the highest level.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Let me continue, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, we should allow the Hon. R. Sampanthan to make his statement and the Government to reply. We do not want anything from the Ministers who will not resign from their positions when the Muslims are being massacred.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Hon. Sampanthan, you may carry on with your speech.- [Interruption.] Order, please! Listen to the Hon. R. Sampanthan.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) May I, Sir, with your permission, repeat my last sentence? - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Today, the Muslim people are fearful; anxious and hurt by the invective surrounding them. As fellow minorities, the Tamil people feel the pain, the insecurity, the fear and the anxiety of our Muslim brothers and sisters. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) The relationship between the Tamils and Muslims has always been close - though sometimes strained and to our perpetual shame, though very rarely, even violent and cruel - but nevertheless always close. It must be emphasized that these extremely unfortunate events occurred only during a certain stage of the time of the armed conflict and will not recur.

Our people are too closely intertwined for one to think that it can survive the fate of the other. We are connected to each other just as we are connected to the Sinhalese, the Malays and the Burghers; the bonds of a common language and home that hold us together cannot be broken easily. And so, when our Muslim brothers and sisters are harmed on the street, or attacked by mobs or have their mosques vandalized, we cannot be unconcerned spectators.

Mr. Speaker, as the Leader of the Tamil National Alliance, I urge that the violence against the Muslim people cease now. I urge an end to the repulsive hate speech that we hear everyday. I urge an end to the collusion of the State in this campaign of hate. We are

1397 1398

[ . ]

2013 09

conscious that the vast majority of the Sinhalese Buddhist people do not condone such actions and that they would very much wish to live in peace and harmony paying due respect to the rights of other peoples. As victims of the worst atrocities, we, the Tamils have demanded that the country and the world heed our call for accountability, justice, genuine reconciliation and the guarantee of non-recurrence.

We wish to emphasize that the enforcement of law and order, and ensuring the safety and security of all peoples including the Muslim people is primarily the responsibility of the State. Recent events have shown that the State has not discharged this responsibility in a manner beyond reproach.

We, therefore, call upon the Government to refrain from acts of partisanship and discharge its constitutional duty to ensure that equal protection of the law be afforded to all peoples in this country including the Muslim people.

Thank you, Sir. - [Interruption.] You have crossed over from this side to that side and you want to survive by selling your people. You are a shameless skunk.

We are looking from a national perspective. When the Labour GSP was losing out, we said, Let us, as a common front, as Government and Opposition work together and protect it. You said that you do not want it. You lost it. Today you lose Rs. 1.3 billion. Likewise, when we said that Geneva in 2012 is not going to be good and let us work together, you said that you do not want it and you would win and come. You lost it. In 2013, we told it in advance. Otherwise, you will say that you went to Geneva, you went to London and this tale and that tale was told. . ? . .

( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. You have 30 minutes.

[1.15 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, the Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning initially referred to the fact that all of these Bills were challenged in the Supreme Court for their constitutionality and announced to the House that through this pre-enactment review process, the Supreme Court has found nothing unconstitutional in any of these Bills that have been moved today. This is hardly surprising after the events of 15th January this year and the Hon. Minister was perhaps announcing the fact that this is what was sought by the Government, of a Judiciary that is amenable, a Judiciary that is under the thumb of the Executive and that it has now started delivering for the Government. That is a sad indictment on the Judiciary.

As you read each of these Determinations, you feel sorry for the way in which serious issues of retrospectivity, of classification, of validity have been dealt with. Fiscal policy of the Government has been

acknowledged as of paramount importance to which even the forum, the Supreme Court, must bow down to.

What was challenged in the Supreme Court was with regard to the constitutionality of these Bills and that ought to have been examined properly without sermonizing on what the Governments fiscal policy is. That is not a matter for the Supreme Court. Nevertheless, that is what we have in these Determinations today.

If one is to look at the amendments that have been brought, the most damaging one appears in the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) (Amendment) Bill. Section 3 of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act No. 3 of 2003 is sought to be amended. This House knows the history with regard to the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act that was brought in the year 2003.

Parliament, in the exercise of its constitutionally mandated responsibility of being in total control over public finance, saw it fit to give expression to that responsibility by way of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act. In that, in the year 2003, certain safeguards were brought in and what is relevant today of those safeguards is that the country is not made indebted in such a way that succeeding generations will inherit that debt and the country will not be totally bound and chained by these fetters of debt and that it was the responsibility of whoever who had the responsibility to manage the fiscal policy to ensure that certain targets were met. One of those targets was that the State Guarantee for loans does not exceed 4.5 per centum for a particular year. Now, that is sought to be increased to 7 per cent, a huge increase. Why was that limit brought in? That limit was brought in because otherwise State Guarantees are directly chargeable on the Consolidated Fund. The moment you default, it is chargeable on the Consolidated Fund. The country's resources can be whisked away by the creditor and, therefore, there was going to be a limit on those guarantees. So, 4.5 per cent was set. There was no explanation given either in the Budget Proposals or in the Budget Speech or today by the Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning as to why this is being extended to 7 per cent, as high as 7 per cent. Of course, by bringing this very amendment, the Government is showing that it is in need of borrowing more and more and it is in need of giving State Guarantees for those loans.

When the Mattala Airport was opened, it was stated there rather apologetically by the Minister of Finance and Planning that we are not borrowing all these monies for our own use - I do not know why he thought of his own use unless that was also uppermost in his mind - but that it was being borrowed for development work. When a country's portfolio is as bad as what we have, when the debt portfolio is as bad as what we have, we must have development but that development must be sustainable development; that development must be people's

1433 1434

[ ]

2013 09

development and that development must necessarily have a view of changing that debt portfolio. It should not be development that will further -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, what is your point of Order?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) . . .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir. I also associate myself with the point of Order raised during the course of my speech by the Hon. (Dr.) Harsh De Silva, the National List Member from the UNP. If the Committee Stage Amendments had been taken up at the Consultative Committee, those ought to have been distributed prior to the Hon. Deputy Minister

moving the Second Reading of the Bills this morning. This is highly irregular although the Hon. Minister of Education defends by saying that according to the Standing Orders, the Government can introduce Amendments at any stage, but it is the Opposition that must give notice. While that may be true, it hardly can be said to be the proper process that halfway through the Debate, these suggested Committee Stage Amendments are being distributed.

Many of the speeches made will wholly be irrelevant now because those may have touched on those areas. Then, you find that there are Committee Stage Amendments, which come in much later. So, I also wish to associate myself with the objection raised by the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva and say that this practice must be discontinued forthwith.

Sir, I was on the issue of increasing the limit of the State Guarantee for loans and development. What do we intend achieving by development, particularly by the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport? What is the income that that investment is going to bring into the country? If the purpose of amending the limit from 4.5 to 7 per cent is so that the Government can borrow more and the Hon. Minister of Finance and Planning can grant State Guarantees at his will, extending to 7 per cent, there are two things that will happen. One, as I said before, several future generations will be indebted to those who lend. The second is, when we are unable to pay, the creditor can charge directly on the Consolidated Fund. We know that there are countries which lend at high interest rates - 6 per cent and so on - particularly the Chinese, from whom we seem to borrow quite a bit and their track record, particularly in Africa, is that when they lend more than those countries can ever hope to repay and when those countries default, their natural resources are taken by the lender. So, this is a very serious issue. We talk so much about sovereignty; we talk so much about protecting our territorial integrity, but our natural resources, all of the resources we have including the human resources and the capital of this country, must be protected. That is why there is a limit prescribed. Otherwise, there need not be a limit. As I said, extending it from 4.5 to 7 per cent is a huge extension, for which no explanation has been given except the desire of the Government to borrow more and more and invest them in projects, apart form their own personal projects that do not give a return to the country.

Then, look at the next Amendment to Clause 2(b) of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) (Amendment) Bill. There was a target that had to be met and it was to be achieved by 2013: one part, which is 85 per cent, by 2006 and the other, by 2013. Now, that has been extended up to 2020. The fact that we have not been able to reach that target is one matter, but this is said to be the fiscal policy of the Government. The Supreme Court has pronounced that this is the fiscal policy. How can this be

1435 1436

the fiscal policy? There was a policy and in accordance with that policy, certain targets were prescribed. Being unable to meet those targets, you relax the targets and then call it the Governments fiscal policy. That cannot be.

Similarly, there are Amendments being made to the Finance Bill.

The main objection there will be to the Minister being given the discretion to make various exemptions and a very interesting argument has been advanced in these Determinations. That is, this has to be given to the Executive to do because there is pressure on Parliamentary time. The Supreme Court is so concerned about the Parliaments time, and there is a heading on page five of the Determination on the Finance (Amendment) Bill which states, "Pressure on Parliamentary time". Therefore, they want to take away some of the functions of Parliament, not give us too much work to do; they are very concerned that we are overloaded with work. This Parliament does not have that much of work. This Parliament, in addition to itself abdicating its duty, has been robbed of several of its constitutional duties like full control over public finance, and the Supreme Court has the gall to say, There is pressure on Parliamentary time. Therefore, let us leave it to the Minister to decide and prescribe on what exemptions are to be made. Now, this is a very serious issue. Those who speak of Parliamentary supremacy will not raise a voice against this kind of thing where a backhanded compliment is being given to Parliament saying, You have too much work to do. Leave it to the Executive. Who is saying that? The Judiciary is saying that, and we shout hoarse about Parliamentary supremacy over other organs of Government, and when even constitutionally-mandated provisions are being taken away from Parliament, we remain mute.

There are other features like the Betting and Gaming Levy (Amendment) Bill, and I want to address that issue. The Supreme Court itself has recognized in this Determination that is here today that it maybe an illegal trade. They seem to be unsure whether it is illegal or not. They say, "possibly an illegal trade". It is an illegal trade. But, we earn revenue off an illegal trade, and I say with responsibility this is not something that we should do. The legislative policy is very clear, has declared betting and gaming as illegal trades, and then nevertheless, we go ahead and prescribe revenue measures that the State earns off that illegal trade and that ought not to be.

There are a very few positive features also and I want to commend the Government for that. For instance, one of the amendments in the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Bill is bringing in an appeal from the Director-General of Customs to be made to the Tax

Appeals Commission. That is a welcome amendment because until now there was no review process for determinations that were being made under the Customs Ordinance. The appeals were to the Director-General himself.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! . , [ ] .

, , [ ] .

Whereupon THE HON. SHANTHA BANDARA left the Chair and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I was saying that there are some positive features in the Amendments that have been brought in and one of those is provision for an appeal from the determination of the Director-General of Customs. Until now, any appeal was to the Director-General, the Head of that Department. But, with the advancement that we have in todays modern world, that hardly is an appeal. And, as far as I know, the Director-General never overturns any determination by his subordinate officers. So, an appeal to an independent body like the Tax Appeals Commission - one hopes that the body will be independent - is a welcome change. I wish to commend the Government for that.

But, overall, various exemptions are sought to be given. The Parliamentary supervision, where up to now the requirement of Parliament having to approve certain changes, is being taken away and a discretion is being given to the Ministers concerned. For instance, prescription of various fees: it says Rs. 5, Rs. 50 or any other figure, as may be prescribed. Now, it maybe that it is efficient, it is convenient, but nevertheless, there is no gainsaying that it actually takes away the power of Parliament to keep a tight control over public finance. Those kinds of Amendments that are being brought in, although some of those are, in fact, Budget Proposals, are detrimental to the economy of this country, particularly the debt portfolio that I highlighted. The provision that is being made today to further commit this country to huge debts without accountability by the Executive is something that we need to be conscious about and oppose.

Thank you very much.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today it has fallen on the shoulders of the Members of this Legislature to pass various Amendments, which form part of the monetary Bills that are being taken up. These envisage the revival of the economy and also to drive this country to be a progressive land. In this context, Sir, we have to concentrate on many areas such as the evil forces, the conspirators and the bad eggs who are endeavouring day in and day out to bring disrepute to this country. We are a very small nation - the Pearl of the Indian Ocean - which, after 30 years of fighting cruel, dastardly and demonly forces, is trying to raise its head. For this economic revival, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa is giving the guidance, the indictment and the correct leadership. It is through the economic revival that we could live as a happy and prosperous nation. This is what our President, all the Members of the Cabinet and the Members of the Government are striving to do and achieve.

If anybody would stand in the path of this progress, he could be easily named as a traitor because he is holding flags of some others, not the Sri Lankan Flag.

See what happened this morning. I must make a hurried reference to that. The leader of the TNA, the Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan, spoke this morning. I was associated with his father, Mr. Rajavarothiam, and even went to some of his meetings at that time in Trincomalee with my close friend Senator S.Z.M. Mashoor Moulana. At that time, they, the Federal Party, under Thanthai Chelvanayakam fought to have federalism, but within a united Sri Lanka. In this context, they had dialogues with the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike first. When those failed, the late Hon. Dudley Senanayake invited that great man, the Hon. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam, for talks. He readily agreed. He did not say, You Sinhalese leaders have betrayed us. Therefore, I will not come to you. No, that was not his political sagacity and wisdom. He readily agreed and went for talks and they also brought out an agreement. He never closed the door of dialogue.

Today, in this imbroglio, the Government is inviting the TNA to come for talks. The Parliamentary Select Committee is the correct forum because if the President or the Government would talk only with the TNA, there are other Tamil parties such as the EPDP which oppose it. Even Muslims would oppose it. If they talk only with the Muslim Congress, the other Muslim political parties such as the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen's All Ceylon Makkal Congress or the Peoples Congress, the Hon. Athaullahs National Congress and other parties would oppose. All these forces and parties which represent various

communities, ethnic groups and languages are represented in this Parliament. That is the best place where we could evolve a better system in order to bring solace to all people, which we aspire and pray for this country. If they say they cannot come for talks, okay, then what?

; ; ; . , simple question . ; ; ; . , . . ?

This morning, the Hon. Sampanthan was shedding crocodile tears on behalf of the Muslims. Sheer hypocrisy! Sheer hypocrisy!! He has shown to the Muslim World and to the entire diaspora that there is no other hypocrite

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

better than him. He must be awarded and also crowned for that. A hundred thousand Muslims were chased away overnight from Jaffna. They were living happily in the Jaffna Peninsula for centuries. That was the land that gave us the great scholar A.M.A. Azeez; that was the land that gave us the famous Supreme Court Judge Alhaj M.M. Abdul Cader; that was the land that gave us the first Muslim Mayor Quazi, M.M. Sultan. Not a word was spoken about them.

Distinguished representatives from the Indian Government were in the distinguished Gallery in the morning. They came forward to build 50,000 houses. We raised that question. The TNA would not think of allocating a single house to the Muslims. All these houses, I say, must actually be given to the Muslims because they were chased away from their land of birth. They were the real victims. It was they who suffered and not the TNA. The war between the Government forces and the LTTE is a different matter. The Muslims were chased away and they are still in refugee camps in Puttalam and other areas.

I think the Hon. Sooriyapperuma Archaryathuma knows these things. He has gone there; we are going there. Who is helping the Jaffna Tamils, I ask? Is it the TNA? No. It is the Hon. Douglas Devananda. The community there is very grateful to him. He is distributing tin sheets; he is building houses for them; he opens housing schemes and technical institutions there. He very often goes to the Muslim areas - to the Moor Street.

1439 1440

The Osmaniya College is going to celebrate its 100th year soon. I told the Hon. Minister of Postal Services, the Hon. Jeewan Kumaranatunga, that he must print a stamp for us when we mark that historic occasion. The Jaffna Osmaniya College is a great seat of learning in the North. The Khadija Girls' College is also a great institution of learning. Al-Manar in Marathamunai in Kalmunai in the Eastern Province is also celebrating its 100th year. We must at least have a stamp printed when we commemorate these great events of those great institutions. This is the way the Government is helping our Muslims. This is the way they are getting every one of us together.

After winning the election, the Hon. Sampanthan never set foot to his own area, Thennamaravadi in the Trincomalee District. Shame on him! I went there for an election. The people in the area were crying. They have no electricity. They have no houses. Their houses are broken because of the LTTE attacks. Thirty years ago they went from the villages to the forests of Mullaitivu and Vavuniya and lived as refugees. After this Government came into power, they came and said, Sir, give us a road; give us a hospital; give us a maternity home.

Sir, I am very happy to state that under the direction of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, it was only last week that the Hon. Susantha Punchinilame went to Thennamaravadi with Thoweek Adambawa, Vice- Chairman of Pulmoddai Pradeshiya Sabha and laid the foundation stone for a school. Now, this is the way we are helping the Tamils, not TNA. Now, Sir, when the Hon. Sampanthan was speaking in the morning I had to interrupt and ask him What about the Jaffna Muslims who were chased away within 24 hours; what about the Muslims you have mercilessly massacred while they were praying in the Kattankudy Mosque; what about the Muslims you mercilessly cut and chopped into pieces in Eravur; what about the Buddhist Priests of Aranthalawa who were brutally slaughtered there?" This is what I told the Foreign Ministers and Gurus who came here. Today, the Hon. Sampanthan

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] is unashamedly -

. . . ! , , , . , , "

, " . , , .

Did you listen to the news broadcast on a private channel last night at 9.00 o' clock? It said, "Tamil Nadu opposed the Indian Delegation coming here. As a result, they are not coming here. Today, early morning, Mr. Hudson Samarasinghe, the Chairman of the SLBC, announced on Dasa Desin - " "- that they have arrived. We all listened and felt happy. That private channel is their channel. What greedy happiness they enjoy by spreading such false news! They will be happy if the Indians do not come. The TNA would have been happy if they did not come.

Sir, you also attended the sumptuous lunch given by the Hon. Speaker today to the Indian Delegation on the fourth floor. How happy they were! They told us that they have come here to explore the possibility of expansion of trade, to build bridges between Sri Lanka and India and also be very much closer to Sri Lanka and cooperate with us. The Indian High Commissioner, His Excellency Ashok K. Kantha, was also there. I told him, It is a tragedy that we are going to lose you soon because you are going to be the Secretary in charge of East Asia. You are a person who has been helping us. You know every inch of the land in Jaffna and other places in the Eastern Province. Innumerable help and assistance came our way after you came here as the High Commissioner of India to this country. The Tamil Nadu must know about the hospitality extended by the Hon. Speaker to the Indian Delegation. Their arrival here is a blow to the Tamil Nadu. You may shout in the South, but there is a very close relationship between the Northern block and the Southern block of Delhi. We will do what we think right and they have done what they think right. They sent the Delegation here. That is a terrible blow to the Tamil Nadu, to Jayalalitha. Jayalalitha is a l ady who wants to win the election. . , " " . -

"We bear witness to the peaceful atmosphere prevailing here", they would say. The Delegation consisted of the Hon. Saugata Roy, the All India Trinamool Congress, Lok Sabha; the Hon. Prakash Javadekar, the Bharatiya Janata Party, Rajya Sabha; the Hon. Sandeep Dikshit, the Indian National Congress, Lok Sabha; the Hon. Anurag Thakur, the Bharatiya Janata Party, Lokh Sabha and the Hon. Dhananjay Singh, the Bahujan Samaj Party, Lok Sabha.

Sir, I think the Minister, Hon. Bandula Gunawardane wants me to carry on until he comes. I do not know whether you can give me another five minutes.

The Delegation also consisted of the Hon. Madhu Goud Yaskhi, the Indian National Congress, Lok Sabha; Ms. Jyoti Malhotra, Convenor, the Forums of Parliamentarians, FICCI and Mr. Tuhin Subhro Chakraborty, the Official Forums of Parliamentarians, FICCI from the highest Legislature of India. It was a high level Delegation who was allowed to enter this country. They are going tomorrow to Jaffna to see the beauty of the land and to see for themselves the development there.

I ask, Sir, when the TNA and their henchmen went to Geneva, did they talk about the Muslim problems in Jaffna? Did they talk about the massacre of the Kattankudy Muslims? Why are they having this duplicity - the double standard - and hypocrisy at the highest level? Do not do that. Not only the Tamil Nadu, but also the whole world would not regard you hereafter. Your integrity is lost today. You should have left us alone. . . . the Hon. (Dr.) T.B. Jayah : "You go from this country, my colonial masters!

We will solve our problem, if there are any, with our elderly brothers, the Sinhalese and also the Tamils. That is the attitude. That is the political guidance given to us by Dr. Jayah. Therefore, Sir, I would kindly ask the Hon. Sampanthan to give to the Muslims their lands in Mullaitivu -" " '' ! ! They are asking back their lands, Sir.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please wind up now.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I am finishing with this. Page A8 of Daily Mirror of April 9, 2013 states under the caption, Alienation of Land to Resettle Returning Muslims : Mullaitivu Muslims Protest Against TNA Claims and I quote:

the Muslim community in the Mullaitivu District had pooh poohed these claims alleging that this was a conspiracy that was being hatched by the TNA to create havoc in the north once again.

I ask, "Hon. Sampanthan, why can you not talk about this" ?

Thank you.

we going to run this country? That is my simple question. I do not know, it is left to the Government to decide what they are going to do. The Hon. Minister of External Affairs has said that he is not accepting the Motion that had been brought forward by Geneva. Okay, that maybe the principle laid down by the Government.

Now, think of the other factor. We are having the CHOGM Summit in the month of November. There again, we are having a conflict of interest. There are a number of countries that have voiced their disagreement and said that this should not be held in Sri Lanka. I am not trying to criticize the Government in any way. I am only telling you the factual position. Now, as far as this issue is concerned, Canada has taken the view that the Commonwealth Summit should not be held in Sri Lanka, and the Prime Minister, Stephen Harper already issuing a warning said that they will boycott the summit if there is no progress in Sri Lanka on human rights issue. Bob Rae, the Opposition Party Leader of Canada has also said, There is neither truth nor reconciliation after the end of the civil war. Ethnic and religious discrimination is growing, not decreasing. Attacks on journalists and opposition politicians are getting worse and more lethal. The abuse of the rule of law is increasing; the impeachment of the countrys Supreme Court Chief Justice was a deep abuse of power. The situation has escalated to such a large degree that Canada can no longer in good conscience attend the upcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Colombo. The Sri Lankan regime has not earned the right to host this international summit, and we urge other states to boycott the meeting and push for a change of venue. The Commonwealth is too important to allow its business to be disrupted by a single rogue member's violation of the association's beliefs and values. Canada must work with other member states to create stronger mechanisms to deal with governments failing to uphold the Commonwealth's shared commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of law.

In the same way, many human rights organizations have said, especially the Human Rights Watch has said, "A summit in Sri Lanka will cast serious doubts on the Commonwealth's commitment to supporting human rights, democratic reform, and fundamental human rights enshrined in the Commonwealth Harare Declaration of 1991.

Holding the Summit in Sri Lanka is likely to prove to be a major embarrassment to the Commonwealth and its participants. In the same way, the Human Rights Watch says that the Government should not receive the honour of hosting the Commonwealth Conference. They further state that Handing Sri Lanka leadership of the Commonwealth at a time when democratic institutions are under direct and sustained attack by the Sri Lankan Government will be an affront to the victims of rights violations in the country and around the Commonwealth".

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. D.M. Swaminathan. Before he starts, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Janaka Bandara to take the Chair?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I propose that the Hon. Janaka Bandara do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

[3.32 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Mr. Presiding Member, I think this morning and for a few hours of the afternoon, we heard many interesting speeches made by the Government as well as the Opposition Members. I think there was a valid point made that we, in this august Assembly, should speak what factually is correct and we should not divulge anything which is incorrect. In the same way, there must also be decorum in Parliament: the way we speak in Parliament, the way we address the Members, and we must uphold the traditions of Parliamentary democracy in this country. We have to consider all these factors as Parliamentarians for the future wellbeing of this country.

Primarily when the Hon. Leader of the Opposition raised an issue this morning and asked the Hon. Minister of External Affairs four questions wherein he mentioned and stressed the importance of the LLRC Report and what the Indian Government has also informed him after his visit to India. But, unfortunately, the Minister of External Affairs gave an extremely vague answer which did not contain anything that is fruitful for this country. I am extremely sorry to say that we, as Parliamentarians are addressing this Assembly but we do not have a clear international policy. We are disregarding the international community totally. We cannot live like frogs in the well. I mean, we cannot just talk in this Parliament about our internal problems; without having due respect to the foreign affairs and to the international community is, really a backward way of thinking. In fact, I was wondering myself what we are talking in this Parliament. If we do not accept principles of foreign affairs, how are

Yashwant Sinha urged the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, to skip the Summit. Addressing a hall meeting on the Sri Lankan Tamils issue in Chennai last week, Sinha said that India was the pivot of the Commonwealth body. If India does not go there, CHOGM cannot be held", he said.

I am not trying to tell that these governments are correct. They maybe talking on the fundamental rights and the human rights violations in this country. But, I think we have to draw our towers somewhere and come to a conclusion in this situation. We cannot allow this country to go on this way. We are not accepting the Geneva sanctions, we are not accepting the Commonwealth Summit's voice. Ultimately, how are we going to run this country? Can we run this country alone internally among ourselves with certain powers in the world close to us? I do not think that should be the way of running the country and I think this is a complete slur as far as democracy of this country is concerned. At the same time I wish to ask one pertinent question. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held on the 28th and 30th October, 2011 had laid down certain principles which the Commonwealth Association has to look into. I quote: "The current procedure for addressing serious or persistent violations of Commonwealth values, other than the unconstitutional overthrow of a democratically elected government, should be revised as follows.

i. The Secretary-General should, in the first instance, take cognizance of a situation of concern, be it a significant structural deficiency in a democratic institution or a serious or persistent violation of Commonwealth values, and raise it with the member state in question, affording it an opportunity to respond, and offering his/her Good Offices to redress the situation; ii. The Secretary-Generals Good Offices engagement with the government concerned could include (a) the appointment of an envoy, (b) the offer of advice and technical assistance in relevant areas to help redress the issues of concern, and (c) consultation with relevant regional leaders, with regional and other international organizations, as well as other relevant Commonwealth bodies;

iii. The Secretary-General will consult the Chair of CMAG on relevant country situations, as required, including where his/her Good Offices engagements are active. The Secretary-General would, of course, also retain the ability to brief and consult the Commonwealth Chairperson-in-Office on matters under consideration and seek his/her intervention as appropriate;

Then, under "relevant considerations", it is stated, I quote:

There should be closer consultation between the Chair of CMAG and the Secretary-General on country situations of concern as required, be it to address structural deficiencies in democratic institutions or actual violations of Commonwealth values;

These are the fundamental outlines that have been laid down in the Summit of Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held between the 28th and 30th of October, 2011 which is called "Perth Outcome Documents".

According to this documentation, has the Minister of External Affairs really invoked the provisions of this and asked the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth as to why he has not exercised his rights to safeguard the interests of non-violation of fundamental rights as far as the Meeting to be held in November is concerned?

These are matters that we have to consider very carefully. I do not want to go in deeper as we have spoken about this matter many a time in this forum. I think, ultimately, the Government of Sri Lanka should at least adhere to the basic principle that has been laid down by the Geneva Resolution: go into the LLRC Report which is its own Report. We have mentioned about that and about the enforcement of the Thirteenth Amendment a number of times in this august Assembly. If we do this, at least, we will have some credibility in the world. Otherwise, we are going to face a tremendous target in the future of this country, which is going to be fairly serious.

Coming back to the Amendments to the Bill that have been proposed by the Hon. Deputy Minister - I must say with due respect that he is a very honourable Minister and as many speakers have mentioned in this Assembly, he has got the experience and powers to carry out the duties of a Finance Minister - there is one issue which I have brought up. I have already told this to the Hon. Deputy Minister and I have also discussed this matter with the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa. But, ultimately, yet the position is not clear. With regard to the implementation of the 2013 Budget Proposals and the revision of 100 per cent tax on transfer of property and prohibition of outright transfer of property to foreigners, Mr. M.M.C. Ferdinando, Secretary to the Ministry of Investment Promotion by his letter dated 11th March, 2013 addressed to the Secretaries of the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs, Ministry of Finance and Planning et cetera draws attention to the letter of the Director-General of the Department of Fiscal Policy dated 28th December, 2012 under Reference No. SP 06/23/01/03; the Circular No. 12/2012 dated 31st December, 2012 issued by the Registrar-General to all the Registrars of Land; the joint ministerial paper based on the unanimous Cabinet Paper dated 21st February, 2013; Abstract dated 21st February, 2013 of the Cabinet of Ministers; Section 107 of the Notaries Ordinance and to Section 117 of the Registration of Documents Ordinance.

Then, he goes on further to say that as per the advice of Director- General of Department of Fiscal Policy and unanimous decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers,

1473 1474

foreigners are prohibited from gaining the absolute ownership of State-owned and privately-owned lands within Sri Lanka. Then, he comes to a very important provision which says that when investment is made within Sri Lanka for mixed or domestic development projects, the necessity of exemption of 100 per cent stamp duty payable by foreigners on short or long term leases with regard to State or privately-owned land has been passed under the Finance Act, No. 8 of 2004 and has been published in the Government Gazettes Nos. 1386/18 and 1530/16 dated 30th March, 2005 and 1st of January, 2008 respectively. Then, some projects are exempted from 100 per cent tax. One is construction of 100 residential housing units each constructed on land not exceeding 10 perches. Then, a project relating to infrastructure development or any other development determined by the Minister as essential for the economic progress of Sri Lanka is exempted provided that the value of the said land is met by inward remittances of foreign currency and the investment on the project be not less than US Dollars 50 million or its equivalent in Sri Lankan Rupees. That is perfectly in order. A project for the construction and operation of a hospital or a hotel provided that the total value of the said land is met by inward remittances of foreign currencies and that the investment on the project should not be less than US Dollars 10 million or its equivalent in Sri Lankan Rupees is exempted. So, those were the provisions brought forward by this Circular.

Subsequently, these provisions have not been included in the Circular sent to the Land Commissioner Generals Department dated 27th March, 2013. That has been done by the officials of the Ministry of Finance and Planning. That Circular does not include these exemptions. In fact, when I spoke to the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa and the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, they made it very clear that as far as the investments of this country is concerned, they are not going to reverse on the decision that was made earlier. But, the Circular that has been sent on 27th of March, 2013 to the Land Commissioner Generals Department and Registrar Generals Department does not contain those provisions. This is a ridiculous state of affairs. So, I earnestly request the Hon. Minister of Finance and Planning to kindly look into this matter and rectify it immediately by issuing a Gazette Notification or by publishing a statement in the newspapers and see that it does not hinder the progress of your Government or our Government's future.

There are also certain other issues that have been brought forward especially in regard to the Powers of Attorney Ordinance where you are charging a stamp duty of Rs. 1,500. If you go to search for a document in the Registrar Generals Department it costs you Rs. 500. That is just to search for a folio. Then, to make an application for a duplicate copy, it costs you Rs. 500. It does not matter. I accept the fact that there should be some revenue coming to the Government. But, there are

poor people, people who are notaries who are not lawyers, there are people who cannot afford to pay these amounts. Also, there are litigants or persons who are going to purchase a land who may not be in a position to pay this amount of money. Therefore, I think the Hon. Deputy Minister, should consider at least reducing certain figures that I have mentioned for the benefit of the people of this country.

I do not wish to take any further time to deal with this matter. I brought in one or two important matters which the Government of Sri Lanka as well as the Ministers should take cognizance of. I hope at least in future there will be a better foreign policy in this country and we respect the international community to the best of our ability.

Thank you.
