() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) This is the National Census. 10 . . Now, we are getting back on track. . . Agricultural census . Industrial census . . . But, we cannot compare that with this because this is a national Census, which is being held once in 10 years.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, obviously, this has been captured in the 2012 Census. Is it?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Maybe, some of it. But, I do not know the methodology they are going to use.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, my second Supplementary Question is, as with the Census, you have got such a lot of information, is it not possible to go for new technology, which is also related to the magnetic identity cards, I would say, with data on one's eyes and so on? Is it possible to go for that so that you can prevent tax avoidance and people from using fake documents? All that can be avoided if it could be done. Is your Ministry looking forward to do that?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Speaker, that is an excellent idea. I want to commend the Hon. Member for that. We are examining that possibility. You know that in India, they are now experimenting with a Smart Card for what they call the Aadhaar System, which can be used for all activities. So, it is a very good idea and we are also studying that at the present moment.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My third Supplementary Question is, with the information that has been revealed through the Census,

1423 1424

[ () ]

would it be possible to ensure that we put this country into national order, where we would be able to have a solution to the ethnic issue instead of being on a chauvinistic run, putting this country forward, moving forward rather than dwell in the dead past and ensuring that we take a gigantic stride into the future where we will be calling ourselves "Sri Lankans"?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Of course, Mr. Speaker. I have to thank the Hon. Member. We are in full agreement with your sentiments, that we must now put the past behind us and look to the future, Hon. Member. Thank you for raising that issue.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I thank you for the opportunity given and also appreciate the Order you just gave to the media.

Today, certain Tamil newspapers have published news items regarding what the Hon. Sampanthan had stated. A news item in the "Sudar Oli" newspaper of 29th November, 2013 states, I quote:

" "

"" means "riotous."

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , notice .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, that refers to my conduct which is against the Standing Order No. 31 (10). I want to clarify myself. Otherwise, a wrong information would be spread right throughout the Island.

Again, a news item in the "Virakesari" newspaper of of 29th November, 2013 states what the Hon. Sampanthan had stated, I quote:

" "

It was not because he is a minority Tamil that I raised the question; according to the Standing Orders, I am entitled to raise the question.

The same news item in the "Sudar Oli" newspaper further states, I quote:

" . .. ..."

That states that I was definitely trying to stop his speech. No, I referred to his conduct which implied hidden motives. So, Sir, I would only ask you -

, - - , " ?" . . senior Member. , . , .

So, Sir, ask them to carry in their newspapers tomorrow, only this explanation of mine.

Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

. . . , , . . , . [12.10 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees for the opportunity given to speak on the Second Reading of the Budget, which was presented by the Hon. Minister of Finance and Planning.

Before I start speaking on the proposals themselves, let me, with your permission, say that todays proceedings started on a very auspicious note. My good Friend, the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer made a clarification with regard to his conduct in this House yesterday. We welcome the clarification he made and we hope that that spirit will prevail in the future too, that he does not intend to disturb or stop anybody from speaking. That is a good explanation. We welcome that though there is one thing that I am a little concerned about. This House will remember - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, my learned Friend being a lawyer must understand that I do not disturb - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is right. I welcomed your explanation. So, do not disturb, please.- [Interruption.] We welcome what you said.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Thank you. How nice of you!

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you. But, I am disturbed about one matter. On the 26th of November, my Colleague, the Member from Jaffna, the Hon. S. Shritharan made a speech in this House. He made certain remarks in his speech and for the next two days running, almost every Member who spoke, referred to his speech as they started speaking. There was a sense of aggression in their voices in retaliation to perhaps, some of the sentiments expressed. But, what bewilders me is that the Member from Jaffna was allowed to speak without any interruption; he was not stopped by any Member of this House. Yet, yesterday, when the Leader of the TNA, the Hon. R. Sampanthan, Member from Trincomalee, spoke with a lot of moderation and appealing to the majority people in this country, he was constantly disturbed to the point that he had to take his seat several times and conclude with a very regretful note that this is how the minorities are treated, not just in the country but even in this House.

So, this is the bewilderment. You yourself describe it as an "extremist speech", but you allowed it to go on. In fact, you like it to be made, but you are not happy with the voices of moderation. This is a dangerous trend. Why are you shutting out people who are moderate, people who still appeal to the good sense and goodwill? We believe that there is a lot of goodwill still left amongst all the communities in this country and we are appealing to that. So, in the Debate on the Second Reading of the Budget, apart from the Budget Proposals themselves - I will come to that in a moment though there is not much to talk about it - a climate of rising temperatures was created because Maaveerar Day happened to take place during that week. When it has traditionally been observed in certain parts of the country for a long time, it coincides generally with the Budget Debate and this is an issue that has been happening every year and it is growing. This aggro is growing and it is not a good thing. People have a right to remember the dead. If they have remembered the dead on a particular day, they must be permitted to do so; whether they be members of the LTTE or members of the armed forces, civilians or whoever it may be, the relatives of the dead must have the right and any country that claims to be a civilized country, must afford that right to its citizens. So, to that extent - [Interruption.] Please do not disturb. You said that you will not disturb. I appeal

1471 1472

[ ]

2013 29

again to the good sense, to the goodwill of all the people in this country to please understand and not make things worse by making allegations and counter-allegations and make people feel that they are not wanted and make people feel that they cannot even perform the most basic of their obligations to their dead relatives.

During this time, a few other things have also happened in the North. One Government Member spoke of the economic growth in the North and claimed that it is 25 per cent. Those are bogus figures. Previously too, the Hon. Minister for External Affairs claimed this in a visit to the US and later retracted because he was comparing apples with oranges. He was using a different base: real and nominal figures. Also, when an area is recovering from the devastation of a war, you have to start from a very low base. But, what is most disturbing, added to all of these, is the fact that the figures that are taken into account include the salaries that are paid to the soldiers who are stationed in the North. That can hardly be counted into the economic growth of the Northern Province. The economic activity that the soldiers are indulging in - they are cultivating paddy; they are cultivating vegetables and they are selling them at the market for a lesser price than the farmers in the Jaffna Peninsula - are going in as economic figures. They are running luxury hotels. Thalsevena Holiday Resort is advertised on the internet as a hotel run by the military. All those figures of that economic activity go into the economic growth of the Northern Province. This is hardly what we want to see. If the people there must recover, must get back on their feet, you cannot force these false figures and claim to the world that this place has recovered. What do we have there? In the last few days, we have had the Chairman of the Delft Pradeshiya Sabha shot dead, initially said to be a suicide, but now I think it is fairly clear that that is a murder. I regret very much and I would like to offer the condolences of our Party to the family of the bereaved and to the Leader of the EPDP who is here, as well. We regret very much that this has happened.

Along with that incident, there are several other incidents that have happened. Last Monday night, the Deputy Chairman of the Valvettithurai Pradeshiya Sabha, Sathish's house was attacked; on the same night the Chairman of the Karaveddi Pradeshiya Sabha, Viyagesus house was attacked; on Wednesday early hours in the morning, a Pradeshiya Sabha Member of the Chavakachcheri Pradeshiya Sabha, Sriranjans house was attacked. These are TNA Members. The Chairman of the Valikamam West Pradeshiya Sabha of the TNA, Nagaranjani Ayngarans house was attacked; on Thursday, that is yesterday morning, the House of the Minister of Agriculture of the Northern Provincial Council, Ayngaranesans house was attacked; a former Member of Parliament and present Member of the Northern Provincial Council, Mr. Sivajilingams house was visited in the night and a funeral wreath has been

kept on his gate; and another house belonging to a relative of a Northern Provincial Council Member, Arnold, was attacked. Why have all these things happened? Why is this happening? If you say this is the Maaveerar week and these are retaliatory attacks because people are lighting flames to remember their dead, can we accept that? Can we accept this as retaliation, and retaliation by whom? That is a thousand dollar question. Retaliation by whom? Who is retaliating in the Jaffna Peninsula to attack Members of the TNA in this way?

On Thursday morning, a large cut-out which was used during the election campaign of the Northern Province Chief Minister, Hon. Vigneswaran, which was inside the premises in the Uthayan Guest House down Sivagnanasundaram Lane was burnt. Somebody had scaled the wall and lit fire to it. Who are the people who are doing this? Will any Member of the Government answer this? Who is doing it? Why are buildings within this illegal high security zone - there is nothing legal about it; there is no law declaring it to be a high security zone - being destroyed? In any case, there cannot be one now with no existence of a state of emergency. Buildings that have stood for 23 years, even when it was maintained as a high security zone, are being destroyed. The day before yesterday, the famous Vigneswara College was bulldozed to the ground.

Yesterday, an Amman temple and a Pillayar temple were destroyed by bulldozers inside that so-called high security zone. The Chief Minister went to see the place with a priest and he was stopped. He was stopped by the members of the military who have no right to stop him; nor do they have the right to stop anyone going in there. There is no law saying that you cannot proceed beyond that place; not even a gazette notification. So, if the military is stopping the Chief Minister of the Northern Province from proceeding to an area over which he is the Chief Minister, who is ruling that place? Is that not military rule then? I ask responsible Ministers, "How is the Chief Minister prevented from proceeding to an area over which he is declared the Chief Minister?" You boast to the world that you have had elections; you boast to the world that democracy is there in the North and people can elect their Members. But, what can those Members do? A man who was elected with 132,000 preferential votes - such an endorsement of the people - cannot even go to an area in that province and there is no law to stop it, only the military. Is that not classic military rule? If not, how will any Minister describe it? There is no rule of law. Certainly, there is no rule of law because otherwise there would be a law declaring it to be an area that people cannot walk into.

You complain about Cameron. - [Interruption.] I can understand. I am not at odds with you, Hon. Minister. I can understand the hurt feelings. I am fully with you on that. I can understand the hurt feelings. I am only talking about the sense of alienation that the people there feel.

1473 1474

People here feel hurt that a visiting Prime Minister has said these things and gone. I can understand that. But, what do people there feel? They feel that at least somebody has spoken out for them. This is true. You must understand this. You must understand both sides. That is why I am appealing to, at least, the Senior Ministers here to listen to voices of moderation. Why do those people feel like that? They say that their voices are not heard. They say, After all, David Cameron had to come and speak on our behalf. Only when David Cameron spoke the world heard; otherwise, our voices are stifled. We cannot be heard. We are outside. Our houses are there; we lived in those places. We are in refugee camps for 23 years. Why is that? So, I am asking -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) What about the Muslims in refugee camps? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, you must control [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

like this. If you set up -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Why did he speak - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) This is precisely what I am talking about. - [Interruption.] You set up

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

like this to stifle our voices. What is the message you are giving the world? - [Interruption.] I am not even denying -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You say nothing about the Muslims. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I have spoken for the Muslims, Hon. Azwer. You know about that. I have spoken everywhere; I have spoken all over the world about them. - [Interruption.] Please listen to me.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Azwer, sit down. - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Please listen to me. Most recently in Canada, when the diaspora asked me about the Muslims, I said that what happened to the Muslims, in the name of the Tamil people, was an injustice. I said that and I also said that if Tamil people do not agree with what I am saying, I will leave politics and go. I will not change my stand on that. You can watch all my speeches and see. I have never deviated from that position. A grave injustice was committed to the Muslim people. - [Interruption.] There were injustices caused; there were several violations where the Sinhalese people also suffered. I am not denying that; I am saying that all these happened. But, for more than four years after the end of the conflict, why should the people in the North and the East have to suffer all these indignities, even now? Do we not want to put these things behind and go forward together? We are willing to do that. But, my worry is that even the Government and its agents are happier with extremist voices rather than our voices of moderation. That is a very serious issue. I am saying this in this House with all responsibility and I am appealing to the Hon. Members here, who are responsible, please do not allow this country to go down that slope again. We will do our best to prevent that. I give you my assurance, we will do our best. I also appeal to you that you must also do your best in seeing that the extremist forces on either side do not have their way again. Thank you very much.

( ) (Hon. Members) Aye. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Douglas Devananda. [12.29 p.m.] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda - Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the proposed Budget for the year 2014 presented by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa in this august Assembly focuses on an equity-focused inclusive development. This Budget is another milestone in fulfilling the "Ten Year Horizon Development Framework 2006-2016" as envisaged in "Mahinda Chintana - Vision for a New Sri Lanka". It is well-aligned with the Mahinda Chintana vision. While aiming to transform Sri Lanka as a "poverty-free upper middle-income country" with a per capita income of US Dollars 4,000 by 2016, it is also aiming at narrowing the income disparities, both among income earners and geographic regions.

The economic indicators such as the decline in poverty level from 15.2 per cent in 2006 to 6.4 per cent in 2013, the expected economic growth of 7 per cent for the year and 7.5 to 8 per cent in the coming years and the expected 5 to 6 per cent inflation, which is much below the anticipated growth, point towards achieving the objective to make Sri Lanka an emerging Wonder of Asia. The Government has almost achieved the targets set under the Millennium Development Goals.

The noteworthy achievements of the accelerated development programmes such as the Southern Expressway, the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway, the A9 Road, the rehabilitation of national highways and renovation of main irrigation tanks in the Northern Province, the Hambantota Sea Port, the Colombo South Harbour Expansion Project, the expansion of the Bandaranaike International Airport, the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, the extension of train services up to Jaffna, which would become operative by the new year, 2014, the Kilinochchi Grid Substation, the Chunnakam Grid Substation, the Kilinochchi-Chunnakam Transmission Line Project, the Upper Kotmale Hydropower Project, the Norochcholai Coal Power Project, the new Surgical Unit Complex at the Jaffna Teaching Hospital, the construction of 150,000 houses for IDPs, the Achchuveli Industrial Estate, the Nelum Pokuna Cultural Centre, the Jaffna College of Technology et

cetera are indicators that Sri Lanka is transforming into a strategically important economic centre of the world as envisaged in the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future.

The recent statement by Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund - IMF - in Colombo after the conclusion of his visit to Sri Lanka stands testimony to what I stated, which I quote:

In my meetings, I commended the authorities for delivering strong growth, low inflation, fiscal consolidation, and a strengthening of the external accounts since the end of the war in 2009, as well as on the ambitious growth and development objectives laid out in the Mahinda Chintana. Sri Lanka has also held up its solid economic performance in the face of recent adverse external conditions.

In spite of the fact that the economy has proven its resilience despite the challenges and obstacles faced in the aftermath of ending the prolonged conflict and in the midst of external vulnerabilities, my Parliamentary Colleagues from the North have condemned the Budget. In their speeches in Parliament, they have stated that the Budget is of no use to the people of the North and the East.

Sir, let me enlighten my electoral Colleagues, who either do not understand the contents of the Budget Proposals fully or pretend to do so, that of the Budgetary allocation to the provincial councils, the Northern Provincial Council has been allocated a sum of Rs. 5,831 million for development activities in the year 2014. This is the highest out of the allocations of all the nine provincial councils in the country, which is about 18 per cent of the total allocation for development activities in all the provinces in the country. The Western Province, which is the hub of economic activities of the country, has been allocated only a sum of Rs. 2,755 million while the Southern Province has been allocated the lowest with Rs. 2,095 million because they have their own revenue collection. Even in terms of per capita allocation to the provincial councils, the Northern Province stands on the top at Rs. 16,369 while the per capita allocation to most of the other provincial councils work out to be far below Rs. 10,000.

This is a clear indication of addressing regional disparities by transforming lagging regions into regions of prosperity and broadening development frontiers. The recently held and successfully concluded CHOGM, particularly the Commonwealth Business Forum, with a large number of participants from across the globe, is another achievement of the Government in attracting foreign entrepreneurs to invest, which would benefit the country as a whole, including the North and East. However, due to the actions of the TNA, the North and the East could not reap the full benefit of the CHOGM.

Recently, we had the District Coordinating Committee Meetings for the Jaffna and Kilinochchi Districts. Unfortunately, TNA Parliamentarians, Provincial

1477 1478

Councillors and other Members did not participate in the Meeting. Had they participated, they would have come to know the amount of money the Government has spent for the development of these districts since the end of conflict.

The Progress Reports presented by the District Secretaries -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Why did the people vote for you? ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) You mean, for me? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) You are the Government - ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) What I am trying to say is, if they had participated in the District Coordinating Committee Meetings, they would have known the amount of money that has been allocated and been spent.

The Progress Reports presented by the District Secretaries of Jaffna and Kilinochchi have revealed incredible sums of money being spent for the development of these districts since 2009 and the resultant astounding achievements. For example, the fish production in Jaffna has reached about 28,000 metric tons per annum, which is higher than the fish production in the pre-1983 period, which was about 24,000 metric tons.

According to their presentations, staggering amounts of Rs. 71,293 million and Rs. 32, 347 million have been spent and earmarked for spending before the end of this year for the development of the Jaffna and Kilinochchi Districts respectively since the end of the conflict. It is evident from these Progress Reports that the mega infrastructure development drive geared towards these districts has resulted in yielding enhanced productivity and contributed towards the GDP of the country.

The Government has also spent huge sums for the Mullaitivu, Vavuniya and Mannar Districts as well during the same period. The TNA Parliamentarians and the Chief Minister for the North have indicated that they did not wish to participate at the DCC meeting because the Chief Minister had been appointed only as the co-Chairman; instead he should have been appointed as the Chairman.

Either they are talking without knowing the instructions of the Government circular in this regard or are saying so to deceive the people as they usually do.

They have also stated that His Excellency the President, in the letter of appointment of the co-Chair, had requested to adhere to the principles embodied in the Mahinda Chintana while conducting DCC meetings; hence they would not take part in DCC meetings.

I wish to make them understand that the Mahinda Chintana is not a dogmatic piece of writing. The Mahinda Chintana: Vision for a New Sri Lanka is the economic policy framework of the Government which is a 10-year development programme tabled in Parliament in November, 2005 along with the Budget for 2006. This is a national policy document which is the subject matter of the centre, as stated in the Reserved List of the Thirteenth Amendment, which every person who has taken oath under the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution will have to adhere to, so that they would discharge their functions in accordance with the Constitution.

In the same breath, I wish to inform the TNA Members, inside and outside this House, that the Provincial Council system is the outcome of sacrifices of many; irrespective of who is in power, we have to safeguard and strengthen it. Your statements, speeches and actions should not hinder the smooth functioning of this system.

Let me also add that this is a Budget for the people who realize that there are no easy answers to problems built up over many years. It is just painstaking work of putting right what went wrong so badly. Together with the people, we are slowly but surely fixing our countrys economic problems. Our goal is to build a modern reformed state we can afford, bringing business to our shores with competitive taxes, fixing the banks and thereby improving our schools, our skills, our infrastructure and our industry.

Before I conclude, Sir, I wish to bring to the notice of the House that I have requested His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa to draw up more special programmes to provide a meaningful livelihood to the rehabilitated

youths and for the large number of differently-abled people that the war has produced. I also have requested His Excellency to allocate more funds to the war-affected areas. His Excellency has agreed to my request.

I am sure that under the effective leadership and enigmatic charisma of His Excellency the President, who is also the driving force of the "Mahinda Chintana", the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Minister of Economic Development and the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr. P.B. Jayasundara, the prosperity of the country is not far away.

Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. R. Yogarajan. You have 30 minutes. Before that, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Janaka Bandara to the Chair?

.. ( ) ( .. - , ) (The Hon. D.M. Jayaratne - Prime Minister, Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs) I propose that the Hon. Janaka Bandara do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

, .

, , . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair,and THE HON. JANAKA BANDARA took the Chair. [12.47 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Presiding Member, I am pleased to participate in this Budget Debate but before I get on to the issues in the Budget itself, I wish to say a few things as a moderate Tamil in this country.

During the CHOGM, universities were closed for over a week because you did not want the youth to protest against the waste of money on CHOGM. But, this shutdown of universities continued in the Northern Province or in the University of Jaffna for a further period, until the 27th of November, 2013. This was designed to see that the Maaveerar Day was not observed by the people in the North.

1481 1482

When the Hon. S. Shritharan referred to Prabhakaran on Maaveerar Day and when the Hon. Suresh Premachandran was speaking, there were several people in this House on your side, the Government side, to protest and speak against it. The Hon. S.B. Dissanayake and the Hon. Lakshman Seneviratne had taken objection to what was stated here. I was not able to listen to the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, but I did hear the Hon. Lakshman Seneviratne. He was very much perturbed by what they said. Anyway, I would leave that alone. I will talk only about this Maaveerar Day.

The objection to observation of the Maaveerar Day comes because there is no real reconciliation that has taken place in this country. The Tamil people - [Interruption.] Please listen to me; please listen to our moderate voice and before I finish speaking, I will give you one minute. Let me finish speaking.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Let the Hon. Member speak. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) There is no real reconciliation between the two communities, the Tamil-speaking people and the Sinhalese people, in this country. That is why you are misunderstanding. You are seeing ghosts in thin air. What I am saying is that the people are commemorating Maaveerar Day because it has become a tradition for over 20 years in the North to remember those dead in the war, during this particular day.

We have to move towards genuine reconciliation. For that, we have to understand each other. The whole world is advising us to do so. But, the Government wants to perpetuate the differences between the communities so that they can build the senses of the people to continue to remember the 30-year misadventure in this country and because you ended the war, you could use it for your political purposes.

Elaborate efforts were made to see that Maaveerar Day was not observed. The police continuously spoke about not glorifying the LTTE -

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Are you condoning terrorism? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I am not condoning terrorism. - [Interruption.] Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, you are a good Friend of

mine. I told you, before I finish speaking, I will spare one minute for you.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! Hon. Yogarajan, you carry on. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) So, a lot of effort was made to stop this. These were all veiled threats against ordinary people. Why do you not look at the observance of the Maaveerar Day as a mere commemoration of the dead people? That is all. It is not to revive terrorism or separatism in this country but it is only to remember the dead. Each individual who was killed in the war, whether combatants or innocent civilians or bystanders, is somebody's relative. All those people are considering those dead as a father, a husband, a brother, a mother, a wife or a sister. So, they wish to commemorate their deaths, remember them and shed a few tears on their behalf. Even a man who is hanged for a murder, though considered by the society as a criminal, is mourned by his family. When a man is hanged, after the hanging, the dead body is always given to the family to perform the last rites. Do we condemn the criminal and not allow the family to mourn his death? No, we do hand over the body to the family. So, this is the concept of grieving which you must permit the Tamil people to practise. They have to commemorate their -

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Abeygunawardana) , . ?

( ) (The Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Yogarajan, you carry on with your speech.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The people in the North must be allowed commemorate the dead.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Presiding Member, I never said anything that is supportive of terrorism.

I am talking about honouring the dead only; how they died is a separate question. - [Interruption.] You say that the young people were misled into joining the LTTE. A

misled person - [Interruption.]. I will talk about the waththa. You sit down. - [Interruption.] You have stated in this House that the youth of the North were sometimes misled into joining the LTTE. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) , . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Being a member of the LTTE if he dies, the family has the right to mourn that person, just like I said a person who is hung for a crime he committed, is allowed a proper funeral. Similarly, they should have the right to mourn. -[Interruption.] These people should be allowed to commemorate their dead at least by lighting a lamp in their memory and cry at their grave site. But, all such grave sites and memorials have been bulldozed by this Government and police stations or army camps have been built on them as an act of vengeance. - [Interruption.] Since the people cannot individually commemorate their dead, they do it as a community on the 26th of November, which has been set aside for remembering the dead for over two decades. Maybe, it was fixed by the Tigers and it happens to be Prabhakarans birthday. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Can I ask one question? Please tell - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You may say that I am glorifying Prabhakaran when I say this. You may blame me. - [Interruption.] Prabhakaran, instead of celebrating his birthday, used his birthday to remember the dead. He sacrificed his birthday for it. So, I do not see how this can be a wrong thing. - [Interruption.]

Okay, let us say this should not be done on this day because it happens to be Prabhakarans birthday and it was initially designated as Maaveerar Day by the LTTE. Maybe to address the sensitivity of your Government, we can change the day to 19th May. Instead of celebrating this day as Victory Day, let all the peoples of Sri Lanka come together and commemorate the dead from both sides, not only both sides but even those innocent people who were killed in the crossfire. We will remember all of them who died during the 30-year war on the 19th of May by making the 19th of May a remembrance day and not Victory Day for one community or one group of people. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Yogarajan, do you condone what the Hon. Sritharan said? Why are you not answering that?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I did not listen to him. - [Interruption.] Only when we do this, the hurt of the Tamil people when the Government celebrates the 19th of May as Victory Day, would be wiped out. - [Interruption.] Why not we all get together on the 19th of May to commemorate all those who died, so that we can get together as one nation, as one people in this country instead of calling ourselves several peoples of this country?

I will now get on to the issues that I want to bring up today.

Sir, in the Budget the Hon. Minister of Finance read out something regarding plantation housing. In the Sinhala version, it is stated that a lot of development has been done for them though the Ministry of Estate Infrastructure has been abolished and he says to provide housing to these people -

, 2014 - 20 :

1485 1486

" 50,000 . . 750 750 . "

You see, in the Sinhala version, you are talking about 50,000 thattu nivasa - that is, flat-type houses - and within that, you are saying that you are going to borrow US Dollars 1,500 million. It is not for building these houses alone, it is for all your financial needs in the next year that you are borrowing. I do not know why this was inserted into this. That is one matter.

The second matter is this. Though the Sinhala version states this, the Tamil version states a different thing.

"

." In the Tamil version, it states, there will be "housing complexes" and not, thattu niwasa. That is a bit different. The English version states, I quote:

Hence, I propose to construct housing complexes with 50,000 housing units to replace poor quality housing available in the plantation sector.

So, I wish to ask the Government, whether it is thattu nivasa or housing complexes? - [Interruption.] The people in upcountry plantation areas wish to have, not line-room houses, but separate houses - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Yogarajan, do not talk about the upcountry people. The Hon. Thondaman is there to look after them.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) If he was looking after - [Interruption.] Come on! Hon. Sajin De Vaas Gunawardena, you are bent on disturbing me.

Sir, the Government has to clarify this issue about the upcountry houses. Meanwhile, I wish to tell how deeply they feel against these flat-type houses in the plantations. It is like this. On Thursday evening, the Budget was presented. Then, on Saturday morning I participated at a public function in Hatton. - The Upcountry Graduates' Society in Hatton came and gave me a handbill, where they have totally opposed the

construction of " " - that is, flat-type houses for the plantation people.

The plantation people want to live in separate houses. This is their desire and this has been recommended and asked for, not only by the people but also by specialists who have gone into the issues of the plantation people. Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga appointed a committee under Mr. Gunapala to go into the issues of the plantation people. I have an extract of the Report of this Committee. As a result of this Committee, the Ministry of Livestock Development and Estate Infrastructure was created as an affirmative action to provide services to the people in the plantations. But, your Government abolished that ministry. However, the Report of the Gunapala Committee states under "Housing and Sanitation", I quote:

The vesting of ownership, of a minimum of 10 perches of land with credit facilities, with each family that wishes to build a house, will release tremendous initiatives, as has been already demonstrated. It is recommended that Settlement formation be decided as a long term policy and based on such settlements, housing and land ownership be transferred to the occupants. The settlement formation includes common services that would be provided by government. In deciding on the settlements, the wishes of the residents and the long term plantation needs for industrial housing should be taken into consideration.

However, there should not be a rigid policy of imposing the same form of housing on all families as the needs and capacities vary widely

So, this was the opinion of the expert committee, headed by Mr. Gunapala in which Professor Hettige, Mr. K. Marimuthu were Members. So, I suggest that the expert' opinion also be considered.

Further, I presented to this House last year - the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa may remember; he did respond to me that day - about the World University Service of Canada did a perception survey among the workers in the plantations. One perception was with regard to the workers' work environment. The Executive Summary of this Report states that, "...some of the main findings relate to workers significant interest and concern regarding the profitability and productivity of the tea and rubber industries. As estate residents, the majority of the study participants had worked on the estates for over twenty years and expressed a sense of ownership and responsibility for the estate to do well". The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa is aware of this, because when he went to Galaha for an occasion and asked the people there, What do you want? they said, Give us fertilizers for the estates. They did not ask anything for themselves. They wanted to protect and sustain those estates.

Similarly, there is another part in that survey. The Executive Summary of this Report further states , "In terms of the non-work environment, the main priority raised throughout the study was the workers desire for

1487 1488

[ . ]

2013 29

separate housing. The majority of workers in the study strongly supported prioritizing the issue of separate housing on the estate. Another popular issue was quality of childrens education."

So, when the people desire separate houses, why are you trying to give them only flats or upstair houses? Last year, I raised this issue in this House and said that the workers have the capacity to build their own houses. I said We are offering to build them by ourselves. Please do not stand in our way. Give us land; we will build our houses. Then, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa interrupted me and said, Okay, we will give you ten blocks. You take the challenge; build the houses and show and then we could proceed. I accepted that challenge and said, You give us the land. I will come to you. You can inform the company to give the land. I will build the houses and show and after that you can open it out to the greater majority. So, the Government, represented by the Hon. Minister of Economic Development, agreed in this House, that this can be an experiment and it could work.

Then, a few days later, the Hon. Earl Gunasekara, Deputy Minister of Plantation Industries who spoke in this House said:

" , 7 . , , ."

So, the Government said that there is going to be a policy to give them separate houses. But, this has not been done so far. So, it is a serious issue that we want you to look into and attend to. - [Interruption.] In support of this separate houses, the Minister of Labour and Labour Relations brought a law that allows a person who is a member of the EPF to withdraw one-third of the amount he has saved for the purpose of building a house. With this assistance, if the land is released - and as the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena says, the Government has allocated money for building houses - please give it to these people to build a house that they like; instead of giving upstair houses for these people, give them separate houses that they would like. - [Interruption.] So, what is the difficulty? - [Interruption.] I will tell you why you are finding it so difficult.- [Interruption.] You believe that thousands of acres of land is going to be taken for housing.- [Interruption.] I will explain, Hon. Sajin de Vas Gunawardena. At seven perches, it will be only 4,375 acres that will be required. If it is ten perches, according to "Mahinda Chintana" - where we have seven perches for a house and three perches for common facilities - then, it would be 6,375 acres.- [Interruption.] When it is only 6,375 acres, it is not a big amount compared to the 600,000 acres that are used -

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) There is a point of Order, being raised by the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena. Hon. Member, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) , . . point . . - he is creating racial violence.

( ) (The Presiding Member) It is not a point of Order. He is putting you a question. What is your answer?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I do not want to answer him just because he interrupts.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Why do you not answer him? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Why should I? But, at the same time, I was not present in the House when he spoke - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, please do not take his time. It is his last minute.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is only a question of over 6,000 acres.- [Interruption.] This Government announced last year that they have 37,000 hectares to be taken from the estates and distributed among the people. So, if you have 37,000 hectares to distribute among the people why can you not give 7,000 acres for these people to build their own houses?

1489 1490

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) What is the difficulty? Is it because the people in Nuwara Eliya, who voted for your Party and gave you 11 Seats should be given this negative gift or is it because you got 11 Seats in the Nuwara Eliya District but only two of your people got elected and nine Tamil Members from the CWC and NUW got elected, that you want to take revenge on these Tamil people in the Nuwara Eliya District? Is that why you are trying to give these upstair houses to these people? Please reconsider your policy and grant them separate houses. We are not against you; we only plead that you give us separate houses.- [Interruption.] ( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you. The Hon. Dilan Perera, please. ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon.

Even though I considered the Hon. R. Yogarajan as a very respectful, moderate Tamil politician, unfortunately, I have to unwillingly change the attitude I had towards him, today. What he did was, very diplomatically and very shrewdly, he aroused the feelings of both the communities to a very low level of racial attitude.

Hon. Yogarajan, you have helped me in my elections. When I was contesting for the Southern Provincial Council, you came to Galle, you took me to all the kovils, you had meetings for me but today, I am confused as to who you represent in this House. Is it the estate polity, is it the Northern polity, is it the Colombo polity or is it yourself? You did not have the courage to answer the question that I asked you. The question that I asked you was, "Do you condone the statement made by the Hon. S. Shritharan that Prabhakaran is a martyr, and the murders that Prabhakaran committed were not only in the Sinhala community and other communities but even in the Tamil community?" Show me one Tamil leader who had great potential in going forward in politics in this country, who is among the living today. Did we kill them? No, they were killed by Prabhakaran. Therefore, I hope that you will have the courage and the wisdom - I choose my words very carefully, "the courage and the wisdom" - to answer my question in time to come.

Offer/proposal to the LTTE I refer to our telephone conversation today. The proposal to the LTTE on how to release the civilian population now trapped in the LTTE controlled area has been transmitted to the LTTE through several channels. So far there has regrettably been no response from the LTTE and it does not seem to be likely that the LTTE will agree to this in the near future.
