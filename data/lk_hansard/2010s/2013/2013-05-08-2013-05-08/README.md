Hon. Deputy Speaker, while speaking on these Regulations that are under discussion in this House today, I must initially say that the great development revolution which is taking place during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime has never taken place in the annals of this

2185 2186

2013 08

country. It is a new country that is emerging now in the Indian Ocean after all the troubles and tribulations that the Government underwent for the last 30 years of the war. Even America is surprised, Japan is surprised, Germany, England and all the developed countries are amazed as to how we have turned around from such a disaster to become one of the most prosperous and wonderland in Asia.

When you relate that story, we just cannot forget the name of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, for he is the person who is pushing ahead the economic development or economic revival of this country. All the roads, all the bridges, all the schools, all the hospitals and all other developments, including restoration of tanks have been achieved and everything for irrigation, including water facilities, are provided. Water is given as it has never happened in the history to all parts of the country, including Jaffna. The other day, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Minister of Water Supply and Drainage and Chief Government Whip, visited Jaffna. This is the great Economic Recovery story; this is the story of marvel; this is the story that generations afterwards could talk about what Sri Lanka has achieved.

It is only the other day the High Commissioner of India was in Jaffna. He has won the hearts of every Jaffna citizen, nay, every citizen of this country for he helped us in the development of this country, obtaining necessary assistance from India. Whatever obstacles that we may have faced in South India, the North is not bothered about that at all. They gave all the assistance and this High Commissioner was the power behind to get all those assistance for the development schemes launched in this country.

Now, for instance, Sir, we are talking about the railway. The Regulations under the Motor Traffic Act is also being taken up today and the Hon. Kumara Welgama, Minister of Transport spoke a little while ago. Who is he? He is also a marvellous worker, an astonishing worker and the poor mans man who can hang on in a train, not sit in a seat comfortably and travel with the passengers. He goes right round the country in trains and buses most unassumingly.

Now, Sir, we must not forget this fact. The international community must be told this over and over again. Why the Opposition, the UNP is hiding this, I do not know. My good Friend, the Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa is also walking in now. We are going to have a railway line to Beliatta which we never had earlier. The Hon. Minister is opening the reconstructed Medawachchiya to Madhu railway line on the 20th and even Mr. Ashok K. Kantha, the High Commissioner of India will be there.

What happened to those railway tracks? It is the LTTE terrorists who removed all the sleepers - -

and put up their bunkers in order to kill our soldiers; our people. This is why we are against them. They killed and destroyed the Tamil community. That is a fact. They destroyed the younger generation of the Tamil community. It was genocide by the Tamil terrorists against the Tamils virtually. Initially, that is what happened. After that, they came to Kattankudi and massacred the innocent Muslims who were worshipping there in the Kattankudi Mosque.

; . . ? Railway lines . - - . ; I must raise one pertinent question.

Has the Hon. Leader of the Opposition ever condemned the atrocities committed by those who killed the UNP leaders? Now, he is going and sitting with them comfortably. What politics is this? The LTTE killed all our leaders. [Interruption.] Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, you do not know because you came recently. They killed Muslims and they also killed former President R. Premadasa, a former Minister, the Hon. Lalith Athulathmudali, a former Minister, Hon. Gamini Dissanayake, a former Minister, the Hon. Ranjan Wijeratne, the Chairman and the General Secretary of the United National Party. Now, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the present Leader of the Opposition, is finding it comfortable to sit with those terrorists.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

, . It is a shameful act which has never happened in any part of the civilized world.

Sir, not only that, I must tell one thing. Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe goes to Mannar and says, "Are the Muslim Ministers and the Members of Parliament of the Government worshipping Makkah or Medamulana?" This is an anti-religious remark. There were one or two Muslims who went with him to Mannar. Could they have not corrected him? This is the knowledge the Leader of the Opposition is having about Islam. It is a shame! How can the Muslims in this country support such a Leader of the Opposition - the rank and file must be told. Sir, we, the Muslims, according to the Holy Quran, worship only Allah - Allah Subhanahu wa Taala. "La-ilaha-illallah Muhammadur-Rasulullah". They do not worship anybody else except Allah. He does not know even that. We do not even pray to Mecca. We pray in the direction of Mecca to our Creator - the Almighty God. He does not know these basics. Earlier, he was talking about the Sinhalese history and put his foot in his mouth. The same thing he did when he talked about Korales, He messed up

2187 2188

that korale and this korale. .

I say in this House with responsibility that if the Leader of the Opposition wants the Muslims to support him, at least, he should recognize and respect the aspirations of Islam and the Muslim community. He must ask for forgiveness from the Muslim community here because he becomes an Apostate. You know the verdict given to Salman Rushdie and Taslima Nasrin because of such talks. Salman Rushdie and Taslima Nasrin were given death sentences because they were declared Apostates for defiling Islam and the Holy Prophet. Are we to give the same judgement here? I am asking you this question. This is sheer ridiculousness

What has happened? " . ." Todays newspapers say. . . . . . , . . . . . . . , " Party " . . Party . .

I must pay a tribute and compliment in this House to His Excellency Ashok K. Kantha, the Indian High Commissioner, because he has done a great service as never done by any other High Commissioner or diplomat for our country. See the economic recovery. I must also say that there will be a railway line from Medawachchiya to Talaimannar which we are going to start with Indian assistance in December. Then, there will be other railway lines from Vavuniya to Kilinochchi in August, and Kilinochchi to KKS in September. KKS . . ? Who destroyed the Northern railways; who destroyed the Tamil economy in this country? It is their own people who took up arms. The late Hon. Chelvanayakam said, "I believe in peaceful sathyagraha." These people took up arms and even killed their own politicians such as Hon. A. Amirthalingam and Hon. V. Yogeswaran, Hon. (Dr.) Neelan Thiruchelvam and several other Members of Parliament of that Party.

Then, Sir, there is a railway line from Kilinochchi to KKS. . Power sets have been bought from the Rites Company of India, and from China. This is to develops the economy backed by our able, estimable and amiable Minister of Economic Development, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa. In fact, we have bought - - Power Sets from SIFAN Company of Japan.

You have to climb up the mountain range there. , . , . Power Sets , .

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) You must compile a new dictionary. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Yes, there are so much of things to say. You must compile a new dictionary. That is what the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa is saying. , what you say is right. We must compile a new dictionary - a new glossary - for Sri Lanka; a new encyclopedia for Sri Lanka in order to show America, Germany, Japan, Saudi Arabia and the powerful countries the economic revival we have achieved. So, I ask the Hon. Swaminathan, "What rubbish are you talking?" You are from a very cultured and respected family. I know the contribution of your forefathers towards the revival of the economy and for national unity. Are you not ashamed of the things that have happened to your people there? Even if you do not condemn, you had better look the other side, I would say.

Then, Sir, Mr. Ashok K. Kantha, the outgoing Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka has done so much than anyone has done before. Today, our Hon. Speaker hosted him to lunch and Hon. Deputy Speaker, you were also present there. What a parting assembly it was - choked with emotion! Our Hon. Minister of Transport said a short while ago, We are more sorry that he is leaving. Actually, we need him to be here much more than before. Today, he said that he will be in the South Block in Delhi and that he will continue to take an interest in the development of this country and do whatever possible as he did while he was here and continue to do the same while being there.

Then, Sir, the Kelani Valley - . . . . " " . " - " . Now, this railway line has been widened. It goes up to Avissawella now, and it will be extended up to Padukka very soon. All feasibility reports are ready. As I told you, Sir, the first stage of the Southern Railway development will be from Matara to Beliatta - we have brought Chinese equipment for that and the CMEC Company has already come. The second stage will be from Beliatta to Hambantota and the third stage will be from Hambantota to Kataragama. " " . railway line .

" - " - I ask the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the United National Party, are you condoning that? Shariah - - as I told you before is the law of Almighty Allah. It is drawn from the Holy Quran. It has been described in Al-Quran. Sir, I do not want to take your time by reading that.

This is the way they treat the Divine law. This is the way they are insulting the Shariah law.

", " . , . . . . Are these the calibre of people who are in the UNP Opposition benches today? , , . . - . . . He must ask for forgiveness.

I must also say that the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake blamed His Excellency Abdulaziz bin Abdul-Rahman Al Jammaz, the Saudi Arabian Ambassador here. In fact, the Saudi Arabian Ambassador has helped us a lot. Our President wrote thrice to King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al-Saud regarding this matter. Sir, people from Indonesia, Bangladesh and from other Muslim countries are all employed in Saudi Arabia. If such Muslim countries desist from meting out the Shariah law, I think all those Governments must resign. You have to bring in No-Confidence Motions against all the Ministers of those countries.

The Hon. Dilan Perera sent a high-powered delegation to Dawadmi in Saudi Arabia under the Governor, S. Alavi Moulana, which met the tribal leaders there. I was also there. Anyway, Sir, it was a full measure of confidence that was expressed on the Hon. Dilan Perera yesterday in this House.

We were very happy. I must tell you that from yesterday, the Government of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa became further strong in this House and in this country. There were also certain tremors in certain areas.

" ; ''

" ' ' . .

. Signal , . , . " , " . . ... . .

I must tell that the Hon. A.L.M. Athaullah is one person who was at the risk of his life at that time when the war was waging fiercely. He is the person who stood up and said I will not support the merger of the North and East. That is the Hon. A.L.M. Athaullah. You must understand the history of this country. I used to cross words with the late Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff everyday in this House; I did not agree with his politics. But, he did one great service. Prabhakaran invited to join him. He said, Come, let us join to merge the North and East; we will achieve the Eelam that we want thereafter. The late Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff was with him. He said,

, . . As the Hon. Prime Minister said yesterday, three-fourths of the Muslims are living in the South, from here to Hambantota, in the Polonnaruwa District, Kegalle District, Anuradhapura District and every district. The late Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff said, "In every Pradeshiya Sabha area a Muslim is living, there is a mosque; there is a madrasa; there is a Ahadiya school. So, I will not join you. What happened? Those terrorists, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam went after him and they wanted to murder him at Maruthamune. His beloved mother, Mrs. Madheena Umma was there. He said Good bye, mummy! I am going. He took the trunk and came to Batticaloa and he was not able to get a seat in a compartment. He was travelling up to Colombo on footboard. He told us, I have the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. He came to Colombo and stayed with one of my friends, Mr. Hafeef Deen at Grandpass. He used to come to, , at Layards Broadway . . . That was Mr. Ashraff. I must today pay a great tribute to him, Sir, he had done one of the greatest national services. If he had joined Prabhakaran at that time, just imagine what would have happened? What would have happened to the Muslims there? What would have happened to us? They would have formed an Eelam. But, he did not pave the way for it; he did not give in at all to Prabhakaran. He came here sacrificing everything in life. I only want these things to be told and educated the younger Muslim generations; the siblings of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and the Muslims at large in the country.

Yesterday, the "Sudar Oli" newspaper has given a very good report. What is that? The Hon. Sumanthiran states,

2191 2192

" , ; ".

' ' . The other day all the newspapers criticized me and I was called a traitor to the Muslim Community. Why? I asked questions from the Hon. Sampanthan, the Leader of the TNA when he was speaking, I said, "You are saying that there is no security for Muslims. Rubbish! My foot! Rubbish! Who killed the Muslims? It is your own Tigers. Who killed your own leaders? Your own Tigers. Now, you are shedding crocodile tears for Muslims".

There is a saying in Tamil : "The goat is getting wet in the rain and the wolf is saying, "Brother come here, come here; there is shade here; there is shelter here". That is the sort of crocodile tears that he was shedding.

Sir, I also told, "You had better ask forgiveness from the Muslim community before you ask for any sort of safety and security for them". That security is there. Our Government has assured that. The Muslim countries in the world are with our President Mahinda Rajapaksa. That is why out of 15 countries, eight voted for Sri Lanka in Geneva. The other day, all Muslim Ambassadors came and saw the President at the Presidential Secretariat and exchanged views. They were very happy to have met the President, they told us later.

Sir, I would like to mention that wisdom has dawned on the Hon. Sumanthiran.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Thank you very much. Please wind up.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I will conclude, Sir.

He says, it was wrong to have driven the Muslims from Jaffna. If that is so, let the Hon. Sumanthiran openly say it and I challenge him to say it in this House. What was done to the Muslims in Jaffna? You drew away 75,000 people including mothers, little boys and girls. The Muslim women were without their purdah and without sufficient clothing to wear. They were half-naked. This is how you treated the Muslim community in this country. You talk about Muslim safety. When I said this, some newspapers published news items stating that I am against the Muslims. No, I am for the Muslims. From first to last, I am for the Muslims. His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa has assured me that I could talk about the Muslims and their rights and I am here to do that - Insha Allah!

Thank you very much, Hon. Deputy Speaker.
