You have not yet tabled that Report. Once it is tabled and one month is gone - Otherwise you must amend Standing Order No. 78A. You can bring a resolution next week or week after to amend Standing Order No. 78A. That is another option. But, unfortunately, I have got a problem on that because today I found that the Leader of the House has stated to the \"Daily News\" that the Standing Orders cannot be amended retroactively. I am about to say that you can do it retroactively but he has said that it cannot be amended retroactively. All I am saying is there are different solutions.- [Interruption.] Let us see.

Then, the Government said that they are not and that they were bringing this in. Then, we expected today, before you took this up, Hon. Speaker, that they would have brought a Motion to suspend that part of the Standing Order No. 78A (1) which required one months time after reporting. So, if they did not bring that in, we cannot be blamed. I cannot do that job. Once they did not do it, we got up and raised the point of Order. If you had brought it, then there would have been a debate on it. Then, we would have debated that and debated this also. We have nothing against it. What we are only saying is that you cannot proceed without suspending that part of the Standing Order because as I said earlier, Hon. Speaker, the whole question was, when was it printed? We all know that it was printed at the Government Press. How it is written is another mystery. But, the question is, what is reporting and what is tabling? And, we must go by what the Hon. Tissa Attanayake has said as to what \"tabling\" is, unless the Standing Orders say, it can be circulated. That is why the COPE Reports have to be tabled here and that is why the PAC Reports have to be tabled here. That is what we are doing. Now, if you did not want to give one months time and if you wanted to shorten it, you had an option. This House could have suspended that relevant portion of the Standing Orders. All we are telling you is, we are trying to show a way forward for you but you are shouting at us. We are trying to show you a way forward. -[Interruption.] Ah! You do not want to go forward. That means, you do not want this Motion. Hon. Basil Rajapaksa does not want to go forward. That means he does not want the Motion. - [Interruption.] - But, we are trying to find a way forward as to how this can be taken up. t ( ) (The Hon. Arundika Fernando) . . rose.

Similarly, if it is deemed advisable to restrict the scope of the inquiry or to limit the Committees powers, an instruction may be given to the Committee requiring it to refrain from considering the matter.

If you felt that you did not want to go beyond five charges, you should have come to this House and got permission to restrict it to five. There were 117 Members who had signed it. The Committee has no right. This is the right of the 117 Members plus the right of the House because we are exercising judicial power. We have to look at all the charges to decide - even if she is guilty of one or two - whether we are going to remove her or not. If it is about eight charges or nine charges, yes, there is a case. Otherwise, it will not be. You have not gone into it. You are telling us to exercise judicial power leaving virtually nine issues in suspension without telling us and one is a very important one, Hon. Speaker, which is about the Divineguma. Does her Ruling on Divineguma amount to a misbehaviour? If so, shall we also bring resolutions against other two Judges, Dep and Wanasundera. You do not even answer it. The most important issue that the Speaker has raised is unanswered. If you have issued a report, it must be for the whole. We gave you a mandate for 14 charges. If you cannot give us answers for the 14 charges as to \"yes\" or \"no\", or if there is not enough evidence, then it is not a report. The charge sheet contained 14 issues. If you have not taking up all 14 and if you cannot answer nine of them, then it is not a complete report by any means for us to go into. That is the basic point that my Hon. Friend has been taking up and you all have not confirmed. Tell us under what basis you decided that these nine are not - [Interruption.] That means, you are saying that the 117 Members who signed it did not know what they were doing. They have signed for nine charges without knowing - [Interruption.] Anyway, at the end of it there is no report. So, how can we proceed if there is no report as was intended. That is not our fault. If you have a full report we will go into it.",

One of the basic principles of natural justice is total impartiality and detachment, and there must be a clear public recognition that that is the case. In the famous case of Pinochet, which all of us have heard about, the English Court of Appeal gave the same reason: if the courts get involved in this, how can they be seen as not being biased?

We will not exercise any form of jurisdiction in respect of this matter because this belongs to the domain of the Legislature. So, they declined jurisdiction. Unfortunately, Sir, the opposite was done by the courts of Sri Lanka.

That is the plain effect of Article 125 and my learned Friend is absolutely correct in asserting that. However, there is a very clear difference between interpretation and legislation. Interpretation requires the court to construe the language that is used in a statute and to attribute to the language that is used, the plain meaning of the words. Interpretation does not go so far as to allow the court to delete, to expunge from statute law any words that are used in it nor is the court entitled, on the basis of interpretation, to add to the language that is used in a statute.",

I refer to the proceedings in respect of the late Chief Justice, Neville Samarakoon. In that case, Sir, there were two Select Committees. The function of the first Select Committee was very limited. It was simply to ascertain whether the Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon had made a speech at Sinnathurai Commercial Tutory. That was a question of fact - had he made that speech or not?

If we get into this situation of allowing the Supreme Court, under the guise of interpretation, to take away whole chunks of the statute law of this country, then we are up against a very dangerous situation in which the very phrase statutory interpretation becomes a total misnomer. That is not interpretation at all. That is lawmaking. Lawmaking can be done only by one organ of the State and that is the Legislature.

Indeed, that is expressly recognized by the Supreme Court in the last page of its judgment.

These are powers which Parliament enjoys not for their own sake but as an instrument of service to the people of Sri Lanka. The whole basis of the law relating to Privilege is that these rights are necessary for the elected representatives of the people to discharge their functions with acceptance. Without those powers and rights, the representatives of the people will find themselves without the authority that they need properly to discharge their functions. This is the practical importance of the concept of Privilege.

It is also of even greater importance to acknowledge the dangers that are inherent in allowing this kind of encroachment because if it is allowed once, then it will happen again and again in the future. Up to now, there was no precedent, whatsoever, which enabled the courts to do what they have done on this occasion. The entire body of precedent, the cursus curiae is entirely against that. Now, we have a radical departure from that and for the first time - and this is nothing short of a constitutional heresy - the courts have exercised their power under the prerogative writs, in this case a Writ of Certiorari, to quash - to deprive of legal effect - a proceeding within the precincts of Parliament. It is something that no court has ever contemplated in the United Kingdom, in Australia, in Canada in this country or anywhere else. So, we have to be mindful of what is implied in that departure from established principles. I would ask you, Sir, to do everything in our power - I think we all collectively need to discharge that obligation - to ensure that the public in this country are made aware of what is involved in this situation. We must do everything that is in the power of all of us to safeguard what is of inherent value in what we have inherited from those who have gone before us and we are equally bound to hand it down in its pristine integrity to those who will come after us.",

That is common. But, in this case, our Supreme Court has not done even that.
