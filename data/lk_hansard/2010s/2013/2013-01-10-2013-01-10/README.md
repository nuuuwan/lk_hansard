( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition)

Hon. Speaker, can I help you on this matter?

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Yes.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Firstly, I would like remind the House that we are sitting in a judicial capacity. So, we should maintain the dignity. We all can argue out. The Hon. Members can reply to what I say. But, I do not think - if we say that Parliament is supreme - that we should behave in the manner we were doing a few minutes ago. I have my points; you may not agree but let the Leader of the House and others reply to me. To help you, Mr. Speaker, I will start off with Standing Order No. 78A (1) which states, I quote:

..the Speaker shall entertain such resolution and place it on the Order Paper of Parliament but such resolution shall not be proceeded with until after the expiration of a period of one month from the date on which the Select Committee appointed under paragraph (2) of this Order has reported to Parliament.

Then, Sir, I looked at the proceedings of Saturday, 8th December 2012. All that has happened is, there had been a presentation, . ; . "Lord Chancellor " t . , " , " .

If you look at the Standing Orders, to help you, I will go on with what we have said earlier. If you take Standing Order No. 63 under REPORTS OF COMMITTEES ON BILLS" it states, I quote:

.shall present a report to Parliament setting out its recommendations, and a copy of the report shall be distributed to every member. Then, you have under Standing Order No. 121 COMMITTEE OF SELECTION, what and what a report should contain. Then again, it is given under Standing Order No. 123, under Standing Order No. 125 (3), under Standing Order No. 126 (3), under Standing Order No. 127 and Standing Order No. 128.

What is a report? I have taken the normal definition of a report. I have taken it from the Oxford Dictionary, which states, I quote:

373 374

[ ]

2013 10

an account given of a particular matter, especially in the form of an official document, after thorough investigation or consideration by an appointed person or body. Then, the same thing is there in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. It states, I quote:

a: a usually detailed account or statement.b: an account or statement of a judicial opinion or decision. c: a usually formal record of the proceedings of a meeting or session. It is also defined in the Macmillan Dictionary as an official document of a particular subject, often made by a group of people after studying a problem or the situation carefully.

Now, what happened was, the Hon. Minister presented it. Then, it had to be printed and tabled. The Debate can take one month after it is tabled. Now, "tabling" is placing it here on our table; distributing it anywhere else is not tabling.

Just now, the Hon. Minister tabled a Report and said, Let it be referred to the Consultative Committee. Now, that "tabling", Hon. Speaker, will not take place until you table it. My worry is, let us say, that you have a majority and you pass it. Then, someone else will go and say, This is not valid. So, whatever you do, has to be valid. If it is not tabled, then how can you say that that one month has gone? It is for you all to decide. We cannot be breaking the law and the Standing Orders. If we say Parliament is supreme, let us go through that. I am the one who got hit most for saying Parliament is supreme.- [Interruption.] That is why we are here.- [Interruption.] I think Parliament is supreme but you must follow the law. You have not yet tabled that Report. Once it is tabled and one month is gone - Otherwise you must amend Standing Order No. 78A. You can bring a resolution next week or week after to amend Standing Order No. 78A. That is another option. But, unfortunately, I have got a problem on that because today I found that the Leader of the House has stated to the "Daily News" that the Standing Orders cannot be amended retroactively. I am about to say that you can do it retroactively but he has said that it cannot be amended retroactively. All I am saying is there are different solutions.- [Interruption.] Let us see. Let us now look at that situation. Hon. Speaker, before you say anything, let the Government also tell us what exactly they have done.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I would like to respond to the issue raised by the "Lord Chancellor".

e ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) There are no "Lord Chancellors" in this Parliament. In Parliament, we have Members.

.. . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) "Lord Chancellors" are in the House of Commons. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Mr. Speaker, if you go by what exactly is meant by reporting -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) The issue is, what is meant by reporting in Standing Order No. 78A(1)? What exactly do you mean by reporting? Now, the Hon. Minister - if you read the Hansard of that day - has made a very short statement that they have gone into five charges and found the Chief Justice guilty of three charges, not of the other two. That is all. That is not a report. A report is a full account of what took place.

First he said, "". . ; it was not printed. Then, you made an Order to be printed. Once you said "to be printed", what had to be done next? So, this is the issue. What was done has to be tabled. That is the practice. So, if you did not table it, where is it? We have not got a report. That is what we are saying. Whatever we do, especially in regard to the Chief Justice, must be done properly.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) 6.30 . 08 .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, firstly, I want to add something to what the Hon. Tissa Attanayake said and then reply to the Hon. Chief Government Whip because our conduct has been in question. The Hon. Tissa Attanayake pointed out Standing Order No. 22 and about tabling. Every document has to be tabled.

Look at Standing Order No. 122 on "HOUSE COMMITTEE" which states, "The minutes of meetings of this Committee shall be circulated...". Again, Standing Order No. 124 on COMMITTEE ON PARLIAMENTARY BUSINESS states, "The minutes of meetings of this

391 392

Committee shall be circulated...". Then, you can put it into the pigeonhole. Otherwise, you have to table it. That is why, Hon. Speaker, these Budget Estimates are tabled in this House. It is not pigeonholed nor is it sent by courier to our houses. It is tabled here because that is what it is required. If you change it and say it can be pigeonholed or like in England, if you say, look into the website, that is a different matter. We do not do that; we still have the old practice.

Then, secondly, why did we come here? When we met, you knew our position and the Government's position was different. We wanted legislation to be brought in. Then, the Government said that they are not and that they were bringing this in. Then, we expected today, before you took this up, Hon. Speaker, that they would have brought a Motion to suspend that part of the Standing Order No. 78A (1) which required one months time after reporting. So, if they did not bring that in, we cannot be blamed. I cannot do that job. Once they did not do it, we got up and raised the point of Order. If you had brought it, then there would have been a debate on it. Then, we would have debated that and debated this also. We have nothing against it. What we are only saying is that you cannot proceed without suspending that part of the Standing Order because as I said earlier, Hon. Speaker, the whole question was, when was it printed? We all know that it was printed at the Government Press. How it is written is another mystery. But, the question is, what is reporting and what is tabling? And, we must go by what the Hon. Tissa Attanayake has said as to what "tabling" is, unless the Standing Orders say, it can be circulated. That is why the COPE Reports have to be tabled here and that is why the PAC Reports have to be tabled here. That is what we are doing. Now, if you did not want to give one months time and if you wanted to shorten it, you had an option. This House could have suspended that relevant portion of the Standing Orders. All we are telling you is, we are trying to show a way forward for you but you are shouting at us. We are trying to show you a way forward. -[Interruption.] Ah! You do not want to go forward. That means, you do not want this Motion. Hon. Basil Rajapaksa does not want to go forward. That means he does not want the Motion. - [Interruption.] - But, we are trying to find a way forward as to how this can be taken up. t ( ) (The Hon. Arundika Fernando) . . rose.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Speaker. Yesterday, we adopted the Minutes of the Meeting of the Committee on Parliamentary Business held on 7th January, 2013. Yesterday's Minutes are not available yet. The Minutes of 7th January, 2013 very clearly says right at the end, I quote:

"The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake stated that they have informed the Hon. Chief Government Whip well in advance of their inability to participate in the sittings of Parliament on 10th and 11th January, 2013. He further informed that even though they were agreeable to a Debate on this matter ....." That is his stance.

"....on the basis of the Judgment of the Supreme Court, the UNP is not willing to have the Debate on 10th and 11th of January, 2013."

395 396

After that, the Members of the Opposition left the Committee in protest against Governments insistence on taking this matter up for debate on the 10th and the 11th of January, 2013. It is very clearly stated in the Minutes of the Meeting of the Committee on Parliamentary Business held on 7th of January 2013, which was accepted and confirmed yesterday. So, it is wrong for the Hon. Chief Government Whip to say that the Committee on Parliamentary Business decided to take this up for Debate on the 10th and 11th of January, 2013. That is wrong.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , ?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Mr. Speaker, Article 107 of the Constitution and Standing Order No.78 have mandated the Select Committee. We have all mandated the Select Committee to go into the 14 charges. That mandate requires an

answer on all the 14 charges. Erskine May on the "Scope of Deliberation on Inquiries" states that a Select Committee like a committee of the whole House possesses no authority except which it derives by delegation from the House by which it is appointed. When a Select Committee is appointed to consider or inquire into a matter, the scope of its deliberations or inquiries is defined b the Order by which the committee is appointed, and the deliberations or inquiries of the committee must be confined within the limits imposed. Similarly, if it is deemed advisable to restrict the scope of the inquiry or to limit the Committees powers, an instruction may be given to the Committee requiring it to refrain from considering the matter. That is contained in Standing Order No. 96.

So, you are mandated to go into 14 charges and tell us. If you felt that you did not want to go beyond five charges, you should have come to this House and got permission to restrict it to five. There were 117 Members who had signed it. The Committee has no right. This is the right of the 117 Members plus the right of the House because we are exercising judicial power. We have to look at all the charges to decide - even if she is guilty of one or two - whether we are going to remove her or not. If it is about eight charges or nine charges, yes, there is a case. Otherwise, it will not be. You have not gone into it. You are telling us to exercise judicial power leaving virtually nine issues in suspension without telling us and one is a very important one, Hon. Speaker, which is about the Divineguma. Does her Ruling on Divineguma amount to a misbehaviour? If so, shall we also bring resolutions against other two Judges, Dep and Wanasundera. You do not even answer it. The most important issue that the Speaker has raised is unanswered. If you have issued a report, it must be for the whole. We gave you a mandate for 14 charges. If you cannot give us answers for the 14 charges as to "yes" or "no", or if there is not enough evidence, then it is not a report. The charge sheet contained 14 issues. If you have not taking up all 14 and if you cannot answer nine of them, then it is not a complete report by any means for us to go into. That is the basic point that my Hon. Friend has been taking up and you all have not confirmed. Tell us under what basis you decided that these nine are not - [Interruption.] That means, you are saying that the 117 Members who signed it did not know what they were doing. They have signed for nine charges without knowing - [Interruption.] Anyway, at the end of it there is no report. So, how can we proceed if there is no report as was intended. That is not our fault. If you have a full report we will go into it.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . , points of Order -

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , . Hon. Speaker, today the Parliament is sitting as a judicial body. . The body of Parliament is collectively acting as a court. There are certain basic requirements to fulfil before it can proceed -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) ? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) This is based on the rules of natural justice. Courts have repeatedly held that the person presiding must stick to the rules of natural justice. I am now asking, today there is a judicial proceeding, where is Shirani Bandaranayake, the accused? - [Interruption.] ?

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . . -

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Speaker, I am only speaking about natural justice. Under natural justice, we are deciding the fate of the Chief Justice today. Does she not have the right to hear the accusations against her? ?

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, I ask you - [Interruption.]

I respectfully request you to kindly give me a hearing . If you believe in the supremacy of Parliament, I would please request you to give me a hearing.

Where a resolution for the presentation of an address to the President for the removal of a Judge from office on the ground of proved misbehaviour...

Now, where is this "proved misbehaviour"? At which court was it proved? That did not come. He just basically went on a frolic of his own, on a voyage of discovery and told us about a report that had not been tabled one month ago.

It can be even a kangaroo court. Tell us. I thought the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva will reveal that but he has not revealed that.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) , . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What is the difference between Prabhakaran running there and Mahinda Rajapaksa running here? Now, we need a kangaroo court to come and tell us that there is "proved misbehaviour".

[3.51 p.m.] () . . ( ) ( () .. - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Speaker, I think it is very important for us to be clear in our minds about some basic principles. Who has the responsibility in respect of impeachment proceedings of judges of the superior courts? - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Is it the Legislature or the Judiciary? With regard to this matter, Sir, there is a uniform and consistent practice all over the world. In the United States, it is the Senate that is responsible for arriving at a determination in respect of impeachment proceedings; in the United Kingdom, it is the House of Lords and in the Philippines, it is the Senate. The consistent practice is that responsibility in this regard is entrusted by the constitutional structure to the legislative organ of government.

Sir, for this, there is a very compelling reason. Why is it that this responsibility is given to the Legislature and not to the Judiciary? There is a very cogent reason. The reason has been spelt out by courts of the highest authority. For example, the Supreme Court of the United States, where the previous Chief Justice, William Rehnquist, whose tenure straddled several American administrations, gave this as a rationale. He said, To exercise any form of judicial review over the Senate proceedings is just as bad as handling the matter directly.

There is a question of bias; there is a question of public perception of bias. If one judge has the power to quash directions against another judge, if one judge is intervening to protect the interests of his or her judicial brethren, there is a violation of one of the basic tenets of natural justice. One of the basic principles of natural justice is total impartiality and detachment, and there must be a clear public recognition that that is the case. In the famous case of Pinochet, which all of us have heard about, the English Court of Appeal gave the same reason: if the courts get involved in this, how can they be seen as not being biased? So, that is the very conceptual foundation of the principle that in respect of impeachment proceedings, the responsibility is that of Parliament and not the courts.

Sir, quite recently, this principle has been applied in the Philippines, where, towards the end of 2011, impeachment proceedings were brought against the Chief Justice of the Philippines, Justice Renato Corona.

In that case, the Chief Justice of the Philippines did exactly what the Chief Justice of Sri Lanka did. The Chief Justice of the Philippines went to court and asked for a Writ of Certiorari to quash the proceedings. That is what Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake did in this country. What was the outcome? The courts of the Philippines categorically and very emphatically said, This is not a matter for us to get involved in. We will not exercise any form of jurisdiction in respect of this matter because this belongs to the domain of the Legislature. So, they declined jurisdiction. Unfortunately, Sir, the opposite was done by the courts of Sri Lanka. Violating all the established principles in this regard, the principles which govern the basic relationship between Parliament and the courts, the Sri Lankan courts assumed responsibility for this matter and went so far, for the first time - this is unique in the annals of legal history - to issue a Writ of Certiorari to quash proceedings of this august Assembly.

Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the United States spelt out the dangers inherent in this course of action. He said, Do not do this. We will not do it because it is a course of action fraught with danger". That has proved almost to be a prophecy, Sir. If we examine the Judgment of the Supreme Court, we can see how flawed it is and how serious is the erosion of public confidence in the integrity and the objectivity of the Judiciary at its highest levels. I would like to draw your attention, Sir, to several paragraphs in the Judgment. The Supreme Court itself quotes Article 107(3) of the Constitution; the Supreme Court quotes it. This is the sentence that the Supreme Court quotes:

Parliament shall by law or by Standing Orders provide for all matters relating to the presentation of such an address,.

One does not need any knowledge of the law; a simple understanding of the English sentence is all that is required. It states, Parliament shall by law or by Standing Orders. There is a clear alternative - this or that. Parliament can, at its discretion, decide which of these vehicles or instruments it proposes to use for the purpose of investing with authority this Select Committee appointed under Article 107(3).

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Perhaps, Justice Sriskandajah did not understand the English, Sir. - [Interruption.]

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Speaker, in 1984, 29 years ago, the Parliament of Sri Lanka - not this Government - in its wisdom, brought its mind to bear upon this matter and decided that they would choose not legislation but Standing Orders. Sir, amazingly, truly amazingly, the Supreme Court then goes on to say this. At the beginning of the very next paragraph, the Supreme Court states in its Judgment, I quote:

There is a presumption that Parliament will not use words in vain or unnecessarily.

In other words, every word has to be given a meaning; there is no word which is superfluous or redundant. Then, I ask the simple question, what is the meaning that you are going to give to the words "or by Standing Orders"? It must have a meaning because the Supreme Court itself says that in no statute, least of all, the Constitution of the Republic, would you expect a phrase or a word to be used unnecessarily. This is basic. The Court then comes to the astonishing conclusion. It says that Parliament must act, in this matter, only by law and by law alone. In the judgment, the phrase only by law and by law alone is underlined.

How do you reconcile that with the plain meaning of the words that are used in Article 107(3)?

I have read a series of statements by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, who rightly insists that the function of interpreting the Constitution of Sri Lanka belongs solely and exclusively to the Supreme Court. That is the plain effect of Article 125 and my learned Friend is absolutely correct in asserting that. However, there is a very clear difference between interpretation and legislation. Interpretation requires the court to construe the language that is used in a statute and to attribute to the language that is used, the plain meaning of the words. Interpretation does not go so far as to allow the court to delete, to expunge from statute law any words that are used in it nor is the court entitled, on the basis of interpretation, to add to the language that is used in a statute.

Now, Sir, this has been clearly recognized by the most distinguished judges of our country. I quote the Supreme Court itself in quite a recent judgment, in 2006, in the case of the Attorney-General vs. Thilanga Sumathipala, where it is stated:

A Judge cannot, under the thin guise of interpretation, usurp the function of the Legislature to achieve a result that the Judge thinks is desirable in the interest of justice. Therefore, the role of the Judge is to give effect to the expressed intention of Parliament, as it is the bounden duty of any court and the function of every Judge to do justice within the stipulated parameters. This has been the unchallenged view expressed by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka for almost a hundred years.

So, when the Constitution states by law or by Standing Orders, the court has to recognize that there are

two options; the court cannot exclude one option. Of course, no law is written for all times. As social priorities change, as we discover in the light of empirical experience that laws need modification and improvement, the Legislature must undertake that task. It is not for the court to rewrite the law. My own distinguished teacher, Dr. A.R.B. Amerasinghe, who subsequently became a Judge of the Supreme Court, wrote a book called Judicial Conduct, Ethics and Responsibilities. Justice Amerasinghe says this in his book. Sir, I quote this one sentence:

If legislation needs amendment because it results in injustice, the democratic process must be used to bring about the change.

So, it is for Parliament, consisting of the elected Representatives of the people, that must undertake the law-making function. It would be constitutional heresy to suggest or to imply that the court, however exalted it may be, can undertake the law-making function.

Laws can be made here and here only. Nobody can usurp that function. This is very clear from the entire conceptual framework of the Constitution of Sri Lanka. Article 4 recognizes the doctrine relating to the separation of powers. There are powers and responsibilities that are given to the Legislature, to the Executive and the Judiciary. In this case, there is no doubt at all that the court has usurped for itself, without any semblance of justification, powers and responsibilities which belong to this House and to this House alone. It would be grossly irresponsible on the part of Parliament to acquiesce in that finding. That would be a dereliction of the public duty of this Parliament.

Mr. Speaker, this judgment is replete with error and those errors are obvious on the face of the judgment. I would like you, Sir, to consider these sentences at page 23. The Supreme Court relating to the Select Committee presided over by my Friend, the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa says this. I quote from the Judgment:

In the case of a finding made by a Select Committee Parliament has to take cognizance of such finding that the allegations against the Judge have been proved and make an address of Parliament to be presented to the President for the removal of the Judge.

The court says, Parliament has to take cognizance of. That is completely wrong, Sir. The Select Committee like any other Committee, will submit its report to Parliament. Standing Order No. 78A(2) uses the phrase, investigate and report. The Select Committee will investigate and report its findings to Parliament. It is for Parliament to debate those findings and to decide whether to accept them or to reject them. It is completely and utterly wrong to say that "Parliament has to take cognizance of" such findings. That is not the case at all. That is a fundamental error which vitiates the reasoning in this judgment.

445 446

2013 10

That is not all, Sir. The judgment goes on to say, I quote:

.... the final decision of the Select Committee is what that eventually takes effect. Again, that is fundamentally and basically wrong. There is no final decision of the Select Committee. The Select Committee does not make any decision at all. On the contrary, it merely arrives at a finding at the conclusion of the investigation it conducts. There is no decision at all, there is only a finding.

Then, truly incredibly - Sir, I am very sorry to say this because these are my own students - [Interruption.] No. Sir, I think it is a very dangerous doctrine to attribute to the teacher the sins of the student. Sir, there is this sentence here in the judgment. I quote:

The finding of the Select Committee is not subject to confirmation or approval by some other authority Is that correct, Sir? Is it not subject to confirmation or approval by some other authority?

Sir, the true position is that the finding of the Select Committee is subject to confirmation or approval not by one authority, but indeed by two authorities. One authority is Parliament itself. The second authority is His Excellency the President because Parliament at the conclusion of this Debate tomorrow, when the Vote is taken, will make an address to His Excellency the President and the final decision is to be made by none other than the President of the Republic. So, the court is wrong. It is misdirecting itself fundamentally when it says that there is no scope for confirmation or approval by any other authority. Then, the court says, again completely wrongly, I quote:

"... the address of Parliament to be presented to the President is an inevitable consequence of a finding that the charges have been proved".

It is nothing of the sort, Sir. It is not an inevitable consequence at all because Parliament can reject it, entirely or in part. So, there is nothing inevitable about it.

Therefore, what I am saying is that this reasoning is absolutely flawed, and it does not reflect any credit to the highest court in this land. All these problems are arising for the basic reason that was fully appreciated in the Renato Corona case in the Philippines.

The Supreme Court of the Philippines to protect their brother judge - I mean, these are judicial brethren, we are all human beings - had every opportunity of doing what the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal did in this country. But, they had the good sense and the integrity not to do that. They said the entire constitutional system works on the basis of a proper and coherent allocation of powers and responsibilities. It is a question of delineating the limits of public power. That is the pith and substance of the reasoning contained in the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. They, therefore, did not

wish to get embroiled in the matter. The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka took this upon themselves and came up with a judgment that, I say with great respect, is not worth the paper that it is written on.

Now, Sir, see what has happened next. So, the Supreme Court handed down this judgment. Then, the next step is the Court of Appeal and the Court of Appeal concludes its judgment with these words. It is the judgment of Justice Sriskandarajah and His Lordship says at the conclusion of his judgment, I quote:

In view of the above determination

- that is the determination of the Supreme Court.

In view of the above determination and the finding and/or the decision or the report of the 2nd to the 8th respondents marked as P17, . - that is my Colleagues who were on the Select Committee.

... has no legal validity and as such this court has no alternative, but to issue a writ of certiorari to quash P17, thus giving effect to the determination of the Supreme Court referred to above.

That is, it does not appear from this language that the Court of Appeal is doing this with any relish at all, they do not seem to be liking what they are doing. That is why they are saying, "this court has no alternative".

That is, the Court of Appeal has its hands tied by the Supreme Court. I have indicated to you, Sir, how demonstrably flawed the reasoning of the Supreme Court happens to be. So, the Supreme Court takes away from the Constitution of this land, words which are part and parcel of the Constitution. In so doing, the Supreme Court is making an unpardonable inroad into an encroachment upon the powers which are inherent in this sovereign Legislature; powers that are conferred upon it specifically by the provisions of the Sri Lankan Constitution. So, the Supreme Court arrives at a finding which is incurably flawed. It is a very bad finding. Then, the Court of Appeal says, "because the Supreme Court has sent this Determination to us, we have no choice but to follow the ruling of the Supreme Court". So, the source of it is entirely tainted.

Now, Sir, let us examine for a moment the repercussions of this anomaly because those repercussions are going to reverberate through our legal system for many more years when all of us are gone. Here, we have a situation in which the court has destroyed the fundamental basis of the law governing the relationship between the judicial and the legislative branches of Government. It has departed without any semblance of logic or sound policy from well-established principles of law and it has put this particular branch of public law on uncharted waters with horrendous consequences for institutions which we hold to be sacrosanct in this country.

447 448

Sir, I would like to indicate what the position has been up to now. Up to now, no court has dared to touch this Parliament, quite rightly. For 350 years, the courts of the United Kingdom have evolved a body of law which has recognized that Parliament is immune from the exercise of the jurisdiction of Her Majestys Courts. That is the distilled wisdom which your distinguished predecessor, the late Speaker, Hon. Anura Bandaranaike, expounded in his celebrated Ruling which was delivered from the Chair in which you now occupy, Sir, in June 2001. This is what, the Speaker, Hon. Anura Bandaranaike said encapsulating the substance of the principles which have been developed in an uninterrupted manner for a very long period of time. This is a privilege which is now being assailed for the first time and this has consequences for posterity, not only for the 225 Members who are in this House today.

The Hon. Anura Bandaranaike said, This is a privilege recognized in the United Kingdom from ancient times and forms an integral part of our system of Parliamentary democracy which has drawn heavily from their practice in the development of our own traditions. He went on to say that These are principles faithfully approved and followed by our Parliaments up to the present day.

So, this is part of the cherished legacy of this nation, which the late Speaker upheld, as you did yourself, Sir, in the Ruling which you gave just a few weeks ago.

Mr. Speaker, you made very clear the position that no Member of this House, least of all, you, Sir, the custodian of the rights and privileges of this House, can be directed by any court in this country to appear before that court in relation to any matter that has to do with your official functions in Parliament. This is the proud tradition which has been maintained and there is total continuity with regard to the maintenance of that tradition.

One of Sri Lankas most respected Judges, H.N.G. Fernando who subsequently became a Chief Justice - [Interruption.] We can handle this at a very frivolous level if you wish to do that but the gravity of the issues may require a different treatment.

Sir, I refer to the judgment of Justice H.N.G. Fernando in Attorney-General vs. Samarakkody. This is the opinion of one of this countrys most respected judges about the importance of the principles which are today being eroded for the first time in the legal history of this Island. H.N.G. Fernando, J. said, I quote:

The cumulative effect of the jurisprudence, constitutional provisions read in conjunction with the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act of 1953 as amended, in my opinion places the question of the exercise of the Speakers powers and the powers of the Members of this House, exercised both jointly and severally, outside the control of any court.

That is one of the proud privileges which Parliaments both in this country and in all other nations of the Commonwealth and indeed even outside the Commonwealth have safeguarded, at the cost of their lives, in some instances.

So, H.N.G. Fernando, J. says that these are powers which Parliament must always exercise. There can be no challenge and no court has the power to trespass upon the territory which belongs only and exclusively to the legislative organ of Government.

For the first time, we have a Writ of Certiorari actually quashing a Parliamentary proceeding. This is something that is wholly unimaginable to anybody familiar with the cultural ethos which pervades the public law of this country, which is based on the public law of England. It is really to make the basic principles of law stand on their heads. It is a fundamental disservice to all that we hold to be important with regard to the legal legacy to which we are proud heirs. It flies in the face of direct rulings by the Supreme Court.

In matters that were connected with the impeachment that was brought against the former Chief Justice, the Hon. Sarath N. Silva - this was a case filed by Mr. Victor Ivan, who was at that time the Editor of "Ravaya", Victor Ivan vs. Sarath N. Silva. Justice Wadugodapitiya was the Chairman of a Bench that consisted of five judges. Now, what is interesting, Sir, is that one of the members of that Bench was the present Chief Justice, Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake. The others were Justice Priyantha Perera, Justice Gunasekara and Justice Ismail. Now, in this Judgment - it was a unanimous decision of that Bench of five judges - they specifically recognized that Article 107 (3) of the Constitution provides a lawful means of removing from office the Chief Justice of this country. In other words, the present Chief Justice accepted that position sitting on that Bench and associating herself with the judgment that was delivered by Justice Wadugodapitiya. There are many cases, I do not wish to labour the point.

The Hon. M.H. Mohamed was one of your distinguished predecessors, Sir. In the case of Gomes vs. M.H. Mohamed, which had to do with the impeachment proceedings against the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, the Supreme Court said that they would not dream of interfering with Parliament or inquiring into any procedure within Parliament. That is not for the courts; that the courts will not embark upon such an exercise because it is inappropriate and because it would constitute an affront to the dignity of Parliament. So, in Gomes vs. M.H. Mohamed, the court declined to do something even less, far less, than what the courts have done in relation to this House on the present occasion. So, Sir, I think I have said enough to establish the position that what has happened is not only contrary to all principle and precedent, but it is something that would affect the rights of future generations of legislators.

449 450

[ () . . ]

2013 10

I would also like to draw attention to this. The very proposition that Standing Order No. 78A is bad, because the authority of the Select Committee comes from Standing Orders as opposed to a law, is a proposition which does not make sense at all because there are previous instances in which this Standing Order was used in the same way by previous Select Committees without one word of objection. I refer to the proceedings in respect of the late Chief Justice, Neville Samarakoon. In that case, Sir, there were two Select Committees. The function of the first Select Committee was very limited. It was simply to ascertain whether the Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon had made a speech at Sinnathurai Commercial Tutory. That was a question of fact - had he made that speech or not? And, the conclusion was arrived at that Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon, in fact, did make that speech.

Then, a second Select Committee was appointed to go into the question whether the contents of that speech amounted to proven misbehaviour because Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon criticized, in somewhat strong terms, some of the aspects of the policy of the Government of the late President J.R. Jayewardene. The second Select Committee acted on the basis of Standing Order No. 78A. So, if this Select Committee is bad, the previous Select Committee was also bad. If Standing Order No. 78A is bad on this occasion, it was equally bad on the previous occasion. But, it is a Standing Order which has stood without challenge for 29 years, quite rightly so. If we get into this situation of allowing the Supreme Court, under the guise of interpretation, to take away whole chunks of the statute law of this country, then we are up against a very dangerous situation in which the very phrase statutory interpretation becomes a total misnomer. That is not interpretation at all. That is lawmaking. Lawmaking can be done only by one organ of the State and that is the Legislature. So, that is the position, Sir, and I would like briefly to indicate what the future course of action is. What has happened so far is that 117 Members of this House presented to you, Sir, as Speaker, a Motion calling for the appointment of a Select Committee. The Constitution requires you, upon receiving such a Motion signed by not less than one-third of the Members of the House, to proceed to the appointment of such a Select Committee, which you, Sir, as Speaker, duly did.

Then, the Committee comes into existence. The Committee derives its vires from Standing Order No. 78A, which itself is a creature of statute. Then, the Select Committee carries on with its work and at the conclusion of the investigation - it is not a judicial act, it is simply an investigative act - and there is in public law, a fundamental distinction between the function of adjudication and the function of investigation. They are two vastly different things. So, the Select Committee carries out its function of investigation; it arrives at a finding and the finding is conveyed to the plenary assembly, it is conveyed to Parliament. The only

restriction with regard to time frames that is incorporated into Standing Order No. 78A, is the compulsory requirement that there must be an interval of one month between the submission of the Report to Parliament and the commencement of the Debate. The Report was submitted to Parliament on the 8th of December and any time after the 8th of January, Parliament is free to debate it.

Parliament is now embarking on that Debate; the Vote will be taken tomorrow evening and the next step is, if Parliament agrees with the findings as contained in the Report, then, in terms of Article 107, an address has to be presented to His Excellency the President. And, the President as the appointing authority also has the authority to dismiss the Chief Justice from office. Indeed, that is expressly recognized by the Supreme Court in the last page of its judgment. So, this is a lawful proceeding; it is a proper proceeding and it is a proceeding which has been unjustifiably and indefensibly assailed by courts acting entirely outside their jurisdiction. It is for that reason that this House is duty-bound not to take cognizance of such judgments, which are totally incompatible with the basic powers of this House. These are powers which Parliament enjoys not for their own sake but as an instrument of service to the people of Sri Lanka. The whole basis of the law relating to Privilege is that these rights are necessary for the elected representatives of the people to discharge their functions with acceptance. Without those powers and rights, the representatives of the people will find themselves without the authority that they need properly to discharge their functions. This is the practical importance of the concept of Privilege. Therefore, Sir, it is my humble submission that Parliament must jealously guard those rights and does not allow any functionary outside Parliament - be it the courts or anyone else - to take away those rights, which we hold to be vitally important.

So, this is to be recognized and understood very clearly by people who say that we have defied the courts. We are not defying the courts. It is the courts who had thrown to the winds all restraints and limitations which govern the exercise of their authority and that is by its very nature an arbitrary and capricious proceeding. Those who talk of the Rule of Law must recognize that impunity is an essential characteristic of the Rule of Law. All authorities exercising public power must be astute to confine themselves to the boundaries within which power is conferred upon them. This is an instance where it can be shown with crystal clarity that the courts have overstepped their jurisdiction in defiance of the plain language that is used in the Constitution of this country. This is why this situation cannot be construed as one in which Parliament is seeking to ride roughshod over the judiciary and refusing to recognize the lawful powers of the judiciary. On the contrary, it is the Supreme Court, without any consideration of the consequences and with

451 452

scant regard for the body of law which has established itself over such a long period of time, with scant regard to all of this, it is the courts that have assailed the authority of Parliament.

I ask, Sir, if it is the unanimous opinion of this Assembly, as indeed it was a few weeks ago, that no single Member of this House should appear before the court in response to the notice that was issued and everybody agreed with that - the Government agreed with that; the United National Party agreed with that; the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna also agreed with that - and not one single Member of the Select Committee appeared before the courts. That is in recognition of the principles that have sought to expound during this brief period. If that is so, Sir, how can anyone without a palpable contradiction say, "We do not go anywhere there because we do not recognize their right to ask us to come; they have no right to engage in that exercise at all. Therefore, we will not go there". There was unanimity with regard to that. There was no cleavage of opinion in any form between the Government and the Opposition. So, if we were able to arrive at unanimity with regard to that basic principle which goes to the very root of the authority of this august Assembly, how then, I ask, Sir, is it possible for those very people now to say, "Okay we did not go there, but now we recognize that judgment and we want to give effect to it even though it transcends the lawful powers of the courts and makes a very fundamental encroachment upon the powers of Parliament which we all individually and collectively are bound to uphold." This is why I say, Sir, with due responsibility, that this is a matter which goes beyond these specific circumstances of the impeachment against the Hon. (Dr.) Shirani Bandaranayake. It is far more important than that. It is a far broader set of principles that are in jeopardy on this occasion.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Just one moment. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I am raising a point of Order. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Okay.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris referred to the fact that we did not go to court. I would like to bring to your notice that the application filed in court did not make us respondents in any way. Shall I read the prayer to you?

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) I know that. I have considered it. ... ( ) ( ... - , ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne - Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs)

No, Sir. All Members were given notice. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) "A mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the report of the 2nd to the 8th defendants". I am the 9th defendant and the Hon. John Amaratunga is the 10th defendant. The JVP Member and the TNA Member are the next two. So, they have asked for relief against the second to the eighth defendant. Therefore, this is the - [Interruption.] I am reading in English. You should understand English. I am reading in English.

"A mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the report of the second to the eighth defendant..." I am the ninth defendant. There is nothing against me. "A mandate in the nature of a Writ of Prohibition ..." You are the first respondent and it is against you; it is against the Secretary-General and it is against the seventh respondent, the Government Members. - [Interruption.] Because we did not sign the report, we did not take part in the proceedings. So, the Chief Justice did not ask any relief from us. That is why we did not go to court. Do not mislead.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) No. I do not wish to get embroiled in a dispute about that. I am not in any way criticizing you. What I am saying is that there is a principle involved. - [Interruption.]

According to that, Chandra Jayaratne vs., and there are eleven respondents and all of you are cited as respondents here. - [Interruption.] Please, I have no time.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Originally, when the case was filed we were all respondents. I agree. When they went to argue the case, Sir, they confined their prayer only to the eighth defendant. I read it out. It was against you, against the Secretary-General and the seven people who signed the report; there was nothing against us.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) So, Mr. Speaker, this is why it is important to recognize the legality and the propriety of everything that has been done in this instance. It is also of even greater importance to acknowledge the dangers that are inherent in allowing this kind of encroachment because if it is allowed once, then it will happen again and again in the future. Up to now, there was no precedent, whatsoever, which enabled the courts to do what they have done on this occasion. The entire body of precedent, the cursus curiae is entirely against that. Now, we have a radical departure from that and for the first time - and this is nothing short of a constitutional heresy - the courts have exercised their power under the prerogative writs, in this case a Writ of Certiorari, to quash - to deprive of legal effect - a proceeding within the precincts of Parliament. It is something that no court has ever contemplated in the United Kingdom, in Australia, in Canada in this country or anywhere else. So, we have to be mindful of what is implied in that departure from established principles. I would ask you, Sir, to do everything in our power - I think we all collectively need to discharge that obligation - to ensure that the public in this country are made aware of what is involved in this situation. We must do everything that is in the power of all of us to safeguard what is of inherent value in what we have inherited from those who have gone before us and we are equally bound to hand it down in its pristine integrity to those who will come after us.

I thank you, Sir, for your indulgence. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) Order, please! .

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Deputy Speaker, are you able to control the proceedings? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you speak. [4.39 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir. Before I commence my speech, I need to deal with two preliminaries, both relating to certain customs. The first one is that I must make a disclosure to this House of my involvement in my professional capacity in many matters relating to the matter under discussion and that is the proper thing to do. - [Interruption.] Even in this purported report, the first witness has referred to my name. I have seen in the proceedings of myself having appeared in the Ceylinco Shriram case. I have appeared for the Minister, Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, as his counsel in the case in which the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation was privatized and the privatization was reversed consequent to which the Hon. Chief Justices husband was appointed as the Chairman of that institution. That is the first disclosure.

Secondly, this is also a matter of custom; I have come to know that in yesteryears, when lawyers came to this House as Members of this House, they changed their attire. They did not come with a black tie and a black coat. The Hon. (Dr.) Colvin R. de Silva was the prime example of that. He always came into the Chamber in a gray, beige or white suit and I have so far striven to uphold that tradition and today I am breaking with that tradition deliberately and I address you in a black coat and a black tie because this is a black day. - [Interruption.]

Thirdly, if the House continues like this, that only demonstrates - [Interruption.] Now, some Member whose office was raided and

[ .] [ ]

[Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

is trying to interrupt me. - [Interruption.] Mr. Deputy Speaker, I was quietly listening to the Hon. Minister of External Affairs, not to the Deputy Minister of External

Affairs. - [Interruption.] I will not refer to you. - [Interruption.] I am referring to the Hon. Minister of External Affairs who referred to the Supreme Court Ruling, sought to expound it and surmised it for a long time and he was permitted to do so by the Chair. Mr. Deputy Speaker, you yourself was present in the House then. Therefore, all that he has said and got put on record cannot be allowed to stand. Even though I am much junior to him in the field of law, yet, I have practised as an Attorney-at-Law for 21 years, which he had not been able to do even for a single day. - [Interruption.] Today, I seek to draw from that professional experience in order to lay before this House the true position. - [Interruption.]

Now, the Hon. Member who is shouting is giving a demonstration of what he did at the Select Committee, how he abused the Chief Justice. - [Interruption.] This is what he did there. - [Interruption.] The Hon. Minister of External Affairs is the one who claims credit for that appointment of her's. - [Interruption.] I am not saying it. -[Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) He appointed her. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development has said so in the Parliamentary Select Committee proceedings, that it was the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris who got her appointed. Therefore, you objected to him as well. It is there in these proceedings. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. Mr. Deputy Speaker, you have recognized the Hon. Sumanthiran's speech. So, why do you allow this type of nonsense to go on?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not a point of Order. - [Interruption.] Hon. Sumanthiran, you carry on. - [Interruption.] That is not a point of Order.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am asking you most humbly, just for one time now, to please maintain the decorum of this House. I will not ask you again. - [Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) You are not the Speaker. - [Interruption.]

457 458

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Sumanthiran, if you present your speech, there will not be any disturbance.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Is the Hon. Deputy Speaker saying that I am not presenting my speech? I am presenting my speech, but there is disturbance. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Sumanthiran, continue with your speech.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You, as the Chair, have a responsibility to maintain discipline in the House.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) If you continue, everything will be recorded.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) But you, as the Chair, have the responsibility to maintain that -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You do not have to tell me of my responsibility. I will discharge my responsibility. - [Interruption.] Please continue to speak.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is why I said I will say it once and I will say it no more. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Sumanthiran, you speak.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris looked at the Judgment, the interpretation, given by the Supreme Court. The Hon. Leader of the House also, as he opened the Debate, referred to that and attacked the interpretation of the Supreme Court based on one word in Article 107(3) of the Constitution - the word "or". Both of them spoke at

length about the court having entered the arena of legislation-making because, according to both of them, the court has somehow misread, it has not looked at the word "or". The court has not done any such thing. If one cares to read the Determination of the Supreme Court, -

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) How can you say so?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) This is what I am saying. Sit and listen. - [Interruption.] You also have not practised in any court. - [Interruption.] The Supreme Court has very carefully dealt with that issue.

( ) (An Hon. Member) In one and a half hours.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, the Supreme Court did not take one and half hours, it took much more. If you do not know, do not show your ignorance. - [Interruption.] It took several days. - [Interruption.] The Supreme Court says the reason as to why the word "or" is there and not "and" is that with regard to procedural matters in the Select Committee, Parliament has a choice. Parliament can do it either by Standing Orders or it can incorporate it in the Act of Parliament that it can enact. I see the Hon. Susil Premajayantha, a person who knows the law, agreeing with me. Thank you. So, you have to use the word or; you cannot say and. You cannot say provide it in the Act and provide it in the Standing Orders. No, you cannot do that. But, there are certain matters with regard to standard of proof, burden of proof and the mode of proof, that cannot be provided for by the Standing Orders, and there is reason for that.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Who told you that?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Article 4(c) of the Constitution states that.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) You are reading into it.

459 460

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, you did well when you retained me as your counsel. Now, you are faltering. - [Interruption.] In many matters, you retained me as your counsel.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Now, you are a devil's advocate. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I must remind you of an incident. You will remember, on one occasion when I stood up for you in the Supreme Court - you know that - the then Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva told me, "You are appearing for this petitioner too many times". I said, "So long as he has confidence in me as counsel, he will continue to retain me".

( ) (Hon. Members) Ah! .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I appeared and obtained judgment for you.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Eat humble pie. ( ) (An Hon. Member) Now, we all have lost confidence in you. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, that is true. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) . ( ) (An Hon. Member) . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, Article 4(c) of the Constitution states, I quote: "the judicial power of the People shall be exercised by Parliament through courts, tribunals and institutions created and established, or recognized, by the Constitution, or created and established by law,........"

It states "created and established by law", only by law, not written law. Article 170 of the Constitution gives the definition of what a "law" is and what a "written law" is. A Standing Order is written law, not law. Any person who can read and understand has to concede to that. That is the reason why, in the interpretation of the Supreme Court, they have very carefully dealt with that word or. I do not know whether it is ignorance or convenience, the Hon. Ministers including a learned Professor of Law, are seeking to mislead the country by saying that the Supreme Court has not read the word or. As I said, the Chair permitted the Honourable Professor to make his surmise on this Judgment.

Before I get to that, the Constitution, which is the supreme law - all of us agree with that; there is no dissent on that as the Constitution says so, that it shall be the supreme law - gives to three different organs of Government three separate areas of competence. If anyone is violating the Constitution, it is those who transgress into the area that has been given to the other institution. Accusations are being made that the Judiciary has gone into the province of legislation-making. I have just explained that the Judiciary has done no such thing; they have only interpreted the law. The Honourable Professor would know - he cited English authorities - that there are several judgments, not only from here but even in England, in India and in every civilized jurisdiction, where the courts, in interpreting, sometimes supply a word, a comma, a dot or a full stop. That is common. But, in this case, our Supreme Court has not done even that. They have very clearly explained why that word or is there and they have gone on to say it is a presumption that Parliament will not use words without a reason and the reason why Parliament used the word law, the reason why Parliament used the word or, the reason why Parliament used the phrase Standing Orders is very clearly laid down in the interpretation of the Supreme Court. Even if the interpretation of the Supreme Court is wrong, that is the interpretation that must stand, and so our Hon. Speaker said that on the 9th of October. - [Interruption.] I will come to that. Your Speaker, in a Ruling given on the 9th of October 2012 very clearly said it is the interpretation of the Supreme Court that must stand. On that occasion also he did not agree and he asked the Supreme Court to revisit that interpretation and that is the correct course of action.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) If you do not agree -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Even if you do not agree, there is no warrant for the Parliament not to agree. Article 125 of the Constitution -

461 462

2013 10

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) I have told the Supreme Court to go to hell. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, I know. That is what you will do. One of the three organs of Government, you say is a democratic institution. You go and say that this is a democratic country. You go and say that there is an independent Judiciary and today the Minister, Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara in this House is saying that they have told the judiciary go to hell. We will not allow you to do that. That is a sure way of sending this country down the slope and that is what you are doing. We will not allow you to do that. This is a democratic country. There must be a Rule of Law. If there is to be a Rule of Law, there must be an independent Judiciary. We cannot allow you to send the Judiciary to hell. Who are you? - [Interruption.] I am a citizen of this country. I am entitled to say that this country must have every democratic institution. Who are you to say, "send the judiciary to hell"? You are the conspirator against the countrys interest. If you say, "send the judiciary to hell", you are the one who is conspirating against the country, against this Government. That must be what you are trying to do because you announced to the country that you will vote against this two days ago. But, you got scared. You got scared that your Ministry will be taken away from you. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Therefore, you have changed your stance. This is exactly what you did for the Eighteenth Amendment also. You said you do not agree with it in principle but you will nevertheless vote. Some principled man this is! I feel ashamed that I have ever appeared for you.- [Interruption.] I will tell you one more thing. You were one of my boyhood heroes of this country - [Interruption.] You can ask my family. Each time you came to my chambers, I was proud. I told my children, "This is a man I respect. I count it an honour to appear for this man". I told my children that. Today, I have to take those words back because of your shameful conduct. All for just a ministerial post, you have turned your tables on all the hallowed principles which you were saying that you abided by all these years. Why do you do this in the last few years of your life? - [Interruption.]

Sir, Article 125 is very clear. In case Parliament itself, when enacting this Constitution, was conscious that there might be people like this here, it could have said, "It is the sole jurisdiction of the Supreme Court" or it could have said, "It is the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court" No. They said, "sole and exclusive jurisdiction."

Just in case, like some people here, they missed that word, they said it twice over, "sole and exclusive". But, there are people here who miss both words. What more can it mean when the Constitution says that it is the sole and exclusive jurisdiction? Does this Parliament have jurisdiction?

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Yes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) There you are! The one man who answers. I will deal with you in a moment. - [Interruption.] Hon. Rajitha Senaratne, you sit down. I will deal with it. This is not like taking tooth out of somebodys mouth. This is law. There are legal principles involved in this. This is not like some crafty things that he does. This involves law. -[Interruption.] Now, if the Constitution says that it is the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution, what more can there be ? And, if after the Supreme Court has done just that - I am thankful to the Honourable Professor because he tabled it in this House. Thank you so much. There are instructions given at the gate not to let those judgments come in. But, you have tabled it. I must thank you profusely for your act today. So, that judgment has been tabled and it is on record. - [Interruption.] You also must be a conspirator then against the Government, against what the Speaker has ordered, against what the Deputy Speaker has been saying to the media. Nevertheless, that has now been tabled. Parliament must take notice of it. Is this Parliament to say, we can read Article 125 of the Constitution which says it is the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution but because we do not agree with that, we do not accept that? This is - [Interruption.] Not the way we want, the way the Supreme Court has interpreted it.

( ) (An Hon. Member) That is what the Speaker said.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes. The Speaker said in his Ruling, it is the interpretation of the Supreme Court that must stand and that is why -

463 464

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, your time is over.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) No, you have got 20 minutes.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I have now got 10 more minutes. I had got 50 minutes but I will wind up in 10 more minutes.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Okay, you continue.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) This is the reason why we are participating in this Debate but, without prejudice to our stand, there is no Report before this House. There is no Report - [Interruption.] All you want to know is that.

Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Sumanthiran, you speak.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I charge fees and I was paid by Mr. Janaka Ratnayaka for appearing in that case. For every case that I appear, I am entitled to charge, as a professional and receive it. If you do not know that, I do not blame you that you do not know that. But, there are lawyers here, ask them and learn from them. Now, I am entitled to my fees for the work that I do. Only for the Hon. Minister there, I did not charge any fees because that was in the public interest. Now, since I have a short time to conclude, I want to read from this purported Report.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I want to find out from the Hon. Sumanthiran, when Prabakaran killed thousands of Tamils whether he wore a black tie.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Sumanthiran, you speak.

465 466

2013 10

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, I want to ask the Hon. Sumanthiran whether he can participate in these proceedings without prejudice to the jurisdiction of Parliament. Once you participate in these proceedings, you are subject to the jurisdiction of Parliament.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That will be looked into.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, I want a Ruling on that.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That will be looked into and a Ruling will be given by the Hon. Speaker.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, the Hon. Member took the position - [Interruption.] May I finish ? I am on a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) The point of Order is this. The Hon. Member mentioned in this House that he is participating in these proceedings without prejudice to the jurisdiction objection. I want a Ruling because he cannot participate in these proceedings.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Speaker will look into that and give a Ruling.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, before I conclude my speech, I want to read from this Report. -[Interruption.] Now, please do not disturb. [Interruption.] This is your own Report. Do not disturb your own Report. Sir, I would like to quote what Mr. Romesh de Silva said addressing the Chairman of the Select Committee in page 1482 of Volume II of the Report that was submitted. I quote:

Mr. Chairman, there must be some decorum in this. I do not like to be shouted at by Members of the Select Committee. We have come here to do a job of work. We are making submissions and we must be treated with some kind of decorum. Otherwise, this does not become any kind of a process that we can possibly accept. We cannot accept this process, if we have been shouted at, if we are not being allowed to make submissions. When I am making submissions to you Mr. Chairman, I am being interrupted.

Then, the Hon. R. Sampanthan who was a Member of the Select Committee had this to say and I want to read it to this House. I quote:

Mr. Chairman, if I might intervene. I think, you as the Chairman of this Select Committee have to safeguard the dignity and the decorum of Parliament, because we are functioning as a Select Committee on behalf of Parliament. The Hon. Chief Justice of the country is here before us and we are conducting an investigation in regard to certain matters. There are Counsels appearing on her behalf. I think, we should conduct ourselves with a sense of decorum and dignity so as to ensure that the prestige of Parliament is preserved. It will be unfortunate, if we cannot do that. Let us not forget that the whole world is watching what is going on here, not only the people in this country. The whole world is watching what is going on here and if this is the way that we are going to conduct our proceedings, it will be a very, very bad reflection on the institution of Parliament and on these proceedings itself.

When Mr. Romesh de Silva and the Hon. R. Sampanthan said this, none of the other Members said, What are you talking about? Who pointed fingers? Who is shouting? We did not do that. Why are you saying this? Nothing of that sort. They have agreed that there was shouting; they have agreed that there was abuse of the Chief Justice in that Chamber there.

.. . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is your point of Order?

.. . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, he is casting aspersions on the Hon. Minister. That must be expunged from Hansard.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, what is your point of Order?

.. . ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) My point of Order is this. How many millions of dollars has he received as fees from the diaspora in order to appear for their cases?

467 468

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) No. That is not a point of Order.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, there was abuse in that Select Committee and your own proceedings bear that out. Having abused the Chief Justice of this country and chased her out, how can you say that you adhered to the principles of natural justice of audi alteram partem? Your own proceedings betray you. Are you not ashamed? The Chairman is here. Are you not ashamed? You were addressed and you were asked that question. Several times you were telling them, Do not listen to the comments of the others. You address me. What does that mean? You have conceded in the print here that there was abuse going on in that place and you come here and present this Report with these proceedings. You did not utter one word. You did not challenge. When they complained, you did not say, No such thing is happening here. It is not recorded. That is a clear proof as to what you did to a lady, to a Chief Justice of this country. What more will you not do? If that is the kind of justice that you mete out to even the Chief Justice of this country, what chance do others have? What chance do we have? You have been complaining that we are not coming to another Parliamentary Select Committee.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.P. Jagath Pushpakumara) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Sumanthiran, you continue your speech.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If the Chief Justice cannot get justice in this Parliamentary Select Committee, with what face do you invite us to come to the other Parliamentary Select Committee? If this is the justice that you can do to your

own appointee, to the Chief Justice of this country, what will you not do to us? Why do you invite us to a Parliamentary Select Committee, if you abuse and chase even the Chief Justice? How will you treat us? The Hon. Minister wanted to talk about the Tamils. After illegally taking 109 young Tamil women saying that they are being recruited to the army without any process, abusing them in those camps and keeping them -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If anything is to be deleted from the Hansard on the basis that it is untrue, first, you must delete this entire Report, because this entire Report is a false report and this Report is a No-Report because the Court of Appeal has quashed it. I want to add that. In Proceedings No. CA 411/2013, the Court of Appeal has quashed this already. It was the undertaking of the Sri Lankan Government to the UN Human Rights Council in 2003 - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) After having given an undertaking to the UN Human Rights Council that judicial review is available after the impeachment process of a judge under Article 107(3), this House - I say with utmost necessity - adhere to that

because, otherwise, like you have already put the country at peril, you are putting this country at peril once more. because with all the undertakings that you have given to the UN Human Rights Council, you are willing to willy- nilly, move away and that will put this country at peril. It is our responsible reminder to you. "Do not put our country at peril; do not violate the Constitution; do not put the country at peril". If you do that, this will be regarded as a failed State. You are the ones who are doing that, not anybody else. - [Interruption.] If you give undertakings and if you violate them, if you do not listen to the Supreme Courts own order, if you violate the Constitution, you will make this country a failed State.- [Interruption.] Thank you.
