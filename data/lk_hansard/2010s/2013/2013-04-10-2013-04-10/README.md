VIOLATION OF DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS OF TAMIL PEOPLE . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you Mr. Speaker for granting me permission to raise this matter of urgent public importance under Standing Order No. 23(2).

On Saturday, 30th March 2013, a mob of around 50 persons who came in a procession along the A-9 Highway carrying the National Flag attacked a meeting held at the Tamil National Alliance Office of the Hon. S. Shritharan MP in Kilinochchi by throwing rocks and concrete stones. In addition to the Hon. S. Shritharan, MP, the Hon. S. Senathirajah, MP, the Hon. E. Saravanapavan, MP and the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, MP, were present there at that time. The Members of Parliament were engaged in

1597 1598

meeting with about 100 residents of Killinochchi relating to matters of concern to the Tamil people. This attack took place in the presence of the Kilinochchi Police, who did nothing to prevent it, and resulted in injuries to 13 persons and extensive damage to property. This attack was recorded on video and photographs and the persons involved are easily identifiable. However, not one person has been arrested in relation to this violence up to date, despite the presence of the police on the scene while the attack took place. In fact, one assailant apprehended by those present at the meeting was identified to be an officer of the Criminal Investigation Department - CID - of the Sri Lankan Police. He was handed over to the Deputy Inspector-General of Police who arrived at the scene later, but was released shortly thereafter. Two others, who were similarly caught in the act and handed over to the Police, were also promptly released.

This is not the first time such attacks have been carried out on TNA meetings. On 16th June, 2011, army personnel in full uniform attacked a TNA local authority election meeting at Alaveddy in Jaffna, at which five Members of Parliament were present. Although the assailants were in uniform and identifiable, to date no one has been arrested in relation to that incident. More violence was unleashed against the people the day before the local authority elections at that time, particularly, in the Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu Districts. Army personnel went house to house and confiscated National Identity Cards and the Polling Cards of the people and warned them not to vote for the TNA. I made a complaint to the Commissioner of Elections with full particulars and consequently some of those people were able to vote and the TNA emerged victorious. During the Eastern Provincial Council Election, several acts of intimidation, undue influence, misrepresentation, bribery and other malpractices were committed by persons inclusive of security intelligence personnel supporting the ruling party.

These matters were brought to the notice of the President, the Commissioner of Elections, the Inspector-General of Police and other authorities. However, no tangible action that could erase the impact of such misdeeds and ensure a free and fair election was taken raising grave doubts in regard to the independence and integrity of the electoral, police and public service authorities entrusted with the duty of conducting elections. Several other meetings and rallies were also similarly disrupted and more recently, on 15th February, 2013, military intelligence personnel disrupted a hunger strike by the Tamil people at the Durgai Amman Temple premises at Tellippallai, which was also attended by the Leader of the Opposition. There too, persons who were arrested by the police were released by the army who intervened.

Mr. Speaker, you will observe that the common feature of all these attacks is that they have been carried

out by or with the connivance of the security forces and the police and even though the assailants were identifiable, no arrests have been made. These are also carried out under the watchful eyes of the police. This is clearly indicative of the complicity of the authorities.

The most recent attack was in the early hours of the morning on 3rd April, 2013, on the Kilinochchi distribution office of the "Uthayan" newspaper by armed assailants. Of the four staff injured, one is in a serious condition. Property has also been damaged. The attack took place when a vehicle carrying copies of the newspaper for distribution arrived at the Kilinochchi office. This incident is the latest in a series of brutal attacks against the "Uthayan" staff in the last few months. In December 2012, the Editor Mr. T. Premananth was hospitalized after military officers and plain-clothes policemen beat him repeatedly while he was covering a protest at the University of Jaffna. In January this year, an "Uthayan" employee who was distributing newspapers in Valvettithurai was attacked by four armed men who also torched his motorbike. The victim was admitted to hospital with a fractured arm. No arrests have been made in relation to any of these attacks. "Uthayan" is an independent newspaper that publishes news, perhaps not palatable to the Government. This demonstrates the lack of media freedom and the threat to freedom of expression in the country now.

These attacks on the democratic rights of the Tamil people of the freedom of association, freedom of opinion and freedom of expression in the North and the East are clearly carried out with the active support, sanction and collusion of the Sri Lankan Government. They are a vain and counterproductive attempt to suppress and persecute the Tamil people for their political aspirations. We call on the Sri Lankan Government to immediately cease the violence directed against the Tamil people. We reiterate that to prevent a non-recurrence of the past, Sri Lanka must expeditiously commence a meaningful and genuine process of reconciliation based on the ascertainment of the truth, ensuring justice and providing adequate reparations for the victims of violations committed by all parties.

Mr. Speaker, you may recall that some weeks ago I met you in your Chambers with my Colleague, the Hon. Sumanthiran, Member of Parliament, and we raised with you the position relating to the Hon. Shritharan, Member of Parliament and his Kilinochchi political office. This was the same office that came under attack on the 30th of March this year. You were kind enough to invite the IGP to your Chambers and the Hon. Sumanthiran and I met the IGP in the Chambers. We told the IGP that we did not want confrontation in this area. We wanted the Hon. Shritharan, who is a Member of Parliament representing that area, to be able to function with freedom.

Two persons arrested, Mr. Ponnambalam Lakshmikanthan and Mr. Arunachalam Velamaligithan,

1599 1600

[ . ]

2013 10

are still in custody. They have not been released. The police personnel attached to the Hon. Shritharans office were removed. They have not been restored yet.

I would like to make an appeal on the Floor of the House, particularly after you intervened, Mr. Speaker, to the Inspector-General of Police to ensure that these police personnel are put back on duty at the office of the Hon. Shritharan as is normally done in the case of all Members of Parliament and that these persons who have been taken into custody be released because they have not been charged in court. One does not know why they have been taken into custody. These persons must be released.

In fact, I am informed that some preparations are being made by some service personnel in Kilinochchi to attack the Hon. Shritharans office tomorrow. Some preparations are already afoot. I want to bring that to the notice of you, Mr. Speaker, on the Floor of this House because this type of thing should not be allowed to continue. Members of Parliament must be in a position to function independently and fearlessly in the electorates to which the people have returned them. I would appeal to you to kindly intervene in this matter.

Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. .. ( ) ( .. - , ) (The Hon. D.M. Jayaratne - Prime Minister, Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs) , , . , . , . .

Sir, now, I would like to draw the attention of this House to a very important matter. That is about the statement made by the US Ambassador yesterday in a foreign correspondents forum. The US Ambassador has said that the war might erupt again. That is a very unfortunate statement made on the part of the Ambassador representing a country like America. Everybody knows that we have brought the war to an end and after the war, we are trying to bring about reconciliation in the country by improving infrastructure and by providing all the social requirements to people, irrespective of ethnic differences; whether it is Jaffna,

Trincomalee, Kilinochchi, Galle, Hambantota or Colombo, the service rendered by the Government is equal. Everybody is treated equally. That is because the Government wants to bring about reconciliation in the country. So, at a time like this, making a statement of this nature is very unfortunate. We should condemn this statement; such a statement by the Ambassador is a very clear instance of where the "wish is father to the thought". This is something that nobody expects in the country. The war coming back or erupting again is something that we never expect. So, if this is the wish, I would say that the "wish is father to the thought". We do not, for a moment, condone this type of statement which is adverse to the reconciliation efforts of the Government.

Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy. You can commence your speech now and go on till the Sitting is suspended at 12.30 p.m. Then, you can continue your speech again at 1.00 p.m. [12.23 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, thank you very much for giving me opportunity to speak on this Debate. Before that, let me have the indulgence of this House to refer to what the Hon. Minister of External Affairs said yesterday. He said that he rejects the Resolution passed in the UNHRC. If that is so, the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association will have to report it back to their headquarters.

Probably, the Minister is not aware of what is happening in the Ministry. On behalf of the Ministry, Mr. Nivard Cabraal, the Governor of the Central Bank has entered into an agreement with a company in America to do propaganda work to bring about a rapprochement between Sri Lanka and America and we are paying Rs. 3 million monthly. I want to find out whether the Minister is aware of it or not. The same thing is happening in the UK as well. We have retained a company and we are paying money monthly to do propaganda work.

Now, I also want to at this stage, refer to various attacks made on the Uthayan newspaper. The first attack was on 23rd August, 2005; the second attack on 2nd May, 2006; the third attack on 11th August,2006 and later there were attacks on 15th August, 2006, 18th August, 2006, 10th September, 2006, 29th April, 2007, 26th January, 2008, 26th February, 2009, 24th March, 2009, 4th February, 2010, 28th May, 2011, 27th December, 2012 and 10th January, 2013. No action has been taken by anybody to arrest the people who are

1629 1630

responsible for it. Sir, we cannot ask the mother as to where the thief is. The mother will not tell us.

What happened to Ekneligoda? What happened to Lasantha Wickrematunge? Is this the media freedom that we are speaking of? I want the Government to take immediate action to arrest the people who are responsible for the attack on the Uthayan newspaper.

With regard to economic development of this country, the Hon. (Dr. ) Sarath Amunugama who is the Deputy Minister of Finance knows very well that we have got four or five white elephants. Unless we get rid of them, nothing can be done towards development. If you want to develop the country, you will have to make the country favourable for foreign investors to come and make investments here. That is the only way to develop the country.

With regard to the Norochcholai Power Plant, what was told was that it remains closed almost all the time. I understand that you were trying to give it back to the company which sold it to you.

Another company in Jaffna entered into an agreement to supply 30 kilowatts of electricity per month but gave only 15 kilowatts. When the Minister wanted to cancel the agreement, he was not allowed to do so.

Then, with regard to public enterprises, kindly see that you take steps to bring down the losses made due to mismanagement and corruption in them. I am a Member of the COPE and I know what is happening there. I have been questioning almost everybody who comes before COPE and I think the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, the Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning will understand what I am trying to say. Please see that the losses are brought down to the minimum and get it done by a person who can do it efficiently.

When India gained Independence, the famous socialist Kripalani said, what we now want is not any isms; capitalism, communism or socialism but an efficient government.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Vinayagamoorthy, you can continue with your speech after lunch.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Okay.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . . .

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Thank you, Madam Chairperson, for allowing me to continue with my speech after the lunch interval. I am sorry that I am not in a position to say anything valuable because, at the moment, both the Ministers concerned are not here.

What the country needs now is economic development and elimination of bribery and corruption in the Government. How can you bring about economic development? We cannot take any more loans because we have gone to the maximum level. So, we will have to make the country suitable for foreign investors to come and invest. That is the only way you can develop the country.

Then, I want to speak about the Registration of Documents Ordinance also. But, the Minister concerned is not here. If you take the Registration of Documents Ordinance, you find these rates in Chapter 135, not in Chapter 117. You have increased the rates exorbitantly.

1631 1632

[ . ]

2013 10

Even for a small affidavit, a person has to pay Rs. 250 and for everything, you need an affidavit. So, how can you expect a poor litigant to affix stamps to the value of Rs. 250 on an affidavit? Earlier, when we went to the Land Registry with stamps worth only Rs. 2.50, we could see all the documents and come. But, now, you want us to pay Rs. 500 to obtain a certified copy of a deed. Then, earlier, registering a power of attorney was done free but now you will have to pay Rs. 1,500 to get it registered. Do you not think that it is a very high rate? When the Minister in charge comes, he must be informed that all the rates he has fixed are on the high side. He will have to reconsider his decision to change the First Schedule so that you can help the poor litigants.

Madam, the main thrust of the Statement made by our Leader, the Hon. R. Sampanthan, in the morning is that in the presence of police officers from the Kilinochchi Police Station, people picked up stones and threw at our office and we did not get any reply for that. So, in Jaffna, what we now want is a civil government. Can the Jaffna people not have a civil government? It is four years after the war. Everything is being controlled by the Governor, who is a military person and Major General Hathurusinghe, the Security Forces Commander of Jaffna. All the officers there, including police officers, have to take orders from them. Are we not entitled to have a civil government in Jaffna? In 24 villages in the Valikamam North, 28,270 people have to be resettled, but they have not been resettled because the army is not allowing them to be resettled. So, I have filed a case in the Supreme Court and I am supporting them on the 13th of May.

Then, coming back to what the Hon. Minister of External Affairs said yesterday, I have got a letter with me, which was sent to me by the Office of the Leader of the Opposition in that regard and which states, I quote:

The Secretary General of the Commonwealth has acted in Item 18 of the Perth Ministerial Action Group recommendations adopted in Perth in 2011. .........."

"He used his good offices to engage with the government of Sri Lanka regarding the violation of the Commonwealth values, which are in accord with UN Declaration in this regard.

Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, Minister of External Affairs categorically rejected the Geneva Resolution in his reply on 9 April, 2013 in the House.

The rejection is in effect, a rejection of the Commonwealth values.

The result is that the Secretary General of the Commonwealth has no longer a role to play.

This is a matter that should be brought to the notice of the Secretary General.

Although the Hon. Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs is not here, I request him to reconsider the rates he has fixed. That is, to get a certified copy of a

deed, we will have to pay Rs. 500; to register a power of attorney, we will have to pay Rs. 1,500 which earlier was done free and to go through the registers, we will have to again pay Rs. 500. Earlier, it was a matter of paying a mere Rs. 2.50. So, I hope the Hon. Minister would seriously consider my request and see that these rates are revised.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara) . . rose.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Yes, Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara?

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara) Madam, there is a small clarification to be made. The Hon. Member stated just now that there is a military government in Jaffna, which is a blatant untruth. In Jaffna, we have a civil administration, but definitely, the military is assisting it. The forces have demined more than 500,000 landmines and also built houses. The TNA has never given even a cup of tea to these soldiers who are engaged in demining, risking their lives for the Tamils to resettle. So, I must object to that statement. There is absolutely no military government; there is a civil government, but the military is assisting the normal day-to-day life of the Tamil people. - [Interruption.] No. The TNA is not doing anything for the welfare of the Tamil people in Jaffna.

[1.09 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Madam Chairperson, I think I got an early opportunity today to have my say on the Bills that have been presented before the House.

Madam, I crave your indulgence to digress a little, firstly, to point out certain erroneous and misleading news reports about our speeches in Parliament in some of todays Tamil newspapers. When the Hon. Sampanthan was speaking, it is true that we, the Hon. Abdul Cader and myself, interrupted. I said in my speech itself that that

1633 1634

must be correctly reported by my good friends of the Tamil media in the Gallery and it had not been done. So, it becomes a matter of Privilege. We did not object to the Hon. R. Sampanthan speaking about the Muslims. Anybody can speak about the Muslims. Even the people who chased away the 100,000 Muslims - this must be reported clearly - can speak about the Muslims; even the people who massacred those who were praying in the Kattankudy Mosque can speak about the Muslims now and even those LTTE cadres who cut and chopped children who were born just the previous day, can speak about the Muslims. They brought those children to us when we went to Eravur.

One of those private channels in its news bulletin said that they are not coming and they have cancelled it. But, in the morning, when listening to Mr. Hudson Samarasinghes programme Dasa Desin - everybody listens to that in the morning - you could get all the information. The Delegation has already arrived. That is a great victory that shows the bond of friendship and understanding that Delhi is having with Colombo and Colombo is having with Delhi. This is what our future is going to be.

While launching the Central Bank Report, he said Rs. 226 billion has been expended for the development of the Jaffna area in the North. That is, Rs. 226 billion! I want to tell this to the Parliamentary Delegation which is here and also let the foreign press report this for the '' to

know and '' to know. Now, Madam Chairperson, what happened to Ms. Jayalalitha? This same lady, until Prabhakaran died, was wearing a bulletproof jacket.

before the world community, I should say. So, you had better first of all - ! Plead with the Muslims to forgive you; ask forgiveness from them. Then only, we can get up in this House and say, You have at least realized your former follies.

Today, I am ashamed of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. He is criticizing and attacking Major General Hathurusinghe, Commander for Jaffna. And, my good Friend, the Hon. Sarath Weerasekara, MP, intervened at the correct time. Major General Hathurusinghe is also a very good friend of mine. The Hon. Vinayagamoorthy said that there is a military regime or rule in the North. There is only a civil administration in Jaffna. So, do not give the wrong signal to the world. This is what you did to the Muslims in Jaffna. There is a civil administration in the Eastern Province. There is a Governor in the Northern Province; there is a Muslim Governor in Colombo; there is a lady Governor in Galle, Mrs. Kumari Balasuriya, the beloved wife of our Minister, the Hon. (Dr.) Jagath Balasuriya. All these people are engaged in civil administration. Also, there is the Secretary; there is the Government Agent; there is the Mayor of the Jaffna Municipal Council. They are all Tamils. There are various Pradeshiya Sabhas won by you. You won it. They are all running a civil administration. Now, you have come here. I am again asking the Hon. Sampanthan, have you spent a single cent through your Decentralized Budget for the development of the Tamils in the North? Rs. 226 billion, for the development of the North, is being spent by our President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa for the good of the Tamils

Then, Madam Chairperson, , ? . . , . , . airport ; ; ; .

See the benefits of this Mattala Airport project. The whole world should know and they know it. I have got all the papers ready here but I have no time to read about the beauty of Mattala: the great concept of Mattala. The future of Sri Lanka depends on the development of Mattala and Hambantota.

I must also tell in this House today, Madam Chairperson, that the Muslims in the Eastern Province like it very much. If you can operate Haj flights annually, it is very easy for them to come to the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport from Amapara, from your district, Batticaloa and from the Trincomalee District by wearing Ihram cloth in order to perform the Holy Haj or Umra pilgrimage. They need not come and spend days in Colombo and then change into Ihram. There also, the President has helped the Muslim community in order to perform Haj very conveniently from the Mattala Airport. See the benefits. You must know the benefits of this Mattala Airport? The establishment of the international airport in the Southern region will serve as an alternate international airport to the Bandaranaike International Airport at Katunayake.

1637 1638

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . Then, Madam Chairperson, new ventures such as general aviation and non-aviation sports facilities would be available at the airport at low cost. Also, this airport would be ideal to provide airport-related industries such as aircraft maintenance, aircraft workshops, engine repair shops, training schools and flight training facilities at low cost.

Madam Chairperson, the Hon. Minister of Water Supply and Drainage has just arrived here. Also, I must mention that he is giving water to the Southern Province.

Then, another benefit is the growth of the agriculture-related industries due to the improvement of cargo. That will enhance the economy. Cargo will be a lucrative business for this location as it covers a huge agricultural processing zone which produces vegetables, fruits, dairy products et cetera.

Then, the tourism and hospitality industry would flourish with the integrated development of the port and

airport in the Southern region. So, see the benefits. Every country, every nation has one or two alternative airports. We must have a second runway in case something happens. If your '' and '' do not allow us to land in Madras, what will happen to our aircraft with all the 200 or 300 passengers? His Excellency the President has thought of it very well. Now, we could say, "Here is the Mattala Airport in our own land. Come and land here". After the repairs, the Muslims going for Haj or the other travellers will take off from there.

Then, Madam, another benefit is to create indirect job opportunities by way of additional business ventures that would form as a result of airport operations and also create aviation related industries.

But, our Leader treats all the Members equally and in a very good fashion.

Then, coming back to the benefits of the Mattala Airport, another is the creation of direct skilled and semi-skilled employment opportunities. The employment of thousands of people from the South is a benefit to the community.

But, now you have projected the debt to GDP ratio to decline to 60 per cent by the year 2020, for which it will take another seven years. By that time what will happen to this country?

Now, I would like to talk about the situation of banks. IMF is not willing to grant loans.

US Dollars 450 million was invested in Greece Bonds by the Governor of the Central Bank without the approval of the Monetary Board and the Cabinet. How did he deposit that money in a bankrupt bank in Greece? How are you going to get that money back? Now, the NSB is going to get loans worth US Dollars 1 billion from foreign banks at the risk of the poor people. Who is going to use that money? Your Government. You have to pay for that in Sri Lankan Rupees. There will be a downfall of this bank very soon like what happened in Cypress. Ultimately, the UNP will have to take in all these sufferings and bring the country to order. That is what is going to happen.

are being debated. As you know, these Bills primarily deal with increasing the revenue chargeable on the said documents. Some of these laws deal with the revenue as at the year 1902. The Bill to amend the Powers of Attorney Ordinance is an example.

Let us now take the Powers of Attorney (Amendment) Bill. Earlier it cost Rs.3.75 for the registration of a power of attorney. But, the documents itself would have cost much more. On any cancellation or revocation of power of attorney, the State coffers received only Rs.1. Since the 1st of July 1902, the State revenue had been in this manner.

Then, with regard to the registration of documents, for any caveat registration for a period of two years, the fee charged was Rs. 12.50 as per the Registration of Documents (Amendment) Law, No. 19 of 1976. The fee charged for an application for copies of extracts of any deed was only Rs. 2.50. That also came into effect by an amendment brought in 1976. Likewise, the fee charged for folio extract was Rs. 2.50.

Mr. Speaker, you will see that the revenue structure is archaic and not realistic. We have been stagnating for centuries without updating the Government revenue machinery in several spheres. These are the ills of the past. Unfortunately, our past leaders lacked the vision and the initiative in the interest of the people of our country. It is pertinent to say that His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa is thinking in terms of the future. In this regard, I wish to quote a statement of His Excellency the President as reported in yesterdays "Daily News".

It states, I quote:

We should think of a development that would take place in 20 to 30 years and the people are being empowered to face this development challenges in the future.

Therefore, the vision of President Mahinda Rajapaksa is to do development work which would pay dividends even after 20 to 30 years. So, he is one of the most visionary leaders of our time. This reminds me of how some of our leaders had acted in the past without thinking far, which had been detrimental to the interest of the country. I can cite a very good example. In 2001, the UNP Government repealed the Finance Act, No. 11 of 1963 permitting the sale of land to foreigners without paying any tax. As a result of that, you can see what has happened now. In Galle, almost the entire prime lands fell into the hands of foreigners and today Galle is like a fortified foreign State. The value of a perch of land in this area is around Rs. 5 million. This has prevented Sirisena, Banda, Mohamed and Raja buying lands in this area. A good part of our coastal belt is also owned by foreigners. His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa wants the fruits of the soil of our motherland to be reaped by our own citizens and through the Budget Proposals of 2013, the President proposed to prohibit the sale of lands to foreigners.

1695 1696

[ ]

2013 10

Let us have a look at the neighbouring countries, especially the emerging economies, like Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Myanmar, Vietnam and Philippines. Bangladesh prohibits foreign companies buying land. Cambodia prohibits foreign nationals owning more that 40 per cent of shares in companies that buy land. In India, lands cannot be leased out to foreign companies for more than five years without having the permission of the Reserve Bank of India. The maximum duration of the lease contracts is 99 years.

In Myanmar, foreign companies cannot purchase or own land. But, they may lease land for a period up to 50 years. In Vietnam, foreigners cannot buy land but may lease land from an industrial zone for a maximum period of 70 years. In Philippines, the Constitution prohibits foreign companies from buying land.

We are a proud nation, Sir. I must say that we entice foreigners to come and invest here, but at the same time, we also safeguard the interests of the citizens in our country. Nobody can say that by doing so, we had failed to bring in foreign investment.

As the Deputy Minister of Investment Promotion, I would like to emphasize the fact that out of the total Foreign Direct Investments in the country from the inception of the BOI, 67 per cent had been during the period of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. This Government had the strength and courage to overcome all this and work for the betterment of Sri Lanka. If we look back at the economic progress since 2005, it would be seen that our economy has been very steady and growing.

Then, I would like to point out some facts highlighted by the Governor of the Central Bank yesterday while presenting the Central Bank Report for 2012 to His Excellency the President. The inflation has dropped to a single digit. What I would like to highlight is that we have continuously maintained the inflation on a single digit for the past 50 months. The unemployment has dropped to 4 per cent. Infrastructure development, since the defeat of terrorism, has been amazing. The per capita income was US Dollars 2,836 in 2011and in the year 2012, it had increased to US Dollars 2,923. If you take this in rupee terms, the per capita income which was at Rs. 313,506 in 2011 has increased to Rs. 373,001 in 2012. The growth rate has increased as never experienced in the history of our country.

Sir, we have achieved these milestones despite the challenges we had to face from many quarters within and beyond the shores of this country. Some of the challenges had drastic impacts on our economy. The embargo imposed on oil from Iran did affect us in a big way. We had to incur additional expenditure on oil imports. When you compare Sri Lanka with other countries in the region, you could see that our economy is very resilient. We know that the so-called developed countries are in crises. In some countries, the banking sector has collapsed but

our banking sector is expanding. That indicates, Sir, how resilient we are as a nation.

So, Sir, this economic progress has to continue and these revenue proposals are only a part of this process. Therefore, the duty of all of us here is to support these Bills and contribute to the country's progress, of which the future generation would become the largest beneficiaries.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. R. Yogarajan. You have 15 minutes. [5.01p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Hon. Speaker. This is the first opportunity I have got to speak before you. I consider it a privilege because generally I am listed as the last speaker, and you preside in the mornings.

Sir, I was waiting for the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena to be present in this House today because last time when I spoke here, I raised an issue about the airfare to Chennai and Trichy, where the per passenger mile charge is in the region of Rs. 50 - Rs. 60, whereas to UK and Paris, it is in the region of Rs. 12 - Rs. 14. He got up and said that it is because of the landing cost and take-off cost for airlines; whether it is to Trichy or to London it is the same though the distance maybe different and that is why Trichy and Chennai flights are so expensive. Today, we see advertisements in the newspapers saying that the airfare to Mattala is only Rs. 4,990. It is almost the same distance as to Trichy but it is Rs. 4,990. You compare it with the charge that the Sri Lanka Air Force charges from passengers flying from Colombo to Jaffna.

They have to pay Rs. 18,000 return fare to Jaffna. If they are possibly going through Mattala, it maybe cheaper for them. This is the way this country is ruled today where nobody gets a fair deal. The Government does as it pleases. We have fundamental rights where everyone has to be treated equally, but a person flying to Mattala - maybe to promote that airport - has to pay Rs. 4,990 whereas, another person flying to Jaffna has to pay Rs. 18,000. These are the things that bring disrepute to this country. This Government has to think again. The Mattala Airport is being promoted everyday in all media as a great achievement. If it is a development, people would recognize it. I do not see any reason for the Government to promote this airport. Promotion can come only when flights are coming in and going out, not through forced flights where a SriLankan Airlines flight from Colombo

to Bangkok stops over at Mattala and one or two persons get in and on the return flight, maybe one or two persons get off at Mattala. So, the economics of this airport is a big question mark. To justify it, the Government propagates it as a development effort.

In the same way, you are planning airports in Kandy and Nuwara Eliya. I have explained in this House before that there is a flight to Nuwara Eliya which lands in the Gregory Lake. It has only eleven seats and it is always less than half full. So, there is a greater need to build houses in Nuwara Eliya than to build an airport there. This Government must realize that. It is only because you do not realize this, that there are issues of this nature.

The "Mirror Business" Supplement of Daily Mirror of 4th April, 2013 states, Banks cut gold exposure on possible price crash". They give a list of the banks and their exposure:

Peoples Bank - 35 per cent; Bank of Ceylon - 20 per cent; Commercial Bank - 3.3 per cent; Hatton National Bank - 16 per cent; Sampath Bank - 25.3 per cent; Seylan Bank - 14 per cent; National Development Bank - 3.1 per cent; PABC - 16.4 per cent; Nations Trust Bank - 16 per cent; Union Bank - 9.2 per cent and DFCC - 3.3 per cent.

Why is this situation? This situation has risen because the people in the country are suffering. They do not have money for their day-to-day expenses or to meet emergencies. So, they have to pawn their gold jewellery. The savings they made when they were doing better, are today being pawned and the people are living on pawned money. This is the status of the economy today. Everyday you are bringing in more and more taxes. You have brought 11 Bills, all of which are imposing burdens on the people. All these burdens are revenue measures for the Government.

Then, there is a cess on tea. You increased it to 10 per cent, but when the industry protested, you reduced it again to Rs. 6 per kilo. The Government is collecting Rs. 3 billion from that. Any export cess is supposed to support that industry. But, out of Rs. 3 billion collected from the tea cess, only Rs. 250 million is received by the Tea Board for promotion. But, they cannot do promotion with Rs. 250 million. The recurrent expenditure alone of the Tea Board is Rs. 250 million. So, they keep that institution going but there is no real development of the industry. Today, the tea exporters are making Rs. 16 billion whereas the tea manufacturing companies are making only Rs. 2 billion to 3 billion. If these tea manufacturing companies are supported by the Tea Board to move up in the value chain, then these tea manufacturing companies will earn more money. If they have more money, they would be able to share it better

1701 1702

with the workers who have got a very small salary increase during the negotiations recently. We have seen that the inflation during the last two years is in the region of 50 per cent as far as the produce that the estate worker buys is concerned. Most importantly, flour prices went up by 44 per cent. Kerosene oil prices went up by 107 per cent. Sugar prices went up by 45 per cent. With all this, people are suffering. But, a salary increase of 20 per cent has been negotiated by a major union, which is with your Government. So, all this has failed the people and more and more jewellery that these people own will go into these banks. But, are these banks safe today? Because with 40 per cent exposure to gold loans and the gold prices crashing in the world market, the prospects of these banks are in danger. There is a possibility of these banks crashing if gold prices fall too low. So, the economy itself is very unstable.

Today, there is a big haa-hoo about the Central Bank Report that was released yesterday. The main thing that they are talking about is the so-called increase in the per capita income to US Dollars 2,900. But, no man in this country feels that he is earning US Dollars 2,900 per year. Nobody gets more than Rs. 300,000 individually, maybe, except five per cent of the cream of this country. But, the exposure by the Central Bank shows that our loan portfolio has gone up to Rs. 6 trillion which works out to Rs. 300,000 per individual. Every man, woman and child in this country, even the newborn, is indebted to the extent of Rs. 300,000. But, 90 per cent people of this country cannot borrow Rs. 300,000 from a bank today. - [Interruption.] - No, Rs. 6 trillion was not there. Even in 2004, it was Rs. 1,400 billion and not Rs. 6 trillion, Hon. Minister. So, where are we going?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena ) The per capita income has doubled. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The per capita income is supposed to have doubled. But, the people do not feel it. They are living in poverty; they are living in great difficulty. You could see that the Peoples Bank alone has given Rs. 190 billion on gold loans. This is the status of the country and the status of the people. So, the Government has to rethink.

You have brought another piece of legislation, the Finance Bill, which was passed yesterday where you are showing the agriculturalists who suffered recently due to floods and you are trying to raise further revenue for the Government. As I said, the cess does not reach the tea

industry. Similarly, you are showing the agriculturalists and going to charge 1 per cent on the turnover of the banks, finance companies and insurance industry. This is supposed to support the people who might have disasters; the agriculturists who might be facing floods or other calamities. But, how much of this is really going to reach them? This is again seen as another revenue measure and not as a measure to support the agriculturalists. So, the people in the country are today clamouring for a better deal; for you to run the Ceylon Electricity Board more efficiently without increasing the electricity charges; for you to run the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation more efficiently without increasing the prices of petroleum, but you reduce it according to world market prices. The same expectation is there for you not to tax food items so that the people can have at least their basic needs at a price that they could afford. So, the Government has to rethink its economic polices in favour of the common man in this country and not the ultrarich of the country.

Thank you.
