(c) Not relevant : ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, can you please give me the answer to (a) (iii), that is, the number of additional jobs created in the textiles and apparel industry.

: ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) In 2009, it is 364,031. There are 12 sectors. : ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) In 2012? : ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) It is nearly 260,000. : ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, can I know the total revenue obtained from taxes imposed from 2009 to 2012?

349 350

: ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Hon. Member, what is the question number? : ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is (b)(ii). : ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) The subject of revenue earned from taxes imposed on the industry does not come under the purview of this Ministry. I think it comes under the Ministry of Finance and Planning. .

: ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, you are trying to do your best for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in a bad environment. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is contributing to the drop in the trade balance in the country. How are you, as the Minister, going to stimulate the exporters in this country to increase exports and reduce imports into this country?

: ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) We are working on that. There are a lot of reasons for that.

: ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) In 2009, you had 364,000 people working in the textile trade and that has reduced to 260,000 in 2012.

: ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) It has not reduced, there is an addition of 264,000 in 2010.

: ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) In 2004, when we, the UNP Government under the leadership of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, handed it over to you, there were 682 garment factories with 484,000 people working. Now, you have only 212 garment factories and only 199,000 people working. The thrust industry that we developed -

: ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Hon. Member, at that time there were more than 800 factories but exports in the garment sector was only

about US Dollars 2 billion. Now, there is a reduction in the number of garment factories but the export is nearly US Dollars 4 billion.Why? It is because the factories were there only for the purpose of getting quotas.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . : ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That agreement concluded long ago. The problem that you are faced with is the lack of labour GSP. These are problems that have been created by your heinous and crime-oriented Government, which cannot face the international community. As a minority Minister in the Cabinet, subject to harassment in your own sector and your religion, what are you doing to ensure that you bring about decency in governing this country?

: ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Even with the GSP Plus cut, our exports have increased.

: ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, there is no permanent Chairman in your EDB. When are you going appoint a permanent Chairman? The acting Chairman is Mr. Marikkar, if I am not wrong.

: ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Hon. Member, today I appointed a Chairman.
