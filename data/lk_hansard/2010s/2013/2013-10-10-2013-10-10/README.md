. . Question proposed.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , .

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ENTERPRISES [1.50 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am thankful to you for providing me this opportunity to raise this Motion in regard to the COPE Report. I move,

"The Report of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) was tabled in Parliament on 23rd July, 2013 albeit after an inordinately long delay. No explanation was given for the delay.

Be that as it may, the Report highlights the sorry plight of Sri Lankas Public Sector.

Article 148 of the Constitution provides that:

'Parliament shall have full control over public finance. No tax, rate or any other levy shall be imposed by any local authority or any other public authority, except by or under the authority of a law passed by Parliament or of any existing law'.

Clearly then, Parliament is the custodian of the finances of the Republic and it is this custodianship that COPE exercises.

It is the bounden duty of Parliament, therefore, to protect the States investments in the several enterprises. And, it is this duty that COPE exercises for and on behalf of Parliament.

Millions of Rupees squandered in loss-making ventures is only half the story.

The other half is a long litany of mismanagement compounded by corruption at unprecedented levels.

Some of the observations made in the Report are:

, (1) The need to increase salaries of Professionals in the Public sector;

(2) The need to appoint Private Auditors;

(3) Improper Financial Planning;

(4) The need to Strengthen Internal Audit;

(5) The Unsatisfactory Debt Management;

(6) The Adverse Role of Trade Unions on Decision-Making;

(7) The need to Shift to a Cost Accounting System;

(8) The need to appoint qualified persons as Heads of Institutions.

The Report also points out that nearly 30 institutions had not tabled their 2009 Annual Reports in Parliament as at 30.06.2013 and nearly 50 institutions have failed to table their Annual Reports in 2010 in Parliament as at 30.06.2013.

The Report also refers to the need for positive action against those found guilty of cheating and corruption.

In the circumstances, will the Government inform this House what action they propose to take regarding the findings and recommendations of the Committee on Public Enterprises."

That is the Motion I am presenting and to that, I would like to add a few comments with regard to the findings of this Committee.

First of all, I would like to commend and thank the Hon. DEW Gunasekara who was the Chairman of COPE and the group of Parliamentarians who assisted him in processing the Report and examining nearly 275 Government institutions. A great deal of time had been given for the consideration of the Report. It was a tremendous task that he had concluded. Maybe, it was delayed; nevertheless, it has come to this House even at this stage.

Sir, I would like to, in passing, mention that this COPE was originated in 1980 during the time of President J.R. Jayewardene. It was his view that the COPE should be a separate body of Parliament as against the Public Accounts Committee. In the good old days, the Public Accounts Committee went through all of it. Subsequently, it was separated after amendment of the Standing Orders. I am proud to say that I was one of the first Members of this Committee that was created in 1980

1251 1252

and none of the other Members who were there at that time are here in this House today. Subsequently, for about eight years I did chair the COPE.

In the Report, the Hon. DEW Gunasekara has made some very important remarks in the Chairmans Note. In that he states, I quote:

" The attention of the executive

That means the Ministers and the President.

.... should be drawn to the need for enhancing the quality of leadership.

What do you mean by "quality of leadership"? It is the head of the institution.

...... of the Public Enterprises, through the appointment of professional, experienced and skilled personnel.

This is the most important thing. He has summarized all his recommendations in this paragraph. He goes on to state:

They should be made fully answerable and accountable for their performance.

Then, he states, I quote:

This can be ensured by the maximum degree of autonomy and minimum degree of interference...

That means, giving full freedom to the leader of the institution to manage it without interference. From whom? From the politicians. That is what he clearly means. I quote:

There is a dearth of professionals in the field of Accountancy which can only be corrected through a deserving remuneration.

He puts everything in a nutshell. I will go on; there are further recommendations. Then, he goes onto state, I quote:

....a higher level of accounting and auditing in keeping with international standards.

How can you do the auditing and the accounting according to international standards when the Auditor-General is very poorly paid? I am told that he gets a salary of only about Rs. 45,000. What a responsible post it is? It is a post that is created by the Constitution. It is high time that he should be paid at least Rs. 250,000 a month. If you want to get proper auditing done according to international standards, you have to get the correct man, the correct people and also in the case of other professionals. Then, he further goes on to say that the Constitutional responsibility of financial control rests mainly on the Chief Accounting Officers.

Therefore, if these institutions are not performing, if there is corruption, if there is mismanagement, then it is the Secretary of that particular ministry who should be held responsible. Is that happening today? Do the Secretaries call up all institutions that come under their ministries and have discussions about their management or examine the comments made by the Auditor-General or the internal audit?

I do not think that is happening. This is one area commented on quite rightly by the Chairman and the Committee.

Then, the Report, under No. 01 of page 4, also states, I quote:

Need for Increasing the Existing Salary Scales of Professionals in the Public Sector

Now, how can you get a good accountant if he is paid only Rs. 25,000 or Rs. 30,000? The salary that a clerk in the private sector gets is more than that. You cannot get a Chartered Accountant, a fully qualified Accountant or a Management Accountant for that salary. You have to increase their salaries. The Public Service Regulations will have to be amended if you want to have proper people to manage the public enterprises.

Then, there is another comment in the Report about the "Appointment of Private Auditors". Now, various accountancy firms are being hired by institutions and there is no proper auditing done. Their remarks and recommendations are not up to the mark or not in keeping with the Financial Regulations.

Another recommendation, No. 04 , on page 5 states, I quote:

The Committee strongly recommends that this is a practice which should be discouraged by all means. The General Treasury is recommended to have a close monitoring whether the public corporations and other institutions strictly adhere to the Treasury guidelines, .....

Is that happening? I do not think so. There is no proper supervision even by the Treasury in regard to some of these enterprises.

Then, under No. 08 - "Overstaffing" on page 6, the Report states, I quote:

"The losses incurred by certain institutions such as Sri Lanka Transport Board and plantations companies...."

- among others,

".....had been mainly due to the excess staff in the institutions."

You go on appointing persons or giving employment to people at the request of politicians, and the institutions are suffering as a result of that.

1253 1254

[ ]

2013 10

Then, No. 10 is, "Subsidiaries of state owned institutions not accountable to the Parliament". The subsidiary business is another racket to bypass the Financial Regulations and the audit. There, a lot of irregularities are taking place.

Then, No. 14 is titled "Appointments of heads of institutions and members to the Board of Directors", which I mentioned earlier. Under that, the Report further states, I quote:

The Committee is of the opinion that the appointment of personnel as heads of institutions should be made only by considering their qualifications and experience in the relevant discipline. The matter remains the same even in relation to the appointment of board members as their decision making has a huge dependency on their knowledge and experience in the relevant area of interest.

This is a big problem. Here, you make appointments at the recommendation of politicians: the Minister, the President or somebody. He could be the most incapable person to run that institution; he may not have any qualifications on the subject which that Board is being created for. Sir, in India - we had that experience; we had been to India and visited the COPU - there is a panel of officials created in the Treasury. When there is a vacancy in a Board or in the position of a Chairman, it is from that panel that a person is appointed. The panel consists of the most qualified people in different fields; whether it be accountancy, management, agriculture or engineering, there is a panel. There is no question of the minister or anyone else trying to recommend a person. But, that does not happen in this country. I have visited India along with the other Members of the COPE at that time. We went to New Delhi and had a very good session in regard to the affairs of the COPE.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We also went to the Fertilizer Corporation, do you remember?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) That is right. That is another matter. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) There were no professionals. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The Hon. Minister is quite right. We did have a number of field inspections. There was a full inspection on the Mahaweli, from the very beginning - from Kandy right down to Systems A, B, and C.

We also visited the plantation industries. Like that, we did not sit in the Committee Room and do the scrutiny of a particular institution, but we personally went and made field visits. The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena was one of those Members and he contributed a great deal. I am thankful to him for reminding me of that.

Then, I take up the question of the presentation of Annual Reports to Parliament. It is a very serious matter. That is the only way we could get information with regard to the performance of any particular enterprise. Here, there are 30 or 40 enterprises which have not given their Annual Reports for 2009. Mind you, we have almost completed three years thereafter, but the Annual Reports have not been presented. That means, they have not finalized their accounts; that is why they cannot finalize the Annual Report and table it in Parliament. In 2010, there had been 50 odd of such enterprises. Whose money is this? This is taxpayers money that had been voted by Parliament for these institutions. I do not want to come out with those particular institutions. There is a long list here. It is very saddening that these types of things have been happening. This is not something that took place during the last couple of years; this has been going on for some time.

The management of public institutions and corporations has become a very serious problem for lack of professionals and lack of proper accountability. That accountability is being monitored by the Auditor-General and his Department. The Auditor-Generals Department is terribly understaffed. He has a problem there. Not only now, but even in those days, we had made the recommendation that that Department should be expanded if you are to continue with the public enterprises. Of course, at different times, different regimes had different policies of privatizing and so on, but today it is not happening. Everything is centred around the Governments control.

Sir, leaving all that aside, now there is something very dangerous happening in this country. In this COPE Report, we discuss what has taken place in the last couple of years: corruption, mismanagement et cetera. But, I consider that to be only the tip of the iceberg, that a couple of millions is nothing much compared to what is happening now. Over and above all of what is happening in the private sector, large-scale commission-taking goes on in another area. I am referring to the huge contracts being offered on unsolicited offers mostly by the Chinese companies that have mastered this art. This is a new art of manipulating. Now, it is a common practice in this country for various construction companies coming up with offers to construct various projects, which we have seen and which have been completed - these projects maybe for airports, ports or highways - and other major infrastructure projects that had not been included in the national planning process. The seriousness of it is that those do not come in the Budget nor do they come in the financial planning system, but they emerge from time to

1255 1256

time and are being implemented and the funny part of it is that no tenders are called before these contracts are awarded. I do not know whether this type of thing takes place in any democratic country in the world. No competitive bids are permitted. In the good old days, even when the Mahaweli and the other projects were implemented and completed by the UNP Government, there was an opportunity for all those companies connected to the country from which we had taken loans to make their offers. So that, no tenders are called before these contracts are awarded; no competitive bids are permitted. There is a one-man show. There are globally-accepted procurement procedures laid down especially in the case of unsolicited offers; there are principles that are laid down that objects should be opened out for competitive bids. The important thing is, if there is competition, you get the best deal at the lowest price for the job or the project that is at hand. But, this does not appear to have been done in any of these large-scale projects and the thinking is, if a particular projects cost is only Rs. 1,000 million, it is jacked up to Rs. 2,000 million and we do not know what happens to the extra Rs. 1,000 million that has been included in that. Sir, this is a very serious situation and I think the Government should be mindful of that. Millions of rupees of public funds are seeping into the pockets of various individuals. I do not know who the individuals are, but it is happening very systematically. In fact, these projects are announced only after they are awarded. This awarding business has been very carefully manipulated.

The Speakers who follow after I finish my speech will elaborate on this subject. They, who have done some indepth study of this manipulation, will give more details. It is a very serious thing. The allegations are that, without competitiveness and without tenders, estimates are being drawn up, that estimates are not real and that they are inflated for the benefit of the companies that are carrying out those projects, plus the people who are awarding them.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne. Order, please! Before he starts, the Deputy Chairman of Committees will take the Chair.

I would like to say that if the COPE is to be meaningful, we have to have legislative reforms. We must impose criminal sanctions on those who cheat and rob the State. We must implement the pending Audit Act, which has to be installed over a period of time. We should hold the Secretaries of Ministries as the Chief Financial Officers responsible for the finances and the governance of these institutions and we must amend the Standing Orders of Parliament, so that Parliament will be more effective in the control of public finance.

Thank you.

. , . , . . [4.31 P.M.] ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Presiding Member, the publication of the Second Report of the Committee on Public Enterprises is a momentous occasion because it exemplifies how Parliamentary Standing Committees should construct

themselves in a manner that has not been apparent in Parliament for 30 years. All credit should go to the Chairman of COPE and the three Chairs of the COPE Subcommittees - a Minister, a Deputy Minister and the most responsible and respected Member of the main Opposition Party - for ensuring that we covered almost all the institutions coming under the purview of the COPE, which had not happened before.

Sir, when, as a new Member of Parliament, I expressed astonishment at the fact that previously the COPE had only looked at a modicum of the institutions it had to consider and suggested that we work through subcommittees, one of the more experienced Opposition Members of the COPE objected vehemently, but the Chairman upheld the suggestion. I am happy to say that that Member too has acknowledged the benefit of a very simple idea.

Another area where we were able to innovate was in insisting that a deadline be given to institutions asked to provide reports. Previously, those institutions that were asked to respond but failed to do so were forgotten until the next time they were summoned, which was often years later. Fortunately, we now follow up although not as assiduously as I would wish. This is a pity, but we must appreciate that the COPE office is badly staffed and having got used to the lack of energy of the Committee in earlier incarnations, it is hard pressed to satisfy our needs. But, I must pay tribute to the staff who have managed as best possible under difficult circumstances and produced this very thorough Report, the second in three years.

The manner in which the COPE works is a tribute to the skill of the Chair in ensuring a spirit of collegiality. Government and Opposition Members work well together and also are much more polite to administrative officials who have, in turn, expressed appreciation of the manner in which we now question them and try to advise them rather than blame. Being, I suspect, one of the few Members of Parliament who had to witness the COPE from the other side, as it were, when I was Secretary to the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights, I should note that the conduct of my Colleagues now represents a sea change from the uninformed and aggressive criticism that officials sometimes had to face in the past. But, the things are certainly much better than they used to be and we have produced what, I hope, is a very helpful Report. There is still more that must be done. That is why I have proposed amendments to the Standing Orders, as was just recommended, to develop the functions of both Consultative and Oversight Committees and I am glad that it has now been decided to refer these to the Committee on Standing Orders, which might otherwise have continued to fail to meet a task it has successfully fulfilled over the last three years. I do not suppose there is any other Parliament in the world where such a thing could happen where Standing Committees fail to meet. So, I hope that the example set by the COPE will be taken to heart by that Committee too.

1299 1300

Amongst the changes I proposed are that instead of a Chairman elected by the Committee, the Committee on Public Accounts and the Committee on Public Enterprises should both have a Chair and a Deputy Chair nominated by the Speaker, in consultation with the Minister in charge of the subject of Finance. Neither Chairman nor the Deputy may be a Minister, a Project Minister or a Deputy Minister and the Chairman shall be a Member of the Opposition and the Deputy Chairman, a Deputy Minister of the Government side.

This would bring us in line with the practice in other parliamentary democracies where setting the agenda for oversight is the business of the Opposition. This used to be the practice in Sri Lanka until the system was changed by the top heavy Parliament of 1977 and the practice began of having Cabinet Ministers chairing such oversight committees. Though there have been exceptions instead, the problem is that traditions are developed in Sri Lanka at the drop of a hat and the concept behind various Parliamentary practices is not understood. It is, therefore, necessary to entrench, through regulation, the systems which are normal elsewhere.

At the same time, I tried to accommodate Government concerns about the possible partisan nature of Chairmen who might be appointed by leaving the final decision in the hands of the Speaker, following consultation of the relevant Government Minister. My view is that whilst some Members of the Opposition might use the position for party political purposes, there are others who are concerned primarily about public service and accountability and this should be recognized. But, I have also added a Deputy Chairman not only to ensure adequate Government input into the manner in which the Committees are conducted, but also to develop a bipartisan approach.

I have also suggested mandatory follow-up with regard to the reports of these Committees and I believe, Sir, with your own experience of having chaired a Standing Committee, you will appreciate this point, that there is no point producing a wonderful Report as you yourself did unless there is mandatory follow-up. But, reports should be prepared annually and instead of them being simply approved by Parliament, whereupon the recommendations shall be deemed to be recommendations to the Government, which shall accordingly consider the same and report back to Parliament within a period of six months, I have suggested that the Report be laid before Parliament and sent to the Hon. Minister in charge of the subject of Finance, who shall, within one month, respond to the report and indicate which recommendations may be accepted with a time frame for implementation. Explanations will be provided with regard to recommendations which cannot be implemented with a

description of what remedial action will be taken instead, to deal with issues raised and I think such a system would have actually benefited the deliberations of the Committee you yourself chaired. Sir, following such a response, the report shall be discussed by Parliament and after amendments, if appropriate, shall be approved whereupon the recommendations in such report shall be deemed to be recommendations to the Government, which shall be responsible for implementing the same and reporting back to Parliament within a period of six months. The Hon. Speaker will ensure that such reports are furnished on time and will raise any delays with the Head of the Executive. The purpose of this, Sir, is to ensure that there are productive responses to the report.

At the same time, I recognize that Parliament, while pursuing financial probity and accountability, may not be in a position to understand the practical considerations involved and that is why I believe it is important to give the Executive an opportunity to respond and explain what can be done and what cannot be done.

However, the incapacity to act in the way recommended cannot suffice as an excuse to do nothing, which is why I have requested that the Executive indicate what remedial action is proposed instead for any inadequacies or abuses to which attention has been drawn. This will also facilitate the next stage, which is reporting back to Parliament within six months as to the actions taken. At present, there is no method of ensuring the required feedback and sadly it almost never occurs.

In addition to these structural reforms, there are a few simple measures the Executive should implement to save a lot of time and money. Yesterday at the COPE, we suggested that the Treasury should sit together with affected agencies and revise its circulars so that we do not have endless examples of institutions being reprimanded over what is, in theory, wrong, but which no one really takes seriously. Similarly, the Government should remove all ambiguities in circulars and if instructions are to be read in combination with other circulars, this should be made clear. The Treasury should also issue clear instructions to its representatives who sit on various Boards since it is embarrassing to find institutions accused of violating Government regulations with Treasury representatives having acquiesced in this.

I mentioned these because often problems arise because good systems are not in place. But, when we spend time looking at systemic problems, we can lose sight of stringent financial oversight, which should be our main business. At the same time, we need to look at productivity, which is why the decision of the Chairman that we should concentrate in the coming year on performance too is so important. We need to ensure not only that there is no fraud, but we also need to limit waste. The recommendations we have made that many institutions should be closed is something the

1301 1302

Government needs to take more seriously, while also ensuring that Ministries responsible for such institutions take remedial action without waiting for the COPE to say what should be self-evident to them without our efforts.

Ultimately, Sir, we need to promote constitutional reforms, in general, that will ensure an efficient and effective Executive whilst ensuring Parliament is strengthened to fulfil its legislative and oversight functions. The manner in which the COPE has functioned this year with input both from the Government and the Opposition, under an exemplary Chairman, sets a standard at which we should aim in general.

But, now we work according to the Constitution, the regulations and the laws. So, we come here, we talk on this, but after that nothing much happens. Therefore, we need to formulate some kind of regulation or authority to give COPE some teeth to go into this Report because what we do here is, we just come here, talk and then go home.

There has to be some planning on income and expenditure. You cannot spend more than your earning. These are very basic management techniques, which some of these institutions have forgotten or have laid by, or they are not committing their human resource planning to these aspects of management. Therefore, I would urge this House, both the Government and the Opposition, to get together to strengthen these public institutions because if these public institutions fail, in a sense, the whole community and the whole country collapses.

In Page 47 of this COPE Report, it states, I quote:

The Committee was seriously concerned that the printing of a portion of lottery tickets had been offered to the same private firm since 1995 without calling for a new tender after the termination of the agreement entered into in the year 1995 for 3 years.

Interrelationship between organizations is also very important. Surely, the CPC and the CEB, being the two largest institutions in this country, they must have a very formal and business-like relationship. If you are supplying raw materials to another company, surely, the other company has an obligation to pay you after a certain period of time. But, here, sometimes payments are going on for, at least, seven to eight years.
