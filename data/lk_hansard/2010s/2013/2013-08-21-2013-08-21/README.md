: SELECT COMMITTEE TO RECOMMEND AND REPORT ON POLITICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL

MEASURES TO EMPOWER THE PEOPLES OF SRI LANKA TO LIVE AS ONE NATION : STATEMENT BY CHIEF OPPOSITION

WHIP ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Deputy Speaker, the United National Partys position on the Select Committee to Recommend and Report on Political and Constitutional Measures to Empower the Peoples of Sri Lanka to Live as One Nation is the subject of this Statement.

The Hon. Leader of the Opposition is currently out of the country and a comprehensive statement will be issued by him on the United National Party's position regarding the Select Committee to Recommend and Report on Political and Constitutional Measures to Empower the Peoples of Sri Lanka to Live as One Nation. In the meantime, I had undertaken to make a brief statement regarding the UNP's position on that at the Party Leaders Meeting and this Statement is pursuant to that undertaking.

Consequent to the UNHRC Resolution on Sri Lanka in May, 2009 and the visit of the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, a Joint Statement was issued by the

439 440

Government of Sri Lanka and him, wherein the Secretary-General welcomed bringing about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka, where among other matters, he stated the following. I quote:

The Government expressed its commitment to ensure the

economic and political empowerment of the people of the North through its programmes.

President Rajapaksa and the Secretary-General agreed that addressing the aspirations and grievances of all communities and working towards a lasting political solution was fundamental to ensuring long-term socio-economic development. The Secretary-General welcomed the assurance of the President of Sri Lanka contained in his statement in Parliament on 19 May 2009 that a national solution acceptable to all sections of people will be evolved. President Rajapaksa expressed his firm resolve to proceed with the implementation of the 13th Amendment, as well as to begin a broader dialogue with all parties, including the Tamil parties in the new circumstances, to further enhance this process and to bring about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka."

The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission - LLRC - made several recommendations pertaining to the solution of the ethnic problem and related matters. At the same time, an undertaking was given to expand the scope of the Thirteenth Amendment and the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution was brought in, which did away with the independent Commissions in respect of such vital areas as the Judiciary, the Police, the Public Service, elections and so on. The Government has failed in respect of implementing both the recommendations of the LLRC and its undertakings as set out in the Joint Statement with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Notwithstanding this, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition wrote to His Excellency the President on the 12th of June, 2013, seeking an appointment to discuss, among other things, the restoration of the Seventeenth Amendment, the implementation of the LLRC Report and the appointing of Commonwealth Observers prior to the elections. Yet, the President has failed to respond to his letter. Sir, I am tabling* a copy of that letter.

In the light of this, we in the United National Party fail to see the need to appoint yet another Select Committee all over again merely to go through these same matters. What we need now is a white paper setting out detailed proposals regarding the implementation of the recommendations and the undertakings already made.

Thank you. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) .

" Mr. Speaker shall be responsible for the management of

buildings, security arrangements and the general administration of the Chamber.

Sir, there is a serious situation that has arisen, putting the lives of all the Hon. Members of Parliament and the people working here into danger because this particular Member produced "" - a bullet. [Interruption.] Sir, how did he inveigle a bullet into this Chamber when there is security all around? - [Interruption.] It is a serious situation. We must examine the Hon. Member to see whether he has got a pistol also hidden inside his trouser. Therefore, Sir, I earnestly ask you to give your attention to this Standing Order and also stop the Hon. Member from speaking, arrest him and hand him over to the police. It has to be investigated. It is a threat to all our lives, Sir; it is very dangerous.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) -[ ] . . [ ]

Member, you can certainly hand it over after the Debate. But, it has to be verified whether it is a bullet or any other .

489 490

the families who have lost their loved ones due to the indiscriminate shooting by the military at Rathupaswala, Weliweriya.

The Debate today has taken very strange forms. On the one hand, the Members of the Government side are talking about the quality of the water, the pH levels. The issue of drinking water is a common problem and should not be made into a political issue. So, this issue in Rathupaswala, Weliweriya must be resolved without political differences, and the Governments resolve and commitment to address that issue should be in a responsible way.

But, the issue at hand is not just the water at Weliweriya. The most crucial issue is the manner in which the military got involved in this situation when the people protested. That is the issue at hand. On the other hand, the Opposition also, so far, takes the view that by this incident, the Government has permitted space for people who are ready to accuse the military, an opportunity of slinging mud at the military. They are worried that this one issue is going to be used to tarnish the good image of the Sri Lanka Army. I say these are the strange facets of this Debate today because every month when His Excellency the President calls out the three forces by a Gazette notification under the Public Security Ordinance to assist the police in maintaining law and order, we open ourselves to incidents such as what happened in Rathupaswala, Weliweriya. The war - as it is called - ended in May, 2009. There has been no reason why the three forces have to assist the police in maintaining law and order. Is the Sri Lanka Police so inefficient that during the last four years they have been unable to maintain law and order? Had there been any civil conflict or any incident during these four years, even if we look back, that our police force was not able to handle?

With the benefit of hindsight, looking back at the last four years, today can we honestly say that the situation in any part of the country has been such that you needed the assistance of the three forces to maintain law and order? The answer is, no. There has been no such necessity. The question then is, why is that proclamation being made and what are the effects of that proclamation? The effect is what we saw in Rathupaswala the other day. More than two years ago, in November or December, 2011, when I spoke during the Budget on the Vote of the Ministry of Defence, I appealed to the Ministers and Members of the Government not to blindly support this process of militarization in the North. I read my speech in that Hansard recently, where I have said, You might be applauding now but it will come to visit you very soon. This will come to the South very soon. And, not long after, it has come.

The army is the same in any part of the world. They are trained to do a job of work. They might be efficient at that and they do that at a war. But, where the military is involved in civilian affairs - this is one issue that we keep raising time and time again with regard to the militarys

involvement in civilian affairs in the North - it always ends in disaster like it happened in Rathupaswala in Weliweriya. We might have our own emotions, our own views with regard to the military. That is all right, but we must also act in the interest of the country; we must act in the interest of the people; we must act in the interest of the unarmed civilian population of this country. If we are to do that, then there is a place to which the military must be relegated.

It was sad to hear even the Opposition Members saying that this is going to give an opportunity to demonstrate how the military behaves. But, that is how the military behaves; there is no exception. Nowhere in the world do you have an exception. They are trained for that. That is how, even in the North, they behave and if you want to get a taste of how it happens in the North day in and day out by the large military that is present, which is involved in all the civilian affairs, you have examples like the one that we had in Rathupaswala, Weliweriya.

We regret very much that lives were lost in Weliweriya. We empathize with the people there; we understand what it is like. But, the regret is not because it happened to people who performed bodhi poojas and because it has happened to people in the South only; wherever it happens, it is regretful and to whoever it happens, it is regretful. There is no point in saying I told you so, but I appeal to the Government today to stop, to pause for a moment and think; think of this growing militarization that is taking a stranglehold of this country. You must come to your senses. If you truly love this country, you must start reversing this at least now, at least when it begins to affect the South. If you are not concerned about the North, if you thought that the people in the North are not citizens of this country, not equal citizens and they do not have the right to the protection of the State, at least now when it affects you, you must stop, you must pause, you must think and you must act. That is the only way in which this country can come out of this kind of stranglehold, which many countries have not been able to do because when the military takes over, it is very difficult for civilian rule to be established. But, I believe it is still possible if you, who are seated on the other side in the Government pews, act, if you say enough is enough.

The military did something that we appreciated. You can say you appreciated that. Our people do not appreciate that because they, the civilians, were killed in their thousands. You might appreciate that.

( ) (The Hon. Lasantha Alagiyawanna) Not civilians. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, civilians were also killed. You cannot deny that. We are not complaining about the LTTEers being killed. I am not complaining about the LTTEers being killed, but I

491 492

am certainly complaining about the civilians who were killed in tens of thousands. You might appreciate that, but you will not appreciate your own people being killed like flies on the road. At least, for your own selfish sake, you must now stand up and bring an end to this tyranny. Thank you.
