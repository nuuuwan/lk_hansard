() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) , . . . technical point . .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The institution that -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I can give you the details but I am not going to stand on that. I am going to give you the full answer.

(a) (i) At the end of December, 2012 - 13.62 metric tons (MT)(Valued at USD 727 million)

(ii) The quantity of gold that was sold by the CBSL in 2012 amounted to 20.04 metric tons.

(iii) Gold is being sold throughout the year at different prices and hence the average selling price amounted to US Dollars 1,701 per troy ounce in the year 2012. That is, one metric ton has 32,150.7 troy ounces.

(iv) Gold transactions were carried out with following approved counterparties of CBSL for gold trading:

HSBC Bank London

UBS Zurich

JPMorgan Chase Bank

Credit Suisse International

Bank for International Settlements

Merrill Lynch International Bank

Bank of Nova Scotia

Standard Chartered Bank

ANZ Bank

Toronto-Dominion Bank

Deutsche Bank

889 890

[ ]

2013 18

Crdit Agricola CIB London

Commonwealth Bank of Australia

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce

In (b)(i) you have asked, "the total quantity of gold reserves that must be maintained by the Government?" But instead of "by the Government", I would say "by the CBSL".

(b) (i) As per the Monetary Law Act, the Monetary Board shall endeavour to hold at least a nuclear reserve in gold. Accordingly, Reserve Management Guideline stipulates that the international reserves should be between 3 and 15 per cent in gold reserves.

(ii) At the end of 2012, the Central Bank held 13.6 metric tons of gold valued at US Dollars 727 million in its international reserves.

(iii) The Central Bank actively buys and sells gold from international markets depending on the market price movements for the purpose of the reserves management activities. However, CBSL does not engage in gold trading activities in domestic market. The holding of gold depends on the amount of purchases and sales made during the year. Accordingly, during 2012, CBSL purchased 23.69 metric tons of gold and sold 20.04 metric tons resulting in net purchases of 3.64 metric tons.

(iv) Gold outstanding as of the beginning of the year 2012 was amounting to 9.98 metric tons and at the end of the year 2012, it has increased to 13.62 metric tons.

(c) (i) CBSL does not hold gold locally. Accordingly, the quantity held by CBSL in its international reserves was 13.62 metric tons.

(ii) The value of the aforesaid overseas gold reserves, which I have already answered, is 13.62 metric tons valued at US Dollars 727 million at the end of 2012.

(iii) 20.04 metric tons of gold have been sold during the year 2012.

(iv) The Central Bank of Sri Lanka carries out its gold trading activities in order to make profits by exploiting the opportunities arising from the price movements in the international market.

(d) Does not arise. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you very much Hon. Minister for giving a very comprehensive answer.

May I take the opportunity to ask three Supplementary Questions based on that? I am informed that gold prices in the world have tumbled and at this particular moment instead of reserving gold for future, they have sold a quantity. I may be subject to correction but I am told that they have sold it at the time the depression took place. Has this happened? If so, why has it been done? I guess it was ill-timing and a wrong decision. What would you do about it?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Regarding the actual transactions, that is a matter that is left to the experts of the Central Bank. Now that you have raised this issue -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am sorry. The reason I am saying this is - [Interruption.]

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Let me finish my answer. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is the same bank that had bought the Greece Bonds. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is not relevant. I will give you an answer regarding the Greece Bonds also. Now that you have raised this matter, I will look into it and, if necessary, brief you about it. As regards the Greece Bonds, I have explained many times in this House that the Central Bank buys a series of bonds in its normal transactions. The Greece Bonds were only a very small fraction of its investment. Overall, the investments were very successful and within that, this small investment in Greece Bonds did not pay off.

This is done by every bank. This is not something unique to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Actually, we have to congratulate the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for having an overall plus at the end of the year. So, this talk of Greece Bonds maybe good for television and the political stage. But, the fact of the matter is that the total investments have been quite successful. This jeopardy regarding Greece Bonds is there across the banking

891 892

system. Otherwise, after all, if the Greece Bonds were successful, then there would be no crisis. The next question, please.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Losing Rs. 5 billion is not a small task when that is almost 50 per cent of what you pay out for "Samurdhi" programme. Hon. Minister, my second Supplementary Question is this. In the recent past, the newspapers have revealed that more than 30 Sri Lankans, having gold and foreign reserves, are established with FBI and all those people who have been looking into this type of funding. I am informed that this particular database when it was appeared in the Financial Times the day before yesterday, those names had been blocked. There were 30 Sri Lankan names. Hon. Minister, would you be looking into this because the Central Bank is part of it? You are basically taking people like us to courts making a big case for bringing in money. What about these people who have earned money from our taxpayers and who have been doing it at large? What action would you be taking about them and would you be revealing these 30 names in Parliament? () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, whether it is you or any other person, if any of them have contravened the laws of this country, particularly regarding the laundering of funds or regarding the evading of taxes, we will bring the full severity of the law against them. That is very clear. We are not bothered whether it is the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake or somebody else - [Interruption.] So, let the investigation reveal who his responsible. Now, there are so many allegations - [Interruption.] Let me explain. There is a new book out on the transactions of Mr. Raj Rajaratnam and his brother, which gives lots of details.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Has it also mentioned about the President meeting Mr. Rajaratnam?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I do not know that. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You can have a look whether that book has that.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Now, you are raising issues which is in regard to contravention of existing laws. So, if anybody, simply anybody has contravened those laws, they will be met with the full force of the law. That is all I can say.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . , , . -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Sir, he is misleading the House.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, no. I am asking a question, you cannot interpret that.

, . 2011.12.17 - I quote from Hansard, Columns 2570 and 2571. . . , :

Sir, I am referring to the Parliamentary Scholarship Board, which is an institution created by Act No. 22 of 2002. Now, Sir, I raised this question sometime ago and there was no response unfortunately, and I told that the Board is neither doing anything for the benefit of the scholars nor any service to Parliament. Therefore, Sir, this must be abolished.

I told this in 2011. I further said:

Also, there is a highly politicized person who is the Chairperson of this Board,...

955 956

namely, Mrs. Priyanee Wijesekera, who was the Secretary-General of Parliament. What happened then? She was holding one of the most responsible posts under the Constitution in this Legislature. Then, she goes and gets herself membership in the Executive Council of the United National Party.

. . -

I further said:

She is involved in party activities, Sir. This must be abolished and she must be sent home.

Sir, I would warn this House that even in future when persons are appointed to this type of institutions - it is an institution created by Parliament - one must be careful not to appoint such politicized persons.

Parliament has an obligation. Parliament has a duty to send her home or to appoint someone better than that.

"The Hon. Speaker has already given an order" Deputy Speaker .

We have got our triumvirate in Parliament now. The present Secretary-General is a gentleman, the Deputy Secretary-General is also a gentleman and there is a gentle lady, pretty as she is, as the Assistant Secretary-General. I know their calibre, integrity, capability and their sincerity. They will not resort to such things.

Can you justify this? I am asking this from the Members of the United National Party. What was she up to?

She was making use of the funds of Parliament. She was using a vehicle owned by Parliament. She had her staff under her paying lakhs and millions of rupees. This is very unethical, unbecoming, and, I should further say, that it is immoral on her part because she was holding a very responsible post in Parliament. Furthermore, at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall, she was having two rooms paying rent. We pointed out to her. She sat there like a tortoise sitting on eggs that she laid. She never laid any eggs for the good of the Fund, of course. That is why as far back as 2011, I told that this must be abolished. Furthermore, I make another request. When she was appointed to a political post, how was she able to occupy this post? She herself should have realized this, because she was interpreting Standing Orders and the Constitution to Parliament. I have nothing against her. Personally, she is a nice lady. She was pretty as well those days when I first came to Parliament and saw her. But, that is a different matter. You must not be immoral in your attitude while holding such a dignified office. It is a very bad example to the whole country and this is how she behaved. Now, what is the use? After having spent millions of rupees for her and for the rents of the BMICH

rooms, an inquiry must be held as to how the car was released from Parliament to her. How did she use that car for such a long time? The Hon. Leader of the House said in the House, However, throughout the period in which the Parliamentary Scholarship Board was functioning, only three public officers had been granted scholarships. . .

Hence, the objective of the establishment of the Parliamentary Scholarship Board has not been achieved at all.

If you want foreign aid or foreign scholarships, our Ministry of Finance and Planning is doing it very well. You can ask the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, the Minister of Economic Development and he will tell you as to how the funds are received and how they are spent in order to send scholars abroad and also to give scholarships to foreign students.

Madam, I have here with me the Annual Report of the Ministry of Finance and Planning for 2012 and the title of which is, Securing Stability. It is very interesting to read the contents of Table 6.53 of that Report which includes the number of foreign training opportunities received sector-wise and I will read the whole thing.

. . , ; ; . , . , .

The first sector is the Human Resources Development and the number of foreign training opportunities received is 79. Then, for the Environment sector the number of opportunities received is 66. All these are given for the benefit of the students and others.

Then, you have Economic Development sector and the number of opportunities received is 64; for Public Finance and Public Policy, it is 40 opportunities; for Regional Administration, it is 35 opportunities; for Power and Energy, it is 34 opportunities; for Industry and Trade, it is 33 opportunities; for Agriculture, it is 31 opportunities; for Small and Medium Enterprise Development, it is 30 opportunities.

It is very, very interesting to read this.

Then, for Education, it is 30 opportunities; for Mass Media and Information Technology, it is 30 opportunities and for Health, it is 28 opportunities. All scope has been met.

Then, you have Disaster Management sector and the number of opportunities received is 22; for Security and Law, it is 22 opportunities and for Infrastructure Development it is 18 opportunities.

. They have not spared any area of development. From everywhere, they have got financial assistance and spending them in a proper and progressive manner.

Then, for various other fields under AusAID Masters Programmes, they have got 18 opportunities; for Water Supply and Sanitation, it is 17 opportunities; for Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, it is 16 opportunities; for Poverty Reduction, it is 15 opportunities; for Regional Development, it is 13 opportunities; for Social Services, it is 13 opportunities; for Transport, it is 13 opportunities; for Project Management, it is 13 opportunities; for International Relations, it is 12 opportunities; for Plantation Industries, it is 10 opportunities; for Languages, it is 10 opportunities and for Airport and Aviation, it is, 15 opportunities.

, Airport and aviation. , , , . , . .

Then, for Livestock Development, it is eight opportunities; for Culture and Heritage, it is seven opportunities; for Management, it is seven opportunities; for Food and Nutrition, it is seven opportunities; for Port Development, it is six opportunities; for Road Development, it is six opportunities; for Irrigation, it is five opportunities; for Tourism, it is five opportunities; for Women Empowerment, it is three opportunities; for Mapping and Surveying, it is two opportunities; for Sports, it is one opportunity and the total number of opportunities received is 784.

This is the way you have to go along if you want to give scholarships and shower other benefits to the people. , , .

Receiving aid and assistance from the great Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that, Kinniya Bridge - connecting the Island of Kinniya to China Bay - was constructed by this Government. It was started long ago. Several Prime Ministers went and laid foundation stones but it was left only to President Mahinda Rajapaksa to complete that massive project and open it. I still remember the day when I was there, His Excellency the President came and seeing the late revered Leader Alhaj Moulavi Niyaz Mohammed in the crowd, the President got down and said, You have come to the correct place because we are connecting your people with the mainland. Today, if you go to the South, the North or the East, anywhere, there is a wonderful development of roadways. The network of roadways is marvellous.

If I may add to that, when the President was in China, a bilateral agreement was signed. Developing roads connecting with the A-9 road is one of the projects they promised to fund. It was the other day, Mr. Presiding Member, the President went to the Iranamadu airstrip, which was used as the place targeting other areas by the LTTE. The LTTE started their bombings and started their aeroplanes flying from Iranamadu. Today, what has happened? See the miracle! This is why we say, " " . See Iranamadu! It is a miracle. There is a large runway where large-bodied aeroplanes can land. It was declared open by the President. Also, he went around Nandikadal, where Prabhakaran, who wanted to divide this Island and was

also responsible for most of the killings in the history of this country, breathed his last. There, a Peoples Bank and other banks were also opened.

He also inaugurated the milk-feeding scheme in the North. Not only that, there he said something very significant: "Today, I have come to the place where the Tigers wanted to divide this country". There was a Prime Minister who signed a pact with Prabhakaran. We were told by the then Prime Minister, the Leader at that time, What the hell man! . - " . We know that because we were inside there.

Once upon a time, Turkey was the powerful Ottoman Empire which ruled almost a quarter of Europe.

Ottoman Empire, such a powerful empire it was. Mr. Presiding Member, you had been a Governor; you had been a Diplomat and you may know the history of these Arab countries.

Take for instance, China. Why are they giving all this aid and assistance? Not less than 18 trade and other agreements were signed with the President Xi Jinping during the official visit of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa to China.

So, this is the story; this is the new story heralding a new era. That is the novelty that Sri Lanka is displaying to the whole world. And, I wish the Hon. Nirmala Kotalawala all success in his endeavours as expected by His Excellency the President that he will fulfil all the deeds and particularly, complete the highways and all other road network.

Thank you very much.
