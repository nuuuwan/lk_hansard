( ) (The Chairman) .

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Hon. Chairman, yesterday the only request regarding this Bill was to define who a "terrorist" is, which we have included in the amendment to this Bill with the consent of the Members of the Consultative Committee. Except that, the Act is same. We are seeking to repeal only the following portion of Section 3 (3) on page 3 of the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Act, No. 41 of 2011. I quote:

"Provided however that, providing assistance on humanitarian grounds...."

That is the only portion that we are removing and we have introduced a portion which describes who a "terrorist" is. That is all we have done. Except that, every thing in the earlier Act is the same. Sir, we have not introduced anything else. We took the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, No. 25 of 2005 together with the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Act, No. 41 of 2011, and only defined who a "terrorist" is in the new amendment as you have suggested yesterday. [ ] Act . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, yesterday you did not discuss the amendment to the Clause (5) (2) (c) (i) and (ii). Well, we appreciate the definition of "terrorist" being brought in.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) In Act No. 41 of 2011, that is already there. On page 16 of that Act, under Section 8 (n) (b) (ii), it states, I quote:

" 'person' includes a body of persons; and

'terrorist act' includes ........"

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, you are incorporating that also into this. That is what you are saying.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, if it is already in the law, why do you need to bring it in again? Are you going to dispense with the Act of 2011?

( ) (The Chairman) It is only a clarification. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Instead of defining terrorist act separately, we put both together.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I have my reservations. At that point I will intervene. But, on this basis, we did not discuss the amendments to Clause 5 (2) (c) (i) and (ii).

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Those are there on page 16 - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What is there in the other Acts was not what we discussed yesterday.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) That is for better clarity. That is all. ( ) (The Chairman) Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Chairman. I need just a clarification from the Hon. Deputy Minister. I agree when you say that

285 286

[ ]

2013 08

at the Consultative Committee yesterday, it was only the definition of "terrorist", and we looked at that and that is all right; that is agreed. But, terrorist act had a definition earlier which you are now seeking to repeal and insert. Clause 5 (2) of the proposed amendment states, I quote:

"by the repeal of the definition of the expression terrorist act and the substitution therefor of the following:- "

Now, when you compare this Clause 5 (2) (a) and (b) with the earlier Act, it is not there in the earlier Act. Only from (c ) -

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) . . [ ]- .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) In the earlier Act, it is not there. Clause 5 (2) (a) and (b) are being introduced for the first time.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Section 8 (n)(b)(ii) (a) and (b) on page 16 of Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Act, No. 41 of 2011 states, I quote:

(a) the use of threat of action which is designated to influence the government, or to intimidate the public or a section of the public;"

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Not that; not that. That is all right. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) It goes on to state, I quote:

"(b) the use of threat of action which is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause, and such action.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Not that; that is all right. Clause 5 (2) (a) and (b) have been introduced for the first time. [Interruption.]-

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) That is right. [ ] 2011 - Section 3 (1) (a) and (b) - [Interruption,]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, the clarification is this. We accept that explanation that what was decided yesterday was only to insert a definition for "terrorist".

There is no problem with that but what is presented today has a repeal and replacement of the definition of "terrorist act" also. That also, if it is the same thing, there is no problem.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) It is the same.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) But, (a) and (b) have been brought in otherwise -

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) This states, "(a) an act which constitutes an offence within the scope of, or within the definition of any one of the Treaties specified in Schedule I hereto; (b) any other act, intended to cause death or serious bodily injury,..."

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) From where are you reading?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Section 3 of Act, No. 41 of 2011. It is the final amendment which we are repealing today.

MAKING NEW LAWS TO REGULATE CONTEMPT OF COURT PROCEEDINGS [2.48 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I move,

That this Parliament resolves that new laws should be brought in to regulate Contempt of Court proceedings as to strengthen democracy and to maintain a vibrant free media ensuring equal justice to all.

Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker for giving me the opportunity to move the Private Members Motion on making new laws to regulate contempt of court proceedings.

My reason in bringing such a Private Members Motion in today's context is owing to the activities that have taken place during the last couple of weeks; and there seems to be contempt of court proceedings which are applicable to the Members of the Opposition as well as the Members of the Government. It is not only that laws should be made for the Members of the Parliament but also for those whom we represent, the people of this country. That is the most important aspect. So, let me introduce as to what "contempt of court" is.

289 290

[ ]

2013 08

The interpretation in the Oxford Dictionary on contempt of court is, Disobedience to or disrespect for a court of law and its officers. Is there a real application of law in this country? The application of law should be similar to everyone; whether you are in the Government or whether you are in the Opposition or whether you are an ordinary citizen of this country.

Sir, as they say, the law is blind; it cannot hear or it cannot speak. But, the truth needs to come out on the basis of a free and fair judgement. On this basis, it is very important that in todays context we bring in laws in order to ensure that we are able to have free and fair laws enacted in Parliament.

When the late Hon. Dudley Senanayake was the Prime Minister he mentioned the following. I quote:

There are some things in every true democracy which no mandate can ever destroy. Even if a majority agrees, the freedom of speech, the freedom to organize political parties, the freedom of the press, the right to vote to elect your representatives at elections; these are features which cannot ever be abolished. Even if a majority agrees, a country which deprives any man of these fundamental rights and liberties is not a true democracy, is not even a really human society. A free people should not be condemned to state slavery under cover of an alleged mandate.

This is even more true according to what Jawaharlal Nehru said. He said, I quote:

We shall never allow that torch of freedom to be blown out, however high the wind or stormy the tempest.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, my reason for mentioning this is because the law gives exemptions for a Member who is in the Government today but when he is in the Opposition, the same law is applied to create a problem against him. I take the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake as an example. When he was in the Government as a Minister, he made a statement that was contempt of court as per the Supreme Court. At that time, he was hauled before court for his act which was contempt of court and he was severely warned and sent. That was when he was a Minister under the Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas Government. The same Minister became a Member of the Opposition in 2004 just after the then President (Mrs.) Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga dissolved the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghes Government.

At that particular moment, a statement that he uttered in Habaraduwa, in your good Electorate, Sir, was used to such an extent that the Hon. Member was incarcerated for two years. For what sin he committed? Just for using a word. "" -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) At that time, he was a Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) He was not a Minister. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Was he not the Minister of Samurdhi? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) He was the Minister of Samurdhi, but he was taken to task when he was an MP. - [Interruption.] Why not?

( ) (An Hon. Member) He is the complainant. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What more to be said? I am before the culprit himself. Sir, you know better. The problem is, you made the statement with an ulterior motive, political or otherwise, but he was punished when he was an MP under the UNP Government. - [Interruption.] Why not? In 2004, after the UNP Convention, it happened. We know that for a fact because we were going all over the countryside trying to protect the interests of the Member, who is now a Minister in your Government. So, you could see that there are two different standards applied, one, when you are a Member of the Opposition and the other, when you are a Member of the Government.

Once again, I seek your indulgence, Sir, on the interpretation of the Appropriation Bill. Under petition SC SD 15/2012, the Appropriation Bill was contested in the Supreme Court. At that particular moment, Justice (Mrs.) Shirani Tilakawardene, Justice Priyasath Dep and Justice (Mrs.) Eva Wanasundera gave a judgment on it. That Judgment very clearly states that, in future, any loan taken by the Government has to be notified to Parliament prior to its signing. So, before you put any extra debt on the country, you should come before Parliament, notify Parliament of it and then get it. But, what do you do? You pay scant respect to that. So, that is also contempt of court. In this instance, nothing happens.

Now, may I take another example: the infamous Impeachment of Mrs. Shirani Thilakawardene.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Shirani Bandaranayake.

291 292

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sorry, Shirani Bandaranayake. You take on all the Shiranis and all the Bandaranayakes.

( ) (An Hon. Member) She is going to be the next. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) She has not been impeached. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It may be the case, but with the next harsh judgment given against the Government, you will probably use, not 24 hours, but one hour and get her impeached. She is much more lethal than the other one. You know that.

Imagine what would be the situation had we done that. Mr. Sarath N. Silva - I will be very cautious in saying as to who the Chief Justice of the country today is - when the Impeachment Motion was in progress, gave various interpretations. But, no sooner than there was the appointment of the -

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Rauff Hakeem, what is the point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, the names of some sitting judges were mentioned. Though it was jovially mentioned, if it is reported, it may not be good since it refers to impeachments and all that. I would rather prefer those parts be expunged.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I express absolute objection to that!

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Anything contrary to the Standing Orders will be expunged. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We are supreme. We are supposed to be "supreme". What are you talking about? - [Interruption.] You brought the Chief Justice before Parliament.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) If there is anything stated contrary to the Standing Orders, such will be expunged.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I take objection to that. The Hon. Minister of Justice has got up from his slumber only now. When the Chief Justice was impeached, nothing was said. At that particular moment, nothing was said.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, we must understand - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We are supposed to be supreme. So, why do you worry about it? The others are under us.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Member, we must understand that an impeachment is a very serious procedure. Sir, they are referring to names of judges who are sitting -

( ) (An Hon. Member) So, what? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) And, they are cracking jokes. - [Interruption.] That should not happen. If they want to, let them move - [Interruption.] It would not be good if these things get reported.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

293 294

2013 08

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Ajith Perera what is the point of Order? . ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) , . . .

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , . , . .

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) But, Sir, he did not mention anything against the Standing Orders.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I have decided that if there is any statement contrary to the Standing Orders, such will be expunged. It is very clear. So long as there is nothing contrary to the Standing Orders, you do not have to worry.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is the point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, in that case, nobody needs to raise points of Order. The Chair can say, Anything contrary to the Standing Orders will be expunged. Then, you do not need -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) It can be decided either upon a point of Order being raised or by the Chair on his own. That is very clear; there is nothing to be argued about. Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, you carry on.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I like the interpretation of the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe because that is true. Without our knowing, if the Editor of Hansard can decide that it is against the Standing Orders, then we do not know what is going on.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Unless there is a decision by the Chair, the Editor of Hansard cannot decide anything on her own.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, my point is, then anything can be excluded. Last time, I raised a Privilege matter on this. They said it was not Parliamentary language that I had used when I spoke. Then, a Member must raise it and say that it is not -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) No, either a Member can raise it or the Chair can decide on its own. It is very clear.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) But, it should be on a specific matter. You cannot make an open statement and say, Whatever is against the Standing Orders will be expunged.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) No, it is up to the Chair to decide. As per the Standing Orders, the Chair takes the final decision.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) But, Sir, that final decision should be on a particular point. You cannot make an open statement.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, you carry on. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I expect that there will be a more justifiable approach in doing this type of thing.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, certainly.

295 296

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You should say that in this House, not allow some clerk somewhere to suddenly remind you that it is against -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) No official - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, you were better than a President's Counsel during the Impeachment Motion. You said, We are supreme. So, today, as Members of Parliament, why can we not say anything against any of the court judges? That is the problem.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you make your submission. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Hon. Minister of Justices amiable disposition was somewhat perturbed today when I mentioned judges names. When the countrys Chief Justice was impeached, you were stony silent as much as you were when Muslim Mosques were being broken.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) And, they were slinging mud. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes. Then, nothing happened. Hon. Minister, I know your conscience gets pricked because it was when you were on this side with us that you got the mandate. So, I know you have got to justify your actions at both ends. What to do? Remember, today these laws are being made when you are in the Government, but tomorrow when you are in the Opposition you may have to face the same laws. When we make laws, Sir, we must make them to be fair and equitable for everybody, not only to us. We are supposed to be supreme. We are supreme on behalf of our people. If a Parliamentarian can make a statement and get off scot-free, he also must be able to get off scot-free as a civilian. That is important like what you did in the incident at Habaraduwa.

Then, Sir, let me get back to the point I was trying to make. Imagine it was the Members of the Opposition who brought these allegations against the Chief Justice outside Parliament. Then, I am sure the Hon. Minister of Justice would have been very busy these days bringing charges of

contempt of court against us. But, when it comes from the Government, what happens? You steamrollered through the process and gave the Chief Justice just 24 hours - any rogue in this country is given six to seven months to defend himself in court - to justify her actions in Parliament against the allegations, the report of which ran into almost a thousand pages.

Sir, I stand here to ensure that there is a sense of justice prevalent. George Bernard Shaw said, I quote:

Democracy is a device that ensures we shall be governed no better than we deserve.

That is certainly true. But, what we are trying to say is, because the governing is bad today, we must make laws to ensure that a better government takes over tomorrow. That is what we stand for. Sir, all what we want to bring in is sanity. Mr. Sarath N. Silva, the former Chief Justice, says - I am just mentioning his name and I do not want to go out of context - that today, there are two Chief Justices. Outside, he does not have privileges like we do on behalf of our people. On such a statement uttered by him, can the present Chief Justice bring him before court, saying that it is contempt of court?

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Why should he not? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes. "Why should he not?" is the question that my Colleague is asking.

So, I thought these matters are examples to be brought up at this most opportune moment, which are being experienced in real terms today. - [Interruption.] Sir, I am sure you want to intervene at this moment.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have exceeded your time. You have been allocated only 10 minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Assistant Secretary-General is very punctual on these matters. We got caught up with other matters and I am sure, Hon. Deputy Speaker, your generosity will flow through her and you will give me a couple of minutes more.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You have already exceeded your time and there are three more Hon. Members on your side expecting to speak.

297 298

2013 08

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We have some eminent Hon. Members to speak and I am sure that a couple of them would respond to the Government as well.

Sir, whatever that is debated in this House should be for posterity and we say these things because we really mean to get things done on behalf of the people. So, Hon. Deputy Speaker, on this basis there are many statements that are very cautiously uttered. I am happy to see that the Supreme Court, on an intervention made against the appointment of the Chief Justice, had referred it to a full bench but, in the interim, until such time things happen, Hon. Minister of Justice, I am asking you, what do you think would be the case? I would like to broaden the base to ensure that such matters of contempt of court are reduced. We are supposedly supreme. So, let us discuss anything and everything we want, not only when the Government wants. To impeach a Chief Justice, the Supreme Court becomes secondary to Parliament and no sooner that finishes, the interpretation gets back that the Constitutional Rights can be interpreted by the Supreme Court. Then, our supremacy relegates into a secondary position. So, Hon. Deputy Speaker, these are matters that we need a clarification on. All we want is to increase the powers that are vested with us so that we can discuss matters at any given moment that do not run counter and do not have a heinous impact as was on the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake.

It is not only us who are in the Opposition, you all may be in the Opposition tomorrow. So, that is not the way laws should be brought in. That is why we asked you to define who a "terrorist" is at the previous Debate rather than keeping it nebulous and ambiguous. Then, you know what actually it is; in black and white. So, on this basis, Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would request the entire Parliament to look, on a much more broader basis, at our rights as well as the rights we represent on behalf of our people. They must be educated with the new legislation that I intend bringing in through the Private Members Motions so that they could speak without fear or favour and ensure that justice prevails in a country, where justice seems to be buried today, with the bringing in of the Eighteenth Amendment burying the Seventeenth Amendment.

Thank you. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe. You have five minutes.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Then, you do not have worry about it.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Why do you keep it open? Whatever I mention, you say, "it is sub judice". The Hon. Minister did not say that. He gave an open objection.

First, the Editor of Hansard would submit to you that particular speech and then you can examine it to see whether it refers to any matter that is sub judice in your contention. After that, you will have to -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes. Have you concluded your speech, Hon. Member? You have taken almost 10 minutes.

[3.24 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Deputy Minister of Investment Promotion) Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to speak in relation to this Motion. Firstly, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake gave a definition of what "contempt" is. But, I would like to address the substantive law dealing with contempt of court.

Our laws are governed by Section 55 of the Judicature Act, which clearly states that any act, which is committed in the well of the court or any act which is defined to be an act of contempt, could be punished by that court itself. The Court of Appeal, in terms of Article 105 (3) of the Constitution, is given power to deal with contempt of court. Therefore, we have a law in place dealing with contempt of court. But, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake said that in certain instances contempt of court for the Opposition is one and contempt of court for the Government is another. I would like to inform him that contempt provisions can be invoked by any citizen. It does not have to be by the court. It could be by any citizen. Any citizen can invoke contempt provisions.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, certainly. It can be. But, there are Government-sponsored judges because the Seventeenth Amendment is no more.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) I do not think it is fair for you to say, Government-sponsored judges because -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am saying so. We are supreme. Parliament is supreme - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) You are bringing the whole judiciary to - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Parliament is supreme. You impeached the Chief Justice - [Interruption.] There are Government-sponsored judges. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) The Chief Justice was impeached in terms of a constitutional process. - [Interruption.]

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara - Minister of National Languages and Social Integration) The Chief Justice is appointed by the Parliamentary Council. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You are absolutely correct, Sir.- [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) The Judicial Service Commission is appointed by none other than - [Interruption.] We are the appointing authority. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is why I said that. The Government appoints them. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara You will have to go through your own imagined paradise of democracy. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Member, your Motion was to bring in amendments to the law. But, now you are making allegations against the whole judicial system. You are going against the appointment of judges. Your Motion deals with amending the law to deal with contempt. But you do not -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Do you want to accept my Private Members Motion - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) That is what you said. You said that the appointment of Judges - [Interruption.]

309 310

2013 08

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Why do you narrowly take the contempt of court provision only? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) You brought in a definition to say what contempt of court is, and you said that the Appropriation Bill is a violation. That was passed by a two-thirds majority in terms of the Constitution.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Why did you oppose the judgment given by Justice Shirani Tilakawardene?

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) I am not opposing it. It was passed in this Parliament consequent to the advice of the Attorney-General, by a special majority, in view of the judgment of Justice Shirani Tilakawardene. It was passed by a special majority. This Government will always respect the Supreme Court. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is not a - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) That is what you are saying. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) This is what the judgment states. I quote: ... sans any Parliamentary control, and the abrogation of powers over public finance in contravention of Article 148 of the Constitution. This could be cured if amended to read that it could only be done with Parliamentary approval. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) That is why we passed it by Parliamentary approval, through a special majority, consequent to the advice of the Attorney-General. This came up earlier. You raised the same objection. - [Interruption.] We got two-thirds majority and it was passed.

Therefore, the Hon. Members Motion, which states that there is a need to amend the law, has no rationale for the reason that he just defines what contempt of court is and he does not deal with the substantive provisions of the law. We have a mechanism. We have a Constitution. We have the Judicature Act, under which any person could be dealt with for contempt of court.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) What about the procedure? There is no procedural law.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) What "contempt of court" is, is a question of fact. The procedure is, any act committed in the well of the court or any act defined to be an act of contempt could be - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) That is not the question. What is the procedure? There is no procedural law in this country.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) You are dealing with the substantive law. . ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) No. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) The judicial analysis - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) The procedure is this. If any person brings to the notice of court that someone has committed an act of contempt of court, the court will issue notice and the Supreme Court rules will apply. Therefore, with regard to the Motion moved by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake stating that the law has to be amended, I respectfully state that there is a fully-fledged legal mechanism in place to deal with contempt of court and, in addition, with regard to the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghes allegation that His Excellency the President has not considered a certain report during the impeachment process, I say, is false. Thank you.

311 312

[3.30 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Thank you Mr. Presiding Member. I must say that this Motion moved by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake is indeed a timely one and we have, in fact, taken some steps towards a comprehensive contempt of court legislation, which has been a long felt need. Particularly, the several stakeholders in our justice system have been urging the Ministry to enact a very comprehensive contempt of court legislation because of the different experiences we have gone through - [Interruption.] That is happening. Let me come to the details.

Some of the Hon. Members referred to a draft contempt of court legislation that was sent to the Ministry by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka. That is in our possession. In addition to that, His Excellency the President had directed the Law Commission to go into the same matter. The Law Commission too has now sent us a draft contempt of court legislation for our consideration. So, we are in possession of both these documents.

In addition to that, in fact, I must say that His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, is the President who had already done away with another draconian provision that was contained in our Penal Code, which related to the criminal defamation aspect. That credit should also go to His Excellency the President because this was also something that was hanging over the heads of several editors and media personnel who had been hauled up before courts for criminal contempt. That issue is now behind us and I must say that is an issue, regarding which this Government could be very proud of. In a similar vein, it is also proposed -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) When was it done away with? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) It was in 2007. Criminal defamation was totally taken out. The Hon. Ajith Perera knows this.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe did away with it. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, it was taken away by the Mahinda Rajapakse administration. I was a Member of the Cabinet at that time.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is our government that took criminal defamation away. Why are you distorting such things. You were in the Cabinet with us.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Criminal Defamation was an issue that had to be taken out. Whichever government that did away with it -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That time the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe was the Prime Minister and Chandrika Kumaratunga was the President.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Anyway, full support was given by everyone for the removal of this provision from the Penal Code of this country. I must say the Editors Guild has been urging me several times to consider this particular comprehensive contempt of court legislation, which is now under active consideration by us.

I must say here very specifically that too harsh a law on contempt can act as a barrier to the development of a healthy and vibrant jurisprudence. Ideally a legal system should encourage both spontaneous and reflective criticism of judgments while preserving the sanctity and dignity of the courts and ensuring the smooth and effective administration of justice. To promote the honest and accurate publication of reports on court proceedings; to promote fair and honest comments or analysis of the judgments in a manner that does not impair the dignity of the courts or affect the fair administration of justice are matters that we need to bear in mind. The features of a new draft law would see to it that there would be honest and accurate publication of reports on court proceedings and that any such publications should not amount to contempt. Publication of court proceedings that tend to interfere with the course of justice shall not amount to contempt where the publication was made in good faith and the publisher was not aware that such proceedings were pending in a court. No court shall prohibit the publication of the report of any court proceedings except where there is a substantial risk or prejudice to the administration of justice. A comment on a judgment of a court made fairly and in good faith will not amount to a contempt of court is another matter that should be borne in mind.

Therefore, these issues are now under active consideration. In fact, I did state this in a colloquium organized by the High Court Judges Association in

313 314

2013 08

collaboration with the Ministry of Justice on "Child Protection and Victim-Friendly Court Processes" in September, 2012. I, in fact, referred to the proposal to bring in a comprehensive Contempt of Court Act. We have said that the introduction of the contempt of court legislation is based on the principles of enacting legislation applicable to all courts of Sri Lanka setting out a uniform procedure to be followed for the trial of contempt of court. The draft law defines the offence of contempt of court and divides the offence to two categories of criminal contempt" and "civil contempt. In the meantime, the Ministry of Justice is also mindful of the dangers of a stringent contempt of court law, which will act as a barrier to the development of a healthy and vibrant culture of jurisprudence. Therefore, specific provisions have been included in the draft law to encourage freedom of expression, information and publication as set out in the Constitution. The law also seeks to protect the publication or reporting of legal proceedings and fair comments or criticism of a case that has been heard and decided or pending before court. Together with this, there is also a long-felt need to formulate a clear and legal framework for sentencing and bring in greater clarity, fairness and consistency to the process which will eventually benefit all concerned. For this purpose, the Ministry has enlisted the services of the Federal Attorney-Generals Department of Australia. The Ministry is already in possession of a draft policy document and a basic draft law which will be discussed with all stakeholders in the near future.

Mr. Presiding Member, I propose to discuss this matter further in the Consultative Committee on Justice. If I can have sanction from the Cabinet to draft a new law on contempt which will comprehensively cover every court in the country, it will be effective. As you know, there has been some criticism and several cases have highlighted the issue; particularly the Supreme Court having invoked its inherent powers to impose sentences for contempt of court has come into some criticism in the past. So, having considered all that, we feel that - since we already have these two draft legislations that have been submitted to us - on approval by Cabinet, we can proceed to look into the matter of drafting a comprehensive contempt of court legislation, which we can do shortly.

Thank you.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) , . , .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That is what I said. - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) Consultative Committee . ?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No sooner the Cabinet gives us approval to go ahead. . ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) Cabinet Paper ?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I will submit a Cabinet Paper on this issue and then, the moment I have approval, we will send it. We can right away send the draft legislations that have been sent to us both by the Bar Association and the Law Commission and ask the Legal Draftsman to proceed with it, if the Cabinet approves. Once the draft is sent to us from the Legal Draftsmans Department, we can have it placed before the Consultative Committee for discussion.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) . ?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) This has been a matter on which the Editors' Guild has been pressurizing our Government several times. I will submit the Cabinet Paper soon.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) Thank you very much. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Then, I call upon the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake to wind up.

315 316

[3.41 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for granting me the opportunity to make the winding-up speech on this Private Members Motion. Let me thank the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, the Hon. Ajith P. Perera, the Hon. Faiszer Musthapha and the Minister, Hon. Rauff Hakeem for contributing to this Motion.

I am happy that I have been able to buttress the process you intend bringing forward with the Law Commission and the Bar Association having mooted an idea on the matter of contempt of court. It is pertinent that they have done so. I would like the reflections of the Hon. Members of Parliament that came up during this Private Members Motion also to be taken into consideration. I call upon a Select Committee to be appointed while the Consultative Committee is going on to ensure that this is carried out on a fast track and concluded within the quickest possible time.

Sir, there were various ideas that came up but in the end, the idea of this Motion is to protect and improve democracy through the various institutions that basically administer such laws. But, as you know, today, there seems to be an erosion of democracy in our country owing to the arrogation of powers of the Supreme Court or any other court by other institutions. "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere", said Martin Luther King. We must do things not only for some selected people but for all the people. That is my intention in bringing this Private Members Motion. I am happy that it is in the hands of an efficient and eminent Minister. I only hope that the Cabinet would not stymie his enthusiasm and ensure that legislation is brought in as soon as possible.

Also, as you quite rightly said, credit must be given for criminal defamation being taken out of the statute books. That was done by no other Government, but by the United National Party Government, where you were a Minister with us from 2001 to 2004, and the credit must go to the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, who was the Prime Minister then and who weathered many storms to take that off and give the benefits to the people. But, later, he basically repented thinking why we did that because today, journalists are using it, to our absolute disgust, to bring about, as you know, racial disharmony, religious disharmony and also for engaging in political bickering, hiding and shielding behind that very criminal law we took away. Never mind, we have no regrets because we have done the correct thing the right way.

So, all I want you to do is to ensure that this is brought in as soon as possible and that we have a free and fair society without fear or favour to anybody. Also, ensure

that it is not only the Members of the Opposition who would be harassed, but the Members of the Government would also get the same treatment that the Opposition Members would get in the future.

Thank you. , . . Question put, and agreed to.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Hon. Manusha Nanayakkara - [Pause]. Not here. The next speaker is the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. [5.45 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I think it is a worthwhile Motion that my Friend, the Hon. Ajith Kumara moved in the House. I was very interested and listening to the Hon. Gayantha Karunatilekas almost musical speech covering all aspects of the cultural and historical aspects of Galle in the Southern Province. I would like to remind the House, Sir, that in -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka to take the Chair?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I propose that the Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka do now take the Chair.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) . . Seconded.

, . . Question put, and agreed to. , .

, , . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. GAYANTHA KARUNATILEKA took the Chair.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I moved an Adjournment Motion on the 5th of July, 2012, on the protection of Galle Fort as a national heritage - - -

I think we had a very good and quite a useful debate in the House. The Hon. (Dr.) Jagath Balasuriya, the Minister of National Heritage, was able to give us a very heartening reply on that occasion. " " . . .

Galle is a very famous Southern-most town. Quite interestingly, when we cross from Singapore to Malaysia, we find Johor Bahru, a town similar to the Galle Fort. Both were built by the Portuguese or the Dutch at that time. Although Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa are much older than Galle, they are effectively abandoned cities. The modern towns are divorced from the ancient ruins. In contrast, both old and new Galle have still remained vibrant. It is a vibrant town and I must also say that it rose like a phoenix from the ashes after tsunami ravaged the Southern Province. The whole of Galle Fort, the city and the suburbs were all destroyed by the ravaging sea water at that time.

Now, it has been rebuilt by this Government and we find a modern city coming up there. Historians believe Galle may have been the city of Tarshish, where King Solomon obtained gems and spices, but it became prominent only with the arrival of the Europeans. Ibn Battuta, the famous globe-trotter who came from Morocco, set foot in Galle and there are historical anecdotes that he has collected and written into a book which has been read and re-read by people in the whole world because it is an international document. A documentation is what my Friend is asking for.

In 1505, a Portuguese fleet bound for the Maldives was blown off course and took shelter in the harbour. Apparently, on hearing a cock - "galo" in Portuguese - crowing, they gave the town its name. Another slightly less dubious story is that the name is derived from the Sinhala word gala - the rock. Incidentally, we are not referring to the rock that the Opposition is always talking in this House in the Hambantota Harbour. This is the real rock - gala. What I mean is the rock.

In 1589, during one of their periodic squabbles with the Kingdom of Kandy, the Portuguese built a small Fort, which they named "Santa Cruz". Later, they extended it with a series of bastions and walls. But, the Dutch, who took Galle in 1640, destroyed most traces of Portuguese presence. This is what happened in the coastal areas - from Matara all along the coastline up to Mantai, which was the old name and where Ibn Battuta landed, Kalpitiya, Puttalam - these foreign forces came here and destroyed our culture and heritage.

After the construction of the Fort in the17th Century, Galle was the main port of Sri Lanka for more than 200 years. Such an important place Galle was and an

355 356

important stop for boats and ships travelling between Europe and Asia. However, by the time Galle passed into British hands in 1796, commercial interest was turning towards Colombo. The construction of the breakwaters in the Colombo Harbour in the late 19th Century sealed Galle's status as a secondary harbour though it still handles some shipping and yachts. It is a lively town, a city - a model city for the whole world and we have to protect it.

The Hon. Member asked for documentation of the historical value of that Fort. It is very important. I have a book written in Tamil with me here -

" , ."

.

Therefore, Sir, it is very important that these historical places must be safeguarded, protected and fostered for posterity.

I also must say, Sir, that the Hon. Ajith Kumara and you yourself spoke about several historical sites. There is one famous mosque built 800 years ago, supposed to be the first mosque built in the Southern Province, Kachchuli Dharga (Ziyaram). After tsunami, it was destroyed and some Memon friends came and built a nice mosque on the right side of the road at Katugoda and on the left side this Kachchuli Dharga is there, where a saint is also buried. I think last time also I mentioned that the Government must take some interest in order to revive activities there.

Then, also there are the Nawinne Sheikh Madar Mosque and the Thalapitiya Grand Mosque. They were also built about 800 years ago, during the time of the Portuguese. - The late Hon. (Dr.) W. Dahanayake, when he was a Member of Parliament, brought those stones here indicating the

historical value of that place - where Portuguese have landed - and how Muslims, particularly Muslim ladies, were able to drive those invaders away. All those things are - - Those stones are there and those things must be taken into archaeological account and must be even recorded for people to understand what has really happened.

Mention was made about the Galle Fort Meeran Mosque. It was built during the time of the Dutch. There is also Al-Bahjathul Ibrahimiya Arabic College, a fine historical building of architecture. It was built by the first Consul- General of the Ottoman Empire, Sir Mohamed Macan Markar, who was also the first Muslim Minister in the State Council. He was the Minister of Communication.

Then, behind the Galle bus stand, in the China Garden there is a mosque. A lot of Malays are living there. It was built in Hijri 123. That was about 1,300 years ago during the period of Abbasi rule and Ma'mun al-Rasid was ruling Baghdad. Even the Kings of Sri Lanka sent jewels to Ma'mun al-Rasid of Baghdad through Galle.

The Galle Cultural Islamic Centre is also another important institution which is located in the Galle Fort. They celebrated the Golden Jubilee Celebrations. I am happy to state that our Chief Guest was the Deputy Speaker, the Hon. Chandima Weerakkody. Even a stamp was issued. Mr. M. Zikfi, the President and all the other Members must be congratulated for the efforts that they have taken.

Katugoda Mohideen Jumma Mosque was built by late Hon. A.R.M. Thassim, a philanthropist. I think we have to protect that place also.

Then, there is the Masjid Ya Hussain. It is an 800-year old Mosque. It was destroyed by the tsunami but was rebuilt again. Then, there is the Gintota Kurunduwatta Jumma Mosque. Then, there are the churches such as the Anglican Church and the Roman Catholic Church. Then, there is also the Shiva Kovil and the other kovils in Galle.

Sir, I think it is very important that we, as a nation, must survive. A nation must have history. A person must have his parents. Without parents there is no individual. There is the father and the mother that you love and respect. Likewise, we have to respect the historical values of our country and it must be properly documented.

There is just one more matter I want to refer to. I have to digress from my main subject because of my good Friend, the Hon. Ajith Perera. He was talking about Rizana Nafeek. No, it is wrong. Do not play politics with that poor girl. We tried our best to get her released. The Head of the State, His Excellency himself wrote to His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia twice and so many

357 358

[ ... ]

2013 08

deputations were sent. We must understand the Shariah Law. The mother must give pardon and she refused to give pardon even at the last moment. It was brutal on the part of that mother. We also went and saw the mother of this poor girl several times, Saiyadu Farina Nafeek in Safi Nagar, Mutur and we blamed her for sending abroad a small girl like this. She replied, Sir, we have no way to live".

" . ; . ; - " .

I must say the First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa visited that place last week immediately after the 65th Independence Celebrations, a grand celebration that was held in the Esplanade of Trincomalee in the Eastern Province. The Army has been asked to build a house for them and now they are doing it.

Therefore, Sir, we feel very sorry. There was only one shot in this House, who was always trying to make political capital out of it and I do not want my good Friend, the Hon. Ajith Perera, to transform himself into the second shot. All the shots are over in Saudi Arabia. Now, we have to look after her parents, sisters, brothers and others. That will be done by the Government. I, myself went to Dawadmi, the village where Rizana was working and where this infant was born. We met the grandfather and the entire tribe - the Otaibah Tribe - coming from the time of the Holy Prophet. But, whatever it is - - stone-like. This woman had a stone heart. She would not budge an inch. At the last moment she was told, Now, this poor child has been imprisoned for seven years, therefore, please pardon her now". She said, No, she must die in front of me. So, how can you change the mind and heart of such stone-like people?

Mr. Presiding Member, thank you very much for the time given to me. I commend the Hon. Ajith Kumara for bringing this Motion. Not only in the Southern Province, everywhere there are a lot of historical things. The other day, they were talking about the three Rajadhaniyas in the Kurunegala District. There are historical places in Jaffna and in the Trincomalee District and also in areas like Colombo itself. When I was the Minister of State for Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs, I published books district by district, Sir. But, it is not being done today. We had celebrations - Meelad-un-Nabi Celebrations and other celebrations - and distributed those educational books printed with the assistance of my then secretary, Alhaj S.H.M. Jameel, a great writer himself and Meeran Mohideen. Those books were available. Sir, thank you for your patience.
