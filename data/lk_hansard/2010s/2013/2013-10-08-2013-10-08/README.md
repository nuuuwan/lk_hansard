Placing it on some and not on others does not amount to tabling; whether it is the Ministers responsibility or the Secretary-Generals is a different matter. But, if it has not been tabled for everyone, then there has been no proper tabling. There is a procedure to be followed on this issue. I suppose they will return my file after you have looked into it, Hon. Speaker.

Sir, the Broadlands Hydropower Project, as my young Friend, the Hon. Nalin Bandara Jayamaha mentioned now, is a run-of-the-river type power development planned to be built in the Kelani River Basin with the objective of harnessing the hydro potential downstream of the existing Polpitiya Power Station. The project will have an installed capacity of 35 megawatts and expects to generate 126 gigawatt-hours of electrical energy annually. The main worksites of the project are located about 95 kilometres east of Colombo near the Kitulgala Town.

In those days, Sir, when the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant was mooted, there were protests; of course, there

1059 1060

2013 08

were protests from both sides. It was through ignorance. You see, if we had not signed the agreement on the Sampur Coal Power Station, I think this Island would sink in darkness once again by 2025. The President saw it; the Government saw that the future is bleak. Therefore, we are very happy that the young, dynamic lady, the Hon. Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi, the Minister in charge, signed the agreement in the presence of the Hon. Salman Khurshid, Foreign Minister of India. It is a hallmark agreement; it is a historic occasion. We must welcome that.

I am very happy that this type of very laudable Motions are moved in this House, which are beneficial to the common man, the farmer. The farmers want electricity. In India, even for the banana plantations, they draw water using electricity.

. There are small agricultural units which are highly developed. I would also propose to the Hon. Minister to visit Tamil Nadu one day because they are a model unto our country and other countries, where the small farmer uses electricity even to draw water from the wells to the fields.

Then, Sir, the Cabinet have also given approval for the Broadlands Hydropower Project. The total cost of the project is US Dollars 82 million and 85 per cent of the cost is lent by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China - ICBC - and the remaining 15 per cent is lent by the Hatton National Bank - HNB. The financial agreement with the ICBC and the CEB was signed in mid-January, 2013 and the agreement with the HNB was signed in June, 2013. The other agreement was signed at the Presidential Secretariat by the Hon. Minister and the Indian Foreign Minister.

Sir, all in all, this is the road to prosperity which the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime has started. When compared to all the countries in South-East Asia, we are far ahead. Next month, you will see Heads of 53 nations assemble in the City of Colombo and they will see the beauty of the City of Colombo. They will visit the Diyawanna Oya and recall, if they can, the "Selalihini Sandeshaya" describing its beauty and its surroundings. As His Excellency the President said the other day, the village revival is being taken into the City now. Go to the Viharamahadevi Park, the Independence Square and the area along Reid Avenue or Philip Gunawardena Mawatha and see the development. Also, there are paddy fields now behind the Parliamentary Complex. Mr. Presiding Member, you and your daddy also appreciated that. So, that is the path to prosperity, and we will have a very good and prosperous nation in the future.

Thank you very much.
