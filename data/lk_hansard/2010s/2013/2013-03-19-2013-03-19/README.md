The Bills were in the process of being printed and had been sent by a vehicle from the Finance Ministry. When I spoke to the Secretary-General in the evening, he said, "Sir, we have not got all of them".

Then, you sent me some of them, not the whole lot. So, the House was not possessed of all the Bills at that time. When the House adjourned, only 15 Bills had been given in all three languages.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . Hon. Azwer, you can raise your point of Order now.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is a late Order that you are giving me. Anyway, Sir, the Standing Order is very clear -[Interruption.] Do not worry. I was a little late in raising the point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You are always late. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, my point of Order is this. The Standing Order is very clear that when an Order is made from the Chair, it is binding and if anybody wants to raise any point on it, they can ask for a debate later. But, what the Hon. Leader of the Opposition endeavours to do in his assertion is to canvass your Order and he is also virtually repeating what you said from the Chair.

Therefore, I say that whatever they have said is against the Standing Orders as far as the Order of the Chair is concerned and I request to expunge all that. Once upon a time I moved a motion in this House that there must be a separate printing press in Parliament in order to avoid such unavoidable circumstances and delays. Therefore, I would kindly urge you, Sir, that we must take this up very seriously. I think the Hon. Leader of the House and others would agree that we must have our printing press, a small one, at least to print the Order Papers and other amendments and enactments. Thank you.

, . .

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We cannot question the Hon. Speaker's Order now. . ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) I am not going to contest that. We need a clarification regarding this. I am not going to object to that. We are not going to challenge it.

, link language . , . . .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Mr. Speaker, you gave an Order. I only tried to supplement it by saying, "when the Gazette is issued and printed". That is what you have implied. Here, we have a situation which you were not aware of but which we became aware of: that the Gazette was not printed. So, I think the best situation is, - I would agree with the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera - if the Government Benchers are also agreeable, to speak about this at the Party Leaders' Meeting immediately because some of these things are not problems of Parliament itself. Otherwise, we will get into an argument on both sides. If you can give us 10 minutes, we could meet you and find a way of sorting it out.

I am also happy that the Hon. Azwer agreed with me. He has said that there is a need for a press, which means he has accepted the fact that there had been a delay in the Government Press. That is what I am saying.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . [ ] table . Table . . .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Speaker, I was presiding at the time this issue came up. The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti agreed that 21 Bills were available in English. I inquired from the Deputy Secretary-General who was in the House and he confirmed that six Bills were not available in Tamil and Sinhala. Since all the Bills should be made available in all three languages to the Members, I made a Ruling that those six Bills had not been tabled properly. You maybe overruling me, Sir. As the Hon. Speaker, you maybe entitled to do so. But, I think you should do that with the consent of the House. Thank you.

629 630

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you Sir. What I am wearing is not black.

I have just two points. The first one is, on that particular day there was a Party Leaders Meeting - the Leader of the House and the Chief Government Whip will agree - and I inquired whether those Bills were available. They said they would be on the table. I left the meeting, came here and found only three of the Bills and that too only in English. I took it back to the meeting. They kept on saying that before Parliament adjourns, the Bills would be tabled. It was not tabled. To me it was delivered at 1.30 a.m. the next morning. As has already been pointed out, Article 24 of the Constitution requires that the legislation be made in Sinhala and Tamil with a translation in English.

Now, it is conceded by the Hon. Speaker as well as everybody else that Sinhala and Tamil copies were not tabled. Gazetting is a separate issue. A Bill must be gazetted two weeks prior to it being presented in Parliament.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Therefore, I urge that the Hon. Speaker looks into the violation of Constitutional provisions in this instance, where the Bills, in Tamil and Sinhala, had not been presented to Parliament.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, after what has been said before with regard to the presention of Bills et cetera, I would like to point out that it is mandatory that the Bills be brought before the Consultative Committee. - [Interruption.] What are these extraneous sources trying to say? I am addressing the Hon. Speaker, not you, Hon. Member.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I am telling you. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am coming to the point, Sir.

But, they were not given even 24 hours' notice and you are trying to get all these Bills through in one day. . You are making a mockery of Parliament. .

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am more than surprised to find that the Members of the Opposition are evading these Bills which are before the House. Many Opposition Members were listed to speak before me but none of them were present here. I do understand their attitude because they do not want the Government to attain progress economically, socially or otherwise.

Sir, it is only yesterday that we had the miracle, I should say, of a new international airport being opened in the City of Mattala, in the Hambantota District, our Hon. Speakers Electorate. Now, that is a remarkable feature because the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future

'' - '' very clearly refers to this.

The person who piloted the Air Arabia plane was a Sri Lankan. So, you can see to what extent Sri Lanka has advanced even in piloting planes. The Sri Lankan pilots and crew can man any flight anywhere in the world.

" " . "Daily News" of Tuesday, March 19, 2013

states, Let our children fly above us. . It also states, Chinas special representative at MRIA BIA MRIA .

It further states under the caption The pride of Ruhuna and gateway to prosperity, I quote:

Opening the gateway to the countrys prosperity and adding a golden chapter to Sri Lankas aviation history, President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday opened the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA). MRIA, the second international airport of the country was commissioned amidst pomp and pageantry in the historic city of Hambantota.

. . . . -

They do not want to see development of the country in that fashion. Today's "Daily News" also reports under the caption Chinas special representative at MRIA launch, Mattala symbol of close Sino-Lanka friendship, I quote:

Addressing the inauguration of the countrys second international airport, Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA), Chinese Political Consultative Conference Vice President Luo Fuhe said China always respects the sovereignty and social and economic well-being of other nations. He said China encourages its entrepreneurs...

? . . The English translation of that verse states, I quote: The dawn, That drives woes and grief away embraces Mother Lanka and fills minds with immense pleasure injecting life to countless lotus to bloom.

Azwer) Sir, I will take five more minutes. - [ Interruption.] Those Members have taken an Oath not to help, directly or indirectly, create a separate State. But, what they are doing in Geneva is, violating our Constitution. It is against the Oath they have taken. They want a separate State. That is a violation of the Oath they, including the Hon. Sampanthan, have taken in this House. Therefore, Sir, they have to be tried in a court when they come back. They are acting against the Constitution of Sri Lanka and are being unpatriotic at the highest level. It is sedition.

The Muslims wear the Hijab. That is a part of the religion. That cannot be changed. Other problems can be tackled and it has been tackled properly. We are also happy about the whole turn of events.

Now what is happening? What is the concept of Hijab? You can ask the Hon. Sooriyapperuma, he will tell you. What is the Hijab? The first concept is to conceal the body. It is a universal dress. Not only for the Muslims, but for all. What is happening in Sri Lanka? Father-daughter, uncle-niece, teacher-student, ? .

The second concept is manners, behaviour. Safeguard manners before building up a moral society.

A Buddhist Bhikku has been attacked in a railway station in Egmore Railway Station, Madras. What is the right they have? Tamil Nadu people are daily coming here. I ask "Are you trying to provoke the Sinhalese in this country against the Tamil Nadu people?" Do not do these foolish things. Selvarajah never did that. '' S.J.V. Chelvanayagam, never did that.

The World Bank has basically emphasized that they will give loans only if you ensure that there is a cost-benefit analysis on them, good governance and corruption is reduced.

One of todays newspapers highlights that Sri Lanka has set a record of being the 79th worst country of corruption. So, day by day, the world is losing confidence in us. When the country is going through an absolute economic turmoil, when the country is technically bankrupt and repawned by this Government, they are basically looking at anything and everything and trying to pay tomorrows loans from todays borrowings.

Then, they went to Japan to get loans but they are conditional loans. They have not just promised this US Dollars 489 million to Mahinda Rajapaksa to do whatever

he wants. It was promised on the condition that good governance prevails, peace orientation and devolution of power takes place. If that is not the case they will reject, rebuff that.

The world has suddenly found that there is a huge problem in Sri Lanka, that the Government of Sri Lanka is only working for nearly 157 Ministers and Deputy Ministers and not for the 21 million people living in the country.

Sir, the strange irony is that a country which had a total public debt of Rs. 1,784 billion as of 1st January, 2005 is having a total public debt of Rs. 6,900 billion as of January, 2013. But, this type of increase in debt has not had a resultant increase in the asset ability of the country. No such thing has happened. Is the Government held accountable for what it is doing? They borrow money to pay yesterdays loans. When the Government borrowed money at 8 to 9 per cent, we told them not do so especially regarding the HSBC loan and the ICICI loan. We told them that commercial borrowing to pay for social benefits cannot sustain itself and today, the Government is in a debt trap. The real development that has got to flow in and penetrate to people is stalled. Who is basically complaining about this? It is the innocent people of this country.

It was others who came and sat there and disrespected the House and that is the problem. I guess my good Friend's - a veteran speaker - amiable and generous disposition got somewhat perturbed. He came running and started shouting; I do not understand as to why he did so. I am sure sanity has prevailed now and his cooler thoughts are making him feel as to what he uttered.

271 . Two hundred and seventy one garment factories had been closed down because of the loss of Labour GSP that had been there. I am asking the Senior Ministers who are here, is this the way you take the economy to the cleaners at a time when every single cent is important to this country? You have a sense of arrogance to question the EU when you are beholden to them for giving the Labour GSP to you. You said, No, we do not want that. I do not want the country to be subservient, in any way, to any country to get its dues. But, when we get something, we have got to protect it. Today, if you had that Rs. 145 billion at the disposal of the exporters, you do not need to tax the people, increase petrol prices and to impose a 50 per cent increase on electricity charges, in turn increasing the cost of living, which is going up by the day. If you had that Rs. 145 billion, then you could have utilized the taxes on that in order to ensure that you give at least a 20 per cent salary increase to the private sector. Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, I know you are very concerned about increasing the revenue. But remember, on the other side of the economy, you have got to reduce your cost. If you increase your cost and try to reduce your revenue, it would be a recipe for disaster and that is what is going on at this particular moment.

Hon. Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning, Hon. Prime Minister, you need one million litres of oil stored at that international airport. Today, Mattala is not a normal, domestic airport. It has risen to the status of an international airport. So, it has to have the minimum standards that are expected of an international airport. But, you do not have one million litres of oil there; you have only 100,000 litres of oil, two bowsers. If one airplane comes and refuels, it would take a minimum of 90,000 litres of oil, which happened yesterday to "flydubai". Thereafter, there would be no oil left for the rest of the airplanes that would come. So, how on earth can you call this "sustainable development"? This is "cosmetic development" at the expense of the people and this is what we are basically opposed to. This is just to have a display, to hit the headlines, which makes no sense in economic terms.

Talking about cost reduction, I said, in India, the oil prices are coming down. Sri Lanka is the only country, when world oil prices come down, that increases its oil prices, not once or twice, but three times. Today, you can bring oil to the Colombo Port at Rs. 79 a litre and you are retailing it at Rs. 163. I do not need to point out that the difference, the spread or the profit is used to cover the efficiency, corruption, the hedging deal, all put together, and it is a fact that the Government is basically exploiting the situation. So, at least when the world oil prices come down, give that relative reduction or the benefit to the consumer. But, it is not happening. The "Ceylon Today" of 18th March, 2013 carried the caption "No reduction in fuel prices - LIOC" even though India reduced those by two Indian Rupees. Two Indian Rupees is Rs. 5 in Sri Lankan terms. That is a substantial reduction. Why is that not happening in our country? The reduction you have achieved in certain costs has been increased on the other side with additional Cabinet Ministers being appointed. Last time you increased oil prices to ensure that the increase in cost owing to the appointment of five new Cabinet Ministers and six Deputy Ministers is reimbursed by the people. Why should people reciprocate, and what have they got to do with the appointment of some inefficient Ministers? That is what we are asking.

The other issue I raise at this particular moment is about the oil tanks in Trincomalee. These oil tanks were leased out to the Lanka Indian Oil Company about 8 - 9 years ago, maybe 10 years ago. Today, the Deputy Minister of Petroleum Industries, the Hon. Sarana Gunawardena, at an interview with a TV channel, mentioned that the Hon. Susil Premajayantha has brought in a Cabinet Paper to abrogate this Agreement and to take

back the oil tanks. I am informed that the Chairman of the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminal Limited has been told to take these oil tanks back and negotiations are going on. Is this correct? At a time when you are trying to bring in changes in the field of oil industry, we ask you, is it correct? Is it sensible? When there is an investment in the country, you are trying to create a problem by abrogating this Agreement. Worse so, is that you are basically dealing with an Indian company. At a time when we are trying to ensure that we get Indian support, are you trying to intensify the anti-Indian campaign that is going on? On one side you are bringing Chinese exporters and investors into this country and on the other, you are chasing away the Indian investors who have invested a colossal amount of money, at a time when India is absolutely an essential friend of ours. So, we are asking, if the Deputy Minister of Petroleum Industries, the Hon. Sarana Gunawardena says that the Hon. Susil Premajayantha has put forward a Cabinet Paper to abrogate the oil Agreement, is this correct? If not, an apology should be made to LIOC or to the Indian Government for trying to create unwanted problems.

So, all I want to say is, at the end of everything, the benefit should accrue to the people, not to an incompetent or a corrupt Government and that is what we, the United National Party, are very concerned because the economy of the country is in absolute dire straits. When this countrys economy is put to absolute test, we are the ones who have to resurrect this country and bring it back to normal order.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Thank you. .

Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Hon. Jayarathna Herath [Pause] - not here. The Hon. Eric Prasanna Weerawardhana [Pause] - not here. Then, the next speaker is the Hon. R. Yogarajan. [5.04 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am pleased to speak here today on four Bills related to finance that have been presented as a consequence of the Budget that was presented in November, 2012.

Sir, we see here that our Members of Parliament from the Opposition are being harassed, disturbed and are not being allowed to say what has to be said. This is very unfortunate. Parliament is the only place where the Members of Parliament are guaranteed the right to speak openly without fear; without any consequences of legal or

803 804

[ . ]

2013 19

other impediments; where the actions and inactions of the Government can be pointed out and issues may be raised for answer by the Government.

I know very well that the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, my Colleague, came well prepared with a very responsible, logical and analysed speech on the four Bills that are being discussed today. However, as soon as he started speaking, a Minister from the Government side interrupted him. He interrupted him because the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe is appearing on behalf of thousands of people who live in Slave Island, who protest against the takeover of their homes for the benefit of some foreign investors. He, as a lawyer, has the right to practise his profession. It is guaranteed by the Constitution. But, however, just because he appears for these poor people without a fee to defend their right to their homes, he is being harassed not only in this Parliament but even outside.

But, it is so unfortunate that a responsible Minister, the Minister in charge of housing, can cast aspersions on the character of an Hon. Member of Parliament who has come here to discharge his duties responsibly, by disturbing him, calling him names and saying all types of things. This provoked him. It provoked the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe to counterattack. If you behave yourselves, there is no reason for us to counterattack. So, you must learn that this is Parliament where we have the right to speak and you must allow us to speak.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) You also must learn to respect the political leaders. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) We do respect political leaders. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) You must respect the political leader who brought you into politics.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) My leader who brought me into politics and gave me this status today in this country is no more. I have not forgotten him.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) I am referring to the recent past. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) He is no more. I have not forgotten him. I was the person who brought a Motion to the House Committee

that a portrait of my late leader must be unveiled in this premises.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) I am referring to the recent past. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes, Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, I know you very well and you know me too well.

You know why I left that Party. It is not because I did not like that Party or that leader, it was because he was hanging on to your coat-tails. There was no other reason.

I know that this Government is today defending itself in Geneva because of your actions. You have been running around the world trying to defend this Government. That is because you have failed to do certain things, which I thought and felt that this Government will not do for the minorities in this country. That is why I left the Party that was with your Government and came to this side. So, I feel today that I have been justified in what I did. I did it on a question of principle and not on questions of people or persons.

The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe was not only harassed today in this Parliament, he had been harassed in courts also. He has been pushed to a corner in courts with the

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

on behalf of the Government. This is very unfortunate.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) What is your point of Order, Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena?

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Hon. Member, - [Interruption.]-

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, in this Parliament we have been -

805 806

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) One second, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Please allow me to speak. The Hon. Member made a reference to an intimidation made by the Bench, no less than the Supreme Court. That is a derogatory statement that he is making against the institution and the establishment of Judiciary. Please expunge that.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, do not mention the Supreme Court. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) In Parliament, you have been saying - [Interruption.] How many aspersions were cast on the Chief Justice in this same House just a month ago? - [Interruption.] -

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) That was the subject under discussion in this House then. A Motion was -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) That may be. But, even today, you said that Parliament was supreme and we have the right. The actions of Members of Parliament cannot be questioned within this Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) A Motion was brought after a Parliamentary Select Committee process and it was discussed in this House.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Okay. Let me speak. If it is found that I have spoken against the Standing Orders, the Hon. Speaker has the right to expunge. But, I have to say what I want to say. Do not intimidate us. - [Interruption.] - Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, you could have stayed two more days in Geneva but you came.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) I did not go.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) We thought you were there. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) I did not go. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Maybe that is why we are going to fail the day after tomorrow. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) We are not going to fail. Not us, but it is the Tamil community.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, it is not the Tamil community. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) The Tamil community is going to fail because of [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] like you.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I am not a traitor to my community. It is a question - [Interruption.] Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, please, I am not a traitor to my community. I have stood by my community always. Today, you have been a

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

to this country because there was a Resolution passed by the UNHRC last year. You agreed to implement the recommendations of the LLRC but you have not done it and today, you are facing a bigger, a more serious - [Interruption.]-

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) We have done that. - [Interruption.] The facts available are not being taken into consideration. - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I do have to because he was disturbed. - [Interruption.] This is the whole problem.- [Interruption.] This Government has lost its tolerance - [Interruption.] Because of your excessive arrogance - [Interruption.] Because people like the Hon. Manusha Nanayakkara, for whatever benefit, jumped to your side and gave you a two-thirds majority, you think that you can do anything - [Interruption.] This Hon. Manusha Nanayakkara is a person for whom I got nomination to contest the Provincial Council Elections in Galle. - [Interruption.] What happened? He ditched the CWC in three months and ran to the UNP. - [Interruption.]

Yogarajan) From the UNP he came to this Parliament. - [Interruption.] Within three months, he ditched the UNP and jumped to your side. Dishonourable people like him - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) But, I must appreciate one thing. You came and helped me at the Southern Provincial Council Election. I must appreciate that. I must say that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) That is a personal between you and me. At that time I was a Member of the CWC and I had the right to work for you. That is a different matter. But, this fellow is a shame. This person is a shame to Parliament, to politics. He is a dishonourable person.

( ) (The Hon. Manusha Nanayakkara) CWC . CWC .[ ] .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You go and ask them. Even today the CWC knows how much I have contributed to that Party and to those people. Everybody in this House knows how I have contributed to my community and my Party. - [Interruption.] Okay. Now, Hon. Sajin de Vass Gunawardena, please do not disturb me. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) We will not disturb you. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) My Colleague was intimidated in the courts. Then, when he was going to Kandy -

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) You cannot say that. You are a lawyer. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I am not a lawyer. I am no lawyer, Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) How can you say that he was intimidated. You cannot say that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) If I know that it was done, I can speak on behalf of my Colleague. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Yogarajan, why do not you speak on the subject? . ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) Subject . ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) If you divert your speech to personal matters it will be a problem. You carry on with your speech, Hon. Yogarajan.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I have the right to speak of what happened in this House today. The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe was not only intimidated here, he has been intimidated on the road. He was travelling to Kandy. The police is following him. They are blocking his vehicle. They are questioning him about the case that he is appearing for in courts. This is not the way to run a democratic country. An individual cannot do his politics, cannot do his job as a Member of Parliament, he cannot do his job as a lawyer.

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) What has happened?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) What is this democracy? You are objecting to my talking about community. I represent a - [Interruption.] No. You objected to my talking about my community and asked me what I am doing for your community. You see, I am not a communal person. I am the only Tamil Member in this House who is married to a Sinhalese lady; I am not a communal person. But, you are a person who is known to have burnt down a Mosque in Mawanella.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Today I made a statement to the "Indian Express" newspaper saying that the intimidation of pilgrims who come to to Tamil Nadu, India, is unfair - [Interruption.] I did not say so; you also do not disturb me.

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) . [ ]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Lalith Dissanayake, he did not mention your name. So, please sit down.

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) ? ? .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Today I made a statement to the "Indian Express" newspaper. I said that the intimidation of pilgrims, students, sportsmen and visitors to India which took place, is unfortunate. It should not be done by the Tamil people in Tamil Nadu because they have a culture of hospitality. I have told them openly that this should stop not because I am in fear but that is the tradition of the Tamil people.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) If you are going to talk about the killing of soldiers, then I will have to talk about the killing of civilians about which the whole world is looking at you.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Lalith Dissanayake, . . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Today the people of Tamil Nadu should not react against the people of Sri Lanka. They should react against the Government of Sri Lanka. When your Ministers go to Tamil Nadu, if there is a black-flag demonstration, I would welcome it. If your armed forces are going to Tamil Nadu for training and those people are emotionally affected in the protest, I would welcome that and I also appeal to the Government of India that they must vote with the US on the Resolution that is coming before UNHRC. Only then I feel the Government, which is so arrogant and irresponsible, can be brought to justice.

Talking about the levies that have come up, you all are people who talk about . You say that there are people who go abroad, work, send their earnings back to this country. They are the people who sustain the economy. Your balance of payments will go awry if not for those people.

You have said in one of the Bills that they will be exempted from -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Give the mike to the Hon. R. Yogarajan.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) This is the harassment -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) No. It is due to some technical fault, Hon. Yogarajan. Your mike was not purposely turned off.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Okay, it was some technical fault.

Sir, this country survives because of the remittances of our workers overseas. But, what are you doing to them? You have offered, when they come back and start a business, to exempt them from Turnover Tax. But, how

813 814

much is your Turnover Tax threshold? Rs. 12 million. Do you think any of these people who go abroad, work there and come back are going to have a turnover of Rs. 1 million a month for them to be exempted from Turnover Tax? This is something you are showing them as a concession, which will never reach them. This is just a bluff! So, to call them Rata Viruwo, to talk so big about them and then not give them anything is what you are doing. This is the way you are deceiving all the people in this country.

Now, you have brought in a Telecommunication Levy (Amendment) Bill, in which you say that you are going to reduce the Telecom Levy from 20 to 10 per cent for internet users. Yes, you have to develop access to the internet among the general public in this country. But, this is a small amount for those who access the internet. It is more of a concession to those who are involved in BPO operations. Maybe, that is the future of our export industry. So, we have to support that industry.

But, at the same time, why do you not think of the Rata Viruwo that you talk so big about? You have imposed a Rs. 3 levy on every overseas call. This is in addition to the 20 per cent Telecom Levy that anybody has to pay. When the Telecom Levy first came about, it came through the Ministry of Environment. It was only a 5 per cent levy. They said that was for the collection and disposal of e-waste.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Member, you have only one more minute.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Okay, Sir.

But, what has happened? To date, not a single telephone or mobile phone has been seized and disposed of by the Government. But, you continue with this levy and have increased it to 20 per cent. So, what happens to this Rs. 3? Rata Viruwo are people who are living away from their families. They leave their children, wives and husbands here and go abroad. The children want to speak to their mother or the father gets a call from her. The telecommunication companies are charging as less as Rs. 2 for predetermined numbers. But, the Government is charging Rs. 3 on that. How very unfair? If you are really concerned about the Rata Viruwo, why do you not reduce this levy?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) On telecommunication, they are charging less so that the amount that is charged on the interest automatically comes down.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, it does not. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) They are already getting the benefit of reduction by having competition.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The user has to pay Rs. 3 a minute. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) On a reduced amount. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Not on a reduced amount. It is not 3 per cent but Rs. 3.

It is not a percentage. You pay Rs. 3 per minute as the IDD levy.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, I am not talking about that. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) His time is up, Hon. Minister. Hon. Yogarajan, please wind up now. - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Minister, the Deputy Chairman of Committees wants me to wind up. So, please do not disturb me.

The companies, through competition, have reduced their tariff. When they reduce it, the consumer gets it into his left pocket. Then, you come and rob it from him for Government revenue. So, everything that you do is to rob the people to increase revenue and waste funds like you wasted in Mattala. [.. 5.25] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon.
