The International Commission of Jurists has called upon the Sri Lankan Government to reinstate the ousted Chief Justice. That is the highest body in the judicial circles of the whole world. They are calling for the reinstatement of the Chief Justice. Can you do that? I do not think you will ever be able to do it. So, you will have to face the music.

Then, the United States of America has expressed dissatisfaction with the impeachment of the Chief Justice and states that there can be serious repercussions in the international arena, both in the case of investments to Sri Lanka and our exports. We send 22 per cent of our exports to America and also another big percentage to Europe. If there would be sanctions, God help the people of this country, not the Government! It is the poor producers who would suffer and the poor workers in the industries would lose employment. That is the danger.

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) Our exports to Europe and America add up to 80 per cent.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes, there is a large amount of our exports going to these countries and continents. You are playing with the lives of the Sri Lankan people. We are not worried about the Government; we are worried about the people at large - the poorer people, the majority of this country who are producing and are involved in industries.

The Canadian Government has said that its Prime Minister would not come for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. What is the plight of the Meeting? I would like to know from the Government. Will you be able to hold the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting? Already, Canada, which is a key player in the Commonwealth, has said that they are not going to participate. The other countries are yet to decide. I think Britain also has said that they will have to consider participating in the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting to be held in Sri Lanka. It is a disgrace! They are now trying to move it to Malaysia. There is a plan not to hold that Meeting in Sri Lanka. Why is this? It is a very serious situation. I do not know how we are going to remedy this. The United Kingdom, Canada, the European Union and the United Nations, all these have issued statements expressing strong concern about this impeachment. All this is centred round the Judiciary of this country and democracy. It is a very serious situation. Your own Minister, the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana made a statement that confrontation between the arms of government is harmful to the countrys Government. The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana and the Hon. DEW Gunasekara, who are Senior Ministers, did not come for the Debate, did not even vote for the Impeachment; they both kept away. They are sensible Ministers; they know their responsibilities.

Even the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, which is headed by our own Member of Parliament, is against the appointment of the new Chief Justice and they will be boycotting his Ceremonial Sitting that is to take place tomorrow. I wonder whether the Hon. Minister is attending it. I ask you, do you have the guts to go there? After all that has happened, can you go and face the people? Is it the right thing to do? I am sure you are going because you are being forced to go.

The, Sir, if you look at some of the articles that appeared in the press during the last few days, The Sunday Times of 20th January, 2013 states, I quote:

Judiciary silenced; a dark chapter in Sri Lankas history

Can you account for this? It further states, I quote:

UNHRC chief issues scathing attack, Canada initiates moves that may get Lanka suspended from Commonwealth

This is the risk that you are running. You are responsible if we get thrown out of the Commonwealth.

That article also states, I quote:

"Two CJs now: Shirani claims she still holds office but heavy force used to prevent her from entering court premises.

Is it not a blatant violation of human rights? I wonder

how you are going to face this situation. Then, "The Sunday Leader" of 13th January, 2013 states, I quote:

Commonwealth cautions the Government

It further states, I quote:

The impeachment of a Chief Justice is a very serious matter. In this particular case, it has called into question aspects of the Constitution of Sri lanka, ."

"He said that the Commonwealth, collectively, is profoundly concerned about this situation.

So, these are some of the statements reported in the newspapers. I am quite confident that they will never have the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sri Lanka in view of these statements.

2013 20 "" :

" "

.

Then, another article in "The Sunday Leader" of 13th January titled "The Nation Is Now At Stake" states, I quote:

What the Geneva vote in March last could not achieve, it now seems, the Parliament vote on Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayakes impeachment is capable of attaining."

At that time, what the "Geneva vote" was not able to achieve, would now be achieved with this impeachment and you will have that problem once again.

The explanation given by the Government, the US says is unsatisfactory, states another report. There are statements coming in daily. The international organizations and countries are just getting organized. They were, all this time, quite silent and if any sanctions are imposed on Sri Lanka, that will have a very serious effect. We are not worried about the Government. We are only worried about the people of this country. You would not suffer; you have enough resources. But, the people down below, who are living from hand to mouth with the increase in taxes, are those who will suffer.

Therefore, Sir, we strongly oppose these Amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Bill.

Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. M.K.A.D.S. Gunawardana. , 12.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , . ..... ( ..... ) (The Hon. M.K.A.D.S. Gunawardana) , . , . . .

, , , , . . . [2.31 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for the opportunity given to speak on this Bill. This Bill has had a bit of history. It was previously enacted for a limited period of time and had also authorized the Minister to extend its applicability by making orders for extension and on one of those occasions it was pointed out in this House that it had already lapsed without extending and the Hon. Minister of Justice graciously conceded that that was the case and its applicability came to an end.

Regrettably, today this Bill that is before the House, by Clause 8, seeks to validate even acts done during that period on which this Act was not in operation, when the provisions contained in this Bill had lapsed. Now, this is a very serious issue. It maybe a procedural matter, but nevertheless it has retrospective operation and it is not desirable. During a particular period of time when this law was not in operation, illegal acts that were committed by the law enforcement authorities are sought to be covered by this "Validation Clause 8" in this Bill.

Primarily, we are opposed to this Bill because it seeks to extend the period of detention in a police station. There is a lot of misunderstanding with regard to the 24-hour period and the 48-hour period. It must be remembered that in the scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure that we have had for over 100 years with the brief suspension during the AJL time, the Administration of Justice Law in the 1970s, the period has been only 24 hours and the misconception is that people think that 24 hours has been given for the conclusion of investigations, and that is wrong. If one looks at the scheme of the Code of Criminal Procedure, one will realize that the law did not expect the police to conclude their investigations within a period of 24 hours. That 24-hour limitation was only with regard to maximum permissible time in detention at a police station so that within the 24 hours, there will be a dawn, there will be a period of light, during which at least the person arrested can be produced before a magistrate. When he is produced, if it is a bailable offence, he is entitled to be enlarged on bail. If it is a non-bailable offence, then, there is provision for detention up to 15 days, not exceeding 15 days. If the police makes an application that such a person must be detained for 15 days, the Magistrate will detain that person. That is the period of time that the law expects

715 716

the police to conduct investigations and conclude them. It is not that first 24 hours. The first 24 hours is with regard to, perhaps, recording the statement of the person arrested and attendant matters like that. One does not expect the police to conclude the entirety of their investigations in 24 hours nor in 48 hours. By extending this period of time to 48 hours, it is not expected that they can ever conclude their investigation within 48 hours.

So, that is why it does not make sense to extend this period to 48 hours. The Minister of Justice in his reply might say that the requirement to produce the suspect before a Magistrate within 24 hours is still maintained and that is true; that is maintained. But, what is being introduced now is that a further 24 hours, or in the aggregate 48 hours, whatever the balance time after the person is produced before the Magistrate, he is permitted to be detained in a police station. That is the big difference that is being made.

Already, there is provision available for the investigating police officers to obtain permission from the Magistrate and record statements to interview the accused, to take him to a particular place, to continue with their investigations although his custody is with the fiscal authorities and not with the police. That is a safeguard. That is a time-honoured safeguard that this country has had and there is absolutely no reason, no logical sense in providing for a further period of 24 hours in which he is kept in police custody. This can only lead to abuse. As we have seen, our authorities and our law reports are full of incidents where police officers have been found guilty of torture within 24 hours. Now, you extend it by double the time. This will only pave the way for that kind of abuse by the police. Although there is a requirement to produce the person before a Magistrate, we know how that is done. Even when a person is detained after production in 24 hours, in several instances the Supreme Court has found that the person was, in fact, not produced. The police go to the Magistrates house and say the suspect is in the police vehicle. The Magistrate does not see the person and the detention order is given. This is what happens in practice and by this, the person will still remain in the police station, perhaps, hung up by his two feet, upside down while the police go and get an order from the Magistrate to continue his detention in the police station for another 24 hours. This is not a desirable thing.

There is no real reason why this amendment ought to be brought and that too as a temporary provisions Bill applicable only for two years. The other so-called reforms that are brought are also going to apply only for two years, like direct indictments before the High Court. Perhaps you can cut down on time. But here, the Attorney- General is being empowered to make decisions and, more often than not, we are going to have decisions based on political considerations rather than the strength

of the case, which a magistrate at a non-summary inquiry would have been able to ascertain much more. Today, the police are involved and, as I said, this will lead to abuse, very serious abuse.

I want to apprise this House of a very serious abuse that is going on at present with regard to one of my Colleagues, the Hon. S. Shritharan, Member of Parliament from the Jaffna District. On the 12th of January, his office was raided without the Speaker being informed, without even the MP himself being informed. While he was returning after having participated in a Debate in this House, his office was raided by the said to be Terrorist Investigations Division. Twenty five policemen raided his office. They took many things into the office. They brought bags; they brought their own laptop computers; they put a CD into the computer and produced pornographic material and then took photographs with his staff standing with the pornographic material on the screen of these computers. Now that material, the photographs that were taken by the Terrorist Investigations Division are now part of a leaflet campaign against this Hon. Member in the area of Kilinochchi and EPDP Members are involved in distributing this material all over the place. How did the photographs and were taken by the TID get into the hands of EPDP Members for them to go and distribute this scurrilous material all over town? How did that happen? This is because the Hon. Member raised a very important issue in this House of abuse by the security forces, by the army, in taking over a hundred young girls into their camps and abusing them. He raised it in this House and for that he was called by the TID. He raised a matter of Privilege in this House because his speech in this House was sought to be questioned by the police. When these officers came and raided his office, this is what they said. They told the staff there, Ah! He is the MP who is saying that the Tamil women are being abused. He is the one. It is for that reason that they have brought pornographic material; they have brought condoms and they have laid out all of them and taken photographs; arrested two of his associates - a staff and his secretary - and both are being detained without any production before a magistrate.

We are discussing whether a person can be held in police custody for 24 hours or 48 hours. But, under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, a person is detained for a much longer period without any production before a magistrate and two of his associates are - as I speak - being unlawfully and illegally being detained in the Terrorist Investigations Division. What about the 43 other youth who were arrested in Jaffna on the 30th of November and 1st and 2nd of December? They are still being held. More than one-and-a-half-months have passed, they have not been produced before a single judge. They are said to be surrendees after giving receipts of arrest to the next of kin. After they were actually arrested they are being described as surrendees and are being subjected to what is called "rehabilitation" and we

717 718

[ .. ]

2013 22

are told that they have voluntarily subjected themselves to be sent to rehabilitation. It is a joke.

I want to ask the Minister of Justice this question. Ever since you became Minister of Justice, Tamil political prisoners who are languishing in prisons for 10 years, 12 years, 13 years, 15 years have written numerous letters to you and in public several times you have given them assurance that you will look into it. How long more do you want to look into this matter? You are bringing in a (Special Provisions) Bill here to extend the period of detention in a police station from 24 hours to 48 hours and other matters said to be reforms to the Code of Criminal Procedure, but there are over 900 people, a fact that was disclosed by Hon. DEW Gunasekara when he was the Minister of Prison Reforms. He said somewhere between 600 and 900 people are there. He did not even know the number. Close upon 1,000 Tamil political prisoners are languishing in prisons, some for over 10 years. You know that very well. You have got their letters. What are you able to do as the Minister of Justice? You give them assurance after assurance. Is it not time, Hon. Minister, if you cannot do these things, if you cannot act according to your conscience and deliver, that you leave this post? That you leave it to persons who can handle this Ministry and that you honourably exit and say, Well, I cannot anymore be party to this kind of abuse and illegality. How long more are you going to cheat the people of this country? How long more are you going to cheat the persons who have appealed to you and to whom you have given assurance after assurance? I ask you this and I expect you to reply some of the issues that I have raised in this House today.

[4.38 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for giving me an opportunity to speak today. The Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Bill is being debated today due to the fault of the Ministry of Justice at that time. The Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act, No. 42 of 2007 had not been promulgated after 8th of September, 2011, and as such, the Act became insignificant and not in law. That itself shows the capacity of the Ministry of Justice. If the Ministry of Justice was more alert, this problem would have not arisen and we would have not spent one whole day in considering this Bill and debating this Bill in this august Forum.

When we consider the provisions of this Bill, 48 hours of custody is a matter of opinion; to be frank, it maybe an opinion from the Sri Lankan point of view. But, if you look at the British system or if you look at the Indian system or if you take the Malaysian law, all those laws only promulgate 24 hours of custody. So, when we consider those important factors, such as the Indian law, the British law, the Malaysian law, I do not understand why we are bringing in this provision of 48 hours.

Taking that into consideration, today what do the police officers do? When a person is taken into custody, if he is a known character or if he has money, probably he will be bailed out early. But, if he is not bailed out early, the police officers themselves keep the accused without even taking evidence for more than one or one and a half days and subsequent to that they take the evidence and say, you are charged, you will be produced before the Magistrate. And, probably he will be kept in custody for more than 48 hours. This is the practice that is taking place in this country. Therefore, whether we bring in this Bill or we do not bring in this Bill, this whole practical aspect of criminality is going on.

Now, if you look at the past history of Sri Lanka, some Members were saying that the legal fraternity was stoned during the late President J.R. Jayewardenes term. We may have stoned at that time. But, we never did what has been done today, sacking the Chief Justice. That is not the procedure that our country ever went through.

Even during the late President J.R. Jayewardenes time, Hon. Neville Samarakoon was charged. There was a special committee appointed to inquire into the charges. The charges were read out and he was found not guilty. Here, I am not trying to get into controversy in this Chamber. I merely want to bring one matter to the notice of this Assembly very clearly. When Hon. (Dr.)(Mrs.) Shirani Bandaranayakes inquiry was taken in on the 6th of December, I think her counsel had asked, Can we

759 760

lead evidence? What is the procedure that we have to take up? Can we lead witnesses? Then, the entire Select Committee had not replied positively or negatively. There was no answer. Then, the lawyers had said, Sorry, we are not going to take part in these proceedings any further; we are getting out of this procedure. The next day, there had been about 20 witnesses brought; evidence from all those witnesses had been led and she was found guilty.

If Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Shirani Bandaranayake is found guilty, certainly, she has to go home. There is no question about it. But, the question is whether the procedure laid down is correct. Carrying out the correct procedure is very important if we are to maintain justice and the judicial system in this country. That is all I am saying. I am not supporting her nor am I saying that she should not be taken off her post. But, the correct procedure should be laid down. Otherwise, there would be no justice in this country. Ultimately, we are heading towards a stage where we, ourselves, would not be in a position to address the problems and the atrocities committed as far as the judicial system of this country, the justice and the human rights are concerned.

Sir, there are so many factors. Now, we are talking of detaining a suspect for 48 hours. You have the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the TID. Tomorrow, if someone does not like my face, under that Act, they can take me in, keep me at the Boossa Camp for years and I would not be able to come out. There are detainees who have been kept there for years. So, if they have got charges, file the charges, try them out, hear the cases or else, let them out.- [Interruption.] Do not disturb me. The position is that even the Human Rights Council has referred to the many people there in custody. I can give the names of a few of those people.

Stephen Sundararaja, who was a Project Manager for the Centre of Human Rights and Development, was taken into custody by the army on the 12th of February, 2009. He was released on the 7th of May, 2009. Then subsequently, he was abducted again and taken to the Cinnamon Garden Police Station. A statement was obtained, he was rearrested and there was no acknowledgement of the detention. Then, there is another case against a lady called Thirumagal. She may have been an LTTEer; I am not trying to support her. If she is an LTTEer, go ahead with the charges against her, prove those and find fault with her. This lady, Thirumagal, has been in the detention camp for 15 years and she had visited the court for more than 429 times. How many more years has she to be there? Yet, we do not know where she is and what the Director of the Terrorist Investigation Division had said. So, this is the position as far as that lady is concerned. Then, Lakshman Cooray, Police Superintendent, was accused of involvement in an assassination of a Minister and detained by the Terrorist

Investigation Department in August, 2009. Nearly 17 months after his arrest, on the 7th of February, 2011, Cooray was indicted by the High Court of Colombo. He was not transferred to the remand prison, but kept in the Boossa Camp reportedly being tortured. Then, T. Ravindran, whose name had been changed in the report, was arrested when he was at the Bandaranaike International Airport and detained till September, 2007. There was no arrest warrant. He had been relocated several times and on January, 2012, he was remanded again in the Prison at Welikada. Then, R.D. Wickramasinghe, a teacher and a former Army Captain, was arrested and abducted in Dambulla on the 26th of June, 2006 and later, in 2011. He is yet remaining at the Bogambara Detainee Camp. Then, there is another person, Kumar, who was just 16 years of age at the time of his arrest. He may have been a terrorist and I am not trying to say no. But, my position is, if he is a terrorist, he should be tried and if he is not, he should be released. That is all. If he has been tried, give him punishment and put him into jail. Then, that is different, but do not keep him in custody, in the Boossa Camp or in any other camp, without issuing a charge sheet against him and going through the prosecution procedure. That is what we want.

The 48-hour detention is not a question to be argued today. The issue to be considered is whether we are adhering to the general principles of law. I say that we are not really adhering to those. Then, Alexandra Thayaparan, 48 years of age, from Mannar was detained by the Mullaitivu AG's Office. He was a disabled man as his leg was amputated in 1990 and has an artificial limb for support. Up to August, 2011, no charges were framed against him. Then, Rasiah Duwaraka, a student of 24 years of age from the Arts Faculty of the University of Peradeniya was arrested. She was an athlete and arrested in Kilinochchi. She filed a Fundamental Rights petition challenging the unlawful detention in June, 2010. The court ordered release on bail, but she still remains under the surveillance of the Terrorist Investigation Division. Sir, I am giving these few examples to show what is happening in this country.

For instance, see what happened to that lady, Rizana, who had been executed in Saudi Arabia. Now, this lady was supposed to have been found guilty of the death of an infant. Sir, there is a very fundamental question, whether the lady had really been found guilty of the charges of death of the child. The infants death report is not yet ready; the report has not been formulated. The report has not been given even to the Sri Lankan Embassy. How can a person be tried in that way? Of course, under the Saudi Arabian law, they have the right to do so.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Shariah law or any other law, there is an obligation on the part of the Sri Lankan Embassy -

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) You cannot interfere with those laws. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) That is not my question. My question is not regarding interference with the law. - [Interruption.] Excuse me. Please allow me to speak, Hon. Deputy Minister. My point is that the Sri Lankan Embassy as well as the Ministry of Justice should have looked into the matter and zealously safeguarded the interests of a Sri Lankan citizen. But there again, I am saying that if she had been found fault with, yes, she should be executed. There is no question about it. Whether it is execution or not, the question is, we are not yet aware under what circumstances the child died. Who was the cause of the infant's death? No one knows it. Did the Sri Lankan Embassy or the Sri Lankan Government at least send a lawyer on her behalf? There were so many Ministries and organizations involved in looking after these people. Did they ever exercise their jurisdiction? So, these are the matters to be considered, not to argue or even discuss the issue of detaining or keeping in custody a person for 48 hours prior to producing him before a magistrate.

Just look at the Sri Lankan courts today. If you look at the area outside the Colombo District Court, you would see that it is full of weeds. The building is not colour washed. Then, there are shanty-like structures built inside court premises, maybe, for security reasons. That was a beautiful Dutch building built for the sacred city of this country to look after the detainees and the accused. The country is getting beautified. I totally accept that. Colombo is getting a beautiful facelift. I appreciate that. But, in the same way - I do not blame the Hon. Minister for this because it is really the administration that should look into these matters - the court complexes should, first of all, be kept clean to have justice in this country.

If you look at another factor - this is not an issue relevent to the subject discussed today, but I just want to bring it to the notice of this august Assembly and I am mentioning this as a lawyer - the Land Registry rate has been raised to Rs. 500 today. This may not be part of the subject under discussion, but I am just stating this as it is an important factor. Rs. 500 is charged to search for a document in the Land Registry. You have to pay Rs. 500 to get a certified copy of a document. In the early stages, it was only Rs. 2.50. Now, it has been changed to Rs. 500. Today, an active lawyer practising in the judicial system has to pay Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,000 to the Land Registry to get a necessary document. If he wants to have five

documents searched for, it will cost him Rs. 5,000, which was not so earlier. So, I think it is very important that the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs and the Ministry of Justice consider this from the point of view of the litigants. Therefore, we also have to look into all these questions, the charges brought in and even at the issues that were raised earlier as far as the human rights are concerned.

If you look at the Prevention of Terrorism Act, under that, anyone can be taken into custody and kept for a period of 72 hours. Subsequently, if the police officer reports back to the magistrate that the person has been found guilty under the Prevention of Terrorism Act or he is a terrorist, he could be kept in custody until the entire trial is over.

Now, just look at the provisions that are existing today. Do we need all these? Today, we say there are no terrorists in this country and terrorism has already been solved. Whether there is a terrorist movement is or there are terrorists in this country, why do you not finish this whole transaction and delete these clauses? Why do we want Prevention of Terrorism Act? If you need that, amend the clauses in such a manner that will be fitting in today's society. Under the PTA, anyone can be taken in and kept at the Boossa Camp and we do not know what is happening there; God only knows. According to what I was made to understand, there is complete torture in that place. So, is this the fundamental rights that we are talking about? We have been zealously looked at by every country in the world. We may feel that we are not worried about the Western world. But, one day, we will feel that what we have done is wrong. If we have done something wrong, we have to accept that we have done something wrong and at least rectify that error. At the moment, we are talking about the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, we are talking about the United Nations Human Rights Council that is going to meet in the month of March, but we do not know what the stringent rules that they are going to bring against this country.

The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa who is really trying to develop this country has brought in so many development programmes. But with all that, if we are going to go against the fundamental system of this country, against the human rights of this country and if the entire world is looking at us in a different angle, how can we develop this country and how can we proceed further? Therefore, it is my request that we, as citizens of this country, as Sri Lankans, you as a Government should zealously safeguard the interests of this country, very zealously safeguard the interests of every citizen of this country. If we are not even bothered, if we are not worried about that, there is one source above us and that is the foreign agencies that are available and if stringent rules are brought against this country, what are we going to do? There will be no trade and whatever development that is going to happen is going to end.

763 764

Even that day, one of the officials of the American Embassy mentioned to a newspaper that as far as Sri Lanka is concerned, it is not a place for any future development. Why? Because these procedures have not been properly followed. If you want to find fault with the Chief Justice of this country, yes, do so, but have a proper system of inquiry and then find her guilty or not guilty. Certainly, we will accept it. But, that has not been done. Why did they want to conclude this whole inquiry within one week? What are we going to gain by this? Was there a race to get the Chief Justice out? Procedures should be properly upheld. Otherwise, there is no point in your bringing in this Bill, amending the Act, and our debating this Bill is not going to serve any purpose. That is my submission to you.

This matter was raised by the Hon. Ajith P. Perera, regarding duty attorneys in the police stations. As a matter of fact, as a recommendation of the LLRC, this is in the National Human Rights Action Plan that had been prepared by the Government.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Deputy Speaker, there was this issue that had been raised about the need to have duty attorneys in the police stations and this is a very salutary suggestion. As a matter of fact, the LLRC recommendations also contained this issue and as a follow-up, the National Human Rights Action Plan has incorporated this need to have duty attorneys in police stations. We have already prepared the necessary amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code and we can, perhaps, discuss it in the next Consultative Committee of the Ministry so that we can bring this into operation as early as possible.

However, I must mention here that since providing duty attorneys at each police station will also have some financial implications, it is subject to Treasury approval to have the necessary provisions provided for the Legal Aid Commission of Sri Lanka. Therefore, this is a matter that is under consideration and we will certainly be bringing it into operation.

The Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act, No. 13 of 1984 provides that upon a certificate filed by a police officer not below the rank of a Superintendent of Police, a persons detention could be requested for a period not exceeding seven days. So, there is a provision even up to seven days under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act, No. 13 of 1984. This has been in operation. But, here again, we

must bear in mind that this is limited to serious crimes and this matter came up purely because during the period of the UNP administration, in the year 2004, there was a report by a Committee which was appointed and that report pointed out that the conviction rate of serious crimes had dropped to 4 per cent. As a result of that, the entire criminal justice system came into serious focus to see whether we can try and increase the conviction rate of serious crimes in this country. As a result of that - [Interruption.] I will deal with that issue because most people have forgotten how some of these things have happened. So, as a matter of fact, if this additional 24-hour period for these limited crimes are not permitted, there can be abuse. By limiting this period, what happens is also something that is relevant and we must bear that in mind. I would deal with it in the Sinhala language because this has to go into newspapers. There have been widespread protests and criticisms, particularly, the two factions of the JVP had been very active for the last two or three days, trying to bring up a campaign though the UNP is far behind in their campaign as usual. They are now taking a back seat in most of these public campaigns and are allowing the JVP and their offshoots to take the front seat when carrying on campaigns and this is a sorry parlous state of the principal alternate government in this country. But, I must point out the wrong assumptions that have been -[Interruption.] No, no, your party and its plight is being continuously lampooned by all the mainstream media in this country. Let me not get into that area.

I would also like to refer to some of the issues raised by the other Members. Particularly, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella raised an issue regarding the non-summary procedure and the opportunity for cross-examination being not available was criticized. In this regard, he must bear in mind that in a non-summary proceeding, we are not seeking to convict an accused. The fact was, it has also been accepted by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka. The President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka himself conceded that this procedure can continue and we need not subject the witnesses and victims to a double jeopardy of having to testify in the Magistrate's Court as well as in the High Court and therefore, that must be borne in mind. He must also bear in mind that there is a provision for the Attorney-General to prefer a direct indictment without even opting to go for a non-summary inquiry. That is also provided here. Therefore, taking into consideration the laws delays in this country, we have seen by experience that the legal fraternity has broadly welcomed to have this in operation.

Then, the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana pointed out that when there are suspects detained outside police stations in other detention centres, various abuses could

take place. We must bear in mind that there is also -[Interruption.] No. Magistrates are provided with certain powers but sometimes these powers are not being used by them. Magistrates themselves as judicial officers are granted several opportunities not only to prevent any custodial ill-treatment or torture but also to hold accountable those who are clearly responsible for such actions.

According to the Release of Remand Prisoners Act, No. 8 of 1991, magistrates are required to visit places of detention of remand prisoners once a month for offences over which they have the power to order the release and if they find that complaints are received by remand prisoners about ill-treatment, torture or any other harassment, that can come under magisterial supervision, but unfortunately, our magistrates are not using their power to go and supervise these detention centres as it has been provided for.

Then, Section 39 of the Prisons Ordinance also provides this and, as a matter of fact, Members of Parliament too could have access to prisons and other places to go and inspect remand prisoners.

Together with that, I must now refer to a particular matter that had been raised by the Hon. Sumanthiran relating to the prisoners who have been taken into custody particularly during the period of the war and are still languishing in prison and have not been released. I would rather deal with that in Tamil, because I am sure what he said would be in headlines of all the Tamil newspapers tomorrow since he called for my resignation. So, he had made sure that he will grab the headlines in the vernacular press by referring to and calling for my resignation for not having fulfilled assurances given in the past. - [Interruption.] I must say very clearly, Hon. Sampanthan, and let me say that in Tamil.

I must say that even as a follow-up to the LLRC recommendations, the Committee appointed under the Chairmanship of Mr. Lalith Weeratunga, the Secretary to the President, has been having frequent discussions and the Secretary to my Ministry is also a part of that task force. The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, in his Human Rights Action Plan has incorporated some of these issues. We have the LLRC task force that has been appointed. They are looking into most of these matters and some action has been taken. Of course, there are certain delays -

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) , LLRC Report -

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No. I do not accept - [Interruption.] As a matter of policy - ( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) ? . . ? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No. As a matter of policy, the Government does not accept that we have political prisoners. There are prisoners; there are detainees; there are people who are held under special laws. So, all of those matters are being looked into very meticulously. A special team has been appointed by the Attorney-Generals Department. Specific courts have been set up. Particularly in Mannar a court is already functioning. There is a court even in the Welikada Prison itself - a court house has been separated. The only problem is because of the issues concerning the Chief Justice, the appointment of specific High Court judges to sit exclusively for this purpose has been delayed. We are also faced with a difficulty of having an additional number of High Court judges that are necessary. In fact, I have submitted a Cabinet Paper to increase the number of High Court judges from 75 at least up to 90, so that we can have some additional High Court judges, some dedicated judges available to sit and dispose of the cases which have been pending for a long time. This matter has been looked into and action has been taken.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) What about the detainees? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Basically some of those detainees have been held under the PTA. Some of them are suspects against whom investigations have been completed and some against whom investigations are pending. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) What about KP not being taken in like the others? - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, you have been posing this question several times. We have answered them very clearly. - [Interruption.] We have very clearly said that there has not been sufficient evidence to indict him. -[Interruption.] We have very clearly said that. - [Interruption.] If sufficient evidence is adduced, we can indict him. That is my pure and simple answer. - [Interruption.]

Having said that, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would like to summarize what I said. Particularly, the purpose of this Bill has been explained and the need to have these provisions, as I explained in the Sinhala language, is very clear and it is to prevent abuse taking place. As a matter of fact, the converse to what has already been said by the Opposition that it would encourage abuse in the police stations, I would like to say that this would, in fact, prevent such abuse taking place. What we observe today is that because of the limited period available, police officers are seemed to be resorting to various unlawful methods of extracting statements. Sri Lanka, being a signatory to the Convention against Torture, we are duty-bound to see that there should be zero tolerance for torture in Sri Lanka. That matter has been reiterated several times by the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe in Geneva and in many other forums. Also, we have seen to it that the policy of zero tolerance is reflected in the fact that the Attorney-Generals Department has taken a policy decision not to defend even a single police officer who is accused of torture in Fundamental Rights cases before the Supreme Court.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You have conceded now that it is going to be used against -

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, no, what I am saying is that there has been a prevalence of such issues. As a Government, which is committed to uphold the Rule of Law, if there are any such issues taking place, we have to take cognizance of them and prevent them. This is what the Government has progressively done. So, this Bill, as a matter of fact, will encourage the police to see that they will abide by the existing laws and existing procedures and also will encourage successful prosecution of serious offences and serious crimes taking place in the country. With those words, I conclude. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Mr. Presiding Member, when we talk of test cricket - that is what we call real cricket - I remember that for several decades the Sri Lankan Cricket Board and the country at large carried out a real struggle to obtain test status. For years and years, we wanted test status and ultimately in the '80s, I think when the Hon. Gamini Dissanayake was the President of the Cricket Board, we obtained it. So, we should nurture and safeguard that status in Sri Lanka.

But, unfortunately, now what is happening is, the players are reluctant to play test cricket. The unfortunate thing is, in the present scenario, the selectors are scared of the players. I think the Hon. Minister will agree that the selectors are scared of the players.

The Cricket Board and the selectors do not set the timetable; the timetable is set by the cricketers. Last year, when the English Cricketers came - we normally give them three test matches - we gave them only two test matches because our cricketers had to go and play in the IPL. So, what is going to happen is, when we go to England, they will also give us two test matches.

Our test cricket standard is not very high because in the recent tour of Australia, we lost all the test matches. It is very bad. So, I would advise the Hon. Minister to have three teams: one for test cricket, one for 50-over matches and one for T20. You must also set the programme and the timetable and tell the cricketers, This is our timetable. If you are available, you play. Otherwise, you go". Other countries do not follow this. In other countries, they set the timetable for this year, next year and so on and tell the players, This is our timetable. If you want, you play, otherwise, you go. So, that will enable the young cricketers to play. Have three teams: one for test cricket, one for 50-over matches and one for T20. There is plenty of talent. In the recent tour of Australia, I think several new batsmen were discovered.

I would not like to speak for long, but I would advise the Hon. Minister, you must take control of the Cricket Board and the programme for the future years.

Thank you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay, thank you very much.

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Before I commence my speech, it is a duty cast upon us to pay in this House, our homage to Tony Greig who was one of the best-known cricketers in our world of cricket. He played for two countries, South Africa and England, and at the end breathed his last in Australia. We remember him so dearly and cherish his memory particularly for the reason that he put our name Sri Lanka very high on the world map.

Mr. Presiding Member, you would know that in any country like West Indies, New Zealand, Africa or Zimbabwe, when we mention a name of a Minister or even a Prime Minister, they do not know them but when we mention the name, Sanath Jayasuriya, Arjuna Ranatunga or Muttiah Muralitharan, then they know that they are from a country known as Sri Lanka. So, in countries where Sri Lanka was least known, Tony Greig did a marvellous job. He was in the mould of great commentators like Norman Yardley and John Arlott.

Tony Greig was vivacious, scintillating and sometimes tantalizing. He described the beauties of our shores, our beaches and our natural surroundings in the test matches at Galle, Pallekele, Sooriyawewa and even in the rest of world. So much so, Sir, I know that because of his lucid commentaries, the British people took a great liking and wanted to visit our Isle. There was an "Army" called Cricket Barmy Army. They came to Sri Lanka and special facilities were made for them for the first time in the Galle International Cricket Ground. They even brought their toilet equipment and other accessories for their exclusive use on that occasion. Tony has done his duty towards us. We never paid him for the great service that he did for our country. But, not withstanding that, everyone in Sri Lanka, including His Excellency the President mourned his death. We send our deepest sympathies to Vivian, his wife, and his children.

I am a little puzzled, Sir, with my good Friend, the Hon. Ajith Perera as to what he is seeking through this Motion. Now, Sir, they were talking about test cricket. Sanath Jayasuriya and Arjuna Ranatunga played. He was a decision-maker and administrator. Decisions conducive to cricket were taken by the Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala, a former Chairman of the Sri Lanka Cricket. A former Minister of Tourism and Sports, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, also spoke today. Sir, I should record that the Hon. Sumathipala did a brilliant job in putting up the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium in Dambulla. At a time, Sir, when ICC members visited Sri Lanka, they discovered that we were short of grounds. They were not able to give us many matches as we sought. Earlier, it was only the Oval Ground - at present called the "P.

803 804

Saravanamuttu Stadium", - the SSC Ground and the NCC Ground. Then, came the Ranasinghe Premadasa Khettarama Stadium at Maligawatta. Our President saw a great future for cricket and he ordered the building of the massive International Cricket Stadium at Sooriyawewa. Even the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium was developed under his guidance.

Therefore, when we play cricket it is left to the cricketers to play the game in the middle. What happened to such a great cricketer, Don Bradman? In his farewell match he got out for a zero. The same thing happened to another great Australian cricketer, Ponting. He could not stay long in the crease when he bid farewell to the world of cricket. Today, we have a fine team led by Mahela Jayawardene and new players are now displaying their talents far above the talents, sometimes of other seasoned players like Dinesh Chandimal and, of course, there is a new player called Kushal Janith Perera, the wicket-keeper cum batsman, one of the best latest introduction to the world of cricket. After Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara and others retire from the scene, I think the new players will take over the centre stage and take Sri Lanka to greater heights.

I am very happy to state, while concluding my speech, that the Sports Minister, Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage has taken all effort in order to improve cricket and develop other sports in this country. He gets all the assistance, guidance and good advice from His Excellency the President. I think under our President, the Ministry of Sports chaired by the Hon. Aluthgamage will have a bright future. We wish a bright future for Sri Lanka Cricket. Good luck to cricket!

Thank you.
