In order to accommodate the proposals made by Tax Commission, amendments were made to the Value Added Tax Act - VAT (Amendment) Act, No. 7 of 2012; the Income Tax- Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 8 of 2012; the Nation Building Tax - NBT (Amendment) Act, No. 9 of 2012; the Economic Service Charge - ESC (Amendment) Act, No. 11 of 2012; and the Finance Act, No. 11 of 2012.

Then, regarding the progress in tax reforms and the tax to GDP ratio, the tax reforms introduced in 2011 are mainly based on the recommendations made by the Tax Commission. Under these reforms, the tax system was simplified, tax rates were reduced and a number of taxes

were removed. The new tax system was strengthened and consolidated in the subsequent Budgets presented for 2012, 2013 and 2014. It is expected that with the full impact of these reforms and improvements in tax administration complemented by the expected improvement in economic activities, it will help to increase tax to GDP ratios in the medium term as given in the table below:

Then, as regards the publishing, this document has been presented in English. It is being translated and will be tabled in the House. Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , ); the procedure is very clearly laid down. We, in Parliament, have to follow the Constitution and from the Constitution, we derive the powers of the Standing Orders. If the Standing Orders are to be amended, there is a procedure laid down and the Hon. Speaker has already appointed a Committee to amend the Standing Orders, which is proceeding. If any other Bill attempts to subvert these two very clear positions that have been taken under the Constitution, the Standing Orders and the Parliament procedure, we are sorry to say that we cannot agree to this new procedure that is being adopted. Then, we have to discuss matters. So, we cannot agree to this. . , , . .

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Deputy Minister of Investment Promotion) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) There is a point of Order being raised. ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Speaker, Standing Order No. 78A provides for the mechanism. I respectfully state that the Bill is inconsistent with Standing Order No. 78A. I am not going into the contents of the Bill, but I only state that if we are to bring this Bill, already there is a mechanism by way of Standing Orders. Also, Article 107(3) of the Constitution provides for that by way of law or the Standing Orders. So, when we presently have a mechanism, we cannot bring a Bill which is inconsistent with Standing Order No. 78A. Therefore, the Hon. Speaker would have to first consider whether this mechanism could only be adopted if the Bill is consistent with Standing Order No. 78A. I respectfully state that the Bill is inconsistent with Standing Order No. 78A and therefore, you cannot bring that in.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Speaker, we are not going into the contents of the Bill. There is a mechanism in terms of Standing Order |No. 78A; there is a procedure to be adopted. So, this cannot proceed because there is a provision setting out the mechanism in the Standing Orders. You cannot bring in a Bill, which is inconsistent with the Standing Orders. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition is going into the contents of the Bill.

After a very unsatisfactory performance by the "One Shot" who always thinks that this is a biscope maduwa, I am not in an appropriate position to start. The theatrical act that he performed in this House today has no value in Parliamentary procedure.

Sir, I want to quote Henry Ward Beecher, Proverbs from Plymouth Pulpit. Under "Press: Its Virtues" it has been stated that, Newspapers are the schoolmasters of

the common people. That endless book, the newspaper, is our national glory. That is the glory that His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa has brought to the whole world.

Today, Sir, when we consider the opening batsman, the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, I, for a moment thought that it was not his script at all. He was reading from somebody else's script. It was very unusual.

Sir, the Daily Mirror of Monday, 18th November, 2013 under the caption "CNN interview with Dr. Chris Nonis," states, I quote:

Sri Lankas High Commissioner to Britain has blamed criticism of this countrys human rights record on a 'proxy propaganda war' being carried out by those who funded the nations terrorist conflict

"We don't need an international investigation when we have had a vibrant civilization of 2,500 years." Dr. Nonis said this. Let the world hear this.

"We have perfectly educated people and I think we are perfectly capable of carrying out our own domestic inquiry."

Like a true Sri Lankan, Dr. Chris Nonis rose to the occasion.

Then, Sir, Callum Macrae was blaming the President and asking several questions about the violation of human rights by the State. Then, I got up on behalf of Sri Lanka, my motherland and asked Macrae : "Where was your camera when a hundred thousand Muslims were chased away from Jaffna?" I asked Macrae, "Where was your camera when people were massacred and killed inside the Mosque in Kattankudi?" I asked Macrae, "Where was your camera when Samanera Bhikkus were butchered in Aranthalawa?" I asked Macrae, "Where was your camera when people were butchered in Kebithigollewa" ?

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I will finish in a moment.

Also, there was a fine lady, a beautiful lady. She was a talented newsreader in the SLBC and Rupavahini, Relangi Selvarajah. She was murdered for no fault of hers. . . Where is your camera, Macrae? I asked him. ) , ) , , . ) ) .

( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. R. Yogarajan. You have got 20 minutes.

[5.02 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Presiding Member, I regret that I have to speak soon after the Hon. Azwer, who is trying to remind the people again and again about the Kebithigollewa, Aranthalawa and Kattankudi massacres. Against this only, I am going to speak today.

Sir, I spoke last on the final day of the Second Reading Debate, and this is the first time I am speaking in the Committee Stage Discussion. On that day, I took up the theme, "reconciliation". I am again speaking to you today, and appealing to the media to support reconciliation in this country so that we can all live together in the future forgetting the war, as one nation, as one Sri Lankan community. For this, you as the Hon. Minister can play a role and I appeal to you to do that in an effective and positive manner, please.

I take this opportunity first to talk about reconciliation through a common remembrance day. Today, again, I wish to speak about the role the media can play in promoting reconciliation.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Hon. Member, you mentioned a "remembrance day". "Remembrance day" of what?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) One remembrance day for all those who died in the 30

-year war. The civilians - [Interruption.] Hon. Azwer, I will clarify to you and the Hon. Minister.

1773 1774

2013 11

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Can I get a clarification? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Minister, let me speak. You will get a clarification in a part of my speech; give me a moment. Be patient.

Though four years have passed, I still feel that reconciliation has not taken place in our country. We continue to talk about the incidents that have happened and this is what I am going to tell you. I spoke last time about "Maaveerar Day" because that was a hot topic at that time. The TNA Members had been talking about it and there was an attempt by the Government to stop it. So, I said, we need not have a Maaveerar Day; we also should not have a Victory Day. We will combine. Let all people get together and have a remembrance day for all those who died. I made a speech and I said that we should change the day for remembering the dead to 19th

May . Instead of celebrating Victory Day, let all the peoples of Sri Lanka come together and commemorate the death from both sides; not only both sides but even those innocent people who were killed in the crossfire. Hon. Minister, you are asking me whether the Tigers should also be commemorated. Is that your question? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) It is not the Tigers; it is the people who were termed as terrorists.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Okay, termed as terrorists? ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Yes. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Minister, when I spoke last time I said that you have been telling that a lot of people were misled. They were conscripted by force. They died in the war, maybe while fighting for the Tigers. But, those children are the children of some father, some mother, a brother of a -

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) They had killed thousands of people and contributed in the killing and destruction of a nation. So, are you trying to justify that and commemorate them as well?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I always condemn the method that the LTTE used. As you know, the dead have to be commemorated by their relations. I mentioned that last time also. - [Interruption.] When a man is hanged - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) That is a very personal thing; I can understand that. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) That is exactly what I am saying. Those individuals are remembered -

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) I will appreciate your sentiments and their sentiments, but the fact of the matter is that when they are termed as terrorists, as a nation, as a responsible Government, as a country, can you put it down and underline and underscore the term commemoration of "terrorists? That is what I am asking.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Not terrorists. You are mistaking me again. That is, commemoration of the dead. It does not mean - [Interruption.] I do not know. This is the whole problem, Hon. Minister - [Interruption.] Please let me speak.

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) How many Ministers are shouting? There is only one Minister in charge. So, let him speak.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) You can commemorate them on Victory Day. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) That is exactly what I am saying. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) So, let it be called Victory Day and you can commemorate them.

1775 1776

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Do not call it Victory Day. Victory over whom? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Let them celebrate the freedom. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Your victory is over one set of people of this country. So, do not celebrate Victory Day. - [Interruption.] No, we feel hurt when you celebrate Victory Day. So, we will commemorate this as Remembrance Day. That is what I am asking.

Okay, now forget about that. Today, we are talking about media. I feel that media can play a role.

When I spoke in the House that day, I mentioned about this common day for all of us to get together. One of the

Tamil Newspapers states,

" - .. ". " 19 - ."

This is a positive report in the Tamil newspaper. Then, we had a news item in the Daily Mirror of 30th November, 2013 titled, I quote:

Yogarajan proposes common day of commemoration

It goes on to state, I quote:

'Lets change the date if you dont want to commemorate the heroes on November 26 ..."

The article states heroes, but I never used the word heroes in my speech; I said the "dead. Let it be celebrated on the day which is called "Victory Day". Those are two news reports.

Then, we get the Sinhala version of the same news in the "Lankadeepa" of 30th November, 2013, which states, I quote:

" "

This is what, Hon. Minister, I am protesting against. The Tamil media wants to please the Tamil reader. The English media has both Tamil and Sinhala readers. So, they give a different version. But, the Sinhala newspaper gives a totally different version, which is very unfair. By

this, what are we doing, Hon. Minister? We are building hatred.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Whom are you blaming? ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Are you blaming me? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, I am not blaming you. - [Interruption.] What I am telling you, Hon. Minister, is that we have to create a media culture in this country where -

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Ah, you blame me and at the same time, you are talking of a media -.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I do not blame you at all, Hon. Minister. You are a Minister for whom I have a lot of respect. You are person who came first on the UNP list in Kandy in 2001, and again in 2004. You went to the other side, but still you got elected by your people. That shows how close you are to the people. You would understand that you could influence the thinking of the people and you could guide the media to see that this type of hatred is not built through it. This is all I appeal to you. I appeal not only to you -

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) This is not relevant to the clarification I am seeking. Thank you for your appreciation.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is because you interrupted me that I had to say all this.

The theme of my speech is that the media is an organization that can build reconciliation in this country and get us together. I am not a person who thinks different of the communities, Sinhalese or Tamil. I am one person in this House who went beyond it. There is one choice you make in your life - to choose your wife. When I chose my wife, I went beyond my race. That is because I do not believe in communalism or communities. I am beyond that; I am a Sri Lankan.

1777 1778

2013 11

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Hon. Member, give me one minute, to make a point very clear. The clarity is that I am trying to differentiate between a "person" and a "terrorist". That is all.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I did not talk about terrorists at all. I did not mention the TNA in my speech last time, but the newspapers projected it that way. The Divaina of last Sunday carried an article titled " ...?", which states, I quote:

".... . ......."

I never used that word.

"... ) ."

):

"... . 26 .

?"

This is the same question you asked me. So, they are trying to project me as one who said that we must get together to remember our dead, in that way. When you join somebody to share their grief, that is the best way to get together. But, when you join somebody to celebrate, that feeling of oneness does not arise.

So, that is why I asked that the day of remembrance of the dead be held by both communities together and that would be ideal.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Hon. Member, that is the thinking of mine as well. All Tamils are not terrorists, but unfortunately, all terrorists were Tamils. So, that is where the differentiation has to be made. That is exactly what I am saying.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) We see the media arousing peoples feelings by continuously projecting the remembrance days of all the bad incidents that took place like the Hon. Azwer did now. Is that a positive way of reconciling the people in this country? Do you not think that we must talk about things which are common to the two communities so that

we can, in the future, build up one nation where we are united? Towards that, I appeal to the media and I also appeal to you, as the Hon. Minister of Mass Media and Information, to guide them. You have a very cordial relationship with the media. We have seen that every Thursday, when you do the briefing of Cabinet decisions on behalf of the Government. So, that cordial relationship, you can use to build up a rapport between the communities and urge the media to get us together. Hon. Minister, you must encourage the media to move in such a direction that we forget the past, the difficulties, the enmities and we come together.

The "Sooriyan FM", one of the Tamil radio channels of ABC, has been broadcasting the voice of the late President Nelson Mandela during last week. His voice says, I respect you; I admire you; I love you. That is the message he gave to those white people who suppressed the blacks in South Africa under apartheid. This message, they keep repeating. Why? To build in the minds of our people that we have to forget and love those who did not do justice to us. Why do they broadcast it on "Sooriyan FM"? They are giving that message to the Tamil people. I am not sure whether they do it on "Hiru FM" also. If they do so, that would be a positive thing where they are changing the mindset of the people towards reconciliation. This is what I appeal for. Hon. Minister, I do not want to stand here and just attack your Government, you or talk about general things. I am trying to do something positive as a moderate Tamil person in this country. Please give ear to people like us who do not want to continue this enmity, with which we do not reach any goal. We should get together and see that we are able to reconcile.

Finally, before I wind up, I wish to quote Nelson Mandela, which is very relevant to the media. Nelson Mandela said, I quote:

No one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin, or his background or his religion. People must learn to hate, ...."

They are born without any hate, but they learn to hate.

".......and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.

So, if the media believes in reconciliation, believes in all of us living in this nation as one people, then they must try to teach our people to love and not teach them to hate. Thank you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Sir, the Mover of this Motion complains basically that an extensive discussion has not taken place on the damage supposed to be caused to the people in the area. According to the Deputy Minister, the Hon. Y.G. Padmasiri, there is no objection as such, and water could be tapped from one district to the other. Reservoirs are not built around cities like Colombo or Jaffna. The water supply to Jaffna comes from Iranamadu. It is so in respect of other areas as well. In Colombo, we get water from Labugama and Kalatuwawa. So, that is the normal practice in keeping with the drainage system, the geological condition and the availability of water in reservoirs and lakes.

Then, Sir, major water supply projects, medium and small water supply projects, community water supply projects and rural water supply projects are implemented islandwide with the aim of fulfilling the pure drinking water needs of the people living in remote, rural and urban areas. As a result of these projects, pipe-borne water has been provided to more than 1.6 million of people in the country. I am very sure, Sir, our Minister, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva would be quite knowledgeable about the whole process and he is one person who is visiting irrigation channels right round the country in order to improve irrigation facilities.

Sir, the "Mahinda Chintana" also envisages that pure drinking water should be given to the people. The Hon. Member is blaming somebody in his Motion. What sounds in the Motion is that it is the Gampaha District Leader. Sir, if he is meaning the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, I would like to say that he is a leader not only for Gampaha but also for other areas and, in fact, for the whole country as well. He is doing so much of work such as, construction of roads right throughout the country. The whole country knows that he always has constant discussions with the people. He is willing to discuss and

settle any given problem. Therefore, we are sure that he would be able to solve this problem also. But, as he says, if the Gampaha people are to be benefited from this project, then, of course, it could be discussed. We cannot deprive a community of its water. This is the same problem that the people of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka are also facing. They have got the Kaveri water problem. They are not able to take water from one State to another because the river runs through -

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Hon. Member, your Governments policy is to give water supply to Uganda, not to the people of Sri Lanka. You have spent money for a water project in Uganda but people in Rathupaswala have not got water. What are you speaking?

( ) (The Presiding Member) Let the Hon.Azwer speak. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, this is exactly in the "Mahinda Chintana". Do you understand what I am saying? Water could be tapped from anywhere. Sir, he descends from somewhere after being absent from the country every three months and suddenly, he wants prove to his people that he is in Sri Lanka.
