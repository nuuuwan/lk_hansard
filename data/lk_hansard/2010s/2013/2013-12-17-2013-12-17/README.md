Islam into criticism. He cannot do that. They wanted to have North and East together. They cannot live together with the Muslims in Kalmunai. Then, how can they live? How can they ask the support of the Muslims?

[12.16 p.m.] . .. ( ) ( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Urban Affairs) Mr. Chairman, I thank you for giving me a few minutes to speak.

As a Senior Minister and the Minister of Urban Affairs, I would like to inform this House that the urban population in our country has increased. The estimated increase in our urban population during the period 2005 to 2015 is about 3 per cent, while the population increase of the entire country is about 1.2 per cent. It has also been estimated that 50 per cent of the total population will live in urban areas by the year 2015.

Our Government has given priority to a planned approach, having understood the importance of strategies to be followed for developing infrastructure facilities in urban areas in order to provide basic facilities to the urban poor population with a view to minimizing the difficulties developing fast in urban areas towards a sustainable urban development, depending on the speed and extent of urbanization.

During this year, I have co-ordinated with the Central Government, Provincial Councils and Local Authorities individually and jointly regarding the common problems pertaining to water supply, sanitation and waste disposal, which are common features seen not only in the City of Colombo but also in the cities outside.

I have also taken action to co-ordinate some of the Divi Neguma" Programme activities for the benefit of the urban poor especially in Jaffna, Mannar, Vavuniya, Polonnaruwa and Galle. In these programmes, we have distributed equipment among beneficiaries to promote domestic and household industries. We were able to extend a valuable contribution to the local communities by participating in various exhibitions and programmes organized jointly by the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development islandwide.

Awareness creation programmes were conducted at district level to promote cottage industries. Necessary training, technology and market opportunities were provided to suitable persons to start small industries. Exhibitions were conducted in many districts in order to attract the unemployed young men and women and to motivate them to start self-employment projects. A majority of those who started new businesses were women. We have also carried out follow-up action to monitor the progress of these activities.

Mr. Chairman, I had the opportunity of heading a Ministerial Committee to formulate a policy to determine bus fares. After having consultations with the relevant

2485 2486

[ .

2013 17

parties to provide a sound and qualitative bus service to the public by reviewing the present policy, we were able to recommend an increase in the bus fare by 7 per cent based on the running cost index calculated by the National Transport Commission, avoiding a breakdown in the bus service until a new policy on bus fare is formulated based on the quality of bus service.

In conclusion, I would like to express my gratitude to my Secretary, Mr. Mahinda Madihahewa, to the officials and all those who gave me their support and co-operation to carry out the duties of my Ministry. Thank you.

[12.22 p.m.] () ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana - Minister of Scientific Affairs) Hon. Chairman, the importance of science, technology and innovation was accepted by the Cabinet when I presented a national strategy. It so happens that the mandate which has been given to me as a Senior Minister has enabled me to co-ordinate the implementation of that strategy, which is so vitally important to lift our economy so that we become a high value-added economy for our raw materials and become a developed rich country which can solve the problems of poverty in Sri Lanka. This was accepted by the Cabinet and the Cabinet Memorandum which I submitted to set up a co-ordinating secretariat for this purpose, was also accepted. The co-ordination and monitoring of all activities of this Co-ordinating Secretariat and other Ministries relevant to science, technology and innovation strategy would fall within the responsibilities of the Minister of Scientific Affairs. In terms of this, I am happy to say that the Co-ordinating Secretariat - COSTI - has been set up; half the personnel required have been recruited and they are working very well as a team with various line ministries, institutions and the private sector bringing about the necessary coordination, so that not only is the limited resources that are available best utilized by the scientific community, but the scientific community interacts with industrial community so as to give maximal benefit to our economy.

Now, we have worked out a detailed programme for implementation in the year 2014. I made a request for Rs. 160 million which is what is required for this, but unfortunately only Rs. 87 million had been allocated in the Budget. During the Meetings of the Select Committee, I brought this up and I am happy to say that at this meeting presided by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, a decision was taken that the requested amount of Rs. 160 million will be included in the budgetary provisions for 2014 and I hope that this will be done.

That was one problem, but there is another problem which I want to draw the attention of the House. That is, the conduct of the Secretary of the Ministry of Technology and Research, Mrs. Dhara Wijayatilake. In accordance with the Cabinet Memorandum which was accepted by the Cabinet, the Secretary to the President, Mr. Lalith Weeratunga issued a circular which went round to all the Ministries, to all heads of institutions, directing them to cooperate and work with COSTI to bring about the necessary coordination and monitoring to maximize the benefit to our economy. The principles and aims of co-ordination ensure that national development considerations form an integral part of all science and technology activities as per the five-year science technology and innovation strategy.

Now, just to give you an example, as part of this strategy the setting up of a National Science Centre was mooted. The plans were drawn up for this National Science Centre by COSTI. This was submitted to the Department of National Planning and accepted. It was discussed with the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, Minister of International Monetary Co-operation and Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning and he agreed to get the finances. Then, action was taken to obtain land from the UDA for this purpose. While all this was going on, there were several meetings called, and from the Ministry of Technology and Research representing the National Science Foundation, there was a representative who participated and cooperated in our efforts. This was going on very satisfactorily. I am very happy that His Excellency the President has included the setting up of this National Science Centre in the Budget, which practically every other country has. Developed countries such as the United States of America has over 100 and developing countries such as India has 27. So, developing countries have also appreciated the importance of setting up a National Science Centre. This whole thing was set in motion as part of this strategy, which was accepted by the Cabinet. While this is going on, I am sorry to say that on the directive of the Secretary to the Ministry of Technology and Research, the person from the National Science Foundation has withdrawn from participating in the meetings. Not only that, she has directed the National Science Foundation to come out with an alternative proposal. We have already put this up; this has been accepted and included in the Budget. Now, she is trying to set a separate process going, which is quite contrary to what has been accepted by His Excellency the President and the Government in terms of this Budget. So, I think this is not the way in which a responsible Secretary of a Ministry should behave.

In addition to that, I am sorry to say that we have had innumerable meetings, because there are so many sectors which we want to develop. The question of getting titanium dioxide from ilmenite, then going on to titanium; LAUGFS Gas has come in and SLINTEC, which I helped to establish, has now proceeded along that line. So, we

2487 2488

are trying to develop that same capability in other areas. For instance, we have the best graphite in the world and graphene is being developed. The European Union is setting up a whole unit of all the countries to make use of graphene as a new basis for industrial development. Here, we need to set up our own graphene production centre and we are working on those areas. So, in our effort to do this, we are having a number of committees, councils, which are meeting and trying to coordinate different sectors and develop the type of economic programme that will take our country forward. But, I am sorry to say that she has been communicating with various organizations, not only local organizations, but foreign organizations like the World Intellectual Property Organization - WIPO - in Geneva, the GIZ, the Asian Development Bank and trying to run down what we are doing and saying that we are not entitled to do this. Thereby, she is really acting as a spoiler in what we are doing, which has been approved by the Cabinet. Is this the way for a Secretary of a Ministry to behave? I think, here, we all have to get together and work together with all the relevant line Ministries and various institutions, pool our resources, coordinate our efforts and direct them towards meaningful development of our economy on a planned basis. This is what our Ministry together with COSTI has been trying to do. But I am very sad to say that this individual is behaving in this way, which is contrary to the very spirit of Government Service. I think we should work out some means of coming - [Interruption.]

I really appreciate the Hon. Gunaratne Weerakoon, Minister of Resettlement and members of our staff, especially Mr. Janaka Sugathadasa, the Secretary and M.M. Nayemudeen, the Additional Secretary. Not only them, I also appreciate the minor staff because we have worked as a family. That is why we have achieved these targets.

I also appreciate His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who has given proper advice to us from time to time regarding resettlement. At the same time, I really appreciate the Minister of Economic Development, Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa, who has given the fullest support to this Ministry, which is why we have achieved our targets.

Everybody is aware that the UN Representative for IDPs, Dr. Beyani, came recently to meet our Ministers and also the people. He went to the North and appreciated the marvellous progress that we have achieved so far. Infrastructure activities are going on very well. We have already done the resettlement very well. But, there are still some small issues; we accept that. In future, we can solve those issues. Within a short period, we cannot do everything. We cannot bridge the 30-year gap within a matter of three or four years. We need time.

Thank you.

[3.43 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Presiding Member, yet today, we are debating on the Ninth Budget that was presented by His Excellency the President in this Parliament. We have analysed it in many ways and ultimately the findings maybe that this Budget is not a people-friendly Budget, but can be termed as an "enemy Budget" for the people. There are many factors to come to this conclusion.

We have ended the war and by next May, five years would have lapsed. We have spent a lot and won this war with great hardship and we must congratulate the Government and the armed forces for having done so. Sir, after the five years of war, this amount of expenditure that has been incurred as far as the defence is concerned -

[Interruption.] Yes, it is being more expended; the cost of defence is increasing every year. Five years ago it was said that after the war, all monies that were spent on the war would be given for the development of this country, but, today, we see that none of these promises that had been given by the Government in favour of this country have been fulfilled. It is a very serious matter to be considered because even lately, I saw a notification in the newspapers, that the Government is calling upon for semi-skilled people to join the army and is willing to pay them Rs. 37,000 a month as salary. What is the Government trying to do? Are they trying to militarize the entire country? Is that what they want to do? Certainly, the armed forces will have to be looked after because they have won the war. There is a great amount of credibility as far as they are concerned and it is the duty of the Government to look after them. I totally accept that position. But, this is not the position today. The position is that every year the defence expenditure is being increased and ultimately that money which could have been expended for the development of this country has not been properly channelled. So, this will have very

serious repercussions as far as this country is concerned and I am sure the Government of Sri Lanka, the Ruling Party, will have to take cognizance of these facts.

Today, the people are faced with many problems. We are happy that infrastructure development is taking place in this country. It has been a great success; we accept it. But, is the infrastructure development of this country going to give any sort of relief to the people? Is it giving a better life to the people who are suffering? Is the income of the people being increased? Is the education system of this country being improved? Are more buildings being built for schools? Are university buildings being built? I am sorry to say that although there is infrastructure development taking place, the normal day-to-day needs of the people have not been looked into by this Government, especially in this Budget.

I am just giving you one example. Today, the people are faced with the high cost of living. Today, a trader with over Rs. 250 million turnover is levied 12 per cent VAT and 2 per cent NBT. So, that comes to 14 per cent. Today, definitely many traders of this country who are the major importers and exporters of food production are having a turnover of more than Rs. 250 million per quarter. Now, all these traders are going to be taxed at 12 per cent VAT and 2 per cent NBT. Ultimately, who is going to bear the cost? This cost will have to be borne by the people of this country; the poor citizens of this country will have to bear the cost. Is this what the Government is intending to do to bring down the cost of living for the people?

There is also a special commodity levy tax of 15 to 30 per cent at the time of import. Pharmaceutical retail outlets will also face the same situation because out of the Rs. 250 million turnover, only the first 25 per cent is exempted from tax and the balance 75 per cent is subject to NBT and VAT payment. Ultimately, what is the position? The pharmaceutical items are being affected. A poor man cannot buy his medicines at the cost rate; he cannot buy his food; he cannot buy his commodities. What are you trying to do in this Budget? Is this Budget going to cause a better living standard for the people of Sri Lanka? You are burdening the people on the purchase of pharmaceutical items, which is a very important factor and a necessity to the people of this country.

The banks are being levied another 2 per cent more as NBT on the turnover. Therefore, the interest rates as far as the banking sector is concerned, will also increase very soon.

Then, we also have to consider the exemption of tax for strategy development projects. These are huge projects running into billions. I think our Minister is here and he has been very helpful as far as projects are concerned. In one project where his help was sought, he

2549 2550

2013 17

was very good and kind enough in giving that project a start. But, that is not sufficient. The position is that these are big strategic projects which are running into billions of rupees and these projects are handled by huge multi-national companies in the world. They are investing in this country. I think there must be, at least, some sort of taxation for these projects, which can contribute towards the development of this country. We cannot allow them a full tax holiday or tax relief. What should be looked into is to get some income generated into this country.

With regard to Small and Medium Enterprises, there is a 12 per cent income tax and a 2 two per cent levy of tax more than last year. So, there is a 2 per cent increase on Small and Medium Enterprises compared to last years Budget. What is the reason for that? Those are Small and Medium Enterprises, not multi-national companies or a multi-national projects; those are small and medium projects.

You gave incentives to companies to expand their businesses up to March 2015. This Budget has reduced that exemption and made it up to the end of 2014; that is, one year. I mean, they could have given this up to March, 2015. Why do they want to bring it down to 2014? How does it qualify? Is there a continuity, a clarity or a consistency in your Budget Proposals? These are the three "C"s that you have to consider; the Continuity, the Clarity and the Consistency of this Budget. I personally feel it is not so.

You spend Rs. 500 billion today on salaries and pensions to Government servants. Are we getting the true fruits of the payment of Rs. 500 billion that you are giving the Government servants and the pensioners? I must say that many departments today, although they are working, are not putting the maximum effort that they should put in. I think it is the duty of the Government to see that they reduce the cost of Government departments. Many Government departments have got more people than expected to do the work. You make political appointments. By making those appointments, ultimately the burden is on the people and the people will have to pay for it. Therefore, the Rs. 500 billion worth of money which is spent on Government servants should be reduced to a great extent so that that money could be turned into the society at large.

Today, the Government is borrowing money at 7 per cent over LIBOR. The corporate sector of this country - the companies are borrowing foreign exchange at less than 4 per cent over LIBOR. So, why are we paying 3 per cent more? We have discussed this many a time in this Chamber and I do not see the great necessity for us to do this.

When the United National Party Government was in power, we also borrowed money, we also got foreign loans. But, they were long-term loans, 30-year loans with

a very reasonable interest payable. But, today the loans are not of that nature. Today, you get short-term loans and for that you have to pay high rates of interest, causing a tremendous burden as far as the economy of the country is concerned.

Today, we are also faced with a major crisis in this country as far as narcotics is concerned. Internationally, there have been many queries raised that a lot of Sri Lankan nationals are being introduced into narcotics and that we are introducing narcotics into this country. It is a very serious matter. Sri Lanka is a small island. If they go to bring in narcotics to Sri Lanka making it a major hub, I must say that it is going to be the end of the society in Sri Lanka. We have to take immediate measures to see that narcotics raids are carried out, and humanely, politically, and physically all steps should be taken to curtail narcotics. Today, our younger generation is merely living a normal way of life. But, if narcotics are going to be introduced in school premises or outside school premises and if children are going to use narcotics, I must say the entire society will collapse and the fabric of society will also collapse. Therefore, it is a very important factor that we have to consider. For that purpose, we have to have a strong and independent judiciary, a strong and independent police. These are some factors which should be taken into account, but unfortunately, the police and the judiciary are not independent as they were 15 years ago. Therefore, it is very important that we look into this factor.

The final and most important issue that I want to bring to your attention today is the casinos. Casinos are being brought into this country even without a proper system of getting licences. They are not allowing the casinos to come in the normal way like in any other part of the world where casinos are allowed. There are tender procedures followed when casinos are brought in. But, there again in foreign countries, casinos are located in a different atmosphere: in a separate island, in a separate state where people do not have direct contact with the casinos. Today, we are trying to have casinos in close proximity to Colombo and we will have to face the repercussions. If casinos are going to be brought in and if casino kings are going to run this country, there will be complete pollution as far as the administration of this country is concerned. Casinos mean huge money, big kings and they are not levied the proper taxes that should be levied. They are given tax exemptions and I do not see why casinos should be given tax exemptions. We should really tax them as much as possible. If they want to come into this country, let them pay taxes and come into this country, if necessary. But, we, the United National Party, are totally opposed to it. Even the clergy of this country are concerned about it. They have also made it very clear that if casinos are brought into this country, it will create the utmost confusion because we are a small island. We are not like the United States of America or it maybe Singapore, where they have stringent rules as far as

2551 2552

casinos are concerned, and there is total independence as far as the judiciary and the police are concerned. But, we do not have such a situation here. We have a tremendous amount of political interference in all these fields. Ultimately, if these two factors, narcotics and casinos, also come into this country, I must say, with due respect to the Chair of this august Assembly, we are going to face tremendous hardships society-wise and also in terms of our future generation.

Then, look at the Law College. The Principal of the Law College has given favourable marks to his own son for him to pass the Law College Examination. If the younger generation, the students of this country, are habituated in such a manner, how can we have discipline as far as the legal profession is concerned? I, as a lawyer, have a right to say this. I got through that examination 43 years ago, and today I am a practising. But, today, the Principal of the Law College himself gives marks to his own son to get him through the examination.

So, Sir, these are some of the major factors that we have to consider and we respectfully move that the Government take these facts into consideration and bring some sanity to this country through a better project.

Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . 12 .

There is power vested in you by the Standing Orders to stop this.
