, . , , . . [2.33 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to participate in this Debate on the Imports and Exports (Control) Act. Before I talk of imports and exports, I want to refer to what the Hon. Leader of the Opposition said in his statement. He referred to the attack on investigative journalism.

I would like to quote an article that appeared in "The Sunday Leader" newspaper of 1st September, 2013 by Mrs. Mandana Ismail Abeywickrema, which states:

The past week has been a nightmare. Apart from the trauma experienced by my family and myself due to the pre-dawn break in at our residence on Saturday (24), the biggest disappointment has been the actions of certain sections of the media and their false reportage of the incident.

So, still we do not have any freedom of speech; they do not have any freedom to report in the way they want.

. ( . ) (The Hon. P. Piyasena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

725 726

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, what is your point of Order? [Interruption.] No, that is not a point of Order. Hon. Vinayagamoorthy, you can continue with your speech.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Thank you, Sir.

With regard to exports and imports, we will have to try our level best to increase our exports and decrease our imports. Our economy is an agricultural one. The Right Honourable D.S. Senanayake and his son, the Hon. Dudley Senanayake paid more attention to agriculture. If we can improve and develop agriculture, we can even export rice.

With regard to tea and rubber, after the estates were taken over by the Government, they were subsequently given on lease. Now, what is happening is, tea and rubber estates are not being developed. They are cutting down the trees and selling them. If you want to improve the tea and rubber industries, you will have to take over the estates from those companies and privatize them.

Further, the GSP facility was withdrawn some years ago. As a result of this, last year we lost billions of rupees; several factories were closed and several people became unemployed. So, I request the Government to talk to the European countries and try to get the GSP facility once again.

Sri Lanka is known as the "Pearl of the Indian Ocean". We are surrounded by sea water. So, if we can improve the fisheries industry by exporting fish and tinned fish, we can earn foreign exchange.

In Male, they merely depend on exporting dried fish to other countries and their economy is improving. Similarly, I request the Government to improve the fisheries industry in Sri Lanka. The Myliddy Harbour in Kankesanthurai is the best fisheries harbour. You will have to improve it and thereby develop the fisheries industry. That is the only way we can increase exports. We will have to do away with unnecessary imports. When our farmers are cultivating onions and potatoes, you must stop importing onions and potatoes from foreign countries. This is the only way you can decrease imports and have a good foreign exchange. Thank you.

It states, I quote:

"The keynote was delivered by Australian National University Professor of Economics Dr. Premachandra Athukorala, who stressed on the need for Sri Lanka to improve its productivity and its basket of exports."

, . . .

It further states, I quote:

He added: There has been a precipitous fall in Sri Lankas share in exports from developing countries and the country has failed to share in the great transformation of world trade - the dramatic shift in manufacturing exports from developed to developing countries. So, Sri Lankas export problem is fundamentally home grown,......"

. . He further states, I quote:

" '...we shouldn't be blaming the markets.'

. I quote:

"There has been deterioration in the country's investment climate as well, he observed. On the topic of labour, Athukorala pointed out that the country's unemployment is a misguided indicator as the Government has become the major employment generator and there has also been a rapid increase in overseas employment.

When you take these figures and adjust the unemployment rate, it is very high. Sending your people to work in other countries is a reflection of a failed state. We are heading towards the situation of the Philippines where no one has trust in the Government,' ......"

, . . According to him, Sri Lanka has two options. The first option is, the document states, I quote:

"As per the East Asian experience, Sri Lanka can try and fit into global production sharing within vertically integrated global industries, mostly in machinery and transport equipment."

Hon. Presiding Member, I take great pleasure in saying a few words on the Regulations and Order placed before the House by the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama: the Regulations under the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, No. 1 of 1969 and the Order under the Strategic Development Projects Act, No. 14 of 2008. Those Regulations and Order envisage a great transformation in the economy of this country.

The Statement of Legal Effect on the Order under the Strategic Development Projects Act states, I quote:

Under the Strategic Development Projects Act, No. 14 of 2008 as amended, the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka which is established by the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law No. 04 of 1978 as amended, has identified a project for development, operation and management of a special zone for heavy industries in Sampur Area and inter-alia sourcing and establishing other Board of Investment of Sri Lanka approved projects of which the envisaged investment of United States Dollars Four Thousand Million (US$ 4,000 Mn.) through its own investment and/or procure the investment by prospective investors and do the necessary physical and social infrastructure including education and health facilities, modern settlement with leisure and recreation facilities, constructed deep water jetty and stock pile yard and other facilities such as internal roads, provision of power requirements, water supply, sewerage and water treatments conducive to attach and facilitate investment by the investors within the Heavy Industrial Zone at Sampur situated within the administrative District of Trincomalee in the Eastern Province, as a Strategic Development project in consultation with the relevant line Ministries.

Sir, after the rapid development introduced under the Nagenahira Udanaya and Uthuru Wasanthaya, this is most significant. This paves the way for multifarious forms of development even in a place where the Tigers reigned supreme - a place called Sampur. When you think of Sampur, on the other side is Mavil Aru. We shudder to think about Mavil Aru. We know what happened there. It is the water that the people there asked for; they asked to solve that problem. Thirty five thousand acres of paddy were not allowed to be harvested. Not a mammoty was laid on that muddy ground or the paddy fields. It was an area of terror controlled by the Tigers for years and years - for 30 years. That place was redeemed by our heroic soldiers.

Today, I am very happy to mention in this House that the person who was directly involved in the battle there - Major General Nanda Mallawaarachchi has been appointed as the first Secretary to the Ministry of Law and Order by His Excellency the President. Major General Nanda Mallawaarachchi is a man who had seen the worst times; he is a person who had seen the ravages of war. He is a great gentleman who can hold the scales even. Therefore, we are very happy that Major General Mallawaarachchi has been given the onerous task of maintaining law and order in this country and the people have grown in them a great sense of confidence that he will do justice to the people. It is to the credit, the far-sightedness and the wisdom of His Excellency the President that Major General Mallawaarachchi was chosen for that post after spending about six long years in

747 748

2013 03

Indonesia as our countrys Ambassador, where he earned a very good name whence he brought large benefits to our country.

Then, coming back to the subject, Sir, what is the rationale for declaring the project as a Strategic Development Project.

I further quote the Statement of Legal Effect:

This project is to set up a Heavy Industrial Zone in Sampur, Trincomalee and will consist of three phases with an investment of US$ 4000 Mn and it will be undertaken in the following manner:

Phase I: Construction of a Deep Water Jetty and Stock Pile Yard. US$700 Mn will be invested within a period of three (03) years by SLGIPL in this Phase.

Phase II: Development of infrastructure facilities in the Zone with internal roads, provision of power requirement, sewerage and water requirement etc. and establishment of Iron Ore Pellet Plant and Coke Production Plant for export. US$ 1,300 Mn will be invested within a period of Two (02) years by SLGIPL in this Phase.

Phase III: Establishment of heavy industries within the Zone such as ship building

We know that Busan in South Korea is famous for ship building and such an industry is to be brought into our country to make in the future.

..and repair facility, plan and machinery manufacturing, automotive assembly plant, smaller support industries etc. US$ 2,000 Mn will be invested within a period of Two (02) years by the prospective investors in this phase.

So, investors are coming. They have built up confidence over the years on the economic and political stability of Sri Lanka under the dynamic leadership of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa. The Statement of Legal Effect further states, I quote:

The provision of essential economic infrastructure in a dedicated special infrastructure Zone will underpin the future development of the North Eastern Province. A Special Industry Zone will diversify the economic base of Sri Lanka through the attraction of new high value industries with further opportunities for the development of light industries and support services.

Now, the North and the East is to be further developed. You will be amazed to know that even foreign loans, large amounts of money, were diverted for the development of the Northern Province than to the other areas. In this scenario, I am more than surprised to find that the chief ministerial candidate for the Northern Province, Justice C. V.Vigneswaran says that developments are being made, roads are being opened and railway lines are being laid to enable the Sinhalese to go to the North. Do you not think it is a very silly statement for an ex-judge to make? He also says that the roads are built and developed for the Sinhalese army to go to the North. Even a baby would tell you that there are so many

ways that the army and the public can go there. They can go there by air; they can go there by sea.

Sir, his statement shows that he has fallen from the sublime to the ridiculous. Can the diaspora or others who are helping him to become the Chief Minister through the backdoor, condone this? Our people and the Tamil people are also laughing about it. "To send the Sinhalese people to the North", what a racialist statement! And it had been said in a public meeting. Therefore, Sir, a judge also can falter, if he is not in the Bench. That is what is happening to Mr. Vigneswaran. "

" .

;

. TNA

. That is why I say your place is not there, Mr. Vigneswaran. You are honoured and respected by all of us as a good judge, as an academic, one who even mesmerized the crowds at Kamban Vizha held at Ramakrishna Mission and Colombo Tamil Sangam in Wellawatta. To what an abysmal depth he has fallen into! This is not your job. The popular cry, the popular demand was for the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah. We are not agreeing with his politics, but he is a man with the people. He is working at grass-roots level. Even the Tamils across the Palk Strait are asking whether Mr. Vigneswaran knows the geography of the Jaffna Peninsula. Has he visited Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya and Mannar Districts?

Now, Sir, the title of this article is most remarkable: "Eighty-five per cent of the loans spent on developing the North" Who says this? It is our able, most hardworking and forward-looking Minister, the Hon. Basil Rajapksa. I quote from the "Harimaga" newspaper of 30th May, 2013:

"Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa said on Tuesday that the government was committed to bringing peace and prosperity to all Sri Lankans and stressed that 85 percent of foreign loans to the country was spent on developing the North and resettling the people displaced by the war."

Does the Hon. R. Sampanthan know this? Does he recognize this? Does Mr. C.V. Vigneswaran know this? Does he want this development or does he not? Let him tell that to the Tamil people, the common people, the suffering people of the North. Children from the North are coming down to Colombo. They are playing cricket with boys of the Ananda College and Nalanda College who do not know a single word of Tamil. Also, the boys of the Ananda College, Nalanda College and Zahira College are travelling to the North. That is the scenerio today. We have full confidence in the youth of the North. The country has no confidence in the present decaying leadership of the TNA.

749 750

The article further states:

"Minister Rajapaksa was addressing the large crowd which attended the opening of the first stage of the 106 km Medawachchiya - Thalaimannar railway line at the Madhu Road railway station. With the completion of the first stage of 43km of railway track trains now can reach Madhu from Medawachchiya."

Who destroyed this passenger transport line in the North? Who deprived the passenger transport to the Northern people? Is it not the Tigers, Mr. C.V. Vigneswaran? Can you restore the railway lines? Therefore, I say that even at this late hour, you must withdraw from contesting. This is a serious appeal that I am making in this House. It would safeguard your self-respect and maintain your former honour and dignity because you do not know politics and you can never do politics. You are there to satisfy the diaspora. What is this diaspora? There is no diaspora now. People can come home freely; they are coming. When we travel in the States, the Tamil people who went away due July riots told us this.

This is the cry of our dear Tamils and I tell them from this House, "Please do come". You will be accommodated. This is a country of great hospitality. This is the country of which the leader is His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa; he loves people, he loves children. He is a person with a humane outlook. Therefore, we must wake them up now. What is there today is not a diaspora. It is dias poraya. . , ' '. "Diaspora" . .

It further states, I quote:

"Reconstruction of the line began on March 27, 2011 after LTTE terrorism caused the train service to stop in 1991."

This is the story. Let the dias poraya know it. It is the international dias poraya - ; .

This goes on to state, I quote:

The second stage of 63 km will be completed within the next four months and is scheduled to be opened on September 23. (The British colonial government introduced railways to Sri Lanka in 1867).

That is a bit of the history that I was quoting. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have one more minute. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) No, Sir. I will be taking the time allotted to the Hon. Felix Perera.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Okay. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Thank you..

It further states, I quote:

Following the reconstruction of the line up to Madhu, the first train left Anuradhapura at 9.48 a.m. on May 14 and reached the Madhu Road station at 10.48 a.m. via Medawachchiya, passing the Periyakulam and Wedtikulam stations. Throughout the journey, the Maha Sangha chanted Seth Pirith while Hindu, Catholic and Islamic religious dignitaries gave their blessings.

They have been blessed by all the religious leaders. It is because our President loves the people of the North and the Minister of Economic Development also loves the people of the North that such a large amount of money has been spent. It is not a joke. Let the international dias poraya know this.

It states further, I quote:

Joining Minister Basil Rajapaksa on the train ride were Transport Minister Kumara Welgama,.."

The name Welgama would go into history as a remarkable Minister of Transport who re-established the railway line built by the Britishers. So, he is only re-enacting a historic scenario. The Britishers built the railways; the Tamil Tigers destroyed it, but the Hon. Kumara Welgama is rebuilding it. He is really a kumaraya, a raja. That is the new story of the North.

Then, who else was there? The then Indian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, Shri Ashok K. Kantha and the General Manager of Sri Lanka Railways, Mr. B.A. Ariyaratne were there. Mr. B.A. Ariyaratne is doing a

751 752

very good job as the General Manager of Sri Lanka Railways. We are going to see a new world, a new Sri Lanka. The blind are not the people who cannot see but those who refuse to see. That is what is happening to the Opposition today.

The report further states, I quote:

People standing on either side of the railway line cheered as the train passed by. Thousands of Catholics who wish to attend this years Madhu festival can now travel by train to Madhu unlike in the past when pilgrims had to seek the LTTEs permission to visit the Madhu shrine.

The LTTE wanted the Muslims to take permission when they come to Colombo passing the Manampitiya Bridge. Now, they are relieved and freed from all those impediments by our Government. It further states, I quote:

Minister Rajapaksa further said re-opening this railway line after 23 years was a historic occasion. He recalled the LTTE domination of the area during the farcical ceasefire period until the President defeated Tiger terrorism and paved the way for peace and prosperity, although some people are trying to ignore the past. He expressed confidence that the new railway line would help strengthen economic, social and cultural ties between the people of the South and North.

The agriculture is thriving in the North. Onions and bananas - as big as the stump of a banana tree - are all coming to Colombo. They are getting the wealth from down South. It is now like the era that we saw economic development in the past.

It further states, I quote:

He added that the Government succeeded in resettling 300,000 people who were in refugee camps in the North.

I want to ask now whether the Human Rights High Commissioner for United Nations, Mrs. Navanethem Pillay visited this area. She should have visited. I will come to that later. It further states, I quote:

He emphasized the need for every one to work as one for the development of the North. The Minister further said that government was not working with elections in mind.

There was no election at that time. Nobody was talking about it; nobody was asking for an election and now the election is going to be held. The mere fact that Navaneethem Pillay was allowed to come to Sri Lanka and that she visited the North and the East and everywhere without any constraint and also the very fact that the President has declared an election for the Northern Provincial Council is a great victory for democracy in this Island. Come on! Let us now play the game fairly and squarely. Let us see who wins. Do not take this election easy, Mr. Vigneswaran, the chief ministerial candidate of the TNA. I know for certain that you will taste the bitter pills because there are Tamil widows whom you have not cared for.

What does Batticaloa and Trincomalee Diocese Bishop who chants blessings say at the ceremonial opening of the new church in Vakarai? Sir, it is a wonderful speech that he made. The front page report of the "Daily News" of 3rd September, 2013 states, I quote:

"Trinco Bishop: President a bridge builder, fair by all

You have brought all communities together. Army doing wonderful work in this region."

The front page of Thinakaran and Dinamina and not to be outdone, "Virakesari" and "Thinakkural" have also reported what the Bishop said. The "Thinakkural" of 3rd September, 2013 states, I quote:

It is very interesting, Sir, to listen to Bishop Ponniah. I again quote the Daily News of 3rd September, 2013:

He appreciates what President Mahinda Rajapaksa is doing for the country to make it into one nation, one people and one family, Batticaloa and Trincomalee Diocese Bishop Most Rev. Joseph Ponniah said, as the spiritual leader of the Eastern Province. You treat everyone as equals. You want everyone to be united as one people and live in peace and harmony.

Come on Bishop!

He further states, I quote:

We wish and pray that your dreams be realised and we assure you our full support and cooperation.

This is the voice of the intelligentsia of the North - the people who have wisdom in them. Again I quote:

I see you are as a bridge builder. It is not only that you have made easy travel from one place to another, but also you have brought all the communities together irrespective of their language, religion and ethnicity, he said.

I urge you to take the spiritual guidance and support of those around you so that you can liberate this country from all bondages where all can live in freedom as brothers and sisters,

How nice, how fine, how refreshing! This is what the Trincomalee Diocese Bishop said at the ceremonial opening of the new church, which was destroyed by the tsunami.

We also went to Vakarai. When we went to Vakarai for the first time with His Excellency the President after winning the war, the Rev. Poosari from the Kovil in Batticaloa came and garlanded him. Then, what happened? The Tigers mercilessly killed him on the following day. This is how they treated even their religious dignitaries. We must tell this to " ". Then, I again quote:

He also thanked all Army officers and soldiers starting from General Lal Perera up to Brigade Commander Vakarai for their assistance day and night from the day when church officials announced about the opening and the feast. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Your time is over.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, there are only two other speakers and I will take some time allotted to the Hon. Minister also. I further quote:

Hundreds of soldiers together with officers started planning and working day and night to bring this to completion. Our Parish Priest Fr. Jeyakanthan will testify to it. I too can witness that the Army is doing wonderful work in this region.

. .

The news item further says, I quote:

'They are with the people and reach out to help the people in many areas', Bishop Ponniah said.

Sir, I addressed a communication to Ms.Navanetham Pillay. I think Ms.Navanetham Pillay is an extremely contradictory character in nature.

An article in the "The Sunday Observer" of 1st September, 2013 states, I quote:

Pillay finally branded LTTE, a ruthless organization.

Then, she goes to garland the so-called heroes. How could she do that? She herself admitted that Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam was murdered by the LTTE and she came here to deliver the memorial lecture and then she goes to garland them. We have to twist and say, "Here is Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Hyde".

What does our gallant great soldier, the Defence Secretary, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa says? "" . 2013.09.02 "" :

" . . ; . NGO ."

A news item in the Daily Mirror of 2nd September 2013, states, I quote:

Pillay Exceeded Mandate

It is a statement made by the Government and I would like to table* it to be included in Hansard.

I addressed a communication to Ms. Pillay. In it I have asked her, Have you not visited Kattankudi? Have

755 756

[ ... ]

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

2013 03

you not heard of Kattankudi? Do you not know the road to go to Kattankudi, Eravur, Alingipotana and also Aranthalawa? Why? If you are so biased, how can you write a report? How can you write an unbiased report for the UNO?

I ask the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon to investigate into her activities. She has met Tiger supporters on the sly; she has met so many people.

Therefore, I would only ask this much: Madam Navanethem Pillay, do you know the road to Kattankudi, to Eravur, to Alingipotana and also to Aranthalawa? Do you know the road leading to the refugee camps where 100,000 Muslims were chased away within a few hours from Jaffna - their land of birth - by the Tigers? If you need any help to take you to these spots, where human rights were devastatingly crushed, I am prepared to show you the way.

I told her the best place for her to visit is Palestine, where for over 50 years brazen violation of human rights are taking place. Unabated this crime is still being continued despite United Nations resolutions requesting the Israelis and Zionists to stop the holocaust. Why not Ms. Pillay clear her conscience by producing a top most report on the massacre of women and children in the Holy land of Palestine by the Zionists forces? Has she not heard of the brutal killing of people in Chechnya, Bosnia, Herzegovina and such areas?

Lastly, I say this: "Be true to thyself, physician cure your ailment first. Ms. Pillay you can no more remain a pillai, you should be grown up by now. Please do not hurt the feelings of our countrymen. You can safely say au revoir and leave our country happily, unhurt and unscathed as you came in. You know we are a lovely and peaceful people living on earth. You may come, enjoy our hospitality and remember the Sri Lankans forever. Be assured that we have a dynamic and an affectionate leader in President Mahinda Rajapaksa to look after the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Malays, Burghers, Memons, Borahs and all others. Good bye, Ms. Pillay!"

Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, you have 20 minutes. [4.09 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Good bye, Hon.Azwer, and thank you for the statement you made. I am happy to take on from where he stopped.

The Debate today is related to economic affairs. As usual, his interpretation or translation has got misinterpreted. These are the problems that are there. - [Interruption.]

Well, it is the Government that invited Ms. Pillay and got the works by Ms. Pillay herself. What did she basically do? She came here on an invitation and met people, not of this nature, but people like the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Hon. Sampanthan, His Excellency the President, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapksa. She did not meet "on and off" people. What happened? It is nobody else but the Government that invited her. She went into all the matters; the only thing that was told in the final statement was that we are moving towards a dictatorial, despotic state. This is what you call -

Sir, I challenge him to do so. Innocent people who were trying to move into the democratic stream have been pushed out. If the Oluvil Port can create 500 jobs, it will be a miracle; 10,000 jobs by 2015. I do not think such things will happen.
