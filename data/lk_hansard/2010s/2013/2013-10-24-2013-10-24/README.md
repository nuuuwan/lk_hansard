: : PRIVILEGE : DEATH THREAT

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Speaker, I have reliable information about a plot to assassinate me in the run-up to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting - CHOGM - to be held in Colombo from the 15th to 18th of November. According to Intelligence Reports prepared by the SIS, - I believe it has already been handed over to the IGP - a well-known contract killer called Chakku and another underworld criminal called Kota Gamini have been assigned the task of carrying out my murder. According to the warped criminal minds of those who want me killed, this is a propitious time to do so, as everyone will assume that the killing carried out just before so many Heads of States are in attendance, is to embarrass the Government. The blame is to be squarely put on those who are waging a political and media mud-slinging war against me since the recent incident in Matara and the conspirators hope to kill two birds with one stone through this insidious act: on one hand a vociferous critic of the regime, both inside and outside Parliament, will be silenced and on the other, they think they can further divide the Opposition by putting the blame on sections of the Opposition.

Mr. Speaker, now the problem here is that the next paragraph, which you approved at 4.00 p.m. last afternoon has been totally deleted and this, I believe, is the most important paragraph of this statement and -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) ,-

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Can I finish this, Sir? ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) But, I want to read it because it proves beyond any doubt -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . hearsay . . . ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) At 4.00 p.m., Sir, you gave me permission to read out this statement. But later, I got a totally censored version from the Secretary-General. I am asking you whether the Secretary-General of Parliament has now become the Censor-General of this Parliament? This is atrocious. You cannot silence the Hon. Members of this Parliament.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ; .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) , , . senior defence official . I am talking about a senior defence official.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Hearsay .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) But, the Secretary-General and you are here to protect the interests of Parliamentarians.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) This is about a senior defence official. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, please remember that you were also at the Chair of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and what you are doing now is a clear violation of

the Commonwealth Charter. In fact, the core value - ( ) (Mr. Speaker) union chairman . , -

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) But, you have massacred and censored my statement and what you have done is a clear violation of

The 5th Core Value of the Commonwealth Charter, which is Freedom of Expression, states, I quote:

We are committed to peaceful, open dialogue and the free flow of information,

The 6th Core Value is on Separation of Powers, which I quote:

We recognize the importance of maintaining the integrity of the roles of the Legislature,

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . .
