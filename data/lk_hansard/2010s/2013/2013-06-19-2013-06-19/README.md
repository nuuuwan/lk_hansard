Before I start, ... . , G-8 . G-8 . . * . . :

The Prime Minister has set out bold ambitions to rewrite the rules on tax. He promised Britain would use its G-8 presidency to crack down on big businesses and rich individuals using an army of clever accountants to avoid tax.

, tax havens . . . . ?

Sometime back, Hon. Presiding Member, I criticized a stock market manipulator with respect to a company called Environmental Resources Investments PLC or ERI and a company related to it called Capital TRUST Holdings (Pvt.) Limited. A Director of that company, the very next day, attacked me by saying that people like myself should immediately be eliminated, that we were saboteurs, traitors and subversive elements disrupting the noble goal of Sri Lanka to become a financial hub of South Asia.

But, unfortunately, Sir, yesterday the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists had released a number of names and included in these names are those connected to the companies called ERI and the Capital TRUST Holdings. Sir, I wish to table* a particular document that maps out the network of one Mr. Tushan

1067 1068

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

Wickramasinghe connected to a company called Lionheart South Asia Investments Inc. and also several other documents connected to the said gentleman and other shell companies that have been found out to have been or are being operated in tax havens including the British Virgin Islands and Gibraltar.

Sir, I will tell you why it is important. This is a maze of secret accounts. This rogue company ERI was perhaps the biggest manipulator, or its share price was manipulated from Rs. 10 to Rs. 260 based on all kinds of rumours that were fed to poor investors. The poor people lost money in millions because they thought that this company owned a platinum mine and that the platinum dividends would come to this company and therefore, the price of this stock would increase. Pump and dump was the name that was used for this. The innocent investors, like I said, lost hundreds of millions of rupees. Ultimately, it was found out that this was a lie, a total and absolute falsification of facts. Then, what happened? The Securities and Exchange Commission never went for a conviction. They simply compounded the matter and charged these people - the directors of this company - Rs. 3.3 million each, a puny amount, for the hundreds of millions of rupees that were misappropriated. And, it was a falsification and non-disclosure of information.

Sir, the funny thing is that the Central Bank gave approval to ERI to take this money out and to bring this money in foreign exchange. The Exchange Control Act is within the scope of the Central Bank. So, why did the Central Bank not look at this transaction more carefully and do more? Actually, at a time the Central Bank was involved in organizing to hold the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Hambantota, we lost the bid. This particular rogue company was supposedly going to be the largest private sector investor in building the Commonwealth Games Village. So, there seems to have been - I said it at that time also - some intricate relationship between these companies, the Central Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, we have lost faith in any investigations by the Central Bank or the Securities and Exchange Commission.

So, Sir, I request that we constitute a Parliamentary Select Committee to look into this matter. I say this because it is not only in this country that these revelations have actually resulted in investigations but in multiple countries, be it India, Pakistan, Thailand, America, Canada and various countries in Europe. Therefore, we request that all these names be investigated into. I reiterate once again that I am not accusing these people of having robbed money. There are legitimate reasons for people who, perhaps, do business in a global scale to have offshore accounts. But, there are others who are misusing these tax havens; people who play in the stock market do not necessarily have a reason to open these accounts in tax havens. Therefore, I seek non-partisan support or rather bipartisan support to establish a Parliamentary Select Committee to look into this matter.

The President of the Sri Lanka Chamber of Small and Medium Enterprises states that over 25 per cent of Sri Lankas SMEs have collapsed. He further states, I again quote:

' This is most unfortunate considering that the SME sector is the backbone of the countrys economy accounting for 75 per cent of the Gross National Product.'

What we need to do is to carefully consider the reasons why the growth rate is coming down. Of course, somebody can argue and perhaps there is some legitimacy to it that the international markets are not doing too well; they are soft. I agree. But, then, we have not seen any diversification even into areas where there is growth. For sure, the United States, of course, had its own problems but we have to consider diversification because unless we recalibrate our economy and give first priority to exports, we are not going to make US Dollars 4,000 per capita income.

Thank you very much for the extended time. ( ) (The Presiding Member) .

There is a trust problem. Formally, people used to believe that an economy will grow if there is basically a physical infrastructure and if they invest in its human resources. But, that theory is under dispute because today, there is a growing body of economist who believe that actually it is a trust issue. Sir Partha Dasgupta, who is a pioneer in the field of trust and also was a President of the Royal Economic Society, talks about this. He says, If there is trust when entering into a contract, it lowers the cost of that economic transaction". So, trust is very, very critical because if there is a trust issue, people will refuse to enter into reasonable contracts with us and the cost of those contracts will go up. So, the trust issue is a big issue and this is to do with a system that is there.

We have a centralized presidential system in this country. If you want to appoint a chancellor to a university, the Senate of that university sends three names. The President selects one name as the chancellor of the university. If the names are not satisfactory, the President waits till the other names are put forward without making the appointment. It is a centralized system. There is no difference in the Central Bank also. Even in the Central Bank something similar happens. When directors are to be appointed - [Interruption.] No, no. Hon. Minister, you listen to my arguments. Sir, you have an opportunity to reply me after listening to my argument. In banks, when directors are appointed, the bank takes a decision based on whether they are independent directors or not or whether those persons are suitable or not or whether they represent shareholder interest. Then, those names are sent by them. What does

the Central Bank have to do? All what the Central Bank has to do is to check whether those individuals are fit and proper persons. That is all. But, today, the discussion in the bank Board Rooms is different. The discussion in bank Board Rooms today is whether nominees names will be acceptable to the Governor of the Central Bank. That is no different to whether the Vice-Chancellors name is acceptable to the President of this country. There have been instances in which every faculty and department in a university has opposed the appointment of a particular individual as their Vice-Chancellor. But, until that name comes up, there is no appointment made. Is it not a shame on our professional class as well? We - CEOs and Chairmen of banks - have to have an informal consultation with the Governor of the Central Bank to figure out whether a particular name is acceptable to go on the Board of a bank? This the trust issue that we are facing. There is a trust deficit and I would like to show that to you in some of the statements that the Governor has been making.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has suffered from this. In 2011, in an interview on the cover of the Business Today, the Central Bank Governor said this: We will have a balance of payments surplus this year. That is what he said. "The Island" of 16th April, 2013 reported in the article titled "Central Bank Credibility: Riding the Dragon?", I quote:

"The same view was expressed in the The Island in October where the Governor predicted a balance of payments surplus. 'Although we have a trade deficit, the other inflows have more than adequately compensated for this shortfall, and therefore we expect the balance of payments to record a comfortable surplus by the end of the year.'

However, a few months later in March, 2012, the Governor wrote a letter to the IMF and this is what he said in that, Sir, as reported in the same article in "The Island". I quote:

'Though economic fundamentals were healthy, there were emerging signs in the third quarter [of 201l] that the balance of payments was coming under pressure.'

It is the complete opposite of what he said a few months ago. So, there are two possibilities: either the Governor of the Central Bank was foreseeing a balance of payments crisis, which was untrue or he was keen on not revealing the actual situation regarding the Current Account. It could be one of the two.

We know that markets are driven by the fundamentals of expectation. So, we know that it is possible that the Governor wants to nudge the economy along basically by saying something rosier than it actually is, with that expectation. We need to remember that in the short-term, there maybe a benefit but in the long-term, there will be a cost to that kind of thing.

1099 1100

Then, on March 21st, 2013, this is what the Governor said - I am saying this to show that there is a problem of trust - in another interview to the "Daily FT". I quote:

I am at a loss to understand as to who could have even suggested that we are heading towards depreciation of the rupee.

This is what he said; this is not what I am saying. This is what he had said publicly: "How can anybody even suggest that there will be a downward movement in the rupee against the dollar?" So, what do we do? Do we believe the Governor? But Moodys said, We would not only go by import coverage of 4.3 months. We have our own Index - the External Vulnerability Index. On this measure, Sri Lankas short-term external liabilities are 124 per cent of its foreign reserves. If we put it in another way, if Sri Lanka were to sell all its foreign reserves to settle its external liabilities, it is not enough. The liabilities are more than 100 per cent of the reserves; you need 124 per cent of the reserves. Therefore, you will have a shortfall. Now, the issue is this. We can either believe the Governor or we can believe Moodys.

The problem arises here, Sir - [Interruption.] You listen, Hon. Deputy Minister. I will finish very quickly. Then, you can reply.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you have one more minute.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Right, Sir.

The problem arises because of the expectations that are created. What will happen after a while is that people will believe the external -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) During a particular period -

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Yes, that is right. What you are saying is correct but that is not what the Governor said. I am talking of a trust problem here. Therefore, the people are sooner or later going to believe actually what the external agencies are saying than the Governor of the Central Bank. That is the problem we are facing. There is a trust issue.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Presiding Member, we believe in the axiom of a great Saint in Islam, Gouzul Alam Muhiyiddeen Abdul Qadir Jailani (Qadda Sallahu Sirrahul Azeez, who said, if you attack a person without any substance or reason and hurt his feelings, that persons sins will be washed away. So, Sir, I would submit in this House today that my good friend, Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraals sins have been washed away. Day in and day out, we hear no singsong than repeating his name and attacking him mercilessly. He does not deserve it at all. I know that.

To strike a personal note, ironically, Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal and myself walked out, at the negative-attitude Leader of the Oppositions office at 5th Lane, Kollupitiya. We both simultaneously walked out, and today he occupies the exalted office of the Governor of the Central Bank and I am here in this House before you. Thanks to His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who readily identified easily the capability of people.

1135 1136

Today, what has he done, Sir? He has proved himself to be a marvellous person, as I said, almost performed a miracle. On the front cover of the Annual Report of 2012 of the Ministry of Finance and Planning, it is stated, Securing Stability. This is the bible of the Central Bank and Ajith, the Governor, has taken a lot of trouble to present this to the House. I must also place on record that the services rendered by -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . Sir, blind people are not those who cannot see but those who refuse to see. This is what I am telling you today, Sir. The entire story has been revealed to this House. We are talking about a miracle - . . . . . , '''' .

- document - present . Central Bank . Treasury - Ministry of Finance and Planning - .. . . , . . .. , .. . . .

- - , . ? . He goes to the International Monetary Fund; he goes to the World Bank. He is a very clever and deft negotiator. He brings aid and assistance. The other day our President went to China. Now, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane was speaking about Japan. Even China is called a Green China today. As we drink green tea, they are showing to the world - a showcase - it is a Green China. Of course, in history it was known as a Red China, but it has turned into a Green China. Even in America, Chinese cars and Chinese equipment are used and they are also used in London, Saudi Arabia, in the Arabian countries and everywhere. China is an economic giant today. What did they do? Now they have seen and understood the magic scenario in Sri Lanka.

The publication titled "Towards The US$ 4,000 Per Capital Economy: Sri Lankas Economic Transformation over the Past 7 Years" , . , phobia young . The publication on page 2 states , I quote:

"Mahinda Chintana Vision for the Future envisaged sustained progress towards a US$ 4,000+per capita income and a US$ 100 billion economy..."

It goes on to state on page 3, I quote:

"In an era of global uncertainty, the economy grew at an impressive pace over the past 7 years"

There was a war of 30 years; there were disasters; there was a tsunami. Even now, there have been floods and other natural disasters. Still, we are going forward; marching forward. Why do you not bless the country? Leave aside the persons who are involved. Why do you not bless the country? You have nothing to say. , . It goes on to state further on page 3, I quote:

"The average post-independence growth rate was 4.5%. The highest ever 7-year period average growth of 6.7% was observed during 2006-2012 In the post-conflict 3-year period of 2010 to 2012, economic growth averaged an impressive 7.5%"

. , . . , .

It goes on to state on page 4, I quote:

"At the same time, Financial System Stability was maintained, while banking sector assets surpassed Rs.5 trillion..."

It goes on to state on page 5, I quote:

"The Governments commitment towards continued fiscal discipline has been commendable...

Since the end of the conflict, a conscious effort by the Government towards fiscal consolidation has improved the budget deficit and the public debt"

Listen to what has happened after 27 years. It goes on to state, I quote:

After 27 years, the debt to GDP ratio fell below 80% in 2011, and remained below 80% in 2012

It further goes on to state on page 6, I quote:

"These improvements in the domestic economy occurred at a time when the global economy was experiencing the worst economic and financial crisis in recent times..."

It goes on to states, I quote:

"During the pat few years, the per capita income has improved considerably..."

Can you deny these? Who is the expert who can deny? They cannot deny. As I told you, . , phobia . . According to the figures given here, during the pat few years the per capita income has improved considerably. In 2003, the per capita income was US Dollars 981; in 2009, the per capita income was US Dollars 2,057; in 2010, the per capita income was US Dollars 2,400; in 2011, the per capita income was US Dollars 2,836 and in 2012, the per capita income was US Dollars 2,923. That is the achievement of the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, .
