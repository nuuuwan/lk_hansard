, . The text of those Circulars are here. Do you want me to go through that?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, in order to save time, you table it. That is okay. You said that companies are not responsible but only individuals. So, can you name the individuals?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I will give you the list. There is a large number but I will read from the beginning. The names are: A. Punchihewa, W.H.H. Fernando, S.J. Fernando, L.J.A. Peiris, J.M.M. Fernandopulle -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is okay. I will go through the list. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) We have given a large number of names under different categories. I think there are about 40 names. I will table those.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) While highlighting the answers to the question that I have raised, I greatly appreciate the two very prominent and eminent Chairpersons who had been there. One was Mrs. Indrani Sugathadasa and the other was the Hon. Tilak Karunaratne, a former Member of Parliament. They have said that there is a serious scandalous operation going on. Thanks to the Hon. DEW Gunasekara, Chairman of COPE; we had an opportunity to question them and we only corroborated the facts that they mentioned. Hon. Minister, this scam must stop for the sake of all investors in this country. People like Dilith

429 430

Jayaweera from George Steuart Group and Ajith Devasurendra - I am naming them - are using this "pump and dump" concept and trying to put the sustainability of the Colombo Stock Exchange into question. Why are these people allowed to go on like this? They still go on. Innocent people from the areas that the Hon. Speaker represents or some such people do not have the opportunity to invest with confidence because of a handful of unscrupulous rogues.

Look at the way the assets of Ceylinco Group have been stripped. They have been given to Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraals friends.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) What is the question? Ask me the question, and I will answer.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What happened to NSB? Ajith Devasurendra was involved in the issue of National Savings Bank. That is a company on the Colombo Stock Exchange. - [Interruption.]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Mr. Speaker, I have tabled all the proceedings of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding this matter.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) As the Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning, please tell us. There is the "pump and dump" operation that is going on. I am naming the persons. Dilith Jayaweera and Ajith Devasurendra got involved in the NSB scandal and the Government got tainted; the President had to get involved and Dr. P.B. Jayasundera protected. I am asking you, what are you doing?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You have given all sorts of names. - [Interruption.] Mr. Speaker, there must be a certain procedure and decorum in this House. - [Interruption.] People can make all sorts of allegations. They will be examined under the law in the normal way. If you have any evidence, please give that to us which I will transfer on to the SEC.

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) The Hon. Member mentioned about resettlement in Sampur. Hon. Member, you know the rules and regulations. The Government took these lands for development purposes. It was gazetted. So, people cannot get these lands back again.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Hon. Member, please continue. . ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) I am referring to the lands which were not taken by the Government. The Minister, Hon. Basil Rajapaksa told us about this.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, can I make a clarification?

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Okay.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, under the earlier scheme, people were getting only Rs. 500. You remember that. Now, under this new scheme, they will be getting Rs. 1,250. So, those who are over 63 years of age will have no problem. We are looking into the cases of the other people also. We have to give immediate relief to the older people. That is why we have fixed the age limit at 63. But, we will look into this question and if we can give further relief, we will do that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) When are you going to implement the other scheme?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) This scheme is in operation. It will not be difficult for us to adjust it with regard to the others also. Those who are over 63 years and already getting paid will now get the benefit.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Will people get the pension only after 63?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Those who are over 63 and would have earlier received Rs. 500 a month will now get Rs.1,250 a month. It is a big improvement for them.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) If that is so, it is okay.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, that is a very good idea. I will bring it to the notice of the Hon. Minister of Social Services. I am sure, he will be very happy to contribute to it.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Okay, that is better. If you can establish an institution like this in the North or the East or in both provinces, we will accept that. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I think that is a very reasonable suggestion. We will follow up on that. I will discuss it with my Colleague.

. ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Thank you very much, Hon. Minister.

, . 750 .. . . , . 2002 - 2003 United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, . . , I also follow efforts by the Government to abolish the flat line room housing scheme, which involves rows of small rooms, each housing a family. This scheme has been criticized by various actors for not fulfilling the basic criteria for adequate housing. Of particular concern is the fact that the line rooms do not provide privacy and space necessary to fulfil womens rights to adequatehousing . 10 , , . , .

Housing of the plantation community is a burning issue and over 900,000 of the worker population still live in 100-year-old line rooms built by the British planters. Plantation workers need 250,000 new affordable houses.

Since 1987, action had been taken by successive governments to build housing schemes for the plantation community. Up to now, nearly 30,000 houses have been built. Although workers have paid for the houses, the ownership have not been vested with the workers. In 1992, when the estates were privatized, the then government promised to give each family a 20-perch land including vegetable cultivation plots, but it was not implemented. In 2002, a flat line room housing scheme was introduced in the plantation areas but it was opposed by the community citing social problems and the necessity for affordable and adequate housing.

In 2003, the UN Rapporteur, Mr. Miloon Kothari came to Sri Lanka and inspected the flat line room housing scheme and recommended to the then President, Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga to build houses similar to other schemes under the concept of affordable and adequate housing.

His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa taking into consideration the services rendered by the plantation community to this country for over 180 years, promised through the Mahinda Chintana that every family of the plantation community will be provided with a 10-perch land to build houses similar to other citizens of the country and will stop the flat line room housing scheme, which was not accepted by the community.

His Excellency the President in his Budget Speech stated that 50,000 flat-houses will be built for the plantation community. This move will allow the community to be landless continuously as well as to practise the same line room culture. Flat-houses were not recommended even in the 10-year plan drawn for the development of the plantation community.

Further, this is a breach of the promise made by His Excellency the President to the plantation community. At the recent Provincial Council Election, the President assured the plantation community that they will be treated equally as other citizens of the country. With this assurance, plantation people fully supported him.

Therefore, I earnestly request the President to implement building of 50,000 single houses for plantation workers within the 10-perch land promised under the "Mahinda Chintana. We need nearly 10,000 hectares of land to build 200,000 houses. Already, 35 thousand hectares of land has been identified by the Government. So, I request His Excellency the President to stop

implementing the flat-housing concept which has already been rejected by the community. I want to bring to the attention of the Ministers and Members of Parliament that flat-houses for plantation workers was introduced by the British in the latter part of 1940, but later it was dropped.

So, I request all the Parliamentarians to support our just request on behalf of the plantation workers, who still earn over Rs. 330 million every year as foreign exchange, contributing to the development of the country.

Your Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa

Greeting to you my dear President

This day I congratulate you in Parliament

At CHOGM you were centre-stage seated;

On your 68th Birthday you proudly presented the

68th Budget of Independence Sri Lanka

Head of the Commonwealth now you are;

Leading fifty-four nations from near and far.

Two point two billion the Commonwealth nation;

Comprises one fourth of the world population

A development-oriented Budget you presented;

Which shall make the populace self-reliant, contented.

The beautification of the cities you commanded;

Which dear Gotha and Muza dynamically implemented

Sri Lanka emerges a winner so bright;-

523 524

[ ... ]

2013 23

Although Muza is an UNPer, he is helping to beautify the City of Colombo in order to give a brighter life to the people of the City.

To a peace-proud population wise with hindsight.

On a clear-cut path of positive progress;

Shadowing Channel-4s track of negative regress;

The road networks so preponderant;

With highways on the increase.

Makes life so pleasant; to travel expeditiously with ease.

Joining townships via the A-9 Road;

You have confluenced distant townships to meet.

Bringing North and South into similar mode;

Fostering harmony, happiness and greet,

Prince Charles presence; at CHOGM

Was a tribute to this nation

Through Katunayake Highway came his emergence

Which caused all Sri Lankans to elation.

Sir, when we talk about roads, the other day I told in this Parliament, as in the days of yore, they say that all roads lead to Rome. Now, they say all roads lead to Katunayake, because our President has commanded re-building that wonderful road and the project was pioneered by our young, energetic and able Minister, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, so wonderfully well.

Today, in my hand I have a book titled, Why Islam written by Alhaj M.B.M. Mahir. He relates a nice proverbial story about roads; I will read it from page 31of this book:

The Proverbial saying that All Roads lead to Rome should apply to religions also as all roads should lead to the great power who Creates, Commands, Controls and Cares for his Creations who can possess any religion, race or creed, yet it imperative truly and sincerely to follow the path of his choice to usher peace, harmony and good relationship with all other faiths in order to obtain the Bliss of the Creator.

That is what is happening today. The minds of the North and the South are joined together by the A-9 Road and it is a miracle that all the roads are carpetted roads, particularly, the Katunayake Road.

Sir, in conclusion, today this book and two other books - I should tell that to the House -"

" and " " written by a scholarof the calibre of Alhaj M.B.M. Mahir

- will be launched at the Marine Grand Banquet Hall at Marine Drive, Wellawatte, and I will be visiting that venue soon after the end of my speech.

Again, I shall revert to the poem.

Fifty thousand units of flats you will build;

With all modern facilities; to give respite to the hilt;

To folk without amenities.

We need another Thero like Thotagamuve Sri Rahula

The Selalihini Sandeshaya he compiled.

Portraying the beauty of Kotte and the Oya Diyawanna;

To describe remarkable the Capital City;

Happily now domiciled.

Meda-mulana you brought to Lokay mulata!

wada Ayubowan - Chiran Jayathu Janapathindu Obata!

Sir, a lot of vituperative language was used in this House today by the Opposition, through jealousy.

? . . . [] Hon. Member, without understanding the meaning of what I am saying, you are disturbing me.

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) I do understand. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) My whole concept is based on the reconciliation process. I am expecting that to take place. - [Interruption.] Yes. But, in the North, there is discrimination. - [Interruption.] Will you listen to me, please? - [Interruption.] - No, not at all. It is the Colombo newspapers that are communal in writing. What we want is to live peacefully in the North. You must ensure that.

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) How about the past? . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Forget about the past. Do you want to live in the past? Do you want progress or do you want to live in the past? This is not the way to run the Government. The Government is discriminating.

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) , , . . ? ? . , .

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) This is why they cannot bring in reconciliation. I gave some advice as to what should be done but they are not prepared to listen. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is being wasted.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) I am talking about the atrocities; I am talking about the Northern Provincial Council.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only two more minutes. Why do you not continue with your speech?

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) We are unable to function in the Northern Provincial Council. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you are going into a debate. Without going into a debate, you complete your speech. You have only two more minutes. [ ] , .

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Member, we are elected by the people. We have the Northern Provincial Council with a majority but the Chief Minister is unable to function properly.

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) Why? . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) The Chief Minister is not allowed to function. The Governor is still having control there. Starting from the Chief Secretary, everybody is listening to the Governor. They are not co-operating with the Chief Minister. First and foremost, you must go there and see. You must go to Jaffna and speak to the Chief Minister and see whether he is able to run his Provincial Council. That Deputy Minister was disturbing me without understanding what I was saying.

Furthermore, the police are not doing their duty. I have read out a number of cases in Tamil in this House. You would have understood as to how many murders had taken place one after the other. Up to now or for the last few years, the police have not filed any cases. They have not arrested the people who had committed murder or who had attempted murder or the people who had committed any robbery.

In Ponnalai, more than 100 sovereigns were stolen but to date, no investigations have been carried out. Nobody

knows what is happening on that incident. So, what is the idea of having police of that nature? When somebody goes to the police station to make an entry, they ask whether he can bring the person who committed the crime; or who committed the robbery or who killed the people? That is a silly request by the police to the complainant. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is up. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) We have some time left. So, we will give him time. ( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) . . .

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) I am totally objecting to that statement. We are not communal. It is you who is communal. We are not communal. We are working with the Government. - [Interruption.] It is the Government that is everyday mentioning the word LTTE. But, now it is time for you all to reconcile in a proper manner but every action of yours is not towards reconciliation. We can name it; we can tabulate it.

Thank you.
