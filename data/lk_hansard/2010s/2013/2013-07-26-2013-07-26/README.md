( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! I wish to announce that this House cordially welcomes the Parliamentary Delegation led by the Hon. (Ms.) Eleanor Laing from CPA, UK Branch, now present in the Speakers Gallery.

. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, while acknowledging their presence in this House, I would like to ask the Hon. Minister whether he accepts the fact that the basic salary of a Police Constable is half the per capita income of the country.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) How can you compare the per capita income with the salary?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am talking of the per capita income, . The per capita income of this country which you all are boasting of is US Dollars 2,900 which represents Rs. 28,000 monthly. So, what you are telling is that a person who contributes to keep peace in this country is earning half the per capita income of this country.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) What was the salary paid by the UNP Government? What was the per capita income at that time? How much was a Police Constable paid at that time? Can you give me answers to those questions? - [Interruption.] Hon. Deputy Speaker, that is not a rational question.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Please do not convert this to a debate. This is time for Questions and Answers.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, you do not need to lose your disposition on a matter that you have got stumped. You yourself answered -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, will you please answer?

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Sir, it is not a rational Question because these salaries have been fixed by the National Salaries and Cadre Commission, taking into consideration the salary levels of others in the public sector.

That is the salary which has been fixed. If you say that that salary is not enough, that is your view. But, this is the salary that the Government has given the Police Constables.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The second Supplementary Question, please. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . , . , ? . , . ?

The elections to the Northern Provincial Council has been gazetted now. There is a big issue on police powers. So, I am asking you, as the Hon. Leader of the House, there is a lot of aberration on the white van" syndrome, where police powers have been -

1081 1082

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Sir, he is making a statement. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, please raise the Supplementary Question. This is not the time for a debate or a speech.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am trying to do it according to the British system, Sir. In the British system, we are able to show -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You know that we have got only one hour for 15 Questions. Now, the two of you have taken almost half-an-hour. Please shorten your Supplementary Questions.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We are trying to keep the vibrancy of Parliament. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You are well aware of the Standing Orders of this House. Please strictly adhere to those and raise your Supplementary Questions.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, we want to keep a sense of vibrancy in Parliament. Then, I am sure even the British will be very proud that we, Sri Lankans as well, are doing what they are doing in the UK. So, Hon. Leader of the House, please tell us whether the fact that the Independent Police Commission has been submerged owing to the Eighteenth Amendment overriding the Seventeenth Amendment, has led to the erosion of the independence of the Police? Now, this "white van" syndrome that has taken place -

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) How many questions have been asked? If you want to know about the Police Commission -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, please raise your Supplementary Question.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I will come from the main road to the byroad. My Question is, please tell us: is there any harm owing to the devolution of powers through this particular basis, and is the independence of the Police Commission being put to test owing to the fact that there is this devolution of power that has been given to the provinces?

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) This Question does not arise from the Question which has been asked. But, anyway I will answer. With regard to the question of devolution, there is a Committee appointed by Parliament and we have asked everybody to come there and air their views and reach a consensus. So, it will be decided in that Committee what the consensus is.

[2.38 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I got to know the Hon. Mohamed Mahroof in 1983, when he was contesting the election for the Colombo Municipal Council. His father had also been a Municipal Council Member. I remember the meeting where I met him; he came leading a large procession of supporters. The Hon. Mahroof was a part of the Colombo Central Organization of the UNP. The late President, Hon. R. Premadasa, had made it one of the best electoral organizations - if not, the best one - of the UNP in the country. He had a team of dedicated people who worked with him, both in local politics as well as the activities of his Ministry, led by the Hon. Sirisena Cooray and the others included the Hon. Mohamed Mahroof. He was involved in the Gam Udawa as well as many other political and public projects of President Premadasa.

Subsequently, he was the Deputy Mayor of Colombo in which role I had to deal with him on many occasions. Then, in 1996, I made him the Organizer for Colombo Central because he was a very active Member - even the Hon. Fowzie would agree with me - involved at grass roots level politics. Colombo Central is a good place for training in grass roots level politics: on how would you do it, how would you manage it and we used to watch who used to climb up that organization.

The Hon. Mohamed Mahroof happened to be one of those who came up and I was impressed with his work; I was impressed with his commitment to the Party and I made him the Organizer. It was for a short time just before he came to Parliament in 2001. He contested the 2001 Election and came to Parliament at the end of that year. The Hon. Mohamed Mahroof during that period, played a very important role in the Party agitation activities especially, in the City of Colombo. He had organized the crowds well. We had a Jana Bala Meheyuma and many other protest meetings in which the Hon. Mohamed Mahroof played a key role. I must recognize the role that he played during this eventful period of our modern history.

1125 1126

Subsequently, I made him the Minister of Urban Public Utilities. He kept a low profile but he knew the work. Having worked under President Premadasa when he was the Minister of Local Government and having worked with the Hon. Sirisena Cooray, he was quite aware of the functions of public utilities and he did a good job, both in regard to Colombo as well as the whole country. But, I must say that being a Member of Parliament, he paid special attention to the City of Colombo and the Colombo Central Electorate. There were very few issues that came up. He foresaw many of the problems and was able to deal with them long before it came up. I think that was one of his strengths.

Thereafter, he was in the Opposition with us. At the 2011 Municipal Council Elections, he parted company with us and went on to the UPFA and became the Leader of the Opposition.

His death was a sudden one. But, I do fondly remember the work I have done with him: how often he used to be involved, how often he used to come and meet us because he was a grass roots level organizer. He knew how to keep the grass roots going and he was quite successful in mobilizing the votes in the Colombo City itself. So, this period that he worked as Organizer from 1996 till 2011 was an eventful period and the period in which we worked together. Unfortunately, he had to part company but nevertheless, I remember the work he has done and we are grateful for it.

I wish to convey my condolences to the members of his family.

Thank you.

[2.43 p.m.] ... ( ) ( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Urban Affairs) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, I rise with deep sorrow to pay my tribute to the late Hon. Mohamed Mahroof, former Minister of Urban Public Utilities and a Member of this august Assembly, whose very calm and peaceful face lingers still before my eyes.

I am thankful to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for granting this opportunity to recall the memory of a highly pleasing personality who has been one of those rare politicians with great qualities. His services to the people of the Colombo District, particularly the people of

Colombo Central, were vast and very great. Although he was many years younger to me in age, I had enjoyed his friendship as he was a politician of high eminence and a princely figure in politics.

He was held in high esteem by all political parties as he showed respect for other's views. He was one of the most honest, modest and a lovable personality who moved with men of all shades. He transcended the boundaries of race, religion, caste and creed and embraced all people alike. He was also in the forefront in social, cultural and economic activities pertaining to the people of his electorate.

As a philanthropist, he had a large heart in helping poor people who came seeking his help. He was a charitable person who was liberal in giving away from his wealth as charity. He was also an ardent religious and pious person who helped many organizations and institutions and also most temples, mosques, churches and kovils disregarding religious differences.

As a social worker with an objective vision, he was a quiet and an unassuming personality with very fine human qualities. Throughout his life, he served the people without fanfare.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

[ ] .

, , [ ] .

Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Hon. Mahroof, as a man who fostered fellowship among the different ethnic communities, was an ardent believer in the concept of multiculturalism and ethnic harmony. He always looked into the grievances of the people with great understanding. His approach to various issues had been unique in respect of each case. He played a silent role in building bridges between the different communities of the country. He was also a staunch democrat who was always ready to listen to many a descending view with his ears turned to the aggrieved. Compassion and human kindness were personified in him.

1127 1128

[ ]

2013 26

He began his political career as a member of the Colombo Municipal Council and had been privileged to hold the post of Deputy Mayor. At the time of his demise, he was holding the post of the Leader of the Opposition of the Municipal Council. He was extraordinarily considerate to others, giving priority to the welfare of others before him. He was particularly concerned about the educational upliftment of poor children and helped them with their needs.

The people of Colombo Central will remember him forever for his significant contribution to their welfare. Men of his calibre are very rare. He was truly a peoples man who untiringly toiled for the welfare of the people.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I join the Members of this House in paying my tribute to him and convey my deepest condolence to his family members: Mrs. Zareena Zainab Mahroof, his three children Fathima Deenah, Sithina Fathima, Mohamed Ayub and other members of his family.

May Allah grant him the felicity of the Heaven, "Jennathul-Firdouse"!

Thank you.

[2.49 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the late Hon. Mohamed Mahroof was a very strong supporter of the United National Party. I remember him because he was a very close associate of the late President J.R. Jayewardene and gave him the maximum support in his election campaigns. I am personally aware that he sacrificed quite a lot of his own wealth for the well-being of former Presidents and of the United National Party.

Subsequently, when he was appointed as the Leader of the Colombo Central on behalf of the United National Party, he served the people of the Colombo Central and sacrificed a major part of his wealth for the welfare work of the voters of the Colombo Central electorate. He was also a close associate of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa and undertook a great deal of charitable work assigned to him by President Premadasa .

In 1983, he became a Member of the Colombo Municipal Council and in 1996, became the Deputy Mayor. In 1998, he became the UNP Organizer for the Colombo Central; in 2001, a Member of Parliament and in 2002, he was not only a Member of Parliament but also a Minister in the then UNP Government.

We see that he had sacrificed the better part of his life for the cause of the people, more particularly when we consider the fact that even though he was a leading

businessman with quite a lot of wealth at the time he entered into politics, towards the end he neglected his business and the wealth he had got, depleted. There were no allegations levelled against him as a politician, a Deputy Mayor, a Member of Parliament or as a Minister. He was truly a peoples man who worked tirelessly for the people, whether he was in the United National Party or in the PA, subsequently having joined it.

Therefore, we are really saddened that we have lost him. It was not much of an age for a man to depart but nevertheless, the call had been there and he had to go. So, on behalf of the United National Party, let me extend my condolences to the bereaved family, his wife, children and relatives. As, when a person dies, we say in Catholicism, may he rest in peace!

Thank you. [2.53 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I rise to pay my tribute to the late Hon. Mohamed Mahroof on behalf of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and on my personal behalf.

Sir, the Colombo City and more particularly, the Colombo Municipal Council, has virtually been the cradle from which many an illustrious Parliamentarian has been groomed. The Hon. Mohamed Mahroof was one such political leader from that long line of Municipal Councillors from Colombo, who adorned the national Parliament.

The political persona of the Hon. Mohamed Mahroof was, perhaps, not the same as that of some of the people who came to Parliament from the Colombo Municipal Council, who would have been very articulate in their oratory or whose personality could be considered as being very flamboyant. But, yet, he possessed certain qualities which are rare in men and one such quality was his philanthropy, which knew no bounds.

During this holy month of Ramazan, we, as Muslims, have to perform an obligatory function of our faith, give generously towards the underprivileged people. I am sure many people in the City of Colombo would remember the generous donations and contributions the late Hon. Mohamed Mahroof made to them and many of them had benefited from his philanthropy.

Sir, having said that, I must also say that he was a very popular and dedicated leader of the most deprived sections of Colombo, whom I would describe as those

1129 1130

coming from the underbelly of our Capital City. I am referring to those hundreds and thousands of city dwellers who come from the so-called "gardens" or wattas, which should now be called as "underserved settlements" of Colombo. He had done so much to uplift the living conditions of those underprivileged people. Something that was very unique in his political career is that he not only attended to the day-to-day needs of his people but was also very keen to uplift the educational standards of those underprivileged tenement garden population. He would particularly be remembered for the help he had rendered for the upliftment of many schools within the Colombo City . As for the Muslims, I am sure they would remember the services he had rendered to a few of the oldest educational institutions in Colombo: Hameed Al-Husseinie College, a National School, Al-Nasser Muslim School in Grandpass, Al-Hidaya Maha Vidyalaya in Sri Sangaraja Mawatha, Fathima Muslim Ladies' College in Bandaranaike Mawatha and Khairiya Muslim Girls' School. Those are a few schools that I could mention, which had benefited from the services of the late Hon. Mahroof.

As a Municipal Councillor and Deputy Mayor, he did another unique service, which should be mentioned while we pay tribute to him: upgrading the Ayurvedic dispensaries that were being run by the Municipal Council of Colombo. There, he introduced another novelty by bringing in one other indigenous medical system - the Yunani medicine - through a few Ayurveda dispensaries that were set up in Abdul Hameed Street, Prince of Wales Mawatha and perhaps many others, which I think is a unique attempt made by him.

Another important development with which he was involved together with the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa and a former Mayor of Colombo, the Hon. Sirisena Cooray, was the Nawagampura Stage 1 and Stage 2 Settlement Schemes. Those came about as a multifaceted facility to provide housing, water, sanitation and various other facilities for those underprivileged people who were settled there. What was unique in that settlement was that it was a multicultural setup with multireligious communities living within the same environment, which we see even up to date. Hindus, Christians, Buddhists and Muslims, all have got their separate places of religious worship and they live very much in harmony in a settlement of that nature.

That, we see all over Colombo. In many of these underprivileged areas, there is hardly a friction among these communities. Unfortunately, in some areas today we find that certain extremist forces are fanning the flames of tension among different communities on religious grounds but within the City of Colombo, people of the calibre of the Hon. Mohamed Mahroof did a service to all communities without discrimination whatsoever in uplifting their living standards.

Having said that, I must also mention here about his specific involvement with one of the revered sections of the Muslim faith, the Shazuliya Thareeqa in Colombo and various parts of this country where he was supposed to be an important member of that congregation. He followed the footsteps of his late father, Proctor C.M.M. Mahroof, who was a pioneer of the Shazuliya Thareeqa in Sri Lanka. He had been involved in this Movement and those who are involved in the religious functions of this Movement would very fondly remember the contributions that the Hon. Mohamed Mahroof made to the Shazuliya Thareeqa and its adherence in several parts of this country.

He was originally a member representing the Grandpass area in the Colombo Central, the New Bazaar area, which was originally nurtured by the legendary Muslim leader from Colombo who was one of those pioneers who built up the United National Party, the late Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel. That was his own ward. The New Bazaar Street - Masangas Veediya area was his cradle from which he entered politics and he was very much identified with President Premadasa and the former Mayor, Mr. Sirisena Cooray, and the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya who is present in the House now. As a Mayor, he worked tirelessly to uplift the living standards of the poor and downtrodden people who lived in underserved settlements of Colombo. He would be fondly and dearly remembered forever in their memory for the great services that he rendered to them.

He had built several Community Centres. There is one monument which exists in Centre Road, Barber Street junction. That is the water tank which has been named after him. It is called Mahroof Tower and it provides non-stop water supply to all the areas surrounding Barber Street. That was one achievement of the Hon. Mahroof which cannot be left out when you speak about him. His municipal career and Parliamentary career have earned him respect from people of all shades of opinion and he always had a very friendly and outgoing demeanour which brought us all very close to his heart. He had always been a friend of all those who associated with him; he hardly had enemies to speak of. That was one of those wonderful qualities of the Hon. Mohamed Mahroof.

In conclusion, according to Islam faith it is said in Arabic, Kullu Nafsin Daiqathul Mauth - whoever who is born has to die one day. It means that death embraces everyone. Perhaps, the Hon. Mahroofs life had been snuffed away much earlier than it should be. From the way things happen, his demise is something very difficult for us to bear but still I must condole with his family, his children and his dear wife on behalf of my Party, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, and a vast number of supporters all over the Island, in paying this tribute to the Hon. Mohamed Mahroof.

Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees.

[3.14 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Allahummaghfirlahum Warhamhum - May Allah extend His pardon on him and also shower His mercy on him.

Today, I rise in this House to pay my tribute to one of the best known Parliamentarians who adorned the benches of this august Assembly. Mohamed Mahroof is a name that would remain etched in the hearts of not only the people of the Colombo Central but people in the entire country. He was the driving force in carrying forward the projects of the then Government. He always took a front seat in organizing the "Gam Udawa" project of the late President R. Premadasa. I can remember very well that he used to visit those "Gam Udawa" sites much earlier than the other officers did, along with the former Minister and Mayor of Colombo, Hon. Sirisena Cooray. He joined hands with people of the calibre of Jehan K. Cassim, who was at one time the Chairman of the Common Amenities Board and also the Chairman of the Bank of Ceylon and M. Mohinudeen Hajiar of Delmon fame.

Sir, Mohamed Mahroof was a person deeply involved in Islamic religious activities. He was a dutiful member of the Shazuliya Thareeqa in Sri Lanka. He also was an

ardent supporter and benefactor of the Refai Thareeq. He frequented himself in every Mosque, particularly in Colombo, around Grandpass, Messenger Street, Kuruwe Street, Old Moor Street, New Moor Street, Barber Street and other areas.

Sir, I used to meet him at the All-Ceylon Refai Thareeqa Association Headquarters in First Mosque Lane, Colombo 12, which was earlier called "Siripina Mudukku". My thoughts go to about 30 years back. At Layards Broadway, lived Mr. A.L.M. Thassim Hajiar who was popularly known as "Thassim Baass". He was a great religious person. Dignitaries from the Androth Island in India visit this place annually. Religious personages like Pookoya Thangal, Attukoya Thangal, Nallakoya Thangal and other Thangals annually visit his house and conduct the Refai Ratheeb. Today, this Association is led by the dynamic figure His Eminence Alhaj Ashique Koya Thangal. In fact, the lane named Refai Thareeqa Lane.

The Hon. Mahroof extended not only monetary assistance but also supported its development.

Today, Sir, the people of Colombo in particular, do shed tears in the absence of Mohamed Mahroof as they are observing the holy fast in the month of Ramazan - Ramazan Kareem! This is the time one could observe the charitable disposition of the Hon. Mohamed Mahroof, who had no limits in extending his benevolence in abundance.

He did not leave out a single - what we sometimes call muddukkus - lane in Colombo. He helped the poor people in these areas to observe their fast and celebrate the Eid Festival. He was such a towering figure in Colombo. I should say that the poor in some of these areas shed tears when they are overcome with the thought of Mahroof.

At Awwal Zaviya Road in Grandpass, he used to have the students of the Ahadiya movement lined up to distribute uniforms, books et cetera to them. Once, he invited me also when I was the Minister of Muslim Affairs as the Chief Guest. It was a very beautiful and a serene sight to see such a large number of Muslim female children assembled there wearing the purdah.

"Thassim Baass" of Layards Broadway, whom I mentioned earlier, also frequently visited my uncle Mr. A.L.J. Deen who was fondly called Deen Baass Maama at Azhar Place, Maharagama. Incidentally, when we were rebuilding the Masjidul Azhariya Mosque in Azhar Place, Temple Road, Maharagama, he helped us by donating necessary cement for that venture.

Today, I am happy to mention in this House, that this Mosque has been renovated, upgraded and modernized by my cousin - a son of Alhaj A.L.J. Deen - Dr. Alhaj

M. Haris Z. Deen of Hertfordshire, London. He is an Hafiz and also an author of several books in Islam and Jurisprudence.

The Hon. Mohamed Mahroof had the sterling quality of associating himself closely with the Ulama community. He was a close friend of the All-Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama and helped in its revival and progress.

When I mention this Sir, it comes to my mind that a couple of days ago one of his admirers, a great scholar, Alhaj Moulavi Dr. H. Salahudeen (Bari) passed away. I know he very often visited him. Moulavi H. Salahudeen, by the way, is an author of 247 books on Islam and Jurisprudence in Tamil. He also translated many books into Sinhala for the benefit of the Sinhalese brethren in this country. And, at last, like the Mahawansa, Moulavi Salahudeen also produced a Mahapotha. In all these ventures, we could see Mahroof always associating and extending a helpful hand. His benevolence and philanthropy never ceased until he breathed his last. He helped Colombo schools like Al-Hikma, Al-Nasser in Grandpass, Al-Iqbal in Slave Island and many other schools in which underprivileged and low income students studied.

He helped them by providing uniforms and books. He wanted to have an educated society in the Colombo District where he was a Member. Other very notable institutions were the Fathima Girls' School in Bandaranaike Mawatha, Aluthkade and also Khairiya Girls' School in Dematagoda. The Khairiya Girls' School goes down in history as the first Muslim girls school which was started by the three ladies called, Khaleefatha, Oseelatha and Jaleelatha. They are the pioneers in the education of the Muslim females in Colombo.

All the other political and social activities of the Hon. Mahroof have been very clearly dealt by the Leader of the House, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva.

He was educated at St. Benedicts College, Kotahena, where during his time he played football and took part in other sports activities. He gave a helping hand to the late Mr. V.A. Sugathadasa, a former Minister of Sports and Mayor, when the Sugathadasa Stadium was started by him. After that, he entered Aquinas University College and qualified himself in the ICMA examination.

His father, the late Mr. C.M.M. Mahroof was also an influential personality in Grandpass and Messenger Street area, sometimes called Masangas Veediya. He was also a Member of the Municipal Council and a well-known lawyer. Sir, Mohamed Mahroof, the son, also wanted to become a lawyer, but unfortunately that was not to be. Culanthai Marikkar Mohamed Mahroof was his fathers full name.

His mothers name was Noor Shafiqa Mahroof. He had two sisters - Fathima Maziya Jisthi and Zainab Zeena Haroon. . He was married to the graceful lady, Mrs. Shereena Zainab and they had three children. He had two daughters, Fathima Deenah and Sithina Fathima and also a young son, Mohamed Ayub.

He headed the Lafarge Mahaweli Marine Cement (Pvt.) Limited as mentioned earlier.

He entered the Colombo Municipal Council. He was always a formidable figure, not only a formidable candidate. In every election where the Hon. Mahroof contested, his rivals felt that they had no chance of overcoming the large number votes that would go into the ballot box of this candidate, Mohamed Mahroof. He was elected for the Colombo Municipal Council for the second time in 1987 and did his civic services to uplift the downtrodden people of the Colombo City. He was elected to the Colombo Municipal Council for the third time and became the Deputy Mayor in 1996. He was, in every sense, the most qualified person to become the first citizen of the City of Colombo, but tragically, it was not to be. When one considers the amount of funds, as the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya rightly said in this House that he gave, with no return, to his Party, the then United National Party, his philanthropic mind showed no end in helping this political party.

I remember going with him around Colombo in demonstrations organized by him. He used to be always in the forefront; thousands and thousands of party supporters and cadres in all those events were fed by the Hon. Mohamed Mahroof. That is an open secret. There had been Mr. S.H.M. Kamil, Mr. Rifai Bahaudeen, Mr. Premasiri Perera, who was a close associate of Mr. Vijaya Kumaranatunga, who worked for our great personality, the Hon. Mohamed Mahroof. Some people compare the water tank at Barber Street to his physical figure. It is such a massive tank.

All the people there, and particularly the Hameed Al-Husseini College benefited largely through the philanthropic mindedness of the Hon. Mohamed Mahroof.

From there, he makes a beeline to Rifai Thareeqa Mosque to meet Ashique Thangal.

Sir, the Hon. Mohamed Mahroof was the Minister of Urban Public Utilities, when I was the Minister of Muslim Affairs. Whatever occasion that arose, he always sought my assistance in the House to make his point of view heard by the Legislature and I never hesitated to help him. At last, I am sorry to say, heartbroken, he could not prolong any further with the party that he helped to resuscitate and build to be such a strong movement that he left the United National Party. He was so convinced of

1137 1138

the Mahinda Chintana and the dynamic personality who leads the SLFP, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa that he joined the ruling United People's Freedom Alliance in 2011. The CMC election then followed and he again won convincingly. It was under the leadership of Mr. Milinda Moragoda. After Mr. Milinda Moragoda resigned, dutifully and lawfully the Hon. Mahroof enjoyed that position.

As I told you, this is the holy month of Ramazan. During this month, we give charity and "zakath". It is 2

per cent of one's income, ordained by Islam. The Hon. Mohamed Mahroof was very helpful to the Colombo Dewatagaha Mosque, not only to the devotees who congregate there but all others too in the surrounding areas.

The Hon. Mohamed Mahroof is no more; Allah is great; He knows best!

The Hon. Mohamed Mahroof was a Member in this House for a total period of 9 years, 1 month and 8 days.

Sir, I would like to quote from the booklet, 40 - Rabbana - ATHINA FIDDUNYA. It is the opening Verse of any prayer. This was incidentally - with personal nostalgia I recall - printed in memory of my own teacher at Zahira, Mr. M.S.M. Faleel, by his son M. Shahey Faleel and the family members, and was distributed to the people who attended the 40th "Kathamul Quran" of my teacher, M.S.M. Faleel. There are 40 Du'as - prayers. In conclusion, I would like to quote Dua 37 from this booklet:

RABBANAGHFIR LANA WA LIIKHWANI-NAL-LADHINA SABAQUNA BIL IMANI WA LA TAJ AL FI QULUBINA GHILLAL-LIL-LADHINA AMANU RABBANA INNAKA RAUFUR-RAHIM.

Our Lord! Forgive us and those of our brethren who preceded us in faith, and do not put any spite in our hearts towards those who believe, O our Lord! Verily You are the Most-Kind, the Ever Merciful.

- Al-Hashr 10"

That is the Quran. So, with these words, I wind up and pray for Allah Subahana Tha'ala in this month of Ramazan to grant his Adiyan - his follower, Mohamed Mahroof - the highest felicity in Jennathul-Firdouse.

DISPOSAL OF USED MOBILE PHONES

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Presiding Member, I move,

A remarkable growth has been seen in the field of communication owing to the speedy development taking place in communication facilities at present. Further, the use of mobile phones has also increased rapidly. As a result, a large quantity of mobile phones and spare parts are dumped by the people to environment. The soil and water is faced with the threat of pollution due to the dumping of mobile phones and spares to environment.

Therefore, it is moved in this House that it is advisable to launch an island-wide programme with the intervention of the Ministry of Environment and Renewable Energy for the disposal of the used mobile phones.

I table* the Sinhala and Tamil versions of the Motion to be included in Hansard.

* :

* :

*Sinhala and Tamil versions of Motion tabled:

" . . . .

" , . , . . .

, , ."

Sir, this is a remarkable world, what you call the 21st Century. The world is advancing and we are also advancing equally. We are now not an underdeveloped country. We are a developing country.

The total amount of telephones in Sri Lanka has increased to a titanic amount of 23.8 million during 2012, an 8.4 per cent increase compared to last year. A number of 23.8 million telephones are there in the hands of Sri Lankan people: the young, the old, the middle-aged, school children, office workers and even housemaids carry telephones. The reason behind this huge increase is the recorded hike of mobile phones in the country in 10.9 per cent last year. At the end of 2011, the total count of telephones in Sri Lanka was 87.8 per cent. And during 2012, it has increased up to 100 per cent.

Sri Lanka has a population of around 20 million, but there are more phones than that. So, what an advanced state we have attained under the Mahinda Chintana so ably led by our dynamic President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Sri Lankas telephone density rose to 100.8 lines per 100 persons in 2010 showing that fixed and mobile connections had overtaken the population, in a telling demonstration of the results of ending state monopoly.

Telephone density rose from 86.6 in 2009 in a country with a population of 20.6 million, according to data

1157 1158

published by the Central Bank. Two decades ago, in 1990, Sri Lankas teledensity was one line per 100 persons.

Mobile phone users grew 20.9 per cent in 2010 to 17.2 million. Industry analysts say owners of more than one mobile Subscriber Identity Module - SIM - are growing as there are no restrictions on use of SIMs, removable cards that store mobile phone identification data.

In 1992, there were only 2,644 mobile phones in Sri Lanka. Now, it has increased over 20 million. You would see the amazing rise!

There is one other area I would like to give my thought to. That is the use of mobile phones by school children. They take in their satchels to schools mobile phones and they are more interested in calling even their own mates in the class or their friends rather than concentrating on the studies. Now, this is not a good phenomenon at all.

Sir, on behalf of the Members of Parliament, I take this opportunity to wish good luck to the newly-born Prince of Prince William and Princess Kate. It is very significant that when we are about to host the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in our country, the Queen has already seen the third successor to the British Crown. British Crown means the Head of the Commonwealth of which we are also an honoured members. At this point, I must also say that the next two years is going to be a proud moment in Sri Lankas history. In 1976, . She became the Head of the Non-Aligned Movement.

' ' . . , . British people . ? Prince Charles , . , ; ; . That is culture; that is civilization that we have to learn. - [ ] They cannot understand that.

Sir, I call this handphone a Sultan and a Shaithan. You can give a wrong message. You can spread a canard all over the world by pressing the keys in this phone. A good message is Sultan; a false message is Shaithan. Therefore, it has got to be assured that these mobile phones are used in the proper way so that we will enjoy the rapid advancement technologically in the 20th Century. At the same time, we should guard our children from falling into the pit of degradation.

The Hon. Minister has now arrived and I hope that he has a very good opportunity now to place before the House a comprehensive statement so that the threat of pollution caused due to dumping of mobile phones and spares to the environment could be saved.

Thank you very much.

I would like to draw your kind attention to my letter dated 07.01.2013..

- .-

.........on the above matter. (A copy is attached herewith.) You have been requested to report the mechanism of disposal of used mobile phones at the end of their lifetime by this letter. It was identified that most of the importers do not have a proper mechanism of e-waste disposal.

1167 1168

[ .. ]

2013 26

Since the importation of mobile phones has doubled in 2012 there is a grown concern on mobile phone waste disposal. Therefore, several discussions on this matter were taken place with the Ministry of Environment and Renewable Energy, Telecommunication Regulatory Authority and the other stakeholders in this regard. Accordingly, following decisions will be implemented with effect from 01.10.2013 to mitigate negative impacts of e-waste disposal to the environment with the collaboration of Ministry of Environment and Renewable Energy.

1. Each and every importer of Mobile Phones should declare

the mechanism of mobile phone-waste disposal to be eligible for an Import Control License. This should be a CEA (Central Environmental Authority) approved manner of collecting and disposing.

2. The monetary benefit given for the customers who are

returning used phones and batteries should be included in the disposing mechanism.

3. At least one year warranty period should be provided for the

phones imported to the country.

4. Conformity assessment report from an accredited body with

the opinion on essential requirements of R&TTE Directive 1999/5/EC should be provided with the application to import a Brand/Model for the first time.

Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter. This letter was signed by the Controller of Imports and Exports.

(a) (i) Mr. M. Ramasamy residing temporarily at

No.575/17, Baseline Road, Dematagoda, Colombo 09 has requested for a house from the Urban Development Authority by stating that he had resided at Dematagoda in that particular land and vacated it due to the Black July riot in 1983, before the acquirement by the Urban Development Authority. He had forwarded a complaint as well to the Human Rights Commission under No. HRC/165/03/7(iv) regarding the above matter. Even though necessary action was taken to provide a house by the Urban Development Authority on a payment basis, according to a rent which was decided by the Government Assessor considering the humanitarian and compassionate issues, the Urban Development Authority had not possessed a vacated house at that moment. Therefore measures were taken to provide a land plot at Peliyagoda Development Project. But, he had refused that offer. After that necessary action was taken to provide a house situated at Avissawella Manikka Estate which belonged to the Authority, where he had also refused that offer by stating it is an outstation from Colombo.

(ii) Same answer in above. (b) Further steps cannot be taken to fulfil the requisition of Mr. Ramasamy as he had refused every offer which had been forwarded by the Authority, where all necessary steps were taken to provide maximum relief to the said person under the rules, regulations and policies enforced by the Urban Development Authority. (c) The Authority had not been legally bound with Mr. M. Ramasamy, as the Authority had not acquired any property which belonged to Mr. M. Ramasamy or he had not been displaced by any development activity of the Urban Development Authority.
