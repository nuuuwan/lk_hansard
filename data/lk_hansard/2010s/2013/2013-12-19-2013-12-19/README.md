: : PRIVILEGE: CHALLENGING OF STATEMENT MADE IN PARLIAMENT . ( . ) (The Hon. Pon. Selvarasa) Hon. Speaker, I wish to raise a Question of Privilege on the following matter:

Sir, I made a speech in Parliament at the Committee Stage Discussion when the Votes of the Ministry of Higher Education were taken up on the 6th December, 2013. In the course of my speech, I referred to the allegations that had been made against the Vice-Chancellor and the administration of the Eastern University of Sri Lanka and requested a committee of inquiry to look into same.

It was brought to my notice that on 7th December, 2013, the Vice-Chancellor, Dr. K. Kobindarajah, had a Press Conference in Batticaloa where he had made various references to my Parliamentary speech, challenged and questioned same. This was reported in several newspapers on 9th December, 2013, and I have copies of the articles of the daily newspapers with me. Dr. K. Kobindarajah had repeatedly alleged that my speech was made with malice and was done with the intention of slinging mud at him. He had also stated that I ought to have called and spoken to him prior to making any references to the allegations. I have information that as early as 4th November, 2013, a delegation from the Eastern University Teachers Association had handed over a long list of several allegations in writing, but nothing had been done about this in the last month. As a Member of Parliament, particularly representing the Batticaloa District, I have every right to raise this matter in Parliament.

Sir, you will agree that questioning a statement made by me in Parliament and imputing motives for same is a breach of my privilege as a Member of Parliament and I would, therefore, kindly urge you to give notice to Dr. K. Kobindarajah and take action against him for breach of my privilege. Thank you.

Member, with regard to the recruitment of Grama Seva Niladharis, the only way we recruit is by holding a written examination conducted by the Department of Examinations and an interview conducted by the Ministry of Public Administration. The marks given at the examination and the interview will be added and the results will be based on that. Other than that, there is absolutely no other way the Grama Seva Niladharis are recruited.

( ) (The Chairman) . . . [12.03 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Chairman, this is the first opportunity I got to speak when you are presiding and I am very happy about it.

Sir, on this occasion, I wish to congratulate you for making Parliament open to the public. The public have a right to see what their Representatives are doing here. I saw, especially today, a large number of ordinary people coming to Parliament. In the past, we used to see school-uniformed children coming here, but today, even from villages, people are organizing themselves and coming here. But, I am also sad that they - at the moment they are

2959 2960

not here, but they have been coming and going throughout the day - will be disappointed to see that only a few of us are sitting here. Only those Members who are due to speak are waiting to make their speeches and those who had already spoken have left the House, which is very unfortunate. We have Parliament Proceedings being telecast today. Sir, you must instruct whoever is televising it to scan the whole House while we are speaking, while our voice is on, showing the other Members, so that the people will be aware as to how many of us are sitting in Parliament and listening. It is very unfortunate if you do not listen to the other Members because then, when you speak, you are not going to speak of what is relevant, but what is prepared by you and what you think has to be spoken of.

Sir, since I came to Parliament in 1994, we have been raising the issue of the Public Service reaching the people in the upcountry or the plantation areas. Unfortunately, even today, we are unable to obtain the services in the Sinhala language because of the lack of Sinhala officers in our areas. The Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Lekam Karyalaya has only two members who can speak in Tamil, whereas 75 per cent of the population of the area are Tamils, which is a very unfortunate situation. Further, the national average is about 1,000 persons per Grama Niladhari, whereas in the upcountry, it is more than 5,000 persons served by one Grama Niladhari. You always say that you are going to reorganize this, but for the last 20 years nothing has happened. We are going into 2014. We have been asking for this from 1994. So, please see that Grama Niladhari Divisions are created in the upcountry also so that one Grama Niladhari could serve 1,000 people. Maybe in the '70s and '80s, people thought that the people in the plantations are non-citizens, stateless persons and they are just employees of an estate, living in an estate administered by the management and so they are not entitled to these services for the public. But, today, it is a different situation.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Hon. Member, the Delimitation Committee Report has been completed, and as you are aware, it has been submitted to His Excellency the President. I believe, very soon, he will take a decision to implement that Report. In that Report, there are certain references made to the upcountry, particularly to the Nuwara Eliya area, regarding the DS Divisions as well as Grama Niladhari Divisions. So, your expectation will be fulfilled.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you. If it is happening, we will be very glad and happy and, I am sure, it will ensure that the services reach

these people and they do not feel alienated from the nation.

Sir, then, the Hon. Pon Selvarasa was speaking about recruitment under Circular No. 15/1990, which based the ethnic ratio for recruitment to the Public Service. There was a case in the Supreme Court regarding promotions and promotions were struck down. But, that does not mean recruitment was stopped. In fact, in 1956, the Public Service was flawed. In 1946, there was a survey done and 46 per cent of the Public Service was Tamil officers under the British Rule. So, in 1956, affirmative action was taken to bring the Sinhala Only Act, so that the number of Sinhala officers would also increase in the Public Service. But, it has gone to such an extent that today 94 per cent of the Public Service is Sinhala officers and only 6 per cent is available to the three Tamil-speaking communities. So, to correct this, in 1990, following the recommendations of the Presidential Commission on Youth in which the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris was also a Member, they recommended recruitment on an ethnic basis. This was an affirmative action and if it had been argued before the Supreme Court as an affirmative action, maybe the decision of the Supreme Court would have been different. In 2002, the then UNP Government asked the Attorney-General to move the Supreme Court for a review of that decision, but before a decision could be arrived at or could be determined, the UNP Government was dismissed so that we could not proceed further. But, today, this Circular is being implemented, as the Hon. Pon. Selvarasa said, in the Eastern Province. In the Eastern Province since you feel that the Sinhalese do not have enough share in the Public Service, you are implementing it only in the Eastern Province. If it is good for the Eastern Province to increase the number of Sinhala officers in the Public Service, do you not think it is fair to implement it in the rest of the country where Tamil officers are lacking? Look at it objectively. If it is good for the Eastern Province, it is good for the whole country. You must implement Circular No.15/90. You have recently recruited SLAS officers on a special examination because you need Tamil officers to serve in certain areas. Leave out the ethnic ratio. Say, you need Tamil-speaking officers to serve a certain percentage. If 25 per cent is Tamil-speaking people of the total population, then 25 per cent of the officers should be Tamil. It is only then that they can serve the public. So, when you recruit people under SLAS exams or any other Public Service exams, do the same thing.

Hon. Minister, you got up and said earlier that the Grama Niladharis are going to be recruited based on the marks obtained at a competitive examination and an interview. Grama Niladharis who are working at the village level are the first people in the Public Serivce interacting with the people. So, you need Grama Niladharis speaking the language of the people living in that area. So, when you recruit Grama Niladharis, do

2961 2962

[ . ]

2013 19

consider the merit and interview marks. At the same time, see that you also recruit a sufficient number of people to serve in the Tamil-majority Grama Niladhari Divisions to be fair by the people.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, please wind up. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Hon. Member - . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes, Sir. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) I fully agree with you. The only thing is, we cannot have a separate examination or a separate standard. I know that there were some Tamil candidates who sat for the examination.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It could be done, it could be justified. You can get an opinion from the Attorney-General.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Unless, of course, we get a Cabinet approval, we cannot lower the standard or the marks.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Among the Tamils, you can give merit to the people who got the highest marks. So, within that, you can have this. But, you can always say -

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, now wind up. Your time is over. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Chairman, you have already asked me to wind up. I will just say one thing and finish.

Sir, this can be done because the Attorney-General had given an opinion for holding a separate SLAS examination on the basis that the need to provide services in the Tamil language requires SLAS officers to be

recruited in the Tamil language and that was a special thing. So, applying the same interpretation, you can recruit enough Grama Niladharis who can speak and work in the Tamil language and similarly for all other services.

Thank you, Sir.

[2.28 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Deputy Chairman, thank you for permitting me to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities. This is the second time I am speaking today because I also spoke on the Votes of the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs.

Sir, I am glad to follow the Hon. Perumal Rajathurai. He spoke so much about estate housing and also about the 50,000 housing units that are going to be constructed in the estates as upstair houses. He said continuous houses - line rooms - are not appropriate for our people; that they want separate houses. But, he did not condemn the proposal to build upstair houses, maybe because he is still hanging on to this Government and cannot afford to say what he really feels. It is unfortunate.

I think the Hon. Minister of Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities will have to change his portfolio to "Minister of Construction, Engineering Services, Rural Housing and Common Amenities" because the President has now decided that all urban housing will be handled by the Urban Development Authority. In the Budget Speech, the President says that he is going to build upstair houses in the estates and that also will be done by the Urban Development Authority. Then, Hon. Minister, you will be left only with rural housing. Even for rural housing, as my Colleague, the

Hon. Ajith Mannapperuma said, you have built only 2,600 houses for the whole country during the last one year. So, how are we going to address the housing issue of this country, where we need about a million houses? I do not understand what the Government intends doing.

If we talk about houses in Colombo, the prices are so high. I can remember, when the Maligawatta Housing Scheme was built, those houses were given on an instalment basis, where you had to pay only Rs. 600 a month to own that house at the end of the period. But, today, there are no housing schemes of that nature built in the Colombo City. Nobody can get houses on easy payment terms. There are houses built by private entities which are sold in millions. Prime Lands (Pvt.) Limited had advertised a housing scheme in Nawala with two-bedroom houses for Rs. 11.5 million each. Two days later, they had put a banner across the advertisement, saying Sold out. So, a flat in Nawala costs Rs. 11.5 million. This means that the housing policy of this Government has failed and because it has failed, housing has become unachievable for the ordinary man. So, this is a very serious situation. A person who earns a small monthly income will never be able to buy a piece of land to build a house or buy a house within the Colombo District because, as a middle-class person, he cannot afford the houses that are being built today.

Hon. Minister, the "Mahinda Chintana" programme said that they are going to build 50,000 houses in the plantation areas, that they will be given seven perches for building the house and three perches for common amenities. Those 50,000 houses, they said in 2005, will be built in three years. Hon. Minister, I asked a question from you in this House and you stated that 4,600 houses had commenced, only 3,200 had been completed and 1,400 had to be built in 2012.

Maybe by now there is some more progress. It maybe that about 600 houses have still got to be built and 4,000 have been built. But, after promising 50,000 in three years, after 7 or 8 years of "Mahinda Chintana", only 4,000 houses have been built. That means you will build only 500 houses per year. The plantation people need 200,000 houses and that may take 400 years to complete. Do you expect our people to wait for so long? The policy stated in the "Mahinda Chintana" of seven perches and three perches, I feel, has now been abandoned, because when the President presented the Budget in this House on the 21st of last month, he said he was going to build 50,000 upstair houses - - in the plantations. The Hon. Gunaratne Weerakoon, Minister of Resettlement, who spoke here today said that the people living in the villages expect separate houses. People living in estates also expect separate houses and not flat-type houses. They live in a rural area. They are mostly working in the plantations and engaged in agricultural type of labour. Their needs are such that they want separate houses. But, again you are promising these

3001 3002

2013 19

50,000 upstair houses. I feel these 50,000 upstair houses are never going to be built. These 50,000 upstair houses are being proposed because last year there was a statement made by the Deputy Minister for Plantation Industries who said they are going to give seven perches for building houses and as the golden shareholder, they have discussed with the RPCs and have decided to give land for building houses.

To stop the issue of these lands, now your Government is coming up with this proposal to build 50,000 upstair houses. That will have to be built by you. You will not build it. Until you build, nobody can issue the seven-perch land for building a house. So, you want to put a stop to giving these lands to the estate workers and that is why you are making this proposal, not to actually build these houses. I think this will never come into being and the workers, as the Hon. Rajathurai just now said, will continue to languish in the line rooms that were built by the Suddas those days. So, this is a very unfortunate situation.

There is another issue Hon. Minister, which I have taken up with you personally. , . 1994 . . NHDA . 1994 2009 loans . 2009 loans . . NHDA . . ? ? ? ?
