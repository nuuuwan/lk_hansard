[3.20 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Mr. Presiding Member, the late Hon. P.C. Imbulana, Member of Parliament, Minister, and Governor was a politician who belonged to the old school. He was a real gentleman to the fingertips. He first started politics from the bottom, being elected to the Pahatha Bulathgama Village Committee and two years later, he became its Chairman and continued in that position for nearly 13 years.

He was a founder member of the United National Party. In the '30s and '40s, the area known as "Tunkorale" was identified as the bastion of the Left. There were stalwarts of the Left movement holding fort in that area. It was extremely difficult to find candidates to contest the Left giants like the Hon. (Dr.) N.M. Perera. However, the Hon. Imbulana being a son of the soil and having lived in that area for generations, contested with the Hon. (Dr.) N.M. Perera without fear. He was unsuccessful on several occasions, but he kept on contesting and ultimately on July 1960, he entered Parliament. He continued as a Member of Parliament for a very long time, from 1960 to 1970, and also from 1977 to 1988; for over 20 years.

As our leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe mentioned, and also as stated by the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Hon. Imbulana was a politician of the old school, who believed that politics was a vocation but not a job. His ancestral lands, money and property were spent for the people of his constituency. He was fortunate that he was able to represent the Ruwanwella Constituency, because now as Members of Parliament, we have to look after the whole district. But, as he had been a Member of Parliament up to 1988, he only had to look after the Constituency of Ruwanwella.

Today, everyone who spoke in this House confirmed that the Hon. Imbulana was an honest politician who never abused his position as a Member of Parliament or a Minister and he served the people of his area with great devotion. I came to know the Hon. Imbulana very closely when he was the Governor of the Uva Province in 1988 and I had just entered Parliament in 1989. From 1988 to 1995, he had been a Governor and we had many meetings and conversations together, particularly on sports, because he was an old Trinitian and a very good rugby player, a coloursman and a good swimmer. I remember him telling me that after leaving Trinity College, he wanted to be a planter, because in the '30s and '40s, most Trinitians ended up as planters. However, the calling of his hometown to enter politics took precedence.

So, I think the members of his family will be proud of the sentiments expressed in this House today. We all do politics, but at the end, we all want to be remembered as people who gave our best to the nation. So, in that

respect, the Hon. Imbulana has fulfilled the great dream of his ancestors and his constituents and served Sri Lanka well.

He will be remembered for the services rendered by him to the people. I was told that even his properties were given to his relatives. So, as Buddhists, we hope and pray that he will attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana. Thank you.

[3.25 p.m.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, I rise in this House to pay our respect and tribute and also to salute the late Hon. P.C. Imbulana on behalf of the Muslim community. We are today mourning the passing away of the Hon. Imbulana. He was a person of gentle qualities. He was an amiable personality who never hurt anybody. He was a respected person and he respected the others. He was a great humanist and a devout Buddhist. He was bilingual both in Sinhala and English.

As yesterday, today also I have, Sir, the Dhammapada in my hand. I would like to quote the "Dhammapada", Verse 169.

" - - "

The Tamil translation of it states, I quote:

' ; . ' The English translation of it states, I quote:

Follow the law of virtue; do not commit sin. He who is virtuous lives happily both in this world and in the next. Even we are taught the same by the Holy Quran. We are asked to live a life of virtuosity and not to harm others; to be peaceful and patriotic to your motherland; to help the country to develop; to create an environment of unity and peace. That is what the Hon. Imbulana stood and fought for right along his life and he breathed his last in the last year.

Sir, he was the Deputy Minister of Local Government, Housing and Construction at one stage and that was the first portfolio he held. Consequent to the resignation of the Hon. M. Tiruchelvam, who was the Minister of Local Government, and when the Hon. R. Premadasa became the Minister, the Hon. Imbulana was chosen as his close friend and lieutenant.

853 854

2013 22

He was born on 28th October, 1914. He was a Trinitian, a true Trinitian from Kandy. Trinity College has produced great men and patriots in Sri Lanka - one was the late Hon. Gamini Dissanayake and the other was the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar. Even in the Cricket field, we have great men from Trinity College, who became Cricket captains in latter years.

He entered local politics in 1945 for the first time and was elected for the Imbulana Ward, which is the name of the village that he carried as his own name. He served in the Pahatha Bulathgama Village Committee. Two years later, at the age of 27, he was the elected Chairman of the VC and he was, at that time, the youngest VC Chairman in Ceylon.

We had occasion to mention here about the youngest Mayor of Sri Lanka, the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis, yesterday when we moved the Vote of Condolence on him. The Hon. Imbulana continued in that office for the next 13 years as the Chairman of the VC. In 1947, he contested the Ruwanwella Seat at the General Election to the First Parliament as the UNP candidate. His opponent on that occasion was that great person who held double doctorates, Hon. (Dr.) N.M. Perera. But, as the result showed, he was roundly defeated. At the 1952 General Election to the Second Parliament, he contested the Ruwanwella Seat again. Once again the Hon. (Dr.) N.M. Perera was his opponent. He was not frightened to face the lion in his own den. He was a calm, quiet and peaceful person, but where political agitation was concerned, he was equal to great leftist leaders - Trotskyist leaders like the Hon. (Dr.) N.M. Perera and others. I am happy that my Colleague, the Hon. Y.G. Padmasiri who represents that area in the Kegalle District, particularly Ruwanwella, paid his tribute to this great person.

Then, Sir, he avoided contesting the 1956 General Election. The Ruwanwella Seat, at that time, was contested by the Hon. R. Premadasa, who was defeated by the Hon. (Dr.) N.M. Perera. Such a formidable candidate and a politician the Hon. (Dr.) N.M. Perera was. It was not that easy to uproot him. In the March 1960 General Election to the Fourth Parliament, the Hon. P.C. Imbulana contested and he was defeated for the third time. In the July 1960 General Election to the Fifth Parliament, the Hon. P.C. Imbulana was once again on the field of Ruwanwella and was elected. The Hon. (Dr.) N.M. Perea had meanwhile given up Ruwanwella and contested from Yatiyantota.

Sir, this seat is a unique seat, always represented by the Leftist, particularly the Leader of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and also by the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne who was also a Sama Samaja Member of that area. Throughout 1947, 1952, 1956 and 1959, it was a fortress of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. Then, the Hon. P.C. Imbulana emerged in 1960, 1965 and also in 1970. Then, in 1970, the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne was elected. Here

is the result of the Ruwanwella Seat in that election: P.C. Imbulana (UNP) - 19,989; Athauda Seneviratne (LSSP) - 15,922; J.L. Samaratunga (SLFP) - 673; B. Samarawickrama (Independent) - 129 and the Hon. P.C. Imbulana won by a majority of 4,067 votes.

Sir, although he was a great sportsman and played cricket, he also concentrated particularly on agricultural development. Because of that, we can call him a leader of the second generation of the post-independent era. During Independence time, there were the Right Hon. D.S. Senanayake, the Hon. C.W.W. Kannangara, the Hon. J.R. Jayewardene, the Hon. Dudley Senanayake and the Hon. A.E. Gunasinghe. Then, the "second string" which I would call was the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis, the Hon. E.L.B. Hurulle, the Hon. M.A. Bakeer Marker, the Hon. M.H.M. Naina Marikar and also, later in life, the Hon. Karunasena Kodituwakku and a former MP and Senator, the Hon. Jinadasa Niyathapala. They all helped, at one time, the party to grow. The Hon. P.C. Imbulana had great love for the country and for the leaders including the Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who fought for Independence. He headed the D.S. Senanayake Commemoration Committee. I can remember in his last stages, he came in a three-wheeler to garland the D.S. Senanayake Statue at the Independence Square. I also remember, Sir, the Hon. U.L.M. Farook, the former Minister of State Transport recalling the days when he worked as private secretary to the Hon. P.C. Imbulana.

He was such an amiable and a friendly person. The Hon. U.L.M. Farook recalled how, at his behest and request, the Hon. Imbulana helped the Kannattota Sulaimania School and all the other Muslim schools. He was a great democrat. He respected all communities and also respected the sentiments of all the communities. That is very much important now.

I remember, Sir, going with him for several meetings. One such meeting was in Kalpitiya where he waxed eloquent on agriculture. It was a fish drying area. But, he was so much involved with them and told them that even the sandy soil in Kalpitiya can be made use for agriculture. What happened later? Norochcholai and other areas are thriving agricultural fields. There is no more sandy soil. The prophesy the Hon. Imbulana made on that occasion has come right at this moment. They are cultivating vegetables, selling it to the Colombo Market and the rest of the island, particularly gherkin, they are able to export to other countries.

So, Sir, as I told you, he was a man of principle and respected all communities. He went to Puttalam and mingled freely with the Muslims. When he was a Local Government Minister, he visited Mannar, Jaffna and Batticaloa - my Friend, the Hon. Piyasena would know. He might have been a child at that time, and mingled with them. Today, the dream of the Hon. Imbulana has come true by the holding of the Kamban Villa in the

855 856

Ramakrishna Mission Hall in Wellawatta. Kampavarithi Jayaraj is heading that. A Tamil Minister from Malaysia has visited. Great Indian leaders and scholars have come. They are addressing at 5 oclock at the Ramakrishna Mission and the Kamban Villa will go on for three days. This is what they have written. I quote:

' '

He was, as I said, a true Buddhist. He liked his own language, Sinhala, but never failed to recognize and respect the language of others. That is the great feature of the Hon. P.C. Imbulana that we should remember today.

Then, there is an anecdote that I should quote. He is P.C Imbulana, Premachandra Imbulana. Once he had a mishap in his vehicle. He rang up the police and said, I am PC. Can you send a vehicle? Then, the police officer who answered the phone said, If the vehicle is broken down take a bus and come. Mr. P.C. Imbulana said I am PC. Then, again that officer said Yes, PC I am telling you, do that. So, that person in the police thought he is really a police constable. But, the Hon. P.C. Imbulana took it in a lighter vein. That was the characteristic of the Hon. P.C Imbulana. Sir, as I quoted from the Dhammapada at the beginning of my speech,I would like to wind up my speech by quoting from Thirukkural".
