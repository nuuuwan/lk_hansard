Then, it becomes more serious. We have to find out who took the CD and gave it to that channel. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! I have given everyone the opportunity to speak. Let the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer raise his point of Order.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the most serious thing is this. - [Interruption.] Let me come to the most serious thing. Sir, whatever was expunged cannot appear in media. Normally, the newspapers follow it. They do not publish it. How can a television company telecast that? I also want to bring to your notice and to the notice of the House, the seriousness of allowing iPads which can access websites inside the Chamber because while the speeches are going on, they can give it. That is a very serious thing.

Sir, whatever expunged cannot go on record. The greatest authority on Parliamentary procedure, Erskine May, states that if the Chair expunges anything, no outside power has the right to publish or telecast it. Sir, Erskine May, such a great authority, states that. Therefore, I want you to hold a thorough inquiry to find out how this went out unedited and who took that to the television channel and handed it over violating all the procedures and the rights of the Members of this House.

1043 1044

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, are you saying that something that had been expunged had been telecast?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Yes, it had been telecast. The newspapers did not publish but this television channel had telecast it in the night on the same day.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is the channel? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) What the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe said was expunged on the Orders of the Deputy Chairman of Committees who was presiding at that time. That portion had been telecast. No television company or media has the right to telecast or publish what has been expunged by the Chair. It was a violation of the privileges of the Members. Otherwise, we cannot run this House properly.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is the point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, on the day this happened, only my name and the Hon. Wimal Weerawansas name was expunged. That was the only thing expunged by the Chair. Those two names were expunged. Other than that, I did not mention any names and the Chair said that I have the right to speak about anybody without mentioning names. That was what was said and this is a misrepresentation of facts by the Hon. Member. There is no point in what he says. Ask him to sit down and if he had mentioned my name, you may order that to be expunged according to No. 84 (vii) of the Standing Orders. May I read that, Sir, or if you are aware of it, you may give an Order for my name to be expunged.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Speaker, what the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake says is also against the Standing Orders because he cannot give any motives to another Member. I did it according to the Standing Orders, in order to maintain the Standing Orders and the good procedure of Parliament - [Interruption.] Wait one moment.

[ . [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

3 ?

Sir, the Deputy Chairman of Committees was very clear. You can easily take the Hansard records and find out. He said "Anything said contrary to the Standing Orders will be expunged". What more than that? Further, the TV channel has no right - [Interruption.] Also, I want you to hold an inquiry. This should not be allowed to be repeated. I want you to hold an inquiry.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Deputy Speaker, let us look at Standing Order No. 25. I quote:

An urgent motion directly concerning the privileges of Parliament shall take precedence of all other motions as well as Orders of the Day. The proceedings of Parliament may be interrupted at any moment, save during the progress of a division, by a motion based on a matter of privilege when a matter has recently arisen which directly concerns the privileges of Parliament.

So, that is exactly what the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena said.

Now, look at Standing No. 24, which states, I quote:

Unless the Standing Orders otherwise direct, notice shall be given of any motion which it is proposed to make the exception of the following.

It has a list and it also says "A motion relating to a matter of privilege". Now, what is filing a motion? Standing Order No. 23(1) states, I quote:

Notice of questions or motions shall be given in writing, signed by the member giving the notice and addressed to the Secretary-General. Such notices may be handed to the Secretary-General at any time when Parliament is sitting or may be sent to or left at the Office of the Secretary-General at any time.

So, now it is very clear. You did not know what this was because you were asking the Hon. Member what his question was. You, in fact, asked him, Are you saying

that what was expunged was telecast on some television channel? So, that means that you did not know what he was raising. It is very clear that he has violated Standing Order Nos. 23(1), 24 and 25. Thank you.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Deputy Speaker, the gist of the Hon. Azwers complaint is that proceedings which involved the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe and the Minister, Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, had been telecast, and the issue that the CD was taken away from here and given to Sirasa TV.

Now, as far as we are concerned, first we have to look at on what basis the authority of the Speaker stems. In regard to publications of newspapers, certainly, there is power in the Parliament Powers and Privileges Act. Then, we also have the same powers as you have in the House of Commons. The other one is the general authority of the Speaker.

Unfortunately, we have not made any legislation regarding electronic broadcast and how it is to be reported. This especially arises in the case of television stations. Now, what is the Order that was made as to what should be expunged? If what should have been expunged had not been expunged when it was telecast in the TV station, then it is a matter to be raised with the TV station; whether it was taken by the staff of Parliament, by the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe or by the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa is irrelevant and is not a breach of Privilege. The breach of Privilege, if at all, arises if the TV station has telecast something on which you have given an Order.

So, you look at it and then decide whether there has been a breach of Privilege. If so, you can then ask them questions as they are responsible. You cannot just be keeping only the CDs under control, when a newspaper will write down and publish any matter, unless there is an Order that it should be expunged or that you are going into it. - [Interruption.] I know. There is nothing here. You cannot allow them to write what they want. So, let us look at what was telecast by Sirasa and then, if it had not been expunged, that is a matter for you to give a warning to them.

I do not want to tell anything about that because, as you know, when I mention Sirasa, today evening it will be on me, and not on any of you.

The second issue, of course, is the iPads. I think in all Chambers the iPad is allowed to be brought in. If you are going to stop that - the issue is that in this Chamber and others, we are also using mobile phones. These are issues we have to take in and see if you are going to enforce it; the Speaker cannot be sending people to look at how we

1047 1048

use the iPads and the mobile phones. You should then certainly look into the whole instance of voluntary - what is that we are willing to do. I would be against saying that iPads cannot be brought in because we carry all the information on the iPads. We say that we are against that.

Then, we come to the bigger issue, whether we should be broadcasting and telecasting our Proceedings. If we have to bring legislation, we might as well address the issue of live broadcast and live telecast of our Proceedings. Instead of trying to bring laws now and trying to say, let us restrain how we are going to control the CDs being issued, let us look at the overall question of live telecasting and live broadcasting and bring essential legislation for that. But, as it stands, this is all that is there and I think we should get back to the main Business of the House.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) To what the Leader of the Opposition just now stated, the question that was raised and what I brought to your notice was - as many Members informed me - that there was a telecast by one of the electronic channels. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition mentioned the name of the channel of his Partys good friends - maybe our friends too. But, the issue is, whether the correct version of the Proceedings of the House was telecast. If it was not so, there is a violation of Parliamentary Privilege, which then falls under you and this is not what we expect from the print media and the electronic media.

Secondly, on behalf of the Government, I would like to make a request that an inquiry be held, maybe jointly, of what happened - because we would like to know what really happened - either by a Joint Parliamentary Committee or by the Speaker or the Deputy Speakers Office.

Thirdly, what the Hon. Leader of the Opposition mentioned has been discussed. Both sides have served on the Committee and recommended that live broadcast be brought in. We are in agreement. As the Leader of the Opposition just now said, both sides have agreed.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, you yourself are aware of it. The issue is, how we could get live telecast plus the funding. This is an issue that has been pending for some time. The Hon. Speaker himself has given his attention to this issue. We are in full agreement. There is no disagreement. At least, that will, in a way, prevent electronic devices being brought to Parliament and being used within the Chamber. If it is being used by anyone to give information outside, which is not allowed under strict instructions from the Chair. - [Interruption.] I am not talking about the or the or the

that you and I know. - [Interruption.] Please! This is a much more serious issue. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition raised this issue yesterday in relation to a printmedia, a Government media. I am raising it because we should take responsibility that this House maintains a certain standard if we are interested in this House continuing to function by a very high standard of debate.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, ideas were expressed by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and the Hon. Chief Whip of the Government as well. I understand that a certain decorum must be maintained in this House and that is exactly what I did. I am from a good family. I studied in a good school. Therefore, I know exactly the language that I should use and that is the language that I used. Hon. Deputy Speaker, you can see that we have wasted so much time on this issue. The point here is, as to whether this CD was issued properly. You know the steps that should be followed when a CD is released to the media.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I can show to you a picture of the telecast, which I have with me. The Mace can be very clearly seen in it. Just as the Hon. Chief Government Whip said, there has to be some sort of substance in what one speaks in Parliament.

That day, when I was speaking - unfortunately, you were not here - for 10 minutes, I could not raise a single point on the subject debated. Continuously, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa disturbed me. He mentioned my name once and said that I have taken bribes. That is what happened. If there is someone who should be ashamed about what was telecast, it is I who should be ashamed. But, I am not because I know what I have done. I know where I come from. I know how I act and I am very clear about it. We have wasted so much time on this. I do not think you have even got a written statement by the Hon. Member at the moment. The issue is whether the CD was issued properly or whether it was not issued properly. Hon. Deputy Speaker, I can show you a picture with the Mace on it.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You cannot display that now. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) It was telecast at 10 oclock. The Mace can be seen. This is a simple issue. Everyday this happens.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I have given you enough opportunity. Hon. Sajith Premadasa, you have spoken about four times on the same issue.

Therefore, Sir, I only want to place on record that the print media is doing a good job because they can edit their script, but not the electronic media. The print media is doing a good job.

. . Question proposed.

[3.00 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Resettlement Authority (Amendment) Bill seeks to amend the validity period of the Act from six years to nine years. But, now the Hon. Minister said that he will need six more years. That is about 10 years. Then, what is the use of extending the period again? You have now asked for 10 years.

( ) (The Hon. Gunaratne Weerakoon)

. . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I listened to you, Hon. Minister. Do not disturb me. You have asked for 10 years.

So, you are admitting that you have not been able to do the work. What you now told is that you have built 470 houses in four years. That means, 117 houses a year. Any private company which is building homes will build more than 117 houses for a year and out of the 50,000 houses that are to be built by India, only 1,000 houses have been built. So, this is a pathetic state of affairs. Actually, I did not believe it earlier. But after I heard this, I thought the preamble in the Draft Resolution that is coming up today in the United Nations Human Rights Council seems to be correct. It says, I quote:

Welcoming and acknowledging the progress made by the Government of Sri Lanka in rebuilding infrastructure, demining, resettling the majority of internally displaced persons, and noting nonetheless that considerable work lies ahead in the areas of justice, reconciliation and resumption of livelihoods, and stressing the importance of the full participation of local populations, including representatives of civil society and minorities, in these efforts, ...

I thought this was just some padding put into the preamble. But, when the Minister says that they have built

only 470 houses in four years, then to build all these houses, he will need about 250 years and not 10 years. So, there seems to be some truth in this preamble and we were thinking that it was just some untruth that was put in by the NGOs. I will not take time to describe the pathetic state of affairs of the North because we are running short of time. I will leave it to some of my Colleagues in the Opposition.

You have built some of the roads. Okay, the roads are good and I must say that the army has done its share in building the infrastructure in the Vanni but we have not put the people back to work. We have not got them really resettled in a way which they can carry on with their day-to-day lives. Most of all, we do not even treat them with dignity. I mean, their claim that they are not being regarded as citizens in their own country has some basis. When you do not allow people to sing their own National Anthem, then what else can you not do? The Hon. Minister has only confirmed that the Resettlement Authority really has not started its work. Where is the political right? This is why we always ask you to hold the Northern Provincial Council Elections and let the members of those Provincial Councils get involved in it. Without having the Provincial Council Elections, you cannot put the North in order. There are protests going on in the North and now you come to the House and admit that you did not even build 500 houses.

When you look at the Resettlement Authority, look at the policy background of the Government by which the Resettlement authority operates. The Governments twin policies are reconciliation and accountability. That is contained in the Resolution that the Government of Sri Lanka moved in the Human Rights Council together with members who were supporting them in 2009. The Resolution endorses the joint communiqu issued at the conclusion of the visit of the Secretary-General. In that Joint Statement by the UN Secretary-General and the Government of Sri Lanka, what have they said? They have said that they committed themselves to address the aspirations and grievances of all communities and work towards a lasting political solution and they have resolved to proceed with the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and to begin a broader dialogue with all parties, including the Tamil parties. That is one part.

Secondly, when the Secretary-General underlined the importance of an accountability process for addressing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, the Government agreed to it.

These are the two documents: the Resolution of 2009 and the Joint Communiqu. And there is of course, the supplementary commitment made by the Government to the Darusman Committee. When you met the Darusman Committee, they specifically committed themselves to the fact that those who are involved - the security force

1063 1064

personnel who are involved in violation of human rights law - can be tried under the court-martial or under the general law, by the civil courts of the country. So, these are commitments made by the Government. We, in the Opposition, did not ask for it, but we welcome the Resolution of 2009 as well as the Joint Communiqu by the Secretary-General and the Government.

We have to ask one question by looking at the charges that are being made. What made you to make these commitments? Kindly tell this to the House. Everyone is saying that we are traitors, we are not supporting the Government and we are not giving them help. What made you to make these commitments? In 1991, President Premadasas Government did not agree to international inquiry. But, we allowed the Amnesty International, the Human Rights Watch - you name it, anyone - to come and inquire it by themselves. So, though we did not accept the principle, we allowed all the human rights agencies to come in. I was the one who was responsible for handling them.

In 2003, we agreed to a political solution. We asked for help in reconstructing Sri Lanka. But, I said, We cannot agree to join the International Criminal Court. We have not yet finished the war. We have only a ceasefire. So, now, we have changed that and we have come to the other way in 2009. Okay, you did it. I am not complaining. But, I think the country wants to know what made you to make these commitments.

Then, thereafter, you appointed the LLRC and the LLRC brought out its Report. The TNA gave evidence before the LLRC but the UNP did not. But, we have accepted many of those recommendations. Now, the issue is, why are you not implementing these recommendations? We have given you all the assistance. We said, we are prepared to sit down and let us start implementing the LLRC recommendations to which Opposition parties have given their observations. We are ready to start on it. I mean, we do not want to rush to Geneva. Again, I must say that last time I advised Hon. Sampanthan that he should not go to Geneva. He did not go to Geneva. I thanked him and I must apologize to him that though I tried to move to get the Government to agree to the formula we had of the TNA coming into talks, that was not accepted. Again, feeling rather shy, I told him, Sam, I do not know. This time I could not help but it is up to you to decide. I do not think that you should go to Geneva. He did not go to Geneva. I must thank him again in this House. It is useless attacking the TNA. The Leader of the TNA did not go to Geneva.

We are asking the Government, - I am happy that the Hon. Minister in charge is here - though I may not be able to stay in the House for too long, you could tell me and all my Colleagues here - why you are you not working with

us to implement the recommendations of the LLRC Report? After all, in the Resolution of 2009, you all agreed to bring about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka based on a consensus. What is the consensus if you keep all of us out? You are not implementing the recommendations of the Report and day by day, the situation in the North gets worse.

We were told that the Government did not want the Thirteenth Amendment. You did not want to hold the Northern Provincial Council Election, but now you have agreed to hold the Northern Provincial Council Election. That was conveyed, I think, by third parties to the movers of the Resolution. So, at least, you are holding the Northern Provincial Council Election. Then, why do you not want to implement these recommendations?

Is it that you do not like the independent commissions and you do not want the strengthening of democratic institutions, which the LLRC Report recommended? Now, while you are holding the Northern Provincial Council Election, I would ask the Minister, are we going to have the Independent Police Commission, not this Parliamentary Council and its Police Commission? Are we going to have the Independent Election Commission? Can we go back to the Seventeenth Amendment? There is still time; it is before September. Let us pass some laws; let us start from there; let us start with the independent Commissions. There is still time. What is the use of holding the Northern Provincial Election without having the independent commissions?

I got a taste of it when I went there. The army personnel came; there was a special squad; they came in civvies. They came to disturb and the people who were arrested were handed back to the army, and then the DIG said, he does not know what happened. The members of the army, the members of the security forces, have given me all the details. So, if that happened to me when there was no election, what chance do you have when you have provincial elections? So, I welcome the Governments commitment but to make it a lasting commitment, we should have the Independent Election Commission, the Independent Police Commission, and the Independent Public Service Commission. That is essential if we are to hold the Northern Provincial Election.

I will not take too much of time. I saw the Minister, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe has said, Navi Pillay has gone beyond the mandate. I am asking, why are you blaming Navi Pillay? I mean you all are the ones who gave them the mandate. You invited her into the house, you opened the door, you gave a desk, you gave a chair, you gave the papers, you put on the lights, you put the A/C and after she writes the report, you are complaining. I mean, you did everything; you called her in; you gave her all the powers. Now, what is the use of complaining? We can complain saying you went and gave all these powers to the Human Rights Council, but you cannot complain.

So, all I would like to say is, in this present situation we are in a difficult position. But, we are prepared to work with the Government to implement the LLRC Report to make it a reality. Let us start from there. Hon. Minister, then you can accept this offer. We have given proposals, but it must be a genuine consensus and a genuine participation because even if the Resolution is passed, there is time; we can show that we are interested in implementing. When I made this statement, I got abused all around but I made it in all seriousness. In my view, we are facing these issues because you are refusing to give a commitment to implement the LLRC Recommendations, to reach a consensus on the political freedom of this country. Why are you taking this step? If you take this step, if you agree with us, it will benefit all the people. Now, the only conclusion that I can come to is that you are willing to sacrifice the good name of the country just to hang on to power.

In the meantime, we have to remember while we are talking and debating here, there are hundreds of thousands of our citizens in the North who are still suffering. I have been there once or twice; I have seen the pathetic state. I feel ashamed to be a Sri Lankan. To have been born in the North of Sri Lanka is worse than having been born in Afghanistan. That is all I can say. But, we are still prepared to make this offer. If you will accept it, let us sit down and see that there is genuine co-operation to implement the LLRC Report.

[3.13 p.m.] () .. ( ) ( () .. - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs)

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, what we are debating is a legislation to amend Section 32 of the Resettlement Authority Act. This is an Authority which came into existence on the 10th of April, 2007, and the period of office of the Authority in terms of the existing law comes to an end on the 10th of April 2013; that is very shortly. The Hon. Minister gave us an account of what had been accomplished so far with regard to the resettlement of internally-displaced persons. It was admittedly a very complex task because at the time the hostilities ended in May, 2009, there were approximately 296,000 people who had been displaced by the conflict.

I do not think that anyone will seriously contest that a very substantial amount of work has been done. This needs to be consolidated. There is further work to be done although the process is almost complete and the purpose of amending Bill is to secure for the authority three more years within which to complete its work.

Now, resettlement of internally-displaced persons was one of the most significant challenges which the country was confronted with when a conflict which has spanned three long decades came to an end. So, that was work which had to be given priority; it had to be undertaken as an essential aspect of the initiatives that were necessary for a society from transition, from conflict, to peace and stability.

The Hon. Leader of the Opposition referred to some developments in the Human Rights Council. As the countrys Minister of External Affairs, on a day when the vote is due to be taken in Geneva, I would like to deal with some of the broader issues involved particularly because the Hon. Leader of the Opposition made some reference to them. I would like to take this opportunity, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, to express my thoughts on some of these issues.

The first point I would like to make is with regard to those who sponsored the Resolution as of this morning. That is very significant. There are 32 countries -

( ) (An Hon. Member) Or more. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Yes. Of course, other countries will be added to the list. - [Interruption.] The Hon. Leader of the Opposition was not interrupted when he made his views and when the Government is speaking on an important issue, I think the least we can expect is that there would be an atmosphere of seriousness in this Chamber.

Sir, the original Resolution that was presented in the Human Rights Council had 32 sponsors. Of the 32 sponsors 29 countries were from Europe; 29 out of the 32 were from Europe. Then, there were two countries from North America. That is, the United States and Canada. The only other country that was sponsoring the Resolution initally - now, I think that is important, of course, the other countries would join later. Of the 32 countries that sponsored the Resolution, all except one, came from Europe or North America - was Saint Kitts and Nevis. So, the point I am making is that these sponsors came, not at all, from Asia; not one country from the Continent of Asia, not one from Africa. Nobody from the Caribbean except Saint Kitts and Nevis. So, the geographical dimension of the countries that were sponsoring the Resolution say something about the focus, where it is coming from, the motivations. The Human Rights Council is a body that was set up by the General Assembly of the United Nations and its conspicuous characteristic, of course, is its global character. It is the Human Rights Council which encapsulates the vision of

1067 1068

the entire world with regard to human rights and this is a Resolution about Sri Lanka, a country in South Asia. Surely, is it not remarkable that not one country from any of these continents sponsored the Resolution? So, I would like that to be reflected upon by this august Assembly because I think it is a circumstance that is more than relevant. I think it is a circumstance that is very important.

Then, when a resolution is brought, it must be objective; it must be fair. That is very essential. If I am criticizing you and if you want to take my criticism seriously, you must in your own conscience feel that there is substance and justice in this criticism. That is human nature. Nobody is going to respond constructively to criticism if the person to whom the criticism is addressed sincerely believes, on substantial grounds, that the criticism is unjust and totally unfounded.

Now, I want to tell this honourable House that on the first occasion, when the Representative of the United States met me and indicated that a Resolution would be moved in Geneva on this occasion, I was categorically told that this is a procedural resolution, it is not a condemnatory resolution; it is a resolution that is going to be balanced. I was specifically told that the Resolution would recognize the positive achievements of the country; what had been accomplished on the ground. I was told that reference would be made to those positive elements. The Resolution, I was told, was going to recognize what had been done and subsequently draw attention to what needed to be done. So, it is in that sense that I was told by the Representative of the United States that this was going to be a balanced Resolution; positives and negatives. Both of these were going to find expression in the text of the Resolution that was going to be presented in Geneva. This was the categorical assurance that I was given.

However, when we saw the draft, it became clear that there was not one word of acknowledgement about the positive things that have happened. Nobody can possibly maintain that nothing positive was done. There maybe disagreements about whether it was enough; whether it happened soon enough but nobody can possibly gainsay the fact that there were positive achievements. I was categorically told that those would be recognized, but that did not happen, not one word. Subsequently, it is because of the immense pressure that was brought to bear on the mover of the Resolution by a large number of countries, it was entirely because of the intensity of that pressure, that grudgingly a lukewarm reference was made to the positive achievements of the country. A large number of countries spoke to the mover of the Resolution and said, This is not fair at all; this does not make sense; we cannot support this; this is entirely one-sided; you have to be factual; you have to recognize the reality of the situation. By all means, criticize what warrants criticism

but you must have, not the largeness or the generosity of heart but a basic sense of justice and fairness that would impel you to recognize what has been done and to acknowledge. It is because that point of view was so persistently and vigorously expressed by a large number of countries that belatedly and, as I say, grudgingly, some words were added to make reference to the positive achievements.

Now, that is not really the spirit in which we would like our friends to act. We are told all the time by those who move resolutions of this kind, We have only your best interest at heart; we have no other motivation. It is because we care about your welfare that we are resorting to actions of this kind". Surely, if that is the case, there must be even-handedness of approach, not a willful blindness with regard to what is demonstrably an accomplishment in exceedingly challenging circumstances. So, that approach, deliberately ignoring what has been done and focusing sharply and excessively on negative features, is not, to our minds, a hallmark of goodwill. I do not think that in our lives, from our friends and those who mean well, we expect that kind of attitude. So, this again is something very distressing, we notice, with regard to the manner in which events have moved during the last few weeks.

I also wish, Sir, to ask a question in all seriousness. We have seen the events that took place during the last few days. I would, in all earnest, request the mover of the Resolution to ask themselves, are they really pleased about the consequences they have produced? Not only within the shores of Sri Lanka but in neighbouring India, this Resolution has triggered a chain of events, a whole sequence of events which have played out during the last few days. Is it the case that those who moved the Resolution, who made a calculated, a deliberate decision to do so, when they look back on what they have done, in retrospect when they assess their own conduct in this matter, do they really feel that they have reason to be pleased? Are they satisfied with the consequences that they have produced on the ground? Has the Resolution helped? Has it brought about a benign, constructive and helpful situation? Has it been a positive influence or is it very much the contrary? Can there really be a serious division of opinion on that matter? Is it not the case that it has really served as a catalyst for dissention, for discord, for polarization and most regrettably, even a catalyst for violence? We have seen that. So, is that helpful?

I would ask the House to recognize that this is a matter that must be approached from a national perspective bereft of narrow partisan considerations. So, we all have seen what has happened during the last few days. Is it something that the movers can be pleased about? I am not for a moment suggesting that these tragic consequences were intended; I am not saying that. But, they were clearly foreseeable. When the decision was made to bring the Resolution, these consequences could

1069 1070

[ ( ) 3 3 . ]

2013 21

clearly have been anticipated, that they would trigger these developments. Now, we have seen what the cost has been and the cost has been exorbitant. What has it done to relations between Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu, which is the subject of the Adjournment Motion which will be moved this evening by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella? So, has the Resolution helped with regard to any of these matters or has it, on the contrary, brought about a highly inflammatory situation, a powder keg? Is that the way to set about it? Is that the manner in which we should embark upon a quest for a rational, logical and long-lasting solution to these vexed issues? Is that the right way to set about things?

The basic feature of the Resolution is a persevering attempt, an unrelenting attempt to internationalize this situation and to ensure that Sri Lanka keeps coming up over and over again for consideration by the Human Rights Council. In others words, to put us on the agenda regularly, at regular intervals for a long period. The Resolution calls upon the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights to present an "oral update" - that is the phrase used in the latest version, "an oral update" - on the Sri Lankan situation at the 24th Session in September this year and a comprehensive report followed by a discussion at the 25th Session in March next year. So, the Resolution seeks to bring about a situation in which Sri Lanka comes on the agenda in September this year and six months later, in March, 2013.

Surely, today, the world is full of problems. I will not mention examples. That would be invidious for me to do. But, there are situations in the world which are crying out for attention. But, it is Sri Lanka that is singled out for this kind of sharply focused consideration every six months. The Human Rights Council is a United Nations body that is expected to take a balanced, a rational view of the world. Now, is there no other problem in the contemporary world except Sri Lanka? This is one of the basic issues that the international community must seriously reflect upon and the international community does not consist just of a few countries. The feature of this situation that is immediately striking is the highly selective approach. There are situations in the world which are crying out for intervention, where people are being slaughtered everyday in large numbers. That is happening. Nobody can suggest that there is a humanitarian crisis of that kind in Sri Lanka.

This is a country at peace; the nation is stable after all the anguish and pain that it had to endure for three decades. It is a country that is settled. We are focusing on the economy and on social development. There is no violence; there is no war; there are no hostilities in this country. Nevertheless, ignoring all other situations which, surely, on any rational criteria, are far more worthy of immediate attention by the Human Rights Council - all that is forgotten - the searchlight is solely and exclusively on Sri Lanka. Why this degree of collectivism? Why this

subjective approach? Why this attitude that is so arbitrary and capricious? Does it smack of moral considerations? Can it seriously be suggested that this is an ethical issue? This is something that troubles our conscience. Is that the case? How can it possibly be the case? On any rational comparison, can it be said that among all situations on this planet, this is the one and only situation that calls for the sustained attention of the Human Rights Council in September this year, in March next year and indefinitely? Is that right? The resources of a country, the size of a country, whether the country can be bullied, are those the considerations that should govern decisions with regard to so vital a matter?

Is it not the case that other far more pressing situations cannot be taken up for consideration because of strategic considerations, because of political considerations, because of economic considerations? So, nothing can be done with regard to those matters. But, Sri Lanka is fair game; it is open season. Is that right? I am questioning the moral premise because all of this is presented as a matter of lofty, sublime ideals. People say these are absolute values which need to be upheld. Can that be taken seriously? Is it the truth? Does it approximate to anything resembling the truth? It is not. There is a great difference between what seems and what it is. The appearance, the manner in which this is dressed up, is a far cry from the reality. So, I will not labour that point much more because it is perfectly obvious that Sri Lanka is being selected for this kind of attention not because of the gravity of the problem, but for other reasons which have absolutely nothing to do with moral or ethical considerations and I say directly that they are considerations of a political nature.

Now, we are open. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition made that point effectively; we are open. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition is aware that we invited Navanethem Pillay to visit us, to see for herself, to be guided by the evidence of her own eyes, not to take at face value what the Government is saying, nor to be guided solely by our detractors, and that invitation was issued to her in writing under my hand 11 months before the Resolution on Sri Lanka was passed by the Human Rights Council in March last year; 11 months before that she had that invitation So, we were not trying to sweep anything under the carpet. We said, Madam, come and see for yourself. What was her reply? She said, Of course, I would be happy to come, but I think that my visit will be more productive after the LLRC Report is in the public domain". That was a very reasonable point of view which we unreservedly accepted. Only other circumstance that she mentioned is that she would like her visit to be preceded by a visit to this country by a technical team from her office, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and she said she would like to send Mr. Hanny Megally, one of her officers with some of his colleagues. The Government of Sri Lanka immediately accepted without

1071 1072

any reluctance or hesitation. Hanny Megally came here. We put at the disposal of that team every resource and facility that they requested and my Ministry has a letter from Navanethem Pillay expressing appreciation of the assistance that was rendered by the Government of Sri Lanka to the technical team headed by Hanny Megally that she sent to us. So, she has acknowledged that in writing; she has thanked us for all the assistance which we placed at the disposal of the team that she despatched to Sri Lanka. Why, then, is she not coming? Surely, there cannot be any objection to coming here to see for herself. We are not asking her to express a particular point of view, we are not asking her to commend the Government, we are asking her to come and observe the situation for herself, but she is not coming.

I also want to mention that when Mr. Hanny Megally went back to Geneva, the first thing he did was to brief a third party about the Sri Lankan situation. We do not think that that is right. After all, we are also Members of the United Nations System. We have been a Member since 1952. Countries, big or small, powerful or not, are entitled to equality of treatment at the hands of this global organization. Mr. Hanny Megally is an international public officer attached to the office of Navanethem Pillay.

But, what he did was, before he spoke to our Permanent Representative or indeed to Navanethem Pillay herself, he went and briefed a group of other countries at the residence of a Permanent Representative of yet another country. We do not think that that is at all fair and we do not think that that inspires confidence in the manner in which the Human Rights Council addresses these issues. Now, why is the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights shifting the goalpost all the time? When she first wrote to me in response to the invitation that I extended to her, she mentioned two matters: LLRC Report must be out, certainly, and her technical team must come, most certainly. Now, both those things have happened. Why is she now shifting her goalposts and procrastinating, trying to put off her visit? That is not right. So, these are some of the features of the behaviour of the Human Rights Council and indeed the Office of the Human Rights Commissioner that we are profoundly unhappy about.

I also want to make this point and I am sure the Hon. Members of the Opposition would agree with this. At the end of the day, these problems have to be resolved in keeping with the well-being of the people of our country. Surely, that must be the guiding and overriding consideration. These are difficult issues, issues that have accumulated over a long period. Now, as we put in place solutions that we hope will be just and fair by all the people who live in this country, the governing consideration must surely be the interest of the people of

this country. But, what has been happening during the last few days makes it abundantly clear that the governing motivations have almost nothing to do with this country. They have to do with political considerations elsewhere, stability of governments, all kinds of factors which are far, far remote from the well-being of the people of this country. Now, can we acquiesce in that situation? Can any responsible government of any political party be happy about a situation in which forces extraneous to the country, forces which are not committed to the well-being of this country as an objective that is paramount in itself, how can we possibly set about endeavouring to find a solution to this problem from that perspective? But, that is what is happening. Look at everything that is happening and has happened during the last few days. How much of it is connected with Sri Lanka and how much of it has really to do with developments in other countries? So, that is what has come to pass in consequence of this Resolution.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, now try to wind up, please. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) I will take a few more minutes, Sir.

Then, Sir, it is also my duty to tell this House about certain features of what is now going on in Geneva that we find particularly distressing. This Resolution tries to incorporate several other documents. One of these documents is a Report of this so-called Panel of Experts. Now, I want to stress that this is not an official United Nations document, it is a Report prepared by three people whom the Secretary-General appointed to advise him. He said that categorically to us. - [Interruption.] Yes. But, he said, "These are people in whom I have confidence and I am asking for their advice". Now, if you look at that Report carefully, - this is not my interpretation - the Report they say, contains horrific descriptions about things that are supposed to have happened. But, then they themselves say that these are not to be taken as facts, these are not to be taken as proven facts. They themselves say that. They say that in that Report. What is the probative value of a report whose authors, themselves, insist that the contents of the report cannot be taken as proven facts? It is also the case that that Report was prepared on the basis of testimony given by people who sought anonymity, for 20 years their identity cannot be disclosed.

So, these were people who were invited by the Panel to give evidence. They were hand-picked by the Panel and they gave their evidence on the basis of an assurance that their identity would not be revealed for 20 years. Does that conform to your basic notions of fairness and justice? There is so much talk of natural justice. Is that a

1073 1074

[ ( ) 3 3 . ]

2013 21

procedure for collecting evidence that conforms even at the basic level with the rudiments of fairness and natural justice? That is the Darusman Report and that is the report that is sought to be incorporated into this Resolution. Then, Navanethem Pillay, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, reiterates her call for an international investigation.

Now, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, she made this call for an international investigation seven days after the cessation of hostilities in May 2009. Just one week after the war ended, she made this call for an international investigation. What evidence did she have? On what basis did she make that call? Since then, doggedly and persistently, she has asked for an international investigation. But, was there material on the basis of which she could reasonably have been convinced of the need for an international investigation at the time she first wanted that? I also want to say that the Government of Sri Lanka has never, at any time, accepted an international investigation. We have never done that and we never will.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I will conclude very soon. There are many countries including countries in the neighbourhood which have traditionally expressed great unhappiness with country-specific resolutions. This has nothing to do with Sri Lanka because those countries see the danger of that precedent once it is established. It opens the door wide for all kinds of interventions which may not be at all compatible with the well-being of these countries. Now that has happened, a country- specific resolution.

Now, our position very plainly put is this. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, there are situations in life when you have to take a stand. What we have today is a conflict between parties. I think, Conflict is a wrong word. We do not want it to be a conflict. We want it to be based on goodwill and understanding. But, there is no comparison between the size and the strength of the mover and the country against which the Resolution is moved. But, it is important for the Government of Sri Lanka to make a point effectively and unambiguously. That is why we have said that we will call for a vote. We are not Members of the Human Rights Council but we will request that a vote be taken. That is important. Whatever the outcome, we want to make the point that this country has been very unfairly treated. There is no semblance of justice in what is being done. So, we cannot take it lying down. For what it is worth, we will stand up for all the world to see and say that this is horrendously unjust. It is very important to make that point so that the people of this country will see for themselves that their Government did everything in its power to resist a Resolution, which at its very core, its very essence departs fundamentally from the norms of equity and fair play. These are the thoughts that I wanted to articulate on this occasion, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. I would earnestly express the wish that the Hon. Members of this House, whatever

party they may belong to, would give their minds in a sprit of seriousness to the issues that are involved in this. It is not a question of being happy because of a feeling that the Government is embarrassed. There is much more to it than that.

The Government is not really embarrassed. We can handle this situation. But, what is its impact? Is this something that should happen? In your own conscience, can you be happy about this? Is it the way in which your motherland should be treated by the United Nations system? This is why many countries, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, are today convinced that the United Nations system is itself in need of a fundamental overhaul. Let us not forget that the Human Rights Council itself came into existence because of a firm conviction on the part of the General Assembly that its predecessor, the Human Rights Commission, was unduly politicized. We had the Human Rights Commission but the General Assembly was profoundly dissatisfied with the Human Rights Commission because of the perception that it was excessively politicized. It is because of that reason that action was taken by the General Assembly to do away with the Commission and to bring into existence, in place of the Commission, the Human Rights Council. But, today it is evident to the whole world that the Human Rights Council is every bit as politicized as its predecessor, the Human Rights Commission, ever was. Indeed, it is much more politicized than its predecessor. So, these are matters that require the attention of the Hon. Members of this House and I thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees.

[3.51 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Hon. Minister of External Affairs concluded with a question. He questioned, "Is this right? Can we be happy with the way our motherland is being treated by the United Nations system?". I would like to suggest that the more relevant and more serious question that must be answered is not that. It is, "Is this how our motherland should treat us who are also citizens of this country and merely because we are inferior in number, should the greater in number treat us as second class or worse, third class citizens of this country?" If you can answer that question in good conscience as you claimed, then, most of these issues can be resolved.

The Hon. Minister of External Affairs chose to speak in the Queens English; a language that he is familiar with. He is also equally or more familiar with his own mother tongue but today he chose to speak in English, a Western language. He is one who has benefited from Western education and even from Western scholarships. But, he chose to cast aspersions on Western civilization

1075 1076

counting the number of countries that he said have co-sponsored this Resolution. Even in that, I am saddened that he was not up to date. Perhaps, his Colleague in Geneva does not keep him apprised of what is happening there. He should have been there, not his Colleague. He has probably read the newspapers that said 32 countries have co-sponsored the Resolution, when in fact it is 43 countries. Hon. Minister, let me put the record straight. Forty three countries have co-sponsored the Resolution and your Colleague in Geneva obviously is not keeping you updated on what is happening there.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) I said, "recently". .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes. You are two days late. Obviously, you are not getting information. You are reading newspapers and gathering information.

Your complaint is about, "Who is sponsoring the Resolution?". Who sponsored the 2009 Resolution in which the Government of Sri Lanka gave all of these assurances? It is on the 2009 Resolution that the Resolution today is worded. It is on the 2009 Resolution that the Resolution passed on the 23rd of March last year was also worded. Who sponsored those Resolutions?

And, when the Resolution is carried today, you will be surprised to know that countries from all continents have supported this Resolution.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) How do you know that? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If you do not know, sit down. The Hon. Minister made an appeal to us not to disturb him when he was speaking. After he made that appeal, we did not disturb him - [Interruption.] He does not have the grace to tell his backbenchers to do the same to us - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please sit down. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) This is how you treat the minorities in this country. You claim a privilege - [Interruption.] You get all upset

when you are corrected. We respected you when you spoke and then did not say a word after you appealed to us to remain quiet when you spoke. But, you sit there dumbfounded when your backbenchers treat us like this. -[Interruption.] This is your problem. This is precisely the issue in this country. - [Interruption.] You think that because we are numerically a minority that we do not have a voice and we cannot speak. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

. . rose.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please do not interrupt the Hon. Member.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Arrogance. - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Absolute arrogance. You do not even know what is happening to your own community today. You are a purchased commodity.

. [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Sumanthiran, please go ahead with you subject. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, he is a purchased commodity. . [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

Sir, the Amendment that is being moved today is only to extend the validity period of the Resettlement Authority from six years to nine years. The Hon. Minister of External Affairs chose to speak on the Resolution in Geneva rather than on this Bill. I will speak on this Bill first and then deal with some of those matters that he raised as to what is happening in Geneva. Perhaps, he has not been given the forum there to give vent to his feelings and he has chosen this Parliament, which is the only forum that has been made available to him. So, although, not directly relevant, he dealt with those matters.

The Hon. Minister of Resettlement very correctly answered questions that were posed, while he was on his feet, by the Hon. Member for Hambantota from the UNP and revealed many truths. We have the greatest respect for the Minister of Resettlement. From the time he was appointed to that post, he has chosen and he has always been careful to include us and to consult with us. I remember the very next day he sent a note from there saying that he wanted to have discussions with us and he has acted in that good spirit. In that spirit, he answered truthfully the questions that were posed to him by the Hon. Member for Hambantota. He said that 470 houses have been built by the Government in four years. Utterly shameful! If that is your resettlement, surely three more years is not enough for you. You have built only 470 houses. Are you not ashamed to admit in this House to say that that is all you can do when there are over 250,000 houses that were razed to the ground? We have raised this from 2010, from the mini-Budget in 2010. What is the Government doing about this? We had to appeal to India. India promised 50,000 houses. Only 1,000 houses are in the process of being built.

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Hon. Member - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Please do not disturb. Because of the intererence of Minister of Industry and Commerce and another Cabinet Colleague of his from the North, even the implementation of the houses in the North have been so delayed that the beneficiary list could not be settled for so long, even after four years. We require another 49,000 houses. When are these going to be -

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, there is no point of Order. He can reply later if he wants. There is no point of Order in this.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) , 50,000 .

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I am sorry. That is not a point of Order. Hon. Sumanthiran, you carry on your speech. Keep the phone and carry on your speech. Are you recording?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, Sir. I just got the results of vote that has been carried in Geneva and I would like to inform the Hon. Minister of External Affairs the happy news that the Resolution has been carried with an overwhelming majority with only 13 voting against. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. Are you saying that as a Sri Lankan?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, and I will tell you why. - [Interruption.] Again, he is disturbing and the Chair cannot control him. - [Interruption.]

The Hon. Minister of Resettlement, during his speech, conceded that 52 houses were built down Madhu Road in the Mannar District. On 23rd of October, 2011, in this House, I placed a Report and I even gave pictures of those houses. So, I would like to ask the Hon. Minister one question about that. How many Tamil people have been given houses out of those 52 houses? Not one. I do not mind other communities being given houses. I am not against that. I think other communities - the Sinhalese who lived in the North - must come and live. We welcome them to come back and live. The Muslims who were very wrongly chased away from the North must come back and live and we support that process. In fact, my Party Leader has even given it in writing to India saying that Muslim persons must be given houses in the houses that they allocate. But, I am asking this question. Out of these 470 houses, in this one lot of 52 houses, I know that not even one Tamil family has benefited out of that. Why is this? Why do you treat the Tamil people like this? You do that and then you bitterly complain that the United Nations is passing a Resolution to promote reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka.

1079 1080

The Hon. Minister criticized the High Commissioner for Human Rights. This happened even in Geneva by his Colleague who was rude to the High Commissioner and at least one country protested in the Council itself that the Hon. Minister of Plantation Industries was rude to the High Commissioner. - [Interruption.] The Hon. Minister of Plantation Industries goes to Geneva while the Hon. Minister of External Affairs sits here. The Minister of External Affairs also should be careful; he constantly referred to the High Commissioner for Human Rights as Navanathan Pillay. She is not Navanathan Pillay. You must know that it is one of the basic tenets that you pronounce the name of a person correctly. That is how you respect that person. She is Navanethem Pillay and not Navanathan Pillay.

He said that she is shifting the goalpost. Having said that she is shifting the goalpost, later in his speech he conceded that seven days after the war ended, she called for international investigations. How is she shifting the goalpost then? On 26th of May, 2009 she called for an international investigation and in March, 2013 also she is calling for an international investigation. Where is she shifting the goalpost? And, if an international investigation was called for on 26th of May, 2009, what is the complaint that the Hon. Minister makes? Because His Excellency the President himself singed the Joint Communiqu with the Secretary-General of the United Nations in Colombo assuring that the allegations of violations of international law will be inquired into. So, it was there. Even your own President conceded that there were allegations that needed to be inquired into.

I want to say one word about the international investigation since such umbrage is being taken by the word international. There are credible allegations against both sides that fought the war. One is the LTTE and the other is the Government of Sri Lanka. Can you have an inquiry conducted by one of those accused persons? Can that ever be acceptable? Any inquiry must be independent. Nobody can dispute that.

Any inquiry must be independent. In this instance if the inquiry is to be independent, it must necessarily be international. How can you have a local inquiry when one of the accused is the Government of Sri Lanka and that has been conceded to by no less a person than His Excellency the President in the Joint Communiqu that he signed on the 26th of May, 2009.

He is talking about bullying; countries being bullied. Who is being bullied within the country? The Hon. Leader of the Opposition was in Jaffna for just one day. He recounted his own experience. People there are being bullied by your military intelligence personnel. They cannot have one meeting there.

Muslim women cannot walk on the streets of this country today in their traditional dress. In Manampitiya, a young girl with the habaya was walking and she was attacked. She has made a complaint to the Polonnaruwa Police.

On the day the Mattala Airport was opened, the same night a Church in Weeraketiya was attacked by a mob, unfortunately led by religious leaders, by Buddhist Monks. Then, they go and demonstrate before the Indian High Commission saying that two venerable monks have been attacked in Tamil Nadu. We condemn those attacks. We do not support that. No monk should be attacked in Tamil Nadu. But, who is complaining? Why are they not complaining about the Church being attacked in Weeraketiya. Look at your country before you look at the other countries. Why are you not going on processions that Muslim women are being attacked on the road? You do not go on processions for that. You only have to complain about other countries. Look at yourself, inside first. You put your house right. If you put your house right, no one else will ever be able to point fingers at you. You have this happening in your own country. You treat people who are numerically in the minority like dirt and then you have the brass to stand up and pontificate about international interference and call that "bullying". When you get a little bit of the taste of your own medicine, you are smarting. But, you cannot understand how much we feel being treated like dirt in this country. You talk about shifting the goalpost. What did your Government do? You started talks with us. You were in that delegation that talked with us. 10th of January 2011, 3rd of February 2011, 18th of March 2011, on all three times we gave proposals to you. You are the Government. You had nothing to say. You had no proposals to give. You could not even respond to our proposals. For five months and seven meetings, you came and sat there.

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Ratwatte) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) What is your point of Order, Hon. Lohan Ratwatte? ( ) (The Hon. Lohan Ratwatte) 84 (v) 3

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I will look into it.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That can be read and understood later. Some people take a long time to understand.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Sumanthiran, now wind up please. Your time is over.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will take five minutes from the Hon. Vinayagamoorthy.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) All right. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) My time cannot be taken by persons who cannot read and understand the Standing Orders.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Speak on the subject, please. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Their slowness cannot take my time out. You must study and come.

In resettlement, what is the progress that you have made? The LLRC Report in paragraph 9.134 very specifically states that the Government must disengage security forces from all civil administration related activity as rapidly as possible. That has not been done. It is because the security forces have not been disengaged and it is because they occupy land that people are not being resettled. The Hon. Minister for Resettlement was very forthright.

Talking about Kepapulavu he said, "I have no authority. When they are able to be resettled there, I can do that. But now they are in temporary places. Why are they in temporary places? Because there is a large military cantonment that has been built in Kepapulavu and people are being kept out. What has happened in Mullikulam? The Hon. Minister from the Mannar District

will know what has happened in Mullikulam. What has happened in Valikamam North? What has happened in Sampur? Why are people not being resettled? When His Excellency the President signed the Joint Communiqu on the 26th of May, 2009, the second assurance that he gave was that all displaced persons will be resettled in their own places before the end of that year; that is 2009. In 2013, you come to this House and want to extend the period of the Resettlement Authority for another three years. Four years after His Excellency the Presidents deadline ended, you come and ask for another three years for the extension of the Resettlement Authority.

What is the Resettlement Authority doing? Nothing. It is a Presidential Task Force - PTF - that controls everything. There is no Resettlement Authority. I do not know why the Minister for Resettlement wants to extend the period of this Authority? Resettlement is not complete, he concedes. Two hundred thousand people are still not resettled.

( ) {Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Sumanthiran, please wind up now. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am concluding, Sir. Even the others who are said to be resettled only have to look at the carpet roads and the bridges and know that the Government has money to do all that, but will not spend on priorities such as their own shelter and their livelihood. Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah. You have 10 minutes. Before that, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Udith Lokubandara to take the Chair?

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) I propose that the Hon. Udith Lokubandara do now take the Chair.

IDPs 3 IDPs With this last batch of IDPs, the Government has resettled a total of 242,449 IDPs. A further 28,398 have chosen to live with host families in various parts of the country. A batch of about 200 families living with host families has been resettled with their consent in their original habitat in Mullaitivu in September 2012. At the conclusion of resettlement, 7,264 IDPs had left the camps on various

grounds and did not return while a further 1,380 sought admission to hospitals. The resettlement of the final batch of IDPs marks a day of historic significance as the resettlement is now complete and there are no more IDPs or IDP camps in the island.

3 he further states, Based on Government statistics compiled by UNHCR, as of 31st December 2012 there were 93,447 displaced persons. The Minister himself recognises the old case load of IDPs in his Opening Statement to the Working Group of the Universal Periodic Review on Sri Lanka on 1st November 2012.

( ) (The Presiding Member) 3 3 The next speaker is the Hon. D.M. Swaminathan. You have 11 minutes.

[4.59 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Mr. Presiding Member, today we are discussing the extension of the Resettlement Authority for a further period of three years. Really speaking, the word "resettlement" should not be debated in this Parliament. It is the responsibility of the Government to resettle the people who have been displaced by the war. The war was created and now it is over but the people are still displaced. It is the duty and obligation on the part of the Government to see that the replacement and resettlement of these people are done in a genuine manner.

Today, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, Minister of External Affairs spoke in Parliament. He is a Minister of great knowledge and learning.. But, I was really taken by surprise when he raised certain issues in Parliament today questioning as to why the UNHRC is bringing these resolutions against Sri Lanka, this small country, in such an aggressive manner. Sir, Sri Lanka maybe a small country but it has got its own inhabitants. The UNHRC cannot be influenced. It is a United Nations body with certain fundamental principles laid down under the UN Charter and those fundamental principles are laid down by authorities who are knowledgeable and the issues that have been placed before UNHRC is not something that can be canvassed. If there has been a genuine problem against the fundamental rights of the people of this country, it is the authority and it is the UNHRC that will have to look into this position.

If you look at the Sri Lankan history after the war was over, there were certain fundamental issues, the LLRC Commission that was appointed by the Government has forwarded its report to the Government, but it has not been enforced to a great extent. That is one issue. In fact, the LLRC Report itself refers to the enforcement of the Thirteenth Amendment. Then, the question arises about the independence of Judiciary and the other Commissions that should be there to protect the fundamental rights of this country have not been introduced. Then, the extension of the President's term of office that he can continue to be in power without any limitation. These are the fundamental issues that have been considered by the UNHRC. That is the basis of this whole resolution that was considered by the United States. The resolution that was brought forward today, fortunately or unfortunately, has been passed with 25 Members supporting it, 13

1101 1102

2013 21

Members against it and eight Members abstaining from it. There is no reason for this. In fact, if we had fundamentally studied these issues, if we respect the international authority, if we do respect the other countries in this world, we will not come to this situation. We are facing a severe problem in this country. We do not know what the resolution is going to be, what the repercussions will be and what the reaction of the resolution is going to be to this tiny country. We do not know what will be our economic situation in future years to come. These are the things that have to be answered by the Government of Sri Lanka.

When we talk about resettlement, just because you take certain IDPs out and resettle them or keep them in some other place of living, that does not mean resettlement. Resettlement means that you have to give them some sort of habitation and a formal way to live. There should also be a way of living and there should also be food for them to eat. I think the Hon. Minister, who is respected by this Government as well as the Opposition, said that there are only 437 houses built for the last four years. If these statistics are correct, what are we talking about?

Even the UNHRC has the right to consider what the human rights position is, as far as Sri Lanka is concerned. Are they right or are they wrong? Let us be but fair in what we are trying to do. That is the reason why we are being questioned. If we, as a nation, had a proper foreign policy and if we respected all the foreign countries alike, we would not be in this situation. We, as a nation, respect only certain countries like China and a few others which are giving us aid. If that is going to be the foreign policy of this country, we would face problems. I am sure our learned Minister of External Affairs is capable of advising the Government on much more graver issues than what we are facing today.

Sir, the following are the fundamental issues that are coming up. When the Leader of the Opposition of India, Madam Sushma Swaraj, came to Sri Lanka to see the situation, the Government said that by July, 2011 the entire resettlement would be over. But, up to now, there are so many families which have not been resettled in accordance with the rules and regulations of resettlement. As I told you earlier, taking a person from Vavuniya and putting him in Thimbili is not reasonable. The people who had been in Vavuniya were fishermen. But, they had been put in Thimbili, where there is no habitation or fishing facilities. They had been brought and put into a jungle and are supposed to live there. If that is going to be your policy of resettlement, what is this country going to face in the future to come? That is the issue. These are the fundamental factors to be considered; these are the matters to be considered by the Government of Sri Lanka. It does not matter whether they are Tamils, Sinhalese or Muslims. You are quite right, we all have lived together.

We, as Tamils, Sinhalese and Muslims, have lived together. I was educated at Royal College. My best friends were all Sinhalese. There was no problem; there was no difference of opinions. There were no fundamental issues as far as the Tamils, the Sinhalese and the Muslims were concerned. Those Bills were brought in by the government machinery at that time to gain popularity. The Sinhala Only Bill of 1956 and all other subsequent Bills that were brought in this country just to get the popularity of the people, to get peoples votes and to win elections have now marred the entire community of Sri Lanka. As very correctly said, we all have to live together. There is no idea of living divided as Tamils, Sinhalese and Muslims. We do not mind the Sinhalese going and staying in Jaffna, but we cannot give up our rights in Jaffna. We cannot allow the Tamils, who have been living in Jaffna, to be removed. We have to give them their lands.

We cannot let other people like the armed forces to carry out the administration of Jaffna. The administration of Jaffna should be carried out by a civil administration, not by the armed forces. Today, the armed forces are running the administration of Jaffna. Is this what we are exactly asking for? The administration of the country should be in proper form. We cannot allow the army to run the administration of Jaffna. That is what we are saying. That is why the UNHRC is jealously looking at you. It is not because of any other rights. If we do practise the correct principles and protect the political rights in this country, we would not be questioned by any authority. As you correctly said, we are a tiny country in this world, but the reason for them to check what we are doing is because we are not protecting the human rights. If you violate the principles of human rights, definitely, we are going to face a grave situation in this country, which can affect us internationally, economically and otherwise.

Thank you.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Sir, I think I have about 15 minutes. ( ) (The Presiding Member) No, you have got only five minutes.

[5.18 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Presiding Member, I was listening to the speakers who spoke before me and I thought I was in Geneva and not in the Parliament of Sri Lanka because a lot was said about what had been happening in the UNHRC.

Today, we are taking up the Resettlement Authority (Amendment) Bill to extend its term by another three years. As far as resettlement is concerned, Government says that 95 per cent of the displaced people have been resettled. This is not correct. According to the UN Report, 117,888 persons have not been fully resettled in their own places.

Now, take Keppapulavu, the village which is by the side of Vattapalai. About 250 families of that village are not allowed to go and resettle there. People now living in

Vattapalai, they have got their agricultural lands in Keppapulavu but they are unable to go and do their cultivation in Keppapulavu. It is the same in Mullikulam They are not allowed to go and resettle there. As far as Valigamam North is concerned, there are 24 villages and 28,270 persons have not yet been resettled there. When His Excellency the President was presiding at the DDC meeting in Jaffna, I handed over to him a memorandum giving the particulars of persons to be resettled. Then, he asked me whether those figures were correct. I said that I got those figures from the Divisional Secretary and they can check it from him. Now, Major General Hathurusinghe says that all the figures are incorrect. What we now want is full resettlement of these 28,270 displaced persons. Why do you not give us at least a civilian rule in Jaffna? For how long you want us to be under the army rule? Is Major General Hathurusinghe giving orders to the GA, police and everybody? As regards 50,000 houses that India promised, you have been unable to give them a list so far.- [Interruption.] You have not given them that.

So, I kindly request the Government to resettle these 28,270 people in 24 villages in Valigamam North immediately because what I understand is that, that area is being taken over by the army to set up army camps. If you are not allowing these people to go and reside in their own houses, why do you find fault with the UNHRC when they bring in a Motion against you? So, we request the Government to resettle these people in those places from where they were displaced. That is the UN principle.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have one more minute. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Okay.

Then, I apologise to the Muslims for what has happened to them in Jaffna. We never sent them out.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Why were you silent then? . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) No, we were not silent.

1109 1110

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Why not? When the LTTE gave a 24-hour ultimatum and told the Muslims to leave, you were silent. Why were you silent? Tell us today. None of your Tamil Members spoke against that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) I apologise for what they have done. - [Interruption.] We are prepared to - [Interruption.] Let the Muslims come back. We will accommodate them.

Thank you very much.

[5.55 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Deputy Speaker, today, we are debating the extension of the life of the Resettlement Authority Act, No. 9 of 2007. This Act was passed in 2007 when the conflict in the Eastern Province was concluding, and there was a need to resettle the people who were displaced during that war. After six years, now we are extending it further for another period of three years and this is four years after the conclusion of the war, including the Northern Province.

However, even today, though the Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, who spoke before me, said that 60 per cent of the housing needs in Kilinochchi have been attended to, he is still speaking on the planned activities of the Indian housing scheme. The Ministry of Resettlement told us in December that as many as 87,000 fully-damaged houses and 27,000 partially-damaged houses have to be reconstructed. Out of this, though I do not have the figures, I have been told by the Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees who spoke before me that 9,000 houses have been completed so far. That means, there is a further 105,000 houses to be completed and out of this, India is to complete 35,000 completely-damaged houses and 5,000 houses, which were partially damaged. So, if you deduct that 40,000, we still have 74,390 houses to be constructed. India has pledged Indian Rs. 13 billion, which is about Sri Lankan Rs. 32 billion for the construction of these houses. This offer was made when our President went on a State visit to India, to New Delhi. The Prime Minister of India offered 50,000 houses, out of which 1,000 have been built; 49,000 houses remain to be built with 9,000 houses going to be built in the Eastern, Central and Uva Provinces.

So, with these 40,000 houses, the number of houses to be built will come down to 74,000. If what the Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees said was true, then there will be a further 65,000 houses to be built. Each house that will be built by India will cost approximately Sri Lankan Rs. 650,000. The Government of Sri Lanka said that they were allocating Rs. 375,000 for each house in their housing programme. Even at that price, for 65,000 houses, you need nearly Rs. 25 billion. When is the Sri Lankan Government going to make its commitment to our own people? Are we still waiting for India or for other people to do it? What is the commitment of this Government to our own citizens? This is the question that arises.

It is very saddening to note that the Government has relocated the people from the camps that they were living in soon after the war, in their villages. That means, those people have been relocated or they have returned to their home areas or the villages of their own. But, they have

1119 1120

not been resettled as such. To be resettled, you should first have a roof above your head, means of income and then, the necessary facilities for you to live a normal life. No, none of these are available. People are living primitive lives: some of them are still living under tarpaulin tents; some are living under tin-roofed huts in such hot, arid conditions. This is something that the Government is just ignoring, looking away. This will not solve the problems of these people or help in the reconciliation that we all expect to have in this country.

The UNHRC today, has passed the US Resolution with 25 votes against 13. Last year, it was 24 against 13 and the Government added the abstentions as favourable to them and said that they lost only by one vote. They have lost by four this time. I do not know how they are going to explain as to why the gap is becoming larger. If they had done their job as they keep saying, I am sure the world would not react to us in this manner. As far as resettlement is concerned, even the US Resolution says that resettlement has been done. They also, I believe, accept the criteria of the Government for resettlement. If the fact that these people have only been relocated and not properly resettled came up, this 25 may have been 30. So, it is so unfortunate that this is the situation we are placed in today .

There is a sort of unofficial censorship in this country. There are a lot of people who watch international news media through the Dialog TV. For the last three days, we have been unable to watch the Sun TV, the Kalaignar TV or the Raj TV because the Dialog TV has been blacking out all the news channels that are telecast from India.

Is there no right for our people to watch media, to be informed? Is there no right for our people to watch news items of their choice? Are we living in a democracy or in a dictatorship? This is the question that arises.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have only one minute left. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Okay. I spoke to Dialog TV and they said that they have been given orders by the Government. I said, Please give me that in writing but they are scared to do it because they do not believe in the democracy that we live in.

As far as the Indian housing scheme is concerned, there were some questions raised by one Member who says he is in the Opposition, but he is a person who voted for the Eighteenth Amendment. There is a website of the

Indian High Commission where the Indian Housing Project has been given in detail. They have given the criteria for selection of the beneficiaries. They have given a scheme that is very transparent so that any person who is selected or not selected can be challenged or can file an appeal. Though the Hon. Member who spoke before me said that 7,000 odd houses or 8,100 houses have been built in Kilinochcdhi, the schedule of activities that are given in the website says that the launch of the project on the ground in all five districts will be on the 2nd October, 2013, the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi. Further, they have also very transparently put out on this website the responsibilities of the Government of Sri Lanka.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, please wind up. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I am concluding. They have listed 21 items as responsibilities of the Government of Sri Lanka. I do not know why they have made it so transparent. It maybe because they do not trust the Government of Sri Lanka which has been bluffing on the Thirteenth Amendment and the speech of the Indian Representative at the UNHRC also was on the promises made by the Government of Sri Lanka on the Thirteenth Amendment. It is unfortunate that our Government is not trusted by the international community. It is a shame!

Thank you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

. 3 3 3 overwhelmingly voted for President Mahinda Rajapaksa. 3 3 Sir, history records that the most treacherous, the most unpatriotic and the most anti-national speech ever made in this Legislature was by the Hon. Sumanthiran this morning. The Tamil community would hide their heads in shame listening to him when so audaciously and unashamedly he declared in this House that he felt happy and rejoiced that The Geneva Motion was voted overwhelmingly.

I am telling you Sir, eminent Tamil leaders like Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan and Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam fought for the rights of their people, the Tamil people. They espoused their cause but they were patriotic. Even these two leaders went to England at that time and argued the case so ably against the British Colonialism. That was the type and the calibre of Tamil leaders that we have had in this country.

Now, Sir, I may say this. The Hon. Sumanthiran, born in this country, drinking the water of this country, eating the rice produced in this country and breathing the free air of this country has the audacity to say that the Motion was "overwhelmingly voted". " " 3 See, where is this "overwhelming voting?" Sir, 25 countries voted for the Motion against Sri Lanka while 13 countries voted against. What are those countries? They are: Congo, Mauritania, Indonesia, Kuwait, Maldives Pakistan, Qatar, Thailand, UAE, Ecuador, Venezuela, Uganda and Philippines. Eight countries abstained. What are those countries? They are: Angola, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Japan, Kazakhstan and Malaysia. So, 8 plus 13 is 21. It is a very thin majority. Countries who did not vote for them are with us. Your enemies are our friends. That is the way that you must calculate and nine countries who voted for us, for Sri Lanka, against the Motion are Muslim countries. Even last time, in Geneva, Muslim countries overwhelmingly - use the word there "overwhelmingly - voted for us. I must pay tribute to the Hon. Minister of External Affairs, the able Minister. I have been with him to other countries with Presidential Delegations. How masterly are the lectures that he gives which moves those State leaders and members of various delegations! Also, I will be failing in my duty if I do not place on record my deep appreciation of the work well done by the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe at the Geneva talks ably assisted by Ravinath Ariyasinghe and other

1139 1140

officials. That is the position today, Sir. Therefore, I would only tell the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella not be an anti-patriotic.

Now, what is happening in South India? The students are misled there. The students of Loyola College are misled. Loyola is a College that came and played cricket with Zahira College under Dr. A.M.A.Azeez at that time. We would invite the students of Loyola College to come again and play here. I must also stress the point that the people of Tamil Nadu - all the people there - are not against us. They are very great friends of ours. Look at Dr. Subramanian Swamy, the Leader of the Janata Party. He has put the case very well and as a result his house has been stoned.

Is this the democracy exercised in Tamil Nadu, I am asking? What has happened to Jayalalitha and Karunanidhi? They are before courts on bribery and corruption charges. Let the courts there decide; these are the people you are trying to get help from.

I also want to quote one of our greatest statesmen and leaders in this country, Dr. M.C.M Kaleel. This is recorded in the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation and you could get a copy of this from the able Chairman, Mr. Hudson Samarasinghe. What did Dr. Kaleel say in 1982?

I am always and will continue to say that Ceylon should be a single nation, a united nation with the different communities, different religions and different parties. They can all co-exist without any trouble like a jewel with so many facets. See on one side you can have rubies, the other side you can have diamonds and other side sapphires, like a jewel. Ceylon, we can have one Ceylon as a single jewel where the different facets composed of the Buddhists, Sinhalese, Muslims, Hindus, Christians and so on all jointly forming a single United Nation.

That is the "Ceylon United Nation", not the United Nations in New York that wants to bring this Government down. Dr. Kaleel further states, I quote:

That is my view and the Muslims should always stand by first and foremost united, they should stand not divided into this and that but as far as politics is concerned they can use their personal convictions."

That is a different matter. His leader was that great patriot and nationl leader, the Hon. Dr. T.B. Jayah. Great socialist leaders like the Hon. Philip Gunawardena who was also tutored by Dr. T.B. Jayah, fought for national independence. I would now ask some of the UNP Members not to go to India and to other countries carrying tales against Sri Lanka. We will stand as a united nation. No power on earth would defeat our will and the will of no less a person than His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. R. Yogarajan. You have four minutes.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I think it is a very appropriate Motion that the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella has moved. It is very important that the Government of Sri Lanka establishes a relationship with the people of Tamil Nadu who consider the Tamils in Sri Lanka as their brothers. It is very unfortunate that our pilgrims, our

students, our sportsmen have been today subjected to harassment in India. I issued a statement to the Indian media and said that it is against the culture of hospitality of the Tamil people to treat people who have come to their home in this manner. But, I do not blame them. When they see media reports on the conduct of the war and the conduct of this Government since the war, those people are becoming emotional and acting in this manner. The Hon. Ajith P. Perera said that in 2009, soon after the war, we did not have such a situation in Tamil Nadu. Even during the war we did not have such a situation in Tamil Nadu. This is all because of the way you treat the people in the North and East today. The whole world says, "the war is over, reduce the presence of the armed forces; restore democracy within the North and the East". Even today, you have two former commanders of the armed forces as Governors only for the North and the East but not for any other province in the rest of the country. It is the Commander of Jaffna, Major General Hathurusinghe who is issuing all political statements today.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) It is unfair. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is very unfair. It is true, Hon. Azwer. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) What you are saying is unfair. He is the Governor. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) An army officer has no political role. Why is he issuing these statements? This gives the feeling that there is a military authority that is trampling the people, the Tamil people in the North and the East. The only way for you to establish a rapport with the people of Tamil Nadu as a Government is to concede to a reasonable political solution to rehabilitate those people in a sincere manner. Give them housing, give them all the facilities required for life, look after their livelihood and bring them out of the poverty that they live in today. That is the only way that you can win over the Tamil people not only in Sri Lanka but also in India. Towards this, what are you doing? You are doing very little. I advised through my press release to the Indian media that the Sinhala people or the Sri Lankan people are not against the Tamils, but it is only the Government that is acting against the Tamil people and I asked them to pressurize their Government to act against Sri Lanka. The Indian Government has done it today. But, my message was, Do not act against the people of Sri Lanka when they come as your guests.

Thank you.
