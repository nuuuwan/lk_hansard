I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing away of His Excellency Hugo Chavez Frias, President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela after a prolonged illness. The Government and people of Sri Lanka join me in conveying our deepest condolences to you, members of the bereaved family and the government and people of Venezuela. The late President was a true son of Venezuela and as the leader was deeply committed to the welfare and development of his country, and a strong advocate for the developing world.

The late President Chavez was a friend of Sri Lanka and played a significant role in further enhancing our bilateral relations. I warmly recall my meetings with the late President, and his expressions of friendship and support for my country. At this difficult hour, our thoughts and prayers are with you, the family of the late President and the people of Venezuela.

The Government and people of Sri Lanka together with me stand in solidarity, as your country mourns the passing away of your great leader. Please accept Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Speaker, on behalf of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and on behalf of the United National Party, I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Chief Government Whip on the demise of the great leader, Hugo Chavez.

Thank you.

REGULARIZING THE DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION OF THE COCONUT INDUSTRY AND

COCONUT RESOURCES

[3.59 p.m.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I move the following Private Members' Motion:

" ."

Sir, I table* the Tamil and the English translations of that Motion to be included in Hansard.

, . . . , . . ; . , - , - . .

- .

. , .

The coconut palm which is called, Cocos Nucifera is a member of the palm family, Arecaceae. It is the only accepted species in the genus Cocos. The term "coconut" can refer to the entire coconut palm, the seed or the fruit, which botanically is a drupe, not a nut. Cocoanut is the archaic form of the word coconut. Derived from the 16th Century, in Portuguese and Spanish, "coco: means head or skull, because of the three small holes on the coconut shell that resemble human facial features, gives name to a bugbear.

Found throughout the tropical and subtropical areas, coconut is known for its great versatility as seen in many domestic, commercial and industrial uses of its different parts. Coconuts are part of the daily diet of many people. Coconuts are different from other fruits because they contain a large quantity of water and when immature, they are known as tender-nuts or jelly-nuts and may be harvested for drinking. When mature, they still contain some water and can be used as seed nuts or processed to get oil from the kernel, charcoal from the hard shell and coir from the fibrous husk.

Sir, therefore, coconut is a unique plantation in this country. Of course, coconut is grown in tropical countries, in a vast area of the Philippines and also along Kerala and Goa, in India. They make coir from the fibrous husk.

The endosperm is initially in its nuclear phase suspended within the coconut water. As development continues, cellular layers of endosperm deposit along the walls of the coconut, becoming the edible coconut "flesh. That is the kernel. When dried, the coconut flesh is called, copra. Copra . . . . .

Coconut oil is also widely used in soap and cosmetics. The clear liquid coconut water within is a refreshing drink. The husks and leaves can be used as material to make a variety of products for furnishing and decorating. It also has cultural and religious significance in many societies that use it.

"The Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa, Speaker of the Parliament of Sri Lanka stated that a mini coconut triangle has since been identified and emphasized that it is a matter of national importance that we make full use of this triangle. Then it will be possible to meet the full demand of coconuts in the country.

This was stated by him at the District-wise inaugural ceremony of Island-wide Kapruka Purawara Programme at Hambantota."

The inauguration ceremony was held recently. A large crowd was present. The Minister, Hon. Jagath Pushpakumara was also there in order to see what the Hon. Speaker is doing in his own area.

It further states:

"In the presently identified Mini Coconut Triangle in Tangalle, annual production of coconut is from 4000 to 5000 nuts. The Coconut Research Institute has commenced several researches to identify varieties of coconut suitable for the area which can ensure increased harvests. Hon. Speaker further explained with samples, the ways and means of deriving additional income from coconut related by-products..."

Mr. M.M. Mahusoon and Mr. P. Sivarajah of the Faculty of Agriculture of the Eastern University have stated: A field survey was conducted in the districts of Kurunegala and Puttalam in the 'Coconut Triangle', to study the goat production systems in the area and the problems faced. A random sample of 150 goat farmers, from 5 villages in the two districts, were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. They have further stated, "These farms differed in resource characteristics. Women are more involved in rearing of goats.

When we talk of the usefulness of women, domestically and also in cottage industry, I should like to remind you, Sir, in this House that I am wearing a badge in my lapel today. badge . . . The Director General of the Civil Security Department, Rear Admiral Ananda Peiris informed me at this meeting that about 650 acres of coconut plantation is now being cultivated in the Vavuniya and Kilinochchi Districts.

At the International Womens Day Ceremony held at Temple Trees today, some of the rehabilitated LTTE cadres - nearly 3,600 have now been rehabilitated - came there and gave a dance performance. It was very beautiful and well appreciated Sir, by all present.

No additives are used in manufacturing food products form coconut oil. Some times, aromatics are added to coconut oil but that causes no harm.

So, he has taken away our fear in the use of coconut oil. Also I must say -
