Petitions ordered to be referred to the Committee on Public Petitions.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, the Central Bank Report which should be tabled in this House - so far we have had four Sitting days for this month - has not been tabled in this House. This is a very serious issue. This is not the first time it has happened. I am sorry to say that this has not been looked into. This is the third time it has happened. This has become a ritual now. The Parliament should be treated with respect.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I will look into that. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Central Bank Report is of much debate. Not only that, now you are saying that you will look into it -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I appreciate you for bringing it to our notice. I will certainly take appropriate action and bring it to the notice of the Hon. Speaker immediately.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, there is an even more important matter. After all, the President of this country, by looking at the Central Bank Report before it is even tabled in Parliament, has said that the countrys economy has collapsed. He has basically said - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, that is not a point of Order. You may raise it - [Interruption.] I have given an Order. You can raise it - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I am on a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I have given a Ruling in respect of that point of Order.- [Interruption.]

1813 1814

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Do not externalize issues, Sir. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) No, I am not trying to externalize any issue. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) There is no democracy in the country. Sir, you are in that seat. Do not use it like Hitler's Chair.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, there are Standing Orders under which this House is guided. So, I have to see to it that this House is conducted as per the Standing Orders. If you have a question to ask, you can raise it at the appropriate time.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, Sir. I have a more fundamental question. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Leader of the Opposition, please. 2 ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Deputy Speaker, this House is governed by the Standing Orders, the Constitution as well as the conventions which are referred to in the Standing Orders and the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act. The power of Parliament to control public finance is well-known and also the Monetary Law has made provision for the report to be tabled in this House. Otherwise, we are functioning in the dark. This is not the first time this has happened. So, all we want to know is, in enforcing this convention what steps you are going to take. His Excellency the President has reported that the economy is about to collapse. We know that. But, anyway we cannot even debate on this. The President has informed the country but this House cannot take cognizance of it. I think there are a lot of details about non-performing loans of banks. The President makes an announcement that the economy is about to collapse but we cannot debate on it because the Central Bank Report is not tabled in Parliament.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, I have given a Ruling in respect of that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. My point of Order is yet to come, Sir.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, even after the President saying that the economy has collapsed, yesterday the Hon. (Mrs.) Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi said that she will increase the prices and that still there is a loss. So, that means, the country has collapsed even with a 50 per cent increase.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, that is not a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Why is that, Sir?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You can raise it at the appropriate time.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Do you say that what the President has said is an untruth?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I am not here to answer for what the President has said. I am here to conduct the affairs of this House. Please do not allow others to look at our Parliamentarians as a pack of jokers.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I think they have simultaneously already established it.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. You, from the Chair, are saying that -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) 1 ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am on my point of Order, Sir.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) 1 ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, I am on my point of Order, Sir.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I have given you an opportunity to raise your point of Order and I have given a Ruling. 1

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) As you are asking with decorum, I ask Question No. 1, Sir.

. . rose. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . 2 ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, the media is under a duty to have an accurate reporting of the proceedings of this House. In that context, I bring to your notice how the proceedings of the House on 10th April, 2013 had been reported in the Daily Mirror of 11th April, 2013 under the heading Army men in civils attack dissenters referring to what I have said. It purports to state, I quote:

The Speaker made these remarks after Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremasinghe alleged that a top military officer based in the north kept a separate squad dressed in civilian clothes to attack people whose politics he disapproved of. Mr. Wickremasinghe named the military officer in the House.

There is no name given here. I did refer to this. I referred to the conduct of a group that operates under Major General Hathurusinghe. I do not go into the facts of those because the Hon. Speaker had ordered the Government to go into it. But, The Island of that day has stated, I quote:

Ranil blames SF Commander, Jaffna

The Lankadeepa of the same day says, " 2 . 2 " .

Why is it that the Daily Mirror has deliberately misquoted what I said in order to protect an official? This is supposed to be an independent newspaper. If we have made a statement about anybody, we take responsibility in this House, for whoever it is. There is no means by which they can hold it back. So, I would like you to go into the matter.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Who is going to answer that? 2 ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) No, it is for you to take note of. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, I will take note of what you said and refer it to the Hon. Speaker for appropriate action.

Any disregard of or attack on the rights, powers and immunities of the House and its Members, either by an outside person or body, or by a Member of the House, is referred to as a breach of privilege

I would like to refer you to the Canadian case in 2002 when Arthur C. Eggleton, the Minister of National Defence was accused of deliberately making misleading statements in the House. Speaker Milliken ruled that the matter merited being considered by an appropriate committee because the House has been left with two versions of the event.

Now, the Hon. Member has given two versions. There are two versions in it. - [ Interruption.] One by the Hon. Minister and the other by the former Minister. - [ Interruption.]
