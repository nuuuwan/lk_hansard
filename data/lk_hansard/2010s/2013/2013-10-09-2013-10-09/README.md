[4.11 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Vasantha Senanayake) Sir, we have emerged as a nation out of the murky depths of a war-torn society, where bloodshed, loss of human life and trauma were everyday realities. We have undergone a metamorphosis, leaving behind a memory of destruction and terror and entered an era of peace, which no rational human being living in this country ever wants to witness again. The path to freedom from terror and conflict was won due to the astute leadership of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa and all those Sri Lankans who extended their support in thought, word and deed to His Excellencys great effort. His Excellency and his administration were able to envision a Sri Lanka that was free of fear, free of terror, free of war and free of despair. Despite the existent misconception that prevailed in our society, that guerilla warfare cannot be combated militarily. The Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa was able to, with courage and conviction, usher an era of peace.

Now, as a result, we are able to visualize greater goals. We are able to see and visualize ourselves not as a backward and insignificant nation in the global framework, but as an emerging wonder of Asia. Perhaps for those with narrow political agendas that promote self above national interests and indeed above anything and everything, it may be difficult to witness the transformation of our country from that of a backward third-world nation riddled with conflict into a peaceful and prosperous one. Again, this Government dares to dream the impossible dream. It aspires to rise like the proverbial Phoenix out of the ashes of destruction, to soar to greater heights in the spheres of economics, trade, education and international cultural exchange.

The imminent presence in Sri Lanka, and more specifically in Mirigama, - the electorate I serve as Organizer - of the University of Lancashire is another concrete achievement of the many achievements of this Government, in the light of educational and economic progress. I wish to extend my special thanks, a sincere "thank you" to this Government on behalf of myself and the people of Mirigama. With the increasing phenomenon of globalization, it is not possible to see ourselves as an isolated Island. The need to embrace universal languages

and to be aware of global trends is a necessity to progress in the international sphere. While today, languages like Spanish, French, Chinese and English are international languages, as Sri Lankans the natural and often automatic choice for us is English. There is a good reason for this. Our historical relationship with Britain, being a colony of Britain, has been for about 150 years, up to 1948. However, since 1948, we have remained equal members in the British Commonwealth of nations. We share with them many passions. We share with them the tradition of the Westminster Parliamentary system: tea, high-tea, cricket and even Shakespeare. The latter finds itself in our educational syllabi, and also sometimes in school concerts and national theatres. English is a familiar language spoken in varying degrees of fluency, but throughout the land. There would hardly be anyone today who understands no English at all. It is therefore, not surprising in this context, that many Sri Lankan students opt for higher studies in foreign universities. The UK universities, it must be mentioned, fall in many cases into a preferred category. I, being one such product in my younger days, believe that experience advantaged me, even though it must have financially disadvantaged my late father.

This measure, therefore, to introduce a British University education in Sri Lanka will not only save foreign exchange of Sri Lankans travelling out for this purpose, but also to secure the participation of international students in a regional context or in the context of the SAARC region thus bringing in foreign exchange. In the past, it was only the very affluent or the very exceptional few who had secured scholarships, who were able to avail themselves of a British University education. But, now the presence of the University of Central Lancashire in Sri Lanka will enable a segment of our society, who were formerly unable to afford such a luxury. It will also save expenditure of those who would inevitably travel overseas for education in terms of tuition fees, accommodation, living and incidental expenses. It will contribute to the GDP as well, as it is estimated that, when fully operational, 6,000 international students will be housed here apart from the 4,000 local students who are also expected. We envisage that many of these will be students of the SAARC region. This will benefit the students also because of the cost factor involved, as opposed to going to a university in England, where living expenses, tuition fees and other incidentals will be very high and in the case of regional students, living in Sri Lanka will also serve them with the added advantage that they will be living in a cultural environment that is similar to that of their home country.

Sri Lanka did enjoy a reputation once for academic excellence within the region. This was particularly true in the pre-war decades in Sri Lanka, where many regional students opted for local schools to instil the desired educational standards. The decline in English, however, due to narrow-sighted policies of some governments, the

1147 1148

war having caused stagnation in education as much as everything else in Sri Lanka, and in some cases, the total disruption of education caused Sri Lanka to fall back. It did not help our cause that while we, as a nation, were stagnant, other regional nations, like in India, improved greatly their institutions of academia, and the quality of education offered in a country like Australia, attracted regional students who had better options to consider. Our position as a premier educational hub in the region, I think, can be salvaged if we, as a nation, have a progressive outlook rather than being frogs-in-the-well that some would have us be in perpetuity. The creation of employment opportunities and the generation of industries centred around the campus itself will be of immense benefit to the locality of Loluwagoda and, more generally, to the electorate of Mirigama.

I was appalled a little while ago, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, to witness a Member of the Opposition, who was either deliberately or through utter ignorance, trying to distort the perception of this University and he was trying to state that the University of Lancashire was one that was not up to the mark when it came to education. Let me tell you what he did not say. The University of Lancashire has its roots in the Institute for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, founded in 1828. It was granted university status by the Privy Council in 1992 and is the fifth largest university in the United Kingdom in terms of student population. It is both a privilege and a benefit for us to have a functional branch of such an esteemed organization operating from within our shores.

The Hon. Member also said then that it was like trying to insert something through the back door. I found that highly amusing, because this Government and Members of this Government do not use the back door. We have always and often use the front door. It is ironic because had he thought of his own Party Leader, he may have realized who uses the rear entry most in this Parliament.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, now wind up please. ( ) (The Hon. Vasantha Senanayake) I will conclude in a few seconds, Sir.

It is this sort of out-of-the-box thinking that enabled President Mahinda Rajapaksa to win an unwinnable war. I predict that progressive and innovative steps such as this will assist His Excellencys realization of his present dream in transforming our beloved country to be the "Wonder of Asia", although to those that have prioritized

petty personal agendas above national interests, this may not be a dream at all, but a horrendous nightmare. I conclude in the wise old maxim: It is only the ignorant who despise education.

Thank you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, this is a yet another moment of the blooming of a rose in the beautiful garden of Mahinda Chintana, I should say.

Sir, may I quote Nevin Fenneman while speaking on this subject of university. He said:

The purpose of primary education is the development of your weak characteristics; the purpose of university education, the development of your strong.

Then, Sir, Martin H. Fischer said, I quote:

Hitler destroyed the German university with design; we destroyed ours without."

How true it is today! Sir, the universities established in this country and the colleges created by C.W.W. Kannangara, the founder of free education, were all destroyed from time to time, by and large, by the JVP whose voice box we heard as usual today in the House in the form of the Hon. Anura Dissanayake. So, it has been their practice in the past. Today, I am very sad to say, while speaking on this very important subject of university, that one of the greatest libraries established in Damascus during the Umayyad period was destroyed by the American imperialists during the bombing of Syria recently. A similar thing was done by the United National Party in Jaffna. They went there and destroyed the Jaffna Library, which is one of the most important libraries well-equipped in the whole of Asia. Therefore, I should say that today we are on the correct path and the revival of university education has taken place in the proper way and according to well-guided methods and rules.

The establishment of a branch campus of the University of Central Lancashire at Mirigama Export Processing Zone as a Strategic Development Project, in consultation with the relevant Line Ministries, is really welcome. What is the intention? The intention of establishing this university is to provide high quality international educational experience, open to students in Sri Lanka, the South Asia Region and other countries. This fully fledged branch campus will accommodate a population of 6,000 international and 4,000 national students when fully operational.

Open your eyes and see! And, realize the fact. Two years ago when I went to the Eastern University, to the Oluvil University with our able Minister of Higher Education, the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, what did he say? " ." He wanted to have a full-fledged man above the horizon through university education. That is the idea of the Mahinda Chintana. . That is how in the olden days we had, . . . .

. .. , . ..., . . , . , . . . ,

1175 1176

.

Anyway, Sir, there is a lot of brain drain from this country. We were "exporting" education all these days. After the establishment of universities of the nature of Lancashire, we will be "importing" education and whatever foreign exchange that is drained out will come back to this country. Accommodation will be provided for 4,000 or 5,000 or even 10,000 university students. Now, Sir, this is a far-reaching step taken by this Government and the Hon. Minister, because all these days our students went abroad.

I know that even today some call Bangladesh "a backward nation". But, our students want to go to Bangladesh. They are crazy. They are ready to spend any amount of money, lakhs and millions. Why can we not make them spend that money in our own country and get the best of education from our scholars? They want to go to Pakistan; they want to go to other countries. The Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena placed all these details very correctly, while describing the fundamentals of this university. Therefore, Sir, to fulfil every aspect under the Mahinda Chintana, highways, railways, roads, development, ports, education and medicine, His Excellency the President and his Government are moving in a far-reaching capacity, which the Members of the Opposition will never be able to understand.

Sir, the Hon. Hunais Farook was speaking about universities. There is a publication here with me about Dr. A.M.A. Azeez, one of our greatest educationists and scholars. It is titled, "A.M.A. Azeez: Early Life and Tributes" edited by S.H.M. Jameel and Ali Azeez, and was released recently by the Dr. A.M.A. Azeez Foundation. He had the concept of establishing an Islamic Cultural University. From time to time, it came up. Today, very seriously, our educationists, the All-Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference and other bodies are again studying the proposals because Dr. A.M.A. Azeez had the vision of establishing or changing Zahira College, Colombo, into an Islamic Cultural University. It was so obvious that the student population needed the college; it did not come through. But, in future, it has to become a reality.

Sir, Mahatma Gandhi once said, Open your windows. Let there be free flow of all the wisdom in the world. That is what His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa is doing; that is what the Education Minister is doing today. " ! ! !" , .

Sir, in conclusion, I would say that these are the people who gathered knowledge and gave it to the

younger generation so that they will pick up and create a "Wonder of Asia". The creation of a branch campus of the University of Central Lancashire is also a part of that "Wonder of Asia".

What did the Poet, A. Iqbal say?

. . " 100" :

! ? ! ? !

Islam has laid emphasis on education by saying, "Thalabul ilmi faridlatun 'ala kulli Muslimin wal Muslimat". It is incumbent on both males and females to study. Also, the Prophet has said, "uthlubul ilma walau bissee. He said, "Go even unto China and seek knowledge" at a time when the Prophet did not know where China was. There was no Arabic, but this was to gather knowledge; it is that knowledge we are speaking of. The prime place for education is also given by His Excellency the President. The Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, Minister of Higher Education is guiding and chartering it along a well-planned path. Thank you.
