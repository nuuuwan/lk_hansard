... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Speaker, this is a very serious matter because this Bill is with regard to Constitutional provisions of this Legislature. The Local Authorities Elections Ordinance is already there in the Legislative Enactments. This is very important. The Legislative Enactments of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, Volume -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is the point you are raising, Hon. Azwer? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The point I am raising is, this Ordinance is already there in the Legislative Enactments. Give me one moment, Sir, I will substantiate my point. What is there in the Legislative Enactments cannot be repealed or amended through a Private Members Bill in the House. No Private Member has that right, whether the Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake is rosy, pink or reddish is not the problem. I am only pointing out that you cannot bring in a Private Members Bill before the House to amend the Legislative Enactments because those are already in books.

Sir, this is what Article 78 (2) of the Constitution states in this regard. Let this be included in Hansard so that people will know it. I quote:

The passing of a Bill or a resolution by Parliament shall be in accordance with the Constitution and the Standing Orders of Parliament. Any one or more of the Standing Orders may be suspended

That is required at a later stage.

Now, this Ordinance is already there in the Legislative Enactments. So, how can you amend a Legislative Enactment which is printed and distributed to all the Members? If you want to do so, it will be a Constitutional amendment and that has to be moved in a separate way. There is a procedure to be followed. Sir, even the authority on Parliamentary Practice and Procedure, Erskine May, himself has distinguished very clearly the

393 394

positions with regard to Bills presented by Government, Bills regarding Constitutional amendments and also Legislative Enactments. My submission is, Sir -

In setting up multi-member constituencies, the rule must be to create a certain number of constituencies for a particular minority if you find that there is a concentration of that particular minority within a local authority area. But, what we find is that the National Delimitation

Commission is following this only as an exception. What I would say is that the rule must be to create a ward even with a lesser number of Members if it is to provide for a particular community, their ward. Now, what happens is, it has been turned the other way and the National Delimitation Commission, only in exceptional circumstances, is creating wards for minorities within a local authority. This must be the other way about. In my opinion, multi-member constituencies should be created only as an exception. The rule must be to create as many wards as possible to accommodate minorities who are living within a local authority. For instance, if you take the Hon. Joseph Michael Pereras Negombo Municipality, there are particular areas like Periyamulla and various other places where Muslims are living in large numbers. Those areas are known and those wards have existed even in the past. So, in trying to create a ward in the Negombo or Colombo Municipalities, there may not be a greater difficulty. In certain other areas where there may not be sufficient numbers, the exception could be to create a multi-member ward. But, what is happening is, everywhere, the National Delimitation Commission is moving to create multi-member wards to accommodate minorities. That should not be the attitude. The attitude should be to have that as an exceptional rule and, as much as possible, to accommodate minority interests within a ward and allow them to have a majority within that ward so that they would be able to return a member from their own ethnicity or community. This is not being followed in a right manner, in my opinion. In my discussion with the Chairman of the National Delimitation Commission, I pointed this out. This has to be clarified and I hope the Hon. Minister would give us a clear indication as to what is the criteria the National Delimitation Commission would follow. I would be meeting the Chairman and Members of the National Delimitation Commission soon to discuss this matter further.

In the meantime, the Hon. Minister must also facilitate the political parties that have submitted proposals to the District Delimitation Committees to meet them at district level. What I see is that the National Delimitation Commission is taking the recommendation by the respective District Secretaries as the main proposal and is not paying serious attention to the proposals submitted by political parties. There again, an accusation has come from the Opposition that only the political parties represented in the Government are having the advantage of their proposals being considered by the National Delimitation Commission. I do not think that is a correct assumption. But, from my experience, what I feel is that we must be invited by the district level Delimitation Committee to present our proposals before them so that they would be able to incorporate our suggestions before they send it up to the National Delimitation Commission. So, this is the issue that we face. In fact, as a party, we have made it a point to submit our proposals at both levels: at the district level as well as the national level. This issue represents the need to see

407 408

[ ]

2013 11

that justice and fair play prevails finally in allocating and demarcating wards since we are doing away with the Proportional Representation System and are introducing a mixed system. There again, there was a request made even by the United National Party at the time we agreed to support this Bill in the Select Committee, that the portion of Proportional Representation be increased from 30 to 40 per cent, that the wards be carved out only for 60 per cent of members and the rest of the 40 per cent be by Proportional Representation. There was some undertaking given on the Floor of the House by the Hon. Minister at that time that they will introduce amendments later to consider that issue.

That, in fact, came as a proposal from the United National Party in principal and we too concurred with the same suggestion. But, after you have carved out the wards at national level and district level, once again to change this criteria would create problems. That change may not be able to be accommodated even if you bring that in and that process might take even a longer period to once again review the entire process altogether after the National Delimitation Commission has approved the suggestions from the District Delimitation Committees. So, that is why I suggest that, if at all, there is an intention to change the equation, the proportion of 30 per cent on Proportional Representation to 40 per cent, it must be indicated to the National Delimitation Commission right away. After they finish re-demarcation of all the wards, if we are to tell them that we are now going to change it, then that process of having to change the ward system again to accommodate those numbers might take a further period of time. Since the Hon. Minister has now got Cabinet approval to extend the time period for another six months towards the end of the year to allow the National Delimitation Commission to finish or complete its task and since there has been an agreement for the proportionally elected members to be increased from 30 to 40 per cent, it would be advisable to move that amendment early so that the National Delimitation Commission would be possessed of that and they would adjust their recommendations accordingly. I thought I would bring this matter to the attention of the Hon. Minister.

I must also say that the new Bill would certainly resolve many problems for political parties which are either controlling local authorities or having members in those because discipline in those has become a real problem for party leadership in various local authorities since collective decisions by a ruling party in a local authority are sometimes hampered by dictatorial decisions by its chairman or the mayor. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, I am winding up.

As it stands today, once there is disagreement between members of a local authority even at a Budget, after the Budget had been rejected twice, on the third time he can always have it passed even though he has not got the sufficient number of votes in favour of the Budget. This enables a tendency towards some dictatorial attitude by the chairman and members of the local authority .

( ) (An Hon. Member) What about the Minister? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The Minister, I hope, is not a dictator but in terms of politics between him and me, perhaps, sometimes he may be behaving in a very dictatorial manner. But, that of course, is a matter that we always take with a pinch of salt because in politics, you may be a friend today and an enemy tomorrow and politics sometimes makes strange bedfellows. That is how both of us have become bedfellows in the same Government though we have been in different camps.

Thank you very much, Sir. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera. Before he starts, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Shantha Bandara to take the Chair?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I propose that the Hon. Shantha Bandara do now take the Chair.

[4.39 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to speak today on an issue regarding the filling of vacancies in Local Authorities. The Hon. Felix Perera who spoke before me was commending the Hon. Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils for having always stood against the merger of provinces and his opposition to the merging of the North and the East. But, the Hon. Athaullah will remember that his mentor who brought him to this Parliament asking Asitha Perera to resign at that time wanted the Hon. Athaulla personally to be in this Parliament to carry on his political work as a strength to the SLMC. But, the late Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff agreed to the merger of the North and the East and he signed an MoU with the late Hon. S. Thondaman with whom I worked for a long period.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.L.M. Athaullah) That is conditional.

437 438

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes, conditional. I have the whole document, Hon. Minister. I can send the document to you. [Interruption.] We are not just going to merge. If the Muslim Members of the Eastern Provincial Council are going to agree, then it can come only after they are satisfied that they have a fair deal. The Hon. Ashraff said that there should be a Territorial Council. The Chairman of the Territorial Council should be the Deputy Chief Minister and the Chairman of the Territorial Council can name two more Ministers to the Cabinet of that merged Provincial Council. So many matters such as police powers and how they are to work together have been discussed in that document. I have the full document. I will forward it to you. Just look at it; consider it. [Interruption.] You are entitled to your opinion, Hon. Minister. But, at the same time, your mentor thought it fit that the North and the East should be merged. Look at it; consider it.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) No, you opposed it. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You have nothing to do with this; please sit down. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) What have you got to do with the North? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I have everything to do with the North. [Interruption.] ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Azwer, please do not disturb the Hon. Member. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Minister, it is left to you to consider it. That is all. I will send you the full document. It is available with me.

Meanwhile, I want to refer to the Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera who spoke before, who was saying that we must join the Parliamentary Select Committee that has been appointed now with 18 Members, all from the Government. The Terms of Reference of this Select Committee and the Terms of Reference of the All-Party Representative Committee - APRC - on which one of your Members served are the same. You were represented

on that Committee by Dr. Uthumalebbe. He was a signatory to the document that was finally produced and there was a consensus among 13 political parties: 11 parties from the Government and two parties from the Opposition. This document was presented by the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana to His Excellency the President and this was never published. It was hidden by His Excellency the President. However, Mr. Nizam Kariapper, the Deputy Mayor for Kalmunai and I, published this document with the blessings of the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana and it is in the public domain. If the Terms of Reference of that Committee as well as the present Parliamentary Select Committee is the same, why not take this document? Do not accept it as it is. If the Government appointed a Committee of their partner political parties and they came up with a proposal, why do you not make it the basic document to start the discussions at the Parliamentary Select Committee?

Then, maybe, the UNP and the TNA can consider joining and working with you. You want to give a blank slate. As the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake said, you yourself have not decided what the future is and you are just passing the buck to a Parliamentary Select Committee. I can remember very well during the war whenever a foreign dignitary visited this country, one person who always met that foreign dignitary was the Hon.(Prof.) Tissa Vitarana. An appointment was arranged for him to meet the dignitary; that is to show the world that while the war is going on, this Government is attempting to bring in a political solution. So, this was a bluff. That is the reason we do not believe that this Government is sincere in appointing this Parliamentary Select Committee and we doubt your motives and refused to participate in the Parliamentary Select Committee.

Hon. Minister, today we are debating this Bill because you rushed through the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act. You did not think of the consequences of the current Members, you did not think of the transitional provisions, so now you are bringing up this Bill. Similarly, there are so many other things in the Bill that we criticized. We told you at that time that the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act should have sufficient powers to create delimitation on the basis that the ethnic ratio within any local authority will be maintained in the representation that would result after the election.

Unfortunately, today we see the delimitation committees functioning. We understand that the delimitation committees have been given documents prepared by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Organizers. This was discussed and concluded at the Presidential Secretariat under the supervision of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa. We are told that these are SLFP proposals which have become the basis for the delimitation to take place because since then, none of the district secretaries have consulted any political party or any political authority in the districts.

439 440

2013 11

You know, we have another delimitation committee that is functioning today, which has not yet submitted the report. That is about the Delimitation of Divisional Secretaries' Divisions. In that committee also at the district level, the Chairman is the District Secretary. But, on every occasion, the District Secretary has summoned political parties, political representatives within the district and discuss how the delimitation of Divisional Secretaries Divisions should be done. So, when one Ministry, the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs which is involved in the delimitation of Divisional Secretaries' Divisions is following such a procedure, why is it your Delimitation Commission which has a bigger role to play, does not follow that procedure? How you delimit the wards is going to be very decisive and how representation in these local authorities would come is more important than dividing Divisional Secretaries' Divisions which are larger bodies, which are only an administrative unit for the Government to function. But here, it is peoples representation. Peoples representation is supreme compared to Divisional Secretaries' Divisions where an officer of the Government is appointed to do the administrative work, carry out the policies of the Central Government and the Provincial Councils.

But here, it is representation of people. You see, when this Bill was brought in initially, political parties of minority people all objected because they thought the representation that they have achieved through the Proportional Representation System will be diluted and their representation will be wiped out in the Local Authorities.

You would not believe, there are Tamil representatives in the Kalutara District - in the Horana and Walallawita Pradeshiya Sabhas - under the PR system. But, in the future, are they going to have that representation? If you take the Kandy Municipal Council, where 25 per cent of the population is Tamil, it has 20 Tamil members. According to the latest delimitation that has been done, there is only one ward - the Mahaiyawa Ward - from where a Tamil could be elected to that Municipal Council. Is it fair? This is what we told you at the time you brought that Bill, that it would be eliminating the representation of the minorities and to be careful. Hon. Minister, though you are a minority Member of Parliament, though you represent a Muslim Party, you have, knowingly or unknowingly, collaborated to eliminate the representation of minorities, which is very detrimental to national unity and democracy in this country.

So, I would make a suggestion. I appeared on behalf of the up-country political parties jointly before the District Delimitation Committee. I met the Chairman and the Board; four members were present. We asked them whether once they finalize the District Committee recommendations and before they make a decision and

gazette those, those could be reviewed by public consultation. If that could be done, maybe some of the defects that have taken place in the process of delimitation so far could be corrected. [Interruption.] You could. The Committee has the authority to decide on its procedure. Therefore, under those circumstances, they are entitled to call for consultations once the preliminary draft proposals are made so that everyone, not only the Governments main political party, the SLFP, but also Hon. Minister, your political party, the National Congress, the CWC, the UNP or maybe, I, who is within the UNP representing the people of Indian origin, will have an opportunity to sit with your officials and see whether a fair delimitation has been done.

During this delimitation process, you have taken the Grama Niladhari division as the base. If you are going to do that, then all the Grama Niladhari divisions themselves all over the country should have been delimited in a fair manner. If there is a 1,000 persons population, there is a Grama Niladhari division. But, in the plantation areas, a population of every 4,000 or 5,000 people have one Grama Niladhari division. So, when you take the Grama Niladhari division as the base, could it be fair? There are two Pradheshiya Sabhas - the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha and the Nuwara-Eliya Pradeshiya Sabha - each of which has a population of over 210,000 persons. When you allocate funds for a pradeshiya sabha, you do not look at the population. You say, Ok each pradeshiya sabha gets one, two or three million rupees. So, a pradeshiya sabha with a 210,000 population may get a certain amount and a Pradeshiya Sabha like Walallawita, which has only a 25,000 population, also gets the same amount. Up to date, no attempts have been made to delimit those two Pradeshiya Sabhas. We should have eight pradeshiya sabhas within these two divisions, which has not happened. It did not happen in the past; it has not happened even during your period. We have brought up this issue with you so many times in this House and outside. Even your predecessors, as local government ministers, never attempted to attend to that.

So, this is very unfortunate. Is this country going to discriminate against one group of people just because they lived in the plantations? Actually, they should be given a special status.

These are people who worked in this country for 180 years, for six generations and they contributed to the economy of this country. Until, maybe, 20 to 30 years ago, 70 per cent of the foreign exchange to this country was earned by these people and all the facilities to everyone in this country were given by the Government from those earnings. But, even today these people are being discriminated. Please, Hon. Minister, at least during your period, take this as a special issue and try to do something to give them a fair share in local governments.

441 442

Hon. Minister, there is one more issue that I wish to point out to you. I have already spoken to you at your Consultative Committee and also personally regarding the spending of pradeshiya sabha funds on estates. - [Interruption.] Yes, to spend funds. I have already given you a draft of an amendment to the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act so that the pradeshiya sabhas can serve the people who are living within the estates. They are constituents of these pradeshiya sabhas; they are voters of the pradeshiya sabhas. But, today, the pradeshiya sabhas cannot legally spend their funds on estates. Just because the Udapalatha Pradeshiya Sabha spent some funds on New Peacock Estate to construct some roads and water supply schemes, the whole Pradeshiya Sabha was dismissed, which is very unfortunate. To correct this situation, you have to act, Hon. Minister. Please do this as you have agreed.

Thank you very much. [4.56 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, this is a simple Amendment before the House and there is consensus or approval from both sides of the House to it. But, when the Debate dragged on, it has taken several routes, which will not be considered as relevant to the Amendment before the House.

Sir, I have a document here with me in Tamil, which I will read out:

"2013.01.01 // / "

.

My good Friend, the Hon. R. Yogarajan, brought up a canard in this House to say that the mentor of the Hon. A.L.M. Athaullah, the late Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff, was for the merger of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, but I know for one thing that he opposed the merger. That is why he faced death threats. - [Interruption.] I will tell you what he told us. - [Interruption.] You listen to me. Where were you? Hon. Yogarajan, you do not belong to the North or the East. - [Interruption.] You keep your mouth shut. So, that is a canard, I would say. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. R. Yogarajan, please do not disturb the Hon. Member.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, he cannot disturb me. He must go back to his estate, train himself and come.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) What is your point of Order?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) When he mentions my name and says something, I have the right to reply him.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) So, Sir, there was a death threat to the late Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff's life. He was in Maruthamunai at that time. He, of course, had a pact with the late Hon. A. Amirthalingam. The Hon. A. Amirthalingam had the TULF; the Hon. M.H.M. Ashraff formed the MUF, the Muslim United Front and they had a very good understanding, but when the issue of the merger came up, the Hon. Ashraff said, I cannot. So, there was a threat to his life. He left his gracious mother, the late good lady, Madheena Umma, behind in Maruthamunai - we know the whole story - and came to Colombo picking up his trunk. That is the story. You wanted the Muslims to help you to merge the provinces. Nonsense! Without giving police powers to the Northern Province, what happened to the Muslims? When the Centre had power without giving them police powers, they took up arms and drew away the Muslims, the young and old people carrying children in their arms. Muslims numbering 100,000 got driven away overnight. Will you guarantee their safety? That is why we say that police powers should not be given to any province, for that matter. Sir, for example, if somebody commits an offence in your province, he can escape to another province and he would not be apprehended by the so-called "police".

" " . . . He is called

the "singing Minister". . ... .

I think the whole country must salute the Hon. A.L.M. Athaullah. From the beginning, despite all the threats against him by the LTTE at that time, he was for demerger of the two provinces. What more? Do you know what the late President J.R. Jayewardene said - this is not something new - after the sanction of the Thirteenth Amendment was approved? He said that his Ministers went and worked against him. That was the leader of the UNP, the party you are now in, Hon. Yogarajan. You have only sacrificed your principles as far as the Hon. S.A.R. Thondaman is concerned. Therefore, you have no right to talk about the North and the East.

What is the stand of the United National Party? The Chief Opposition Whip, the Hon. John Amaratunga and the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera - Joseph, John, both names start with J- said today that they would not come to the Select Committee. So, this is the game that is going on. They do not want to have anything good done for the country. They want to have ''' in Parliament together with Rosy. That is all they want.

Yesterday, the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake criticized and condemned the Shariah law as a jada law. I raised an objection and asked the Hon. Leader of the Opposition who was seated there at that time whether he agreed on that, whether it is the policy of the UNP and if so, we will go and tell that to the Muslims in this country. He slowly got up and went. This is the position of the UNP. They are neither here nor there. They do not know where they are going. All the doors are closed for them and the rooms behind them are darkened.

I ask them why they cannot attend the Select Committee. , ? , ; Constitution . . , if they do not come to that Select Committee appointed by Parliament, are they going to Norway, are they going to Germany, are they going to Israel or any other country to attend a Select Committee? ? . . . , . . , , . 1972 . There is a problem of representation of minorities in Local Authorities as mentioned here. The same thing happened under the Soulbury Constitution of 1947. Thereafter, there were 151 elected Parliamentary Members, 145 electoral districts and six nominated Members.

There were multimember constituencies. There were 3 Members for Colombo Central, 2 Members for Beruwala, 2 Members for Harispattuwa, 3 Members for Nuwara Eliya-Maskeliya; 2 Members for Batticaloa and 2 Members for Pottuvil. It was extended to other electorates such as Ambalangoda-Balapitiya, Kadugannawa, Muttur, Badulla and later Beruwala. This is what the constitutional experts named as unrepresented interests to be represented in Parliament. Therefore, in the later amendments to the Local Authorities Elections Bill, if there could be a scheme

445 446

evolved as was in 1947- even today we have this system - it would be good.

We are called "National List Members". No. The Constitution provides for 29 Members representing national constituencies. Before an election, there is a list of Members - like the name of your good self, Sir, - contesting from each electorate or electoral district published, and people look at that list also when voting. Therefore, if they want you, me or anybody else in Parliament, they will vote for the party that we belong to. As a result, now all of us are named as Representatives of a National Constituency. It is a misnomer to call us "National List Members".

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Therefore, Sir, I would applaud the Hon. Minister for bringing an amendment to this Bill before Parliament. According to the "Mahinda Chintana" - I have no time to quote the relevant section - there will be a very strong, vibrant Local Government System presently in our country. The Hon. A.L.M. Athaullah is steering this Ministry well. I wish him all good luck! I think he can sing a song too for us!

Hon. Presiding Member, two Ministers who have geared themselves to mobilize the students and youths of this country to create a new world order for them, are brought into focus today by this Adjournment Motion by my young Friend, the Hon. Eric Prasanna Weerawardhana.

Sir, a large group of individuals who are unable to obtain the opportunity to enter the university after sitting for the competitive GCE (Advanced Level) Examination join the society every year. When we travel in the European countries and even the United States, we find there is nothing called People who are sent out of the schools. They are sometimes termed as dropouts, and various institutions are opened for them in order to advance their different aptitude and engage them in various vocations. Most of the youths who have read for their degrees under the Art stream have to face difficulties when finding employments. What the Hon. Weerawardhana proposes is exactly what the advanced countries are doing. We are trying to create such a society in this country. A stream of technical subjects is due to be introduced to schools by the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Skills Development in order to control the situation.

Therefore, it is moved in this august Assembly that people must be made known of the facts and the inherent value of this new revolutionary change in education in this country.

His Excellency the President quite rightly said the other day, , . The concept that there are clever students and non-clever or weak students cannot be accepted in this country. His Excellency the President has quite rightly emphasized this. In his Mahinda Chintana - this is the Magna Carta of this Government - mention has been made on every field of activity in detail what the Government proposes to do, what the real intention of

465 466

Mahinda Chintana is.

Page 68 of the Mahinda Chintana states, I quote:

Priority for Youth

In recent history we have witnessed several incidents of the violent destruction of our energetic youth. This is the reason why I decided to allocate more space for young people in the Mahinda Chintana.

Also, on page 75 of the Mahinda Chintana it states, I quote:

University education for knowledge

....I believe it is necessary to create a new educational framework that will provide liberal thinking, broad dialogue and opportunities for entertainment instead of the present system that confines the undergraduate to lectures, assignments and examinations.

There are three Ministers, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane, the Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma and the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, to carry forward these laudable intentions of His Excellency the President. They are all working ceaselessly day and night adding much weight and importance to the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime. They are the Ministers who could be marketed to other parts of the country saying, Look! Because of these Ministers the youth of this country, the school-going population of this country and generally the educational setup are made very vibrant and strong.

Sir, look at the Minister of Youth Affairs. What a novel scheme he has introduced! For instance, take the Youth Parliament. Take note of it, which we could not find in so many other parts of the world. There are 332 Members in that Parliament. "Catch them young", as it is called. They are given training in good governance, in administration, in public speaking which would serve them as a ladder to come into the mainstream of politics through this main Legislature later.

In that Youth Parliament, there are 332 Members. In the Senate, there are 50 Members and all communities are represented. Earlier in the First Youth Parliament, there was a Deputy Prime Minister. She was from Thunukkai in the North. She was made Deputy Prime Minister of that Youth Parliament. Who was she? She was the sister of a very strong LTTE cadre. She reformed herself. Today, in the present Youth Parliament, the Deputy Prime Minister is a Tamil. There are two Muslim Ministers. I think, this must be told to India, to Jayalalithaa Jayaram and to M. Karunanidhi as well.

See what happened this afternoon at Temple trees. More than 15,000 people including LTTE cadres who have been rehabilitated are being looked after by the Ministry of Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms. The Hon. Chandrasiri Gajadeera, Minister of Rehabilitation and

Prison Reforms introduced that scheme. The President gave compensation to LTTE cadres who have lost their limbs; lost their lives; lost their belongings and everything. Where is LTTE womens political wing leader, Thamilini today? She is now a reformed, civilized lady, in the civilized Sri Lankan society. Who made this transformation? Is it not our President His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa under the Mahinda Chintana? Like her, there are thousands of people who have been transformed today. I spoke to Mr. Shathish Kumar, Senior Consultant of the Ministry of Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms, a clever officer that he is, gave me detailed information. Now, this is the way that this Government is moving forward, Sir.

A news item appeared in the "Daily News" of 21st June, 2013 states, I quote:

"A technology stream was introduced to the Advanced Level curriculum by the President. The President added aesthetic subjects and other subjects as well, play a pivotal role in moulding young minds."

This is what the three Ministers are proposing to do and are trying to achieve for the good of the future generation of our country.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay, Sir. It further states, I quote:

Each year, around 350,000 students sit the Advanced Level examination and out of them 25,000 qualify to enter universities. Around 300,000 youths, who sit the examination following the four streams enter ..

I wish all three Ministers good luck and Godspeed so that we will have a peaceful Sri Lanka with flowering youthfulness all around us.

Thank you.
