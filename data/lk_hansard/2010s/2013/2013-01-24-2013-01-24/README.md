( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . .

: : PRIVILEGE: NON-RELEASE OF AUDIO RECORDING OF SPEECH ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, on the 23rd of January, 2013, I had occasion to participate in the Debate on the Order under the Strategic Development Projects Act. However, I find that the audio recording of my speech had not been released in spite of my request to do so. Sir, this is not the first time it had happened. There had not been any order either to withhold, delete or expunge any part of my speech. So, this would amount to a breach of my Privileges as a Member of Parliament. Therefore, I seek your indulgence to raise this matter in the House.

Sir, this is not the first time it had happened, but the fifth time. They have said that I had used unparliamentary language in that. I do not know what unparliamentary language I had used because I had not used any filth or any other language. This is not the first time that my speeches had not been released to the media. Therefore, Sir, it is a breach of my Privileges.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I believe it was released this morning. Is it?

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) This is the fifth time where it had not been released on the same day. There had not been any objections to my speech and still, they had not released it to the media.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I will look into that and attend to it. - [Interruption.] Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Sir, every Member who participates in a Debate would like to see his speech appear in the newspapers. So, we have to check and if there is a problem, let him know what section would be left out. Otherwise, it needs to be released on the same day because the newspapers are not going to publish it on the following day when there is some other matter going on. What the Hon.

1055 1056

Member said on the Divineguma Bill was published two days later. But, as far as the electronic media is concerned, it is different. So, there is a duty and a procedure has to be laid down. We know that Standing Order Nos. 78 to 84 deals with the Rules of Debate and there are certain other conventions to be followed. So, if an issue arises, the Hon. Member should be informed immediately saying, We are holding it back or that someone has complained about it. Then, he knows what it is. Sometimes, you may agree to let the whole thing go, taking that relevant portion off. Sometimes, it maybe just a crosstalk between the two of them, which is not relevant to the argument that was presented by the Hon. Member. I think this amounts more to a censorship. We have to sit down and look at what happened during his speech. But, I also think the Party Leaders must lay down a criteria, enabling the Hon. Members to get at least part of their speeches released if you are leaving the rest out. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Leader of the House. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , . . . , , . .

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . Then, I call upon the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer to raise his matter of Privilege.

: 2013 24 "" : 2013 24 "" PRIVILEGE: VIRAKESARI REPORT OF 24TH JANUARY 2013 ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Thank you, Sir, for giving me permission to raise this Privilege issue. There is a newspaper report distorting my

speech made yesterday in the House, and published in today's Virakesari.

[4.31 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Mr. Presiding Member, Rizana Nafeeks execution in Saudi Arabia on the 09th of January, 2013, Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji'un, is the most unfortunate and the darkest day for almost two million labour force of Sri Lankans abroad. Sir, this sad, unfortunate and tragic event has shaken the conscience of all Sri Lankans all over the country and I must try and restore some sanity to this Debate by saying that it would be quite unproductive and futile if we are going to take some cheap political mileage out of this tragic event. What is important for us is to objectively look at how we can correct things in the future. Also it is my duty to put in perspective the efforts that had been taken relentlessly by the Government of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa from the time this issue of her conviction came to light.

The Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake, my Friend, the self-appointed champion of the migrant workers of this country, appears to be throwing allegations all round and I must, to enlighten him on some of the issues, clarify some steps that we have taken. As a matter of fact, I was a Member of the Opposition way back in 2010 and I took upon myself the initiative of writing a personal letter, as a leader of the Sri Lankan Muslim community, to the parents of the deceased child asking them to consider clemency in the name of our religion and its tenets and precepts that allow us to ask for this clemency, which I did very responsibly. I must thank His Excellency the Ambassador for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Abdul Aziz Al-Jammaz, for his kind support in conveying my personal request to the family. Though we made a request to meet with them, that was turned down by the mother and the father, which was also conveyed to me by His Excellency the Ambassador -

( ) (The Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) ?

( ) (The Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake) Could you please tell me whether you met the parents of the infant?

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) They were not willing to meet me. That was the problem. They did not meet anyone.

( ) (The Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake)

. . rose.

( ) (The Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Presiding Member, the issue or the whole trouble was that His Highness the King of Saudi Arabia took that extraordinary, rare step of using his discretion to appeal to the family of the deceased child, which is not done always and which the King personally did at the behest of our President Mahinda Rajapaksa and unfortunately, the mother remained so intransigent and recalcitrant about this issue and was not willing to even consider the appeal by His Royal Highness the King of Saudi Arabia. That was the unfortunate issue. But, apart from that, we did not shirk our responsibility and depend solely on the plea for clemency that was sent through the King of Saudi Arabia.

We also took upon ourselves this very issue of the altered birth certificate and the way in which the passport was forged by some job agents who were involved in this issue. I took upon myself to invite the parents of Rizana Nafeek to my Ministry and both of them came along. Then, I summoned the Criminal Investigation Department. Senior Superintendent of Police, Mr. Jayasuriya, came to my office and I got him to take these two people to his office to record a statement and a statement from the father was recorded. Unfortunately, the person who had brought this poor girl to Colombo when she was a minor was the grandmother, who is no more. She had deceased by that time. This was also revealed in the police statement. The parents were not the people who were involved in bringing the girl to Colombo.

Finally, I instructed the CID to immediately file charges against the job agents who were involved in this matter. As a matter of fact, the CID took almost three weeks to arrest these people because they immediately

went underground. Finally, they had to be tracked somewhere in Kegalle, arrested, produced before the magistrate and remanded. Thereafter, we consulted the Attorney-General - this was last year - and he filed a direct indictment under the new penal offence that has been included for human trafficking. A case was filed in the High Court and we have managed to convict two job agents, who are now in prison, having proved the offence of altering the birth certificate and obtaining a fraudulent passport. This had happened a few months ago. Finally, the case was concluded only a few weeks ago with the third person being given a suspended sentence.

Thereafter, I summoned His Excellency the Ambassador to Saudi Arabia in Sri Lanka to my office when he came to see me regarding another matter. I explained to him about the issue relating to the forged passport and that this girl had, in fact, been underage at the time she was sent. So, this matter was being processed and it so happened that in the sidelines of the Asian Cooperation Dialogue Summit in Kuwait, His Excellency the President met the Governor of Riyadh, Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. He volunteered once again to attempt to talk to the particular tribe and the tribal leaders of this family and undertook to again canvass the issue of clemency. While that was pending, we were processing these papers to be sent and the Attorney-General was ultimately sent there to persuade the Minister of Justice in Saudi Arabia. I also took upon myself the opportunity, when we hosted the 50th Anniversary celebrations of the Meeting of the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee in Colombo, where there were some senior Saudi judges present - I summoned a meeting with the judges and the officials of the Saudi Embassy as well as our Secretary to the Ministry of External Affairs and Mr. Amunugama was also present at that meeting - to canvassed this issue and to enlighten them about the fair trial discrepancies, which we had come to know about and had already brought to their notice.

Despite all these efforts, unfortunately this execution has left some bitter memories for all of us and we feel that this should not go to the extent of trying to criticize a legal system of a friendly country, which is within its own sovereign territory. But, we must understand that within that legal system, there need to be some reforms and we must try and see whether we can persuade them to consider certain reforms when it comes to issues of natural justice which can be denied to migrant workers.

The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana was talking about the recent Convention on Migrant Workers that Sri Lanka is to consider to become a signatory. He must bear in mind that it is futile simply for the labour exporting country to be signing these international conventions. The labour-receiving countries must also become signatories for it to take effect. Unfortunately, these labour-receiving countries are resisting and are not becoming signatories

1099 1100

to these conventions. Therefore, the effect and the salutary impact of all the provisions of these conventions cannot take effect and provide the relief to the migrant labour force, towards whose benefit these conventions have been put in place. So, these matters have to be borne in mind. I must say that already the Government has undertaken a few reforms and I am sure that the Hon. Minister would explain all that.

In addition to that, I must say, there are some issues concerning our migrant workers and the legal aid offered to them by our Missions and we must take steps, Hon. Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, to set up some legal aid programme to assist them in times of emergency. There is a need for the increase of the number of Arabic-fluent officers in the Middle-East Missions and also, if possible, to have lawyers with a knowledge of Islamic Sharia in each Mission with fluency in the Arabic language so that we would be able to provide the necessary assistance to migrant workers when they come into conflict with the law.

I must say that I also tend to agree with alternative measures being introduced to reduce housemaids leaving for overseas. Together with that, there must be some way of addressing poverty alleviation. I am sure that poverty alleviation is one issue which would finally redress all these unfortunate incidents.

But, having said that, we must also remember that Saudi Arabia is home to almost 500,000 migrant workers and when you have such a large number of migrant workers in a country, there is bound to be some who would come into conflict with the law in that country. When that happens, it should not be seen as an issue which would go to strain relations between countries, though this particular issue has its own peculiar problems, but not for the want of trying by our Government; we have taken maximum efforts in trying to plead for clemency for Rizana as well as to prove that, in fact, she was underage at the time she went to Saudi Arabia.

In this particular event, the Ambassador for Saudi Arabia told me, the mother of the infant was responsible and was in the wrong for having got this girl to feed an infant because the housemaids are not sent to look after children; they are sent to do some other housework. So, it is not within their right to force these poor girls, who go there to do housework, to look after children because looking after children is a specialized job; it needs a different training. So, this girl, herself, should have not been engaged in caring for the infant. There again, there was negligence on the part of the mother. That is another issue that should have been canvassed, but, unfortunately, these issues had been overlooked in the Sharia Courts.

I am sure when we point out these matters in a friendly manner to a country with which we are having such fine diplomatic relations and which had even come

to our assistance when the Geneva Resolution was to be passed by the Americans, we could resolve those. Everybody knows that Saudi Arabia is a very close ally of the United States in the Middle-East. But despite that fact, His Excellency the President sent special envoys to various Middle-Eastern countries during the Geneva Resolution. I myself went to Kuwait and Qatar. Then, there were others who went to some other countries. The Hon. Minister of External Affairs went, I believe, to Saudi Arabia and we had their assurance and they upheld that assurance. So, despite the fact that the USA moved that Resolution against Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia took it upon herself to vote against that.

That was a very great help the Saudi Government did to our country. We cannot forget these things in this process, but in the meantime, we also cannot endorse this unfortunate tragic execution of Rizana Nafeek. We, as a Government felt unhappy and displeased about the way in which this had happened despite the fact that we were in the process of sending all these documents to prove that she was, in fact, underage at the time of the commission of this offence. Therefore, I must very clearly state here that all possible steps had been taken despite the fact that this unfortunate incident had taken place.

If we are to remember the legacy of Rizana Nafeek, this unfortunate export of migrant labour without training has to be looked at and we have already taken steps to correct that situation. I am sure the Hon. Minister would explain these issues and therefore, with those comments, I conclude.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti) , . . [4. 58 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Madam Chair, I would like to mention some of the things that my Ministry has been doing, not after Rizana's case, but which we have been continuing to do with regard to the Prisoner Transfer Agreements. I would like to mention that we have requested all the Middle-Eastern countries to sign a Prisoner Transfer Agreement with us so that once our people are sentenced in those countries, they could be transferred to Sri Lanka, to their country of origin. We have already signed PTAs with Hong Kong, New Delhi, Kuwait from among the Middle-Eastern countries, the Maldives, Pakistan and the United Kingdom, and with the UAE, Qatar and Iran, we have exchanged a text and will be signing it soon. The Hon. Minister of Justice has sent a draft Agreement to Iraq. So, to other countries also, we will be requesting to sign PTAs with us like those which have already done so that we can get the prisoners transferred to Sri Lanka to serve their sentence here.

, , , . They are expecting blood money.

Madam, two people from the Puttalam District, Chilaw, which is my Electorate, got involved in a crime and one lost his life and I was helpful in getting down his body. The deceased and the other person who committed the crime were related. The parents and the relatives of the victim do not want to accept blood money from the convict's family and pardon him. This is the situation even in Sri Lanka. They take revenge. Every religion teaches us to pardon all the sins, but, unfortunately, even our Sinhalese people do not give pardon. So, there are a few more days left for the family of the other convict to send an affidavit and save that Sri Lankan's life.

Our Ministry, with the help of our Missions abroad, has gone out of way, going to India, Nepal and so many other countries with affidavits and saving many peoples lives. The Saudi Arabian Government has also helped the

families of the Sri Lankan people who had been murdered and given them a lot of compensations. There are two compensation claims in my custody now, which were approved for a case where the husband and wife, while working in Korea, died inside a container under tragic circumstances. Rs. 4.8 million has been give for each as compensation. Though the husband did not have the necessary visa documents to stay there, our Mission was able to get compensation for him. So, Rs. 9.6 million would be given to their families, the next of kin.

There is also a case of an American, 67 years of age, who had married a Sri Lankan lady from Ampara and murdered her causing extensive injuries. She was 44 years of age at the time she died. The American who had been working for Aramco has been caught through a DNA test and he is serving a sentence. That ladys parents have requested US Dollars 1 million as blood money for the release of the American. So, these things are happening. Even the Judiciary of the Saudi Arabian Government has been helping the Sri Lankan Mission to detect the American. Why I mentioned that he is an American was to show that irrespective of him being an American, he was convicted by Saudi Arabia though it is American-backed country. They had caught him after several years and the family of the deceased from Ampara has demanded US Dollars 1 million as blood money from him, who is serving a sentence, for his release.

Madam, now, I would like to mention several things we have done which people are not aware of.

The Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake, the Hon (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana and many others have been accusing us. I heard certain comments that no female had gone and made a request from the childs mother, as females are supposed to be very lenient and have kind hearts. I do not think so. All hearts are equal - men and women. -[Interruption.] But we have done a lot. No previous governments have ever done so much or had the commitment that we had. We even tried to get the body released. Our Government made a request, but it was not granted. -[Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) Why not? -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) That is the Saudi Arabian custom. -[Interruption.] According to Saudi Arabian custom they do not -[Interruption.] I am telling you -[Interruption.] In this case, as soon as we got to know, we made a request from the relevant authorities, but they did not agree.

I would like to read out the sequence of events that took place.

Miss Rizana Nafeek who was born on 4th of February, 1988 to Mr. Mohamed Sultan Nafeek and Mrs. Seyed Ahamed Fareena Nafeek of Saafi Nagar, Mutur, was sent to Saudi Arabia to be employed as a housemaid on 15th of April, 2005 through a recruitment agency in Maradana, Colombo 10.

The Sri Lankan recruitment agent has altered her age in the Birth Certificate and arranged a forged passport to confirm that she was 23 years old at the time she was sent for employment in Saudi Arabia. However, the recruitment agent who forged her age was later charged by the police for the offence of forgery and a high court in Sri Lanka has sentenced two persons involved in the forgery to two years imprisonment after the forgery came to light.

Of course, there was a court procedure. Without going into a court procedure, we cannot sentence them. So we had to wait until we got these documents approved to be sent to Saudi Arabia. But before that, we informed the courts though humanitarian agencies that these documents had been forged to our knowledge and according to the affidavits that the parents had produced. Therefore, we provided the necessary information. The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment as well as to the Asian Human Rights Commission spent nearly Saudi Riyals 50,000 from the money provided by the Sri Lankan Government and made necessary representation and an appeal was also made despite the first judgment.

She was employed as a housemaid under a Saudi employer namely Mr. Naif Jaziyan Khalaf al-Othaibi in Riyadh initially and after one month of employment in Riyadh, she was taken by the employer to work at their house in a village named Jemshed in Dawadmi Governorate, which is 500 kilometres away from Riyadh.

According to Miss Rizana Nafeek, by the day of the incident, that is 22nd May, 2005, she had been in employment only for six weeks in total and had spent two weeks in the working environment of the remote Dawadmi area. The employers spouse had gone out for employment and had asked her to bottle-feed the four month old infant. According to our Member, the mother has to breastfeed the child at least for two years, but in this case, she has gone out for about six hours leaving the four-month old infant. She has not fed the infant but has got Rizana Nafeek to bottle-feed the infant three times a day and also to make meals for them. Miss. Rizana had done the first and the second feedings between 8.00 a.m. and 1.00 p.m. and had not realized that the baby had died during the third feeding due to choking. The employer and the spouse on their return had come to know that the infant had died and they had assaulted the housemaid repeatedly and forced her to convince to the offence of killing the infant. A few hours later, the employer had reported the matter to the police.

1107 1108

On 22nd of May, 2005, she was arrested by the police on the complaint that she had killed the six-week old infant while she was bottle-feeding the infant. The employer and the spouse had gone out for five to six hours, leaving the six-week old infant under the care of the housemaid, Miss Rizana Nafeek, who had been asked by the employer to do the dual work of a housemaid and a baby-carer. She was not sent for baby-care. She was only sent as a housemaid. So, the responsibility lies on the parents as well.

The High Court in Dawadmi sentenced Miss Rizana Nafeek to death on 16th June, 2007. The Supreme Court reconfirmed the death sentence on 25th of September, 2010 without reviewing the case in entirety. The expenses for the appeal case were met by the Asian Human Rights Commission based in Hong Kong. Mr. Kateb Fahd Al-Shammery, a Saudi Arabian lawyer, appeared in the appeal case on behalf of Miss Rizana Nafeek as arranged by the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Riyadh.

The Foreign Employment Bureau initially had authorized Saudi Riyals 5,000 on 21.03.2007 as the legal fee for the lawyer and Saudi Riyals 50,000 had been paid by the Asian Human Rights Commission on 11th July, 2007 and another Saudi Riyals 50,000, as arranged by the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Riyadh, had been paid to the lawyer.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a formal request by a Third Person Note dated 13th July, 2007 informing the Saudi Government of the background of the case and requested the Saudi Government to grant pardon to Miss Rizana Nafeek on sympathetic grounds while the case was going on and the Government made several more appeals and provided the necessary documents to the Government of Saudi Arabia through the Governorate of Jemshed.

Hon. Hussain Bhaila, former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, accompanied by Mr. I. Ansar, Director-General of Middle East Division visited Saudi Arabia from 20th to 28th July, 2007 on the instructions of His Excellency the President. The Hon. Minister met the Vice-Minister for Consular Affairs of Saudi Arabia, His Excellency Mohamed Abdul Rahman Salloum and handed over a personal letter addressed to Prince Saud Al Faisal, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia from Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, requesting pardon of Miss Rizana Nafeek and also seeking the assistance of Saudi Government to obtain pardon from the parents of the deceased infant. The delegation led by Hon. Hussain Bhaila also met the Islamic scholars and academics that included the Secretary-General of the World Muslim League, Sheikh Al-Turki, Deputy Minister of Haj and Umrah Affairs, the Dawadmi Police, the tribal leaders and many other people as well.

The delegation led by Hon. Hussain Bhaila introduced Dr. Mrs. Khifaya Ifthikar, a Sri Lankan doctor resident in Riyadh, to the Dawadmi Prison authorities in July 2007 and arranged for Dr. Khifaya Ifthikar to visit Miss. Rizana Nafeek every month. That was done by the then Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs with the assistance of the Embassy to visit and see her condition. That was done by the Government. Dr. Khifaya, on the request of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka and with the assistance of our Embassy in Riyadh, have been visiting Miss. Rizana every month from July 2007 till her execution and have been briefing on the welfare of Miss Rizana Nafeek to the Ministry, to the Embassy of Sri lanka in Riyadh and to the parents of Rizana Nafeek.

The staff of the Labour Section of the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Riyadh has visited Miss Rizana Nafeek regularly while she had been in detention.

The Hon. Minister Hussain Bhaila visited Saudi Arabia from 10th to 14th March, 2008 accompanied by Mr. I Ansar, who was the Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Egypt at that time, to assess the progress of the case and to have meetings with a wider section of the officials and the community that included Head of Women Welfare Camp, Chairman of the Human Rights Commission of Saudi Arabia and lawyers as well as other dignitaries, who could influence the judicial system in Saudi Arabia and the general public in Saudi Arabia to get her released.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! Hon. Minister you have got another one minute.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Madam Chairperson, please give me another ten minutes.

Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, also visited Saudi Arabia from 9th to 11th May, 2009 and discussed the issues with the Saudi Foreign Affairs officials and sought the intervention of the Saudi Royal Family at the highest level to convince the parents of the victim to grant the pardon required.

Following the reconfirmation of the death sentence against Miss Rizana in the appeal case, His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa, through Hon. (Prof.) G.L Peiris, Minister of External Affairs, requested twice to the highest authority in Saudi Arabia to pardon her on humanitarian grounds and requested Saudi Governments assistance for a Sri Lankan high level delegation to meet parents of the said victim.

On 20th June, 2011, the Government of Sri Lanka informed the Saudi Government that the Government of

1109 1110

[ ]

2013 24

Sri Lanka is prepared to pay any amount of blood money in case the parents of the victim child demand such blood money to grant pardon for Miss Rizana Nafeek under the Sharia law of Saudi Arabia. According to the Sharia law of Saudi Arabia, granting pardon to Miss Rizana Nafeek is a private right of the victims family and in the case of Miss Rizana Nafeek, it was the father and mother of the deceased child who should grant such a pardon.

( ) (The Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake) Why Mr. Kotelawala- ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Please follow the procedure. Kotelawala had enough money because he has got enough money from the innocent people of Sri Lanka. So, he had enough money to request her pardon. He would have done it to get sympathy.

Thereafter, a delegation led by the Hon. Dilan Perera, Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, including the Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, Mr. I. Ansar, Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Egypt and Chairman of the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau - all these officials - met Miss Rizana Nafeek in prison and briefed her on the action taken by the Government to secure her release and all the people who could make the decision to release her and explained to them the sequence of events that took place.

In October 2011, a delegation led by Hon. Alavi Moulana, Governor of the Western Province, visited Riyadh on the instructions of His Excellency the President. The delegation included Hon. A. H. M. Azwer, Member of Parliament, Hon. M. S. Thowfeek, Member of Parliament from her electorate and Mr. N. Wijeratne, Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare and many others. The delegation visited Jemshed village in Dawadmi Governorate, where Miss Rizana Nafeek had been employed and also met the village leaders, grandfather of the deceased child and the tribal leader of the area and made the request for pardon of Miss Rizana Nafeek.

The Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, in co-ordination with the Ministry of External Affairs, visited Saudi Arabia and met Miss Rizana Nafeek in March, 2008 and October, 2011. They met this girl on two occasions.

The Government arranged for the parents of Miss Rizana to visit her in prison in Saudi Arabia in 2008 and to perform Umrah pilgrimage to Makkah to pray for her release.

The Government arranged for the parents of Miss Rizana Nafeek to make a personal appeal, in person, to the tribal leaders and to the family (grandfather and uncles of the family) of the deceased child during the visit of the delegation led by Hon. Alavi Moulana in October, 2011.

Following the request of His Excellency the President to the King of Saudi Arabia in October, 2010, the King of Saudi Arabia had ordered the Riyadh Governorate to negotiate with the parents of the deceased child and to convince the parents to grant pardon. The Riyadh Governorate informed us that the King of Saudi Arabia had offered three million Riyals to the family and had also offered treatment for the second child of the sponsors family, who is not well, in a European capital with a paid holiday for the parents for the period of stay for the treatment, in addition to the blood money.

The Ambassadors of Sri Lanka who served in Riyadh, during the period from 2005 to 2012 had met the Saudi dignitaries from Crown Prince to Minister of Interior and top Government officials to seek release of Rizana.

The Riyadh Governorate on the request of the Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare also arranged for female scholars and psychologists to meet the mother of the deceased child and to convince her to grant pardon.

Hon. Prof. G. L. Peirs, Minister of Foreign Affairs visited Saudi Arabia in March, 2012 and met Deputy Crown Prince Mohamed bin Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz and His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz, Governor of Riyadh, briefed them of the concerns of the Government of Sri Lanka and requested the Government of Saudi Arabia to reconsider the personal intervention of the Royal Family at the highest level in seeking pardon for Miss Rizana Nafeek from the parents of the deceased infant.

On the instructions of His Excellency the President, Hon. Palitha Fernando, Attorney-General of Sri Lanka, accompanied by Mr. I Ansar, Additional Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs visited Saudi Arabia from 2nd to 6th December 2012, not long ago, only last month, and had meetings with the Deputy Governor of Riyadh, Prince Mohamed bin Fahd bin Abdullah Aziz and His Excellency Al Sheikh Mohamed bin Fahd. The Attorney-General also met Mr. Al Shethri, Director General of the Public Rights of the Riyadh Governorate and discussed the legal matters related to the case and sought for Miss Rizanas release on humanitarian grounds.

On 7th December, 2012, Hon. Minister of External Affairs had a special meeting with the Saudi Ambassador in Colombo, His Excellency Abdul Aziz Abdulrahman Al-Jammaz and handed over a further appeal addressed to His Royal Highness Prince Saud Al Faisal bin Abdulaziz

1111 1112

Al Saud. Further, the Minister requested the involvement of the Royal Family in Saudi Arabia to negotiate with the parents again to seek release of Rizana.

This year, a further appeal was made by His Excellency the President on 6th of January, 2013 to His Majesty King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al-Saud explaining to him of the outcry on the issue in Sri Lanka and abroad among all sections of people and requesting him to suspend the execution of Miss Rizana Nafeek to enable him to continue the negotiations with the parents of the deceased child through every possible channel.

The Saudi Press Agency, which is an official news agency of the Government of Saudi Arabia made an announcement that the Ministry of Interior of Saudi Arabia has confirmed that Miss Rizana Nafeek was executed in Dawadmi just before the Lunar (mid-noon) prayers on 9th January, 2013 at 11.48 a.m., that is 2.48 p.m. Sri Lanka time and not 9 oclock, the time you mentioned in this House.

The Government has gone out of the way. No Government has done this previously.

I would like to mention that not only in this matter, but Saudi Arabia has assisted to find many murderers who have murdered Sri Lankans in Saudi Arabia as well.

Our officers will be signing prisoner transfers agreements, so that the prisoners will serve their sentence in Sri Lanka.

I thank all the officials who undertook this task although we could not save her life.

Thank you. [.. 5.19]

( ) (The Presiding Member) . ... . [6.20 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, listening to my good Friend, the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, I think there is a new thinking developing. I am very happy about it.

Extremism, from whichever corner it emanates, we are opposed to. There is nothing called Islamic

1133 1134

[ ]

2013 24

extremism in Islam. Even in Buddhism and other religions, it is so. It is certain people who are making use of religion as a tool in order to exploit the situation for their own ends, maybe for political and other resons. I hope the Hon. Jayasekara would give his mind and influence the thoughts of the Members of his party also. I am happy to tell you that I happened to meet the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Leader of the Opposition, today in the lift, and told him what is happening. He said they will also take a stand and issue statement.

Halal is not a new thing. On the day Islam came into being, halal had been prescribed on Muslims. No Muslim in the world would eat anything that is non-halal. Therefore, it is not a new thing; it is nothing to be afraid of. Anybody who wants to eat halal food, can eat it - you have been doing that - and anybody who does not want to, can eat whatever he wants. We have seen how pigs are being slaughtered. How? In a most pernicious, inhuman way. If you want to have pork, you can have it, but the doctors have said that millions of germs are there in that flesh. That way of slaughtering will only erase off the human race from the earth when they consume that.

I must also say that outside Parliament, they, including my good Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, are blaming the Government for all the extremist activities that are taking place. What has the Government got to do with it? The Government is governing, which, under His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, had won the war and defeated terrorism, the worst terrorism that was there on earth. After doing that, he is now building up the country economically, and he wants to build a united Sri Lanka. Would a President be so naive as to give in to these extremist elements? No. He is trying his best to do justice.

I must place on record that all the Muslim Ministers and other Members of Parliament met His Excellency the President at the Temples Trees this morning. He assured us that that they are taking all steps possible. They know the people who are behind this. These elements wanted to make an inferno of this country once again because these foreign elements led by Mossad - I accuse them - and certain other international organizations are trying to create differences, a rift between the Sinhalese and the Muslims. That will never happen, Sir, because the Sinhalese and the Muslims have lived together in this country for years. It was the Muslim leaders who, as commanders of the army of King Mayadunne of Sitawakan, drove back the Portuguese up to Thuththukkudi at this battle. It is Kunji Marikkar, Pitchai Marikkar and Ali Marikkar who fought at the battle.

Then, during the time we received Independence, it was that great national leader, the Hon. (Dr.) T.B. Jayah, who stood up in the State Council and said, We, the Muslims, are national-minded. If it is for national freedom, we spare nothing and give our unconditional support. You, Britishers, can entrust things to the

Sinhalese because we can trust them." Those are the words of a great statesman. Dr. Jayah said, "We can trust the Sinhalese leaders and will settle our own issues between us. We are brothers in this country. You, Colonial Master, leave this country!" The late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, at the Debate on the Dominian Bill, which he proposed in Parliament, said, If the credit should go to any Member for the passage of this Bill, it should go to none other than the Hon. (Dr.) T.B. Jayah.

Sir, we are proud; we are a proud race. That is the way we have been living in Sinhalese villages. During the festival months, we give them wattalappam. You eat wattalappam and biriyani. During your Sinhala New Year Festival, we go for cycle races and other festivities and eat your kevum, kokis, athirasa, asmi and other sweetmeats.

Sir, that is the band of friendship we have cultivated throughout history.

Today, Sir, I want to speak on the main subject. But, I am so sorry to say that, in his true celluloid style, my Friend, the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake, moved this Adjournment Motion. I do not know whether he considered this a " ". No, this is not a " ". You are a good actor; you are One Shot actor, but you do not know where to direct your shot. That is the problem. Your aim is missing. Direct the shot in the proper way.

By proposing this Motion, are you going to re-enact Rizanas case? No. Everything had been done. Sir, the Hon. Neomal Perera related the whole story from A to Z. No stone had been left unturned by the Government to obtain a pardon to Rizana. From President Mahinda Rajapaksa down to the Hon. Minister Dilan Perera, everybody took all steps in order to save the life of this child. We were very sorry to hear the Hon. Ajith Perera, not you, saying that we went for tamashas to Saudi. No. Hon. Member, after all, it was one of our lives. So, we went there; we spoke to them. Who led that delegation? It was sponsored by this Government. Who gave Rs. 1 million to Rizanas father and mother? It was the President who gave that money. . , . . .

Then, Sir, I must -

( ) (The Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake, what is the point of Order?

1135 1136

( ) (The Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake) Could you tell me whether the money was given from the Fund or -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) No, no. That is all right. Did you give them a single cent? Did your leader give a single cent?

( ) (The Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake) Whose money was it?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You went there to exploit the situation. You went and met Rizana Nafeeks parents in Nugegoda. Who brought them there? It was the Hon. M.S. Thowfeek, the Hon. Member for Trincomalee, who brought them there. We took them to the Temple Trees. On that occasion, Sir, there were tears in the eyes of His Excellency the President. He wanted to speak, but when Rizana's mother cried, he could not do anything. He was choked with emotion and told them that he wrote to the King of Saudi Arabia with affectionate love, as it was his own daughter. He wrote to the King twice. We met Prince Salman, the second-in-command of the Royal Kingdom, in Kuwait and the President also placed before him this case. I also went with him to Kuwait in that delegation.

The thing is, you should know the law. Why are you hiding it? According to the Islamic law, the aggrieved party must pardon the person who committed the crime. Then only clemency could be granted. Up to the last moment, that women, the mother of the dead infant - I am joining you in order to condemn that - did not have the mind to pardon Rizana.

Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake, you said in this House the other day, . , , , ; ; - brutal law You said, Sharia is a brutal law. You said that. I think the companion who went with you, Azam Ameen, explained the whole issue and put into you some wisdom. You went to - I know the whole thing - Nafeeks house in order to extract some more information in order to sling mud at our Government. But, I think Azam opened your eyes. You stand up now and say that you are sorry for what you said about Sharia Law in the House the other day. You withdraw that! Sharia Law is the Gods law; Allahs law. That cannot be called a barbaric law.

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Today, what is happening in this country? , , , ? . Galle Face . , . . .

Sir, I have with me a book titled Shariah in Britain: The biblical forbidden fruit? written by Dr. M. Haris Z. Deen, Ph.D, MBA, B.Sc., FRICS, wherein he deals with Rizana's case also, which I table* to be placed in the Library, so that all Members can have an indepth knowledge of the subject.

Dr. Haris Deen has given a detailed and comprehensive report on all aspects of Sharia Law in this book. It was printed in Austria and has now found the bookshelves of the world.

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, give me one more minute as this is such an important subject and then I will finish my speech.

Sir, Dr. Deen also had written an article to "The Island" of 12th January, 2013 titled "The Rizana Nafeek case, Did the Saudi Judges Act According to Islamic Law?" According to that, there are five categories of homicide, which you must know about, in Sharia: Qatl amd - intentional homicide; Shibh amd - quasi-intentional killing; Qatl khata - accidental homicide; Majraal-kha - something similar to accidental homicide and then, Qatl bi sabab - indirect killing.

Then, Sir, another article written to the "The Island" of 23rd January, 2013 by Dr. M. Haris Z. Deen tititled

1137 1138

"The Rizana Nafeek case, In the Shades of Qur'an and Ahaadith", states, I quote:

"It must also be clearly taken into account that although God gave the victims family the carte blanche right to demand Qisas, Allah in his absolute wisdom and mercy, urged them 'to move forward and forgive'. (Quran 2:178; 42:40)."

Sir, I would also ask your permission to table* the article of 23rd January, 2013 to be placed in the Library and the Arabic translation of that verse of Quran 2:178 to be included** in Hansard.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I will finish, Sir. This is very relevant. His article goes on to state, I quote:

" Allah has beautifully described forgiveness as being better than revenge or punishment..."

Allah had said that. He is all powerful; he is the God; he is the Creator; he is the Supreme Divine Power! Sir, the article further states, I quote:

" ...and have extolled the virtues of forgiveness extensively in the Holy Qur'an (42:40; 5:45; 2:37; 24:22; 2:109). Allah has promised a reward for those who forgive..."

Then, Sir, Dr. M. Haris Z. Deen continues to say in his article, I quote:

Another important gift of God under the Shariah is the alternative right of the family to seek monetary reward ..." ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Please, Sir, -

( ) (The Presiding Member) . . .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I am only placing the aspects of the Sharia Law before the House.

Then, we went on the 11th of November, 2011 to Dawadmi and met the grandfather of the child and his tribal group and pleaded for clemancy from the mother.

Whereupon THE HON. AJITH P. PERERA left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) , . . - . , .

The tragic and shocking news of Rizanas death reverberates throughout the world. The Saudi Arabian government chose to ignore the appeal of our leaders, our people, civil society organizations. human rights groups and international groups.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, my Friend, the Hon. Kabir Hashim, has been thoroughly misled. It is the law of Sharia that Saudi Arabia is following.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Azwer, you sit down. Hon. Kabir Hashim, you carry on with your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim)My colleagues from the Opposition clearly proved that our Government too has failed in allowing Rizana to be executed or may I put it as allowing Rizana to be killed. While I condemn the way that Saudi Law has been implemented and that there has been a serious miscarriage of justice by the Saudi Arabians, my intention today is to make it clear that the Saudi Judges have not followed the Sharia Law because a misconception has been created about the Islamic Sharia Law amongst our non-Muslim brothers here in Sri Lanka and the world over.

The Sharia Law does permit capital punishment such as hanging, beheading and electrocution for murder. This comes under the Quranic doctrine of Qisas. The doctrine of Qisas is the same as what comes in the Bible; Exodus 21.24, Leviticus 24.20 and Deuteronomy 19.20. Contemporary Egyptian Jurist Abu Zahrah holds the view that the purpose of Qisas is to preserve life. All Islamic Jurists such as Abu Hanifa, Shafi, Malik and Hanbal are of the consensus that the murderers' execution has the long-term effect of preserving the life of the community. This means that capital punishment acts as a deterrent to others who want to kill. That is the reason for a public killing. Permitting capital punishment does not mean that like in Saudi, they can do it in any way that they want. Islamic Law has its own checks and balances called

1145 1146

2013 24

"Dhawabit". The punishment cannot be imposed if the due processes have not been observed in a fair trial and all extenuating circumstances fully considered. The Sharia law provides a special protection for the weak and the underprivileged. In criminal law context, it protects the interest of both the accused and the victim.

The presumption of innocence is the fundamental principle of the Islamic Law of criminal evidence. Prophet Muhammad - peace be upon him- has in many instances referred to this and said that the accuser has to present positive proof beyond any doubt. In criminal cases under Islamic Law, the prosecution has the overall burden of proof and it goes beyond the standard set out by common lawss beyond reasonable doubt. Under the Islamic Law, not only the prosecution has to prove the charged offence beyond all reasonable doubt but, it has to be proven beyond all shadows of doubt.

Pieces of so-called evidence and the judgment in Rizanas case raise some serious issues and questions which need clear, unambiguous answers. The questions are:

1. Whether the said act attributed to Rizana is intentional or unintentional?

2. Was Rizana given the opportunity to refute her charges against her in a free and fair manner?

3. Why did the Saudi Courts not take Rizanas age into consideration before the death penalty was passed?

Under Islamic Law, crimes fall under two categories; intentional crimes and unintentional crimes. Under Islamic Law, no death penalty will be given for a killing which was done by mistake or without intention. Clearly, Rizana's case falls under this category. Did the Sri Lankan Government Ministerial delegation that went back and forth not realize this? Or was it only a fun trip?

In addition, according to Islamic Law, confession must be made without any coercion or compulsion. It must be with free consent. The confession given under threat/inducement or promise is not admissible and moreover and importantly, it should be made in the open court and extra-judicial admission/confession carries no legal weight.

In Rizanas case, the confession was forced, not in courts but in a police station. What were the Sri Lankan Government advisers doing? The Quran differentiates between the two kinds of offenders clearly and says, And there is no blame on you concerning that wherein you made a mistake, what counts is the intention in your hearts - Verse 33.5."

Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said, My people are not accountable for what they do by mistake and inadvertently.

There are exceptions for criminal liability such as insanity, self-defense, duress and also immaturity, which is for minors. Rizana was a minor and our Government had all the documents to prove it. Therefore, she could not be executed under the Islamic Law. Then, what law is Saudi Arabia following? Why did the Sri Lankan authorities not question these issues?

The Islamic adjective law excludes forced confession in hadd - capital punishment - and Qisas cases. The coerced or forced confession of guilt or confession taken under duress is not admissible and similarly, a forced compromise is not lawful. On the other hand, obtaining a confession under duress, coercion or any other kind of illicit pressure is a crime under Sharia. "The Rights of the Accused in Islam, Arab Law Quarterly, Vol. 10" speaks of this - the judge should permit a person who makes a confession or even admission to retract in case of doubt, based on the maxim of the Prophet, which said set aside punishment when there is doubt.

According to the reports, her statement that she was born in February, 1988 was ignored on the basis that her passport indicated that she was born in February, 1982. Further according to the reports, the authorities did not do anything seriously to ascertain her real age. Under the Islamic Law, a child would not be given capital punishment for a crime committed by him or her. In the case of a child-offender, the judge has the restricted right to impose some restrictions on the offender, which would help to reform him or her or to prevent him or her from committing further crimes in future. Rizanas case raised a serious doubt whether all elements of Mens rea were proved or disproved. It has been said that the first statement made by Rizana was translated by a Malayali translator who had no fluency in Tamil.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim)Sir, I will wind up in a minute.

It is also said that Rizana had retracted her initial statement which, she said, she was made to make under duress and coercion. This was definitely not the Sharia or the Islamic Law. The Islamic Law would never have allowed this judgment. It was the barbaric Saudi Law that was implemented by the Saudis. I hope one can now see the distinction.

Sir, this is the heartbreaking story of the thousands of our women folk who go to the Middle-East due to abject poverty and the Government is talking about a per capita income of over US Dollars 2,000. What a joke! They should be held accountable. The Sri Lankan Government

1147 1148

had also failed to present its case successfully, as you can see from the facts I have given. The delegation of Ministers and higher-ups, shockingly, had simply been either gallivanting in Saudi Arabia or are simply brainless and spineless. So, you are equally accountable. If you do not ban our workers from going to Saudi Arabia, then Rizana would have died in vain. Hon. Minister, I hope this pricks your conscience forever.

May Rizanas soul rest in eternal peace and attain the abode in Jennathul Firdhouse!

Thank you.
