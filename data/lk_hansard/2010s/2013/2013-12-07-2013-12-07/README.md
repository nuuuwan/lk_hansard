( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, I join my Colleague, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, in expressing the condolence of the House and of this country on the passing away of Nelson Mandela. The prisoner from Robben Island became a beacon of hope to the whole world. As my Colleague pointed out, it was the imposition of the Apartheid State, which led to Nelson Mandela getting involved in the

struggle to regain full rights of the African people and thereafter, to take leadership of the movement. But, Mandela together with many of his other colleagues, had to suffer imprisonment.

Nelson Mandela represented the ANC, whose objectives were not limited to non-violent struggle. They also had to launch a liberation struggle, in which they wanted the rights of the majority. They had to suffer many hardships. Nelson Mandela had once remarked that his was the least. He was kept in a prison and maybe, beaten up. The others had to suffer much more. As we listened to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, it certainly showed the extent to which the apartheid system worked to try and hold its power. That is a characteristic of many authoritarian States, which seeks to control thinking; which seeks to control the media - that is one sign - which seeks to control the judiciary and put those who are in favour to them; which seeks to control civil society and which seeks, in fact, to keep an eye on anyone who they think is a dissident and then take action against him legally or indirectly. So, it is not only in countries which has White supremacy. It is an unfortunately a sign that we see in many parts of the world. What I see in Nelson Mandela is that once he took over, he dismantled that apparatus. He kept the State structure very much like Shri Jawaharlal Nehru and the Right Hon. D.S. Senanayake did in India and Sri Lanka. But, he dismantled that apparatus.

Finally, we have to remember that the victory of the Africans in South Africa was due firstly, because the struggle launched by the African National Congress, and secondly, because of the international pressure that came in. Without that international pressure, which finally forced even the USA to agree, it would not have been possible. The international pressure made it difficult for the apartheid regime from inside, and for others the international pressure made it difficult for them from outside.

Sri Lanka too played its own part in this. So, we cannot, at all times, say that international efforts and mediation is a bad thing. International pressure came from outside because the Government of South Africa at that time was certainly not going to allow international pressure. But, of course, the system today, of which South Africa has joined, allows countries to voluntarily sign international instruments, safeguarding liberties and human rights. Then, a duty is cast upon us to observe the obligations under that. Once you come under those, you cannot move out. South Africa had to leave the United Nations and the Commonwealth because they did not adhere to those basic principles.

Once Nelson Mandela became the President of South Africa, he did not take revenge on the other communities. He did not try to build an Africa for Africans only. You had the Whites; you had the Indians; you had the mixed or the coloureds and you had the Africans. He did not allow the Africans to be divided into tribes. He evolved a

1057 1058

[ ]

2013 07

concept of South African identity, which is enshrined in the South African Constitution. It is one of the most progressive Constitutions that you can find today in the world.

So, there is a lot to be learnt from it and a lot that we can learn. I know the Government has also been consulting the Government of South Africa. I think it is time that Sri Lankan Government took some definite steps where, having evolved a consensus in this Parliament, they could build and take it forward based on the document, which the Government has put forward as our solution to reconciliation; the LLRC Report recommendations, many of which - the political items - have not been implemented during the last few years.

He also built up a democratic structure. That is what is important. He built up a structure which was different; it was neither the Westminster System of the UK nor the Executive Presidencies of either the USA or France. They studied our Executive Presidency. It was a unique model: a President elected by Parliament, responsible to Parliament and who could be moved out of Parliament. I think that is unique for South Africa because below that were the provinces, which have also been given substantial power. Then you had the President who presided over the whole federation and the constitution itself drew the balance between the different provinces and the powers of the Government. The role of the President vis--vis Parliament. That is a very clear system and the democratic system that Mandela brought in is again one on which we have a lot to learn.

We, in Sri Lanka had a Constitutional Court and then under the 1978 Constitution, we did away with it. But, today we are wondering whether we should not have an independent constitutional court to be the arbitrator of all the disputes that are likely to arise in the process of implementing a new Constitution.

Mr. Mandela himself set a two-term limit. He thought two terms were more than sufficient. At the end of the second term, he could have changed the Constitution and gone for a third term or he could have gone for a lifetime. He did not do that. At the end of the second term, he went home. This is an example, I hope, that we will also keep following in Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, we did not do so in bringing in the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

Then, Mr. Mandela retired. There were disputes within his own party, Mbeki and the others. He did not intervene. He said what he had to say in a few words, but allowed the party to take its course. That is why he became the symbol of hope to many. Nelson Mandela is by no means a Gandhi because he did not confine himself to non-violent means. He did not give up his struggle or suspend his struggle because violence was used. Violence was used extensively by the ANC. But, having attained his objectives, he implemented the Gandhian ideals in his

own country and that is what he will finally be remembered for. Mr. Nelson Mandela showed that the prisoner in an island could think big and that is the ability. Can you in politics think big? Can you in politics give a vision? Can you in politics unite people? Can you in politics give hope to the poor, to the oppressed, and those who think they are the disadvantageous groups of the country? If you can do that, then you certainly would be following in the footsteps of Nelson Mandela and that is what we need Sri Lanka today.

Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , , .

[10.22 a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Chairman, after listening to the very valuable sentiments expressed by both the Hon. Leader of the House as well as the Hon. Leader of the Opposition about Nelson Mandela, one of the greatest leaders in the world, and as the Hon. Speaker also observed, I thought it fit to commence this Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Justice with what was said by Nelson Mandela after his very long struggle for Independence. After the victory, he was advised by his advisers and

supporters to celebrate his victory. His reply was, Do not celebrate revenge, and I think that is very appropriate for any person who believes in democracy anywhere in the world.

If I am to say that, it was true that during the period of the UNP regime, when we were approached to amend the Constitution to increase the number of Court of Appeal Judges in order to set up the provincial Courts of Appeal, the then Chief Justice expected us, both the Hon. (Prof.)

G.L. Peiris and myself, to give our cooperation. In return for that, we asked him to do something. There are two matters regarding which the Supreme Court enjoys original jurisdiction - the jurisdiction pertaining to the fundamental rights and the jurisdiction under Article 99, which pertains to expulsion of MPs from political parties - and that is not a very healthy phenomenon because there is no right of appeal for the aggrieved parties. We all have been aggrieved parties; particularly the United National Party itself is an aggrieved party in many cases. Therefore, in order to facilitate that, we asked the then Chief Justice, as a quid pro quo, to allow us to bring down these two matters under the Court of Appeal so that there will be a right of appeal to the Supreme Court. But, he had been totally against it. That was the time when the Supreme Court was slowly becoming another centre of political power. Even with some reluctance, I must say that. Everybody in the judicial field and the legal field know that, how these things developed and that was the time, we thought, that fundamental rights jurisdiction was being used to attain or rather convert the Supreme Court into an alternate centre of political power. We realized that. Therefore, we thought at least we must have the right of appeal when it comes to these matters. It was because of that issue, that this matter was unresolved.

But then, ultimately, with the Civil Appellate High Courts being set up, these issues getting complicated can be resolved by a future amendment, by increasing some judges in the superior courts. That again may be an issue for the Opposition. If there is some cooperation in the future, we can consider it. It is true that we must at least have two or three separate benches set up to hear the appeals that are piling up from the Civil Appellate High Courts. It is not only the matter of piling up, but the quality of judgments from the Civil Appellate High Courts are also under question and that too must be agreed upon.

I must also thank the other Members who have been talking at length. Particularly, in reply to a question raised by one of our Members or I believe, from the Opposition regarding the assigned counsels and that their fee has to be increased from Rs. 1,000 up to Rs. 5,000, I must say that we have taken that step and approval has now been received so that we can increase the fees that are payable to the assigned counsel. We are now waiting this matter to be confirmed by the Judicial Service Commission so that we can begin to pay an assigned counsel an increased fee to facilitate that matter.

Then, the Hon. Minister in charge of Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms was talking about the drug cases. He came out with some very interesting statistics and I must thank him for that. Those statistics indicate as to how the criminal justice system is getting clogged, particularly when it comes to prisons. Those statistics will give us a particular idea as to how we can reform the system.

1103 1104

While thanking him for coming out with those statistics, I must say something about the contribution of the Government Analyst's Department.

, . 2012 . 2013 30 4,191 953 . , 953. . .

Then, I must say something about the Sri Lanka Law College. There have been certain allegations that have been brought about. In that regard, there are some serious reforms that are being introduced. His Lordship the Chief Justice and the Council of Legal Education have initiated a process of completely revamping the professional legal education in Sri Lanka. With that objective, reforms are to be introduced to enhance the standard of education and to produce lawyers who could keep pace with development and contemporary challenges because our system of legal education is very archaic and we have not seriously introduced reforms into the legal education sphere. So, that is being looked into very seriously.

A complete overhaul of the examination system and the curriculum is also being planned. There have been certain lacunas that were observed and those lacunas are being addressed very seriously. Careful evaluation of the curriculum of the Law College will be undertaken in consultation with the Law Faculty of the Colombo University. That has already been done. With the cooperation of the Law Faculty and the Department of Examinations, certain changes are being introduced so that, for whatever reason, the transparency and the need to maintain secrecy of that examination would finally be ensured.

Action is being taken to streamline the administration of the Law College and introduce measures to improve its efficiency and it has been given some priority. That has also resulted in looking at the Advanced Legal Studies Department of the Law College, which needs a lot of changes and that too is being addressed in earnest.

Together with that, I must say His Lordship the Chief Justice is to, very soon, maybe within the next month, introduce a Code of Conduct for Judges based on the Bangalore Principles. This is something the United National Party had been speaking about during the Impeachment of the Former Chief Justice; they had been speaking about the Bangalore Principles, the Latimer House Principles and various other things.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) What about the Latimer House Principles? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That involves a change in the Constitution. But, this is by rules; by gazetting the rules, this issue will be addressed.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Chairman) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised. Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, we never spoke about the Bangalore Principles. We spoke about the Latimer House Principles. Do not misquote us, Hon. Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Okay, you speak about the Latimer House Principles. The Latimer House Principles belong to the Commonwealth realm. Right?

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Yes.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Now, we are the Chair of the Commonwealth. So, these are things that we will address in earnest. All what is important is to maintain the dignity and the independence of the Judiciary. But, the independence of the Judiciary does not mean that it must be totally barricaded from all the other arms of Government. That is a totally wrong precept. Enacting the law and implementing the law are the two issues. Independence should be in the mind. Sometimes, some judicial officers may think that they have to totally barricade themselves from everything else. That is not the way to look at independence. Independence of judges is, in fact, in their minds. So, they could bring to bear a very independent mind when they decide cases. But, if there is any erosion in the confidence of the Judiciary, it must be addressed. I am sure once the Code of Conduct is introduced, it will

1105 1106

[ ]

2013 07

be open for everybody to look at. If Parliament wants to debate that issue, the contents of the code of conduct, we can even permit a debate because we will be gazetting it soon.

Then, the Judicial Service Commission is looking at introducing a system of evaluation of judges based on their performance because now there is a question of delay in writing judgments. When they go on transfers, sometimes judgments are delayed. Sometimes, they have to go to a new station and come back to deliver their judgments months later. These are issues that have to be looked at very seriously, and therefore there has to be an evaluation where even the legal fraternity who are practising in that court will also be having an opportunity in making representations to the Judicial Service Commission, so that they can look at the competence of judges when it comes to matters of promotion.

I am very happy to say that the Supreme Court would soon be introducing the e-filing system as a pilot project for fundamental rights applications, where all petitions could be filed through electronic means in the computers. So, the e-filing facility will be made available and that would be the first pilot project to begin the digitization of our judicial system which we will be very seriously undertaking.

Then, coming to the other few pieces of legislations that are pending, I noted that the Hon. Ajith Perera was very critical about the delay in bringing in amendments to the Civil Procedure Code that were promised last year. They are still pending because we had difficulty regarding the judicial mediation issue, which even the Bar Association had made some presentations that it is not a salutary thing. Therefore, we would like to drop the judicial mediation and bring it forward. Some technical issues have been raised by the Officials' Committee and I am sure within the first quarter of the next year, we would be able to bring that to reality.

The Victim and Witness Protection Bill which has already been approved by the Cabinet will soon be introduced in Parliament by early next year, hopefully. This Bill has been referred to the Legal Draftsmans Department for final touches, and once that is ready, we will be able to bring it before Parliament.

Then, we have an important piece of legislation, the Children's Judicial Protection Bill, which seeks to provide for the contemporary realties relating to child protection, which will repeal the antiquated Children and Young Persons Ordinance. This is a very important piece of legislation that we will be introducing along with the Ministry of Women's Affairs.

We have also prepared a model statute on childrens homes, which is a subject coming under the provincial councils. We would like to recommend this to provincial councils because, as you know, under the Thirteenth

Amendment, the subject of probation and childcare services has been devolved to the provincial councils. Therefore, we have now completed a model statute which will regulate orphanages and childrens homes, which is now in need, a very urgent regulatory mechanism. That is another matter that we have looked at.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Minister, please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Chairman, I am winding up. Then there is also draft Prescription (Special Provisions) Bill. By operation of the Prescription Ordinance, sometimes those people who have been disadvantaged as a result of terrorist activities during the 30-year conflict can be deprived of their rights. Therefore, in order to address their grievances and give them relief, we have now finalized that Bill.

Then, there is Notaries (Amendment) Bill, which I have already spoken about, to combat the high prevalence of land fraud which will provide for biometric signatures to be affixed to deeds and other instruments. Then, there is also the Prisons Bill to replace the Prisons Ordinance. I have already sent a copy which was submitted to me by a committee appointed by one of my predecessors. I am sure, the Hon. Minister and I would be able to soon bring that to reality.

With those comments, Mr. Chairman, I must thank my Secretary, Mrs. Kamalini De Silva, Additional Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries and other officials of my Ministry for assisting me during the past year, and hopefully we will be able to address some of these longstanding issues that have been raised by the Opposition as some constructive criticisms of our Ministry. By assuring that, we will take all what is possible within our means to fulfil those requirements.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Chairman) 1.00 .

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Deputy Chairman, Sri Lankas position, vis-a-vis, the international community has taken a beating for the last so many years. In 2009, it was good, because soon after the war ended, a Resolution was brought by Sri Lanka giving certain undertakings to the international community and that Resolution was overwhelmingly passed in 2009. That Resolution was passed because you gave certain undertakings. But, since that date, all the undertakings that have been given to the international community have not been honoured by Sri Lanka. So, today we are in a very pathetic situation, where basically the countries that matter to us - India, the USA, European countries including Great Britain - are taking a very hostile attitude towards Sri Lanka.

In order to overcome this situation, you organized the CHOGM. But, has it made Sri Lankas situation better? -[Interruption.] You may say so because you have to say so. But, the fact of the matter is that it has made Sri Lankas situation worse because the entire CHOGM highlighted Sri Lanka and its human rights records so much so that when Richard Uku was presiding over a Press Conference with over hundred journalists at the end of CHOGM, there were over 50 questions asked from him

and every question was on Sri Lankas human rights record. He got so frustrated and said, Are there no questions other than Sri Lanka and Human Rights?". So, where is the publicity for other issues? You issued a very large Communique' with nearly 80 odd paragraphs but none of those were discussed at any Press Conference. That is the truth. So, I think the CHOGM ultimately brought Sri Lanka into the international domain, vis-a-vis, the human rights situation.

You are looking at Africa. You are shaping your foreign policy to get votes just like you always do things to get votes in this country. You bash the international community and go before the Sri Lankan people saying that the international community is attacking us. You have a patriotic attitude to deceive the Sri Lankan people and say that we are being harassed by the international community. That is to get votes. You bash the minorities to get the Sinhala-Buddhist votes. You may win elections on that score. But, is it going to help Sri Lanka in the future? You bash the international community and say they are trying to send our leaders to the electric chair. But, you know that there is no electric chair at the ICC. They only send them to jail for a couple of years. But, what do you say on TV? You say that they are sending our leaders to the electric chair, because you want to get votes. You say, they are bashing us. Why are they bashing us? That is because all the assurances given by you have not been honoured.

Then, you bash the minorities. You say that they are going to take over Sri Lanka, because you want to get Sinhala-Buddhist votes. You may win elections but the damage you are doing to the country is irreversible. Please remember that. It is irreversible.

Though you have a policy with regard to Africa, out of the 19 African Heads of Government, only 7 came. So, have you succeeded? You did not give money to give water to Rathupaswala. You gave money to Uganda. Even he did not come. So, you cannot win countries for their votes only. You have to have a sound relationship with them with regard to trade, business and sporting activities. You do not have any of these relationships with African countries. Because, to win the international community your cause has to be right. We must be on the right side. You always say America is harassing us. But, do you know every year there is a Resolution in the UN for Cuba. The Hon. DEW Gunasekara knows that very well. Every year Cuba brings a resolution against this blockade. Cuba puts it to the UN and America opposes it every year. How many votes did America get this year? It was only two votes. One hundred and eighty countries voted for Cuba. So, how can you say that America is controlling the UN? It is not. What is important is that the cause should be just. The Cuban cause is just. It is the same with Palestine. Every year there is a resolution on Palestine and the USA gets only a few votes.

Now, the situation we are in is entirely due to the Government of Sri Lanka because you gave promises in 2009, but you did not honour them. I do not have to repeat it in detail. You know what it is. When the UN Secretary-General came to Sri Lanka, you gave an assurance that you will have an internal investigation about serious human rights violations. The Government gave that assurance. But, what did you say outside? After giving a written assurance to the UN Secretary-General that you will investigate serious human rights violations in Sri Lanka, you tell the outside world that there was zero-casualty and nothing happened in the war. If nothing happened in the war, why did you give that undertaking to Mr. Ban Ki-moon? No one in Sri Lanka knows that that you gave an undertaking to the UN that you will investigate it. But, outwardly you go and say there is nothing to investigate and nothing happened. How can you go on like that? [Interruption.] After the President came to Sri Lanka; that was drafted by you.

I think we are on a very difficult wicket. I always tell you that there are serious allegations against Sri Lanka and you all always try to downplay it. That is unfair by the country, because I feel that the country is in a very serious situation. Last year, I told you that we are heading in Sudans way; East Timors way and you did not accept it. You said that I am an alarmist.

I would like to table* the Commission on Human Rights Resolution 1997/63 on the situation of human rights in East Timor.

East Timor was accused of certain violations of human rights of a much lesser degree than in Sri Lanka. Look at this Resolution on the situation of human rights in East Timor. I do not have the time to read it. It refers to violations of human rights in East Timor including extrajudicial killings, disappearances, torture and arbitrary detention. Do we not have these on the Resolution against Sri Lanka?

Where are we heading? Surely, you should know where we are heading? You are leading the Government, hiding everything from the people and you are saying that everything is fine. I am worried for the country, not for the Government, because you assured us several times that certain things will happen, but they never happened. First, you submitted a Resolution in 2009 and you agreed to do certain things. Those things did not happen. Then, you said the UN will never appoint a Committee against Sri Lanka. But, they appointed a Committee. You said there will never be Resolutions against Sri Lanka; the Resolutions came. You said we will win it but you lost it. You said India will support us but India did not support

us. So, all what you have said in the House for the last four years never happened. That is why I say I fear for my country because I feel we are heading the way Sudan and East Timor headed this situation many years ago.

I would like to table this Resolution. It states that the Indonesian Government gave certain assurances to the United Nations about the Timorese people, their human rights, extrajudicial killings, the rule of law, media freedom, but the Indonesian Government did not honour those. And, ultimately what did they do? East Timorese became a separate country. In Sudan the same thing - [Interruption.] I am not for a moment saying that the international community is right. I am not saying that they are right. But, you must understand in the international arena, might is right. Now, the Americans invaded Iraq. What did they say? They said Iraqis have weapons of mass destruction. Did they have it? No. The Americans invaded Iraq saying that they have weapons of mass destruction, but they did not have it. What could the international community do at the end of it? Nothing. They could do nothing. That is why I am warning you. We may be right but the international community is strong, and if you antagonize powerful countries like India, USA, Europe - mind you, the Timorese did not have a diaspora. They did not have anyone to support them in the international arena, but against Sri Lanka, there is a strong diaspora. So, we are in a worse situation than East Timor and Sudan. I want you to be honest and tell the President and the Members of Parliament where we are heading. You say everything is tikitiboo.

I want to ask you one question. Now, the Resolution is coming up in March. How are we to win this Resolution? Hon. Minister, we have the right to know. As Sri Lankans, we like to know as to how you are going to win this Resolution, because you lost two resolutions before and the statement made by David Cameron is like the Balfour Declaration, which created the State of Israel. Anyone who has studied history knows that it was a statement by the British Prime Minister, Lord Balfour, in the '30s that created the State of Israel. So, do not take these things lightly. I am appealing to you because several Ambassadors have told me that the Human Rights Council process is irreversible. You cannot reverse it. You may win elections. You will go before the TV and say, International community is bashing us, vote for me. You will win, but what is going to happen to the country? I want to know from the Hon. Minister how are we going to win the next Resolution at the UN? Because after that Resolution, the international agenda is going step by step. We do not have an agenda; we have only knee-jerk reactions. If something happens today, you will react. If we lose that Resolution, I do not have to tell you what will happen. There will be an international investigation and the steps will follow. So, it is a very serious situation.

Do you know that in Barack Obamas office, there are 20 Tamil interns of the second generation who are

1111 1112

working day and night for their cause? You cannot blame them. That is because you have not won them over. After the war ended, what the President and the Government should have done was to acknowledge and forgive whatever was done by various groups in Sri Lanka. That is what Nelson Mandela did. When he came out after 30 years in jail, he said, We will forgive but not forget. The President had an ideal opportunity. I told him several times. I told him here in Parliament, Be like King Ashoka of India. Forgive all these people. Say that they are all Sri Lankans whether they are Sinhalese or Tamils. Let us pray for them; let us build houses for them. But, what did you do? You ate kiribath and lit crackers. Are you not ashamed of eating kiribath and lighting crackers after thousands have died? What is your moral worth? You can pontificate. But, what is your moral worth? What did Mandela do after 30 years of solitary confinement? He invited his jailors for the inauguration. That is why today South Africa is a model; a rainbow nation. We are far from them.

After 2009, we have drifted apart from our communities. That is the truth. Last week, we went to meet a religious dignitary. Do you know what he told me? He said that the North and the South are physically linked but in their hearts, they are separate. So, after 2009, you have not won anybody over. You have not shown compassion to the minorities.

Then, you have the twin questions - reconciliation and accountability - to be answered. You have not prosecuted anybody. Even in 1971, Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaike prosecuted the killers of the beauty queen, in Kataragama. Then, when Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga became President, she prosecuted the people who were involved in the Krishanti Kumaraswamy case. And then, there was an army officer who killed so many people in the Sabaragamuwa Province during 1988-89. The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne knows that incident. But, what have you done? Nothing. So, next time, when you go to Geneva in March, they will ask you as to what you have done about extrajudicial killings.- [Interruption.] That Resolution is like a charge sheet. Whether you like it or not, you are in the dock. If you are charged in a court of law, you cannot say that the charge sheet is wrong. You have to answer it. You cannot say that the judge is biased. So, next time when you go to Geneva, they will ask as to what you have done about disappearances; what you have done about extrajudicial killings; what you have done about media freedom and what you have done about rule of law. You all sacked the Chief Justice. Have you implemented the LLRC Recommendations? You have implemented the soft recommendations but you have not implemented the hard recommendations.

You would have read yesterday in the newspapers about the ACF, the workers of the French NGO, who

were killed? They held the inquiry for seven years and they have some evidence before them which shows that Sri Lanka was involved. What are you going to say next time? You cannot say that you built a highway because this is regarding human rights. You cannot say that you built a harbour; you cannot say that you built an airport. Those things are not going to help you. That is what you say in Sri Lanka. To deceive the ordinary people you say, Forget about everything. We have built a harbour; we have built an airport. But, can you say that to the international community?

Hon. Minister, are you going this time to Geneva? You must go. Do not send a B team. Everytime the UN Human Rights Council issue comes up, you send a B team and when we say in Parliament that the B team is going, then you go. It is a very serious situation. I do not know how you are going to come out of it.

Now, there is another matter about the CHOGM. - [Interruption.] [You do not understand these. You cannot talk of Mathrubhoomiya in Geneva. You cannot say that in Geneva, my dear. [Interruption.] Please sit down.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, please sit down. Do not disturb him. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Minister, last time I referred to the accepted recommendations of the UPR. You said that you only accepted the UPR recommendations that were accepted by you. That is what you said last time. There is no definition for "accepted recommendations". The Human Rights Council Resolution 5/1 of 18th June, 2007, refers to the outcome report which has to be adopted at the Plenary Sessions. As a general practice the term used is Accepted UPR Recommendations". Once the outcome of the report is adopted at the Plenary Sessions at the UNHRC, it becomes a recommendation of a Plenary Session of the UNHRC. Sri Lanka is a unique case. During the 22nd Regular Session, two recommendations in relation to Sri Lanka was accepted by the UNHRC on 15th March, 2003 and 21st March 2003. The External Affairs Ministry slipped in not using the proper terminology for the final CHOGM Communique'. Therefore, any final determination as to what constitutes "accepted recommendations" lies with the UNHRC in terms of its relevant resolutions.

Briefly, what I am trying to tell you is that the Resolution that is adopted in entirety will be deemed to be the accepted recommendations. Sri Lanka may object to certain recommendations but that will not be taken into account. What is adopted will be the entire report. That is number one. So, you will have a problem there because you are committed in your CHOGM Communique'.

Hon. Minister, I would like to draw your attention to paragraph 39 of the CHOGM Communique:

Heads noted the 20th Anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, including the outcome of the Vienna +20 process which agreed to develop action oriented recommendations on how to strengthen further the international human rights system including the Universal Periodic Review (UPR).

So, in this, you have accepted the Vienna Declaration and you have agreed to strengthen the human rights situation in the world. The Vienna Declaration refers to a "World Court for Human Rights. Do you accept that? Do you accept a "World Court for Human Rights"? Under the CHOGM 2013 Communiqu, you have accepted the Vienna +20 Declaration to expand and strengthen the Human Rights. - [Interruption.] So, Hon. Minister, are you accepting a "World Court for Human Rights"? - [Interruption.] That is because you do not accept the UN Human Rights Council, but in the CHOGM 2013 Communiqu, you have accepted the Vienna +20 Declaration. So, I want a clear reply to that.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) I will reply in my speech. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Okay. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Talk about the human rights of the soldiers, Muslims and the Sinhalese. You should talk about them also.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Minister, I wish you well in March, the Ides of March. But, it is going to be a tough time for the country. My only grievance is, when we talk of international violations of human rights and when we talk of war crimes, we are called traitors. But, we, as responsible Members of Parliament, must discuss this in this House. We must discuss the international situation openly in this House. When we talk of human rights, when we talk of extrajudicial killings, , . - [Interruption.] We are here to discuss this. So, you sit down. - [Interruption.]

[1.46 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Deputy Chairman, we convene today as the world mourns the death of that outstanding human being, Nelson Mandela. He passed away two days ago, aged 95.

I wish to place on record our deepest condolences to his family, to the people and the Government of the Republic of South Africa. Nelson Mandela was not just a son of Africa, but of the whole world and we too suffer

1119 1120

the loss. While we mourn the loss of his life, we also celebrate it with thankfulness to God for giving us Mandela as an example of one who fought for the rights of his own people, even taking up arms at one point in his life, but without ill-will against the enemy, and most of all, one who did not wreak revenge, but corrected the wrongs and showed magnanimity in victory. It was that ushering in of true democracy, justice, magnanimity and the spirit of forgiveness that helped unite a fractured country.

I stand up to speak today on the Votes of the External Affairs Ministry, when this countrys foreign relations are at an all-time low. I do not think it would be an exaggeration to say that there has never been a time that was worse than this in terms of our image abroad. We discuss this Vote hot on the heels of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held in Colombo, and the appointment of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa to the Chair of CHOGM for the next two years, not as the Head of the Commonwealth, because the Queen continues to be the Head of the Commonwealth and will continue to lead it. This event has been a bitter pill for us. It started with the Queen announcing that she will not attend the event in Colombo. There were several previous attempts to change the venue on the basis that Sri Lanka was not an appropriate venue, given its human rights record. Sri Lanka, though, fought all of this and succeeded in hosting the event, and thought its success lay in only warding off these challenges. Now that the event has been held, we seem to think that is victory for our foreign policy. And, this has happened even as we have had two Resolutions already passed in the UNHRC and are staring at another possible resolution in less than six months away.

Hon. Minister, I would like to invite your attention to a cost-benefit analysis of hosting CHOGM in Sri Lanka. Was it really a success? Apart from the Queen herself, several other Heads of Government did not turn up, some explicitly citing Sri Lankas appalling human rights record. Heads of Government of Canada, the largest country within the Commonwealth and India, the most populous country, stayed away. In all, only 23 Heads of Government, less than half the number, attended the event. Mauritius even sacrificed their turn to host the next meeting for the sake of principles. Many of those who attended came with apologies saying that they were coming precisely for the purpose of raising the human rights concerns. This hardly can be said to be an endorsement of our record.

What benefit have we derived from hosting this event other than the fact that Sri Lanka has been put on notice? If no credible and independent investigations are carried out before March 2014, an international investigation into violations of international human rights laws and international humanitarian laws by both sides to the

fighting that ended in May 2009, would become inevitable. It is not that we are being given barely six months to do this - the Resolutions passed by the UN Human Rights Council in March 2012 and March 2013 unambiguously stated what was expected of us. We have retorted with the customary bravado - rejecting all of this and insisting that we are paragons of virtue and that the rest of the world is doing all of this because they are envious of us.

I want to pose a question to this House and to the country: why is it that we react this way when the world wants us to investigate serious allegations of violations of international laws? The parallel is that of a husband who says that his wife has gone missing, while the neighbours insist that he has killed her and buried her body in his backyard. If he is innocent, he will let them come in and see for themselves, but if indeed their allegation is true, he will not let them come in. There is no war in the world that is fought cleanly. All wars are dirty. There are violations committed in every war, invariably, by both sides. We are not going to convince anyone by insisting that only the other side violated the rules of warfare. This holds true for the Tamil side also.

How can we then drag ourselves out of this quagmire and get on with our lives for the future? I suggest that we do this firstly by being honest with each other. Both sides must acknowledge that we did terrible things to each other, not just during the last stages of the war, not just during the 30-year period of violent struggle, but even before that.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, the Hon. Sumanthiran made a reference to say - ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) What is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) I am coming to that. Sir, the Hon. Sumanthiran made a reference to say that we must accept that both sides did something to each other. That was terrorism. That was brutal murder, cold-blooded brutal murder.

1121 1122

[ .. ]

2013 07

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) I am sorry, that is not a point of Order. Hon. Member, you carry on with your speech. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The LLRC did look at some of these, but in their anxiety to whitewash the Government on its conduct of the war, they lost their way. In any case, the Government has only paid lip service and not shown any political will to implement the more serious of the LLRCs recommendations. This again brings to sharp focus the usefulness of a purely domestic process. If we are able to come to a point of resolving the long-standing national question first, then like it was in South Africa, it may be possible to thereafter deal with other issues of justice just by ourselves. If not, we do need independent involvement in these processes since there is a huge trust deficit between the communities to make any purely domestic mechanism work.

Why is an independent international investigation anathema to us? Is it because we are worried about our own culpability? When the truth is that both sides have committed violations, we need not fear this the way we do now. When the details of this truth emerge through a truly independent inquiry, both communities - indeed all three communities - will be forced to deal with that truth. There will be no room for revenge at that time, but only for justice to the victims, reparations and a guarantee of non-recurrence. That will also then define the long-term political solution: how we should rearrange our governance structures to affirm the distinctiveness of the different peoples and to forge a truly meaningful unity without utilizing the political majority as an instrument of oppression.

I would also urge the Tamil people to use this opportunity for the long-needed introspection. Where did we go wrong? Was the Jaffna Youth Congress wrong in boycotting the elections in 1931 insisting on poornaswaraj? Were our leaders wrong in rejecting the demand for federalism put forward by the Kandyan League to two imperial commissions? Was G.G. Ponnambalam wrong in calling for 50-50, and then supporting the Government after the passage of the Indian-Pakistan Citizenship Act? Was S.J.V. Chelvanayakam wrong in calling for a federal State in 1951 and for a separate State in 1976? Were the leaders of the TULF wrong in accepting the District Development Council in 1981 and then not accepting the Provincial Council system in 1987? Were the Tamil political leaders complicit in the emergence of an armed struggle?

What about the Tamil youth? Were they wrong in commencing an armed revolt against the State? I think it is appropriate to quote Nelson Mandela on that decision

ANC taken way back in 1961 on resorting to violence. I quote:

It may not be easy for this Court to understand, but it is a fact that for a long time the people had been talking of violence - of the day when they would fight the white man and win back their country, and we, the leaders of the ANC, had nevertheless always prevailed upon them to avoid violence and to pursue peaceful methods. When some of us discussed this in June of 1961, it could not be denied that our policy to achieve a non-racial state by non-violence had achieved nothing, and that our followers were beginning to lose confidence in this policy and were developing disturbing ideas of terrorism... At the beginning of June 1961, after a long and anxious assessment of the South African situation, I, and some colleagues, came to the conclusion that as violence [in this country] was inevitable, it would be unrealistic and wrong for African leaders to continue preaching peace and non-violence at a time when the Government met our peaceful demands with force. This conclusion, My Lord, was not easily arrived at. It was when all, only when all else had failed, when all channels of peaceful protest had been barred to us, that the decision was made to embark on violent forms of struggle, and to from Umkhonto we Sizwe. We did so not because we desired such a course, but solely because the Government had left us with no other choice. In the Manifesto of Umkhonto published on the 16th December 61, which is Exhibit AD, we said, I quote: 'The time comes in the life of any nation when there remain only two choices - submit or fight. That time has now come to South Africa. We shall not submit and we have no choice but to hit back by all means in our power in defence of our people, our future and our freedom.' This was our feeling in June of 1961 when we decided to press for a change in the policy of the National Liberation Movement. I can only say that I felt morally obliged to do what I did.

Was there ever a similar decision such as this by responsible Tamil political leaders for the use of violence as part of the struggle? I ask this question as one who does not believe in violence at all, but even those who think that the use of violence was justified must answer the question whether violence advanced our struggle for equality and freedom from oppression?

What about Tamil unity? Was our disunity exploited by the majority? Was Prabhakaran wrong in killing members of fraternal armed groups? Was he wrong in ordering the assassination of Tamil political leaders, Sinhalese political leaders and foreign political leaders? Was there ever any justification for the attacks and killings carried out against civilian targets, against Buddhist places of worship and inside Islamic places of worship? What about squandering opportunities to settle the political question when the LTTE was strong militarily? Were they wrong in acting in collusion with the UPFA at the 2005 Presidential Election and calling for a boycott? Were the Tamil armed groups including the LTTE guilty of forced conscription, particularly of children? What about the quislings? What about those senior LTTE leaders who are now well ensconced in the Governments bosom? This is indeed a long list of

1123 1124

questions. But, can we avoid answering them and ever hope to be free?

A truly independent international inquiry will certainly assist us and our peoples to come face to face with many uncomfortable truths. There is no better time than today, when we celebrate the life of that icon of reconciliation who did not sweep the truths about his own African National Congress under the carpet, but brought out even the most uncomfortable truth to light, to call on all sides to our bitter conflict to move in the same direction. I do not think it is a coincidence that an offer of assistance from the Republic of South Africa is presently pending before us. This has been made consequent to an appeal by His Excellency the President to the President of the Republic of South Africa, His Excellency Jacob Zuma, to share their experiences and assist us in this regard. President Mahinda Rajapaksa must be commended for inviting an international involvement so that the different peoples of this country can view the process with less suspicion.

There is intense suspicion on the Tamil side, not without justification, that this invitation has been extended solely for the purpose of overcoming the challenge facing the Government in March 2014 in Geneva. The Government must know that any such skullduggery will only boomerang. If you make an honest effort to ascertain the truth and are prepared to enter a process with an open mind with the active assistance of our neighbour India, and the efforts taken by the USA in the UNHRC and are willing to learn from the South Africans and apply those lessons, you will have our active support and participation in such a process of accountability and reconciliation. But, so long as you continue with your present agenda of oppression and subjugation, we will resist it with all our might.

We are an ancient people who put a premium on our dignity. We will not cow down to any form of oppression. But, if you sincerely change your present direction and are willing to treat us as equals in our dealings with you, we will reciprocate and sit down with you to resolve the national question equitably and in a manner that will be acceptable to all the peoples of this country.

The Government agreeing to an international inquiry, or at least, an international involvement in the process of resolving our differences will move this country forward, leaps and bounds. Questions of accountability will never go away until we meet them squarely and sincerely. We do have a great opportunity now to harness all the goodwill in the world that is available to us and agree to a process under the aegis of the United Nations in March 2014.

One hopes that the Minister of External Affairs will take this seriously, change course, advise the country

accordingly and make history. We, on our part, will act responsibly and with genuineness and advise our people to participate in such a process in order to bring an end to the decades-old misery that we have been suffering. We have less than 6 months to go before March 2014. But, that is enough if we decide today to tread the correct path. I make this appeal in the name of Nelson Mandela to all the peoples of this country, but notably to the President and the Government of Sri Lanka. At the time of his treason trial in 1963, Nelson Mandela said, and I quote:

I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for, and to see realized. But my Lord, if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.

Thank you. [.. 2.05]

Whereupon THE HON. (MRS.) SRIYANI WIJEWICKRAMA left the Chair, and THE HON. UDITH LOKUBANDARA took the Chair.

[4.17 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Vasantha Senanayake) Mr. Presiding Member, we emerge as a nation, free from the jaws of terrorism. However, we must realize that the Sri Lankan brand of terrorism was not confined to the shores of our country alone. It had spread in carcinogenic fashion into much of Europe, poisoning their opinion and spilling over to more gullible nations like Canada and the United States of America.

It is true, Sir, that the militia wing of the LTTE is dead. However, devices set in place for the purposes of fund-raising and propaganda still continue and, if at all, they continue more extrovert than they were during the war era, in this post-war era. Therefore, they have resorted to various practices such as extortion, drug peddling, human trafficking, prostitution, money laundering and so on. The influx of pounds, dollars and francs received from these illicit businesses have gone into buying the allegiance of various unscrupulous media organizations in the West and they have made it their top priority to deform our nation by fabricating fictitious accounts so as to humiliate and bully our nation into submission.

Even the so-called "gentleman politicians" of the First World, Sir, seem to be very easily influenced and why this is so, is a million-dollar question, perhaps even a billion-dollar question. In some cases, it is possibly true that certain European Parliaments are influenced by

1169 1170

[ ]

2013 07

members of the diaspora community, who form part of their constituencies and are their constituents. But, in the vast majority of cases, Sir, it is very clearly seen that it is the old story where money talks the loudest. Therefore, when European Parliamentarians breeze in and breeze out of this country presuming to tell us what we can do and cannot do and how we should and should not live our lives, it is indeed an insult to any country with some integrity or a backbone.

In fact, after the war was concluded, the Government made significant initiatives in the direction of reconciliation and the LLRC was set up precisely for this purpose. It is ironical, if you remember, Sir, that at the time the LLRC was being set up, some of the international community expressed skepticism as to the validity or the ability of such a panel to deliver valid recommendations purely because it was Government-appointed. It is historically funny, therefore, that it is those very same countries that scream loudest now that those LLRC recommendations be implemented forthwith.

This shift in attitude, no doubt, shows that we, as a nation, have the expertise, the education and the experience to make our own deliberations as best, to suit our country. In fact, the Government took various crucial measures based on the LLRC Recommendations and have progressed significantly. The areas that I care to mention are infrastructure development, resettlement, rehabilitation of ex-combatants, who were once deployed as child soldiers by the LTTE and the language policy. All go to show the tremendous successes that this Government has achieved.

Sir, in any prolonged war, be it Uganda, be it Rwanda, or be it Northern Ireland, there will be allegations from one side that the other side did wrong. This is only to be expected and is natural. For instance, if one goes to consider the American occupation of Iraq, what about the horrendous accusations that were launched against the American troupes there? It was not only alleged that the American troupes butchered thousands of innocent Iraqis, but also cut off their fingers as war trophies. What did the American Government do in that scenario? They held a swift inquiry, in which they concluded every single American troupe to have been innocent. We are not afraid of inquiries in this country, but what we state is, we need clear evidence to have inquiries of that sort. Empty allegations cannot suffice in a forum of common sense. Doctored tapes, fabricated accounts, falsified documentaries are not credible. It is even less credible if the producer of these happens to be a sensationalist entertainment channel with dubious credibility even within the country that it is based in.

Sir, Sri Lanka is a country that values its traditions; it certainly values the tradition of democracy. It is a country that has enjoyed universal franchise from as far back as 1931. In pursuance of these ideals of democracy

and justice, if there is anything or anyone to be investigated, whether it be the armed forces or the highest in the land, we are prepared to do it, but not on false evidence and fictitious allegations. Let it not be mistaken, we are not afraid of any investigation and are quite happy to conduct those ourselves because we are a civilized nation and not because we need to dance to the tune of a most ungentlemanly Englishman who was here not so long ago, an Englishman, I might add, who did not appreciate to act as a dignified guest to a hospitable host.

Sir, I take this opportunity also to address the TNA and, particularly, ask the Members of it to join the PSC. It is vital that they participate in those deliberations. The victory in the North at the recently-conducted provincial poll sends us a clear message and it is a message that we, in Government, and all the people of Sri Lanka respect. However, the TNA must also acknowledge the fact that the Government party came second, albeit a distant second. But, between the TNA and the Government party, they polled 97 per cent of all the votes polled in the North. This is quite significant and imposes an obligation on both parties to work with each other without petty differences in the interest of the people, they say and claim to represent. It is clear that there may be differences. However, let me say on a lighter note that if a honeymoon couple were to have problems, those must be resolved by those two alone. An interfering mother-in-law from outside will simply be unable to bring about marital bliss.

Sir, the last phase of the war saw regional neighbours like India and Pakistan extend tremendous support to Sri Lanka. This was largely due to the fact that President Rajapaksa did not act as a local politician, but as an international Statesman and was able to secure their support.

Let us not be hoodwinked by those who know little or nothing about international politics when they advocate the marginalization of India. India is a fast-emerging super power, not just within the region but in a global context and this can stand to our benefit, and not to our detriment if we are wise about it. Of course, India will have internal complexities. But, in the past, astute leaders like Right Hon. D.S. Senanayake, during post-Independence worked with his counterpart Jawaharlal Nehru, as did Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaike work very closely with Indira Gandhi, as did his Excellency during the last phase of the war. Even in resolving the Kachchatheevu sovereignty issue between our countries, the Indira Gandhi-Sirimavo Bandaranaike relationship contributed largely so that it did not evolve into an international dispute and was settled most amicably. Speaking of the Kachchatheevu dispute, Mrs. Bandaranaike also consulted the Leader of the Opposition Dudley Senanayake every step of the way and received his fullest cooperation and support in resolving foreign policy and the India policy and the international problem that we were faced with at that time.

1171 1172

The present Opposition would do well to take a leaf out of that book. We see the present Opposition engaging in opposing the Government in anything and everything internally, we can condone that. However, when they take matters overseas and try to sabotage international efforts, this puts the main Opposition in very poor light indeed. It is perhaps a fact that they cannot win the hearts and minds of people and the fact that they cannot win elections that has led them to behave in this manner where they seem to hope that an intervening power will bring about regime changed and install them in Government. This is much like a man slipping off a slippery slope and in his sheer desperation clinging on to a fragile fern so that he may not fall into an abyss of darkness.

Sri Lanka has for years enjoyed a very strong and solid relationship with China. His Excellencys vision has facilitated that friendship to go stronger and become more significant.

I am reminded of the Rubber-Rice Pact that was signed between us and China in 1952, and, may I say, my great uncle R.G. Senanayake also had a significant role in that. We also remember with much gratitude the support extended to the governments of Mrs. Bandaranaike by the Chinese and the BMICH and Nelum Pokuna stand as monuments in memory of that strong friendship between our nations.

I think I would not do justice if I do not say a few words about CHOGM and congratulate His Excellency, the present Chairperson. I was fortunate in being able to participate in the main event at Nelum Pokuna as I was at the Youth Forum in Hambantota as much as the Business Forum in Hotel Cinnamon Grand, and I must say that all these events were an unqualified success and have gone in to prove that Sri Lanka is ready to take on the world and become the "Wonder of Asia". I congratulate everyone in that team and everyone who made an effort and contribution in that respect.

I wish to also take this opportunity to say a word about one of our best Ambassadors, because the High Commissioner, Dr. Chris Nonis' name has been used in an unfortunate and unwarranted manner by the Opposition.

Perhaps, they believe that by removing our best ambassadors that they can reach their objectives of destabilizing this country very, very fast. But, I wish to state that this is another daydream, one of the usual daydreams, which is not going to be a reality. The Hon. Member also went on to state that Dr. Chris Nonis has moved to London, lock, stock and barrel. I think he said something like or something to that effect, referring to the fact that he has gone with his family and children.

If he knew anything about Dr. Chris Nonis, the Hon. Member would know that Dr. Chris Nonis is a bachelor and has not taken his wife and children and gone. He would also do well to realize that Dr. Chris Nonis main source of income is derived from our country, from our tea plantations. He is in fact the head of a huge entity in Sri Lanka called Mackwoods Have you heard of it? I hope you have.

I wish to finally end saying, let it be known to all who believe that they may inflict a proxy war against our nation that we will stand united as one country. We will stand united to defend it. I wish to quote a great British Prime Minister, a Prime Minister who is not only very great, but far more distinguished than David Cameron could ever be. I mean none other than Sir Winston Churchill himself and he was not only a great Prime Minister, but was a Prime Minister when Britain was truly great. I wish to quote him:

"We shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender."

Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . [.. 4.31] ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) , . . .. , , ,. .

The Sunday Leader online newspaper of 26th February, 2012 states in a news report titled Government publishes War Death Toll Statistics, I quote:

The death statistics were the most sensitive, with the report stating that in the first five months of 2009 - the climax of the war - about 7,400 people died of undefined or other causes.

It further states, I quote:

The figures also showed that more than 2,600 other people went missing throughout 2009.

The DailyFT online newspaper of 2nd October, 2013 states, I quote:

A panel of experts appointed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported in 2011 that as many as 40,000 civilians were killed in the final five months of war - a figure Peiris dismissed as pure conjecture.

It further states, I quote:

The government has estimated about 9,000 people perished in those months.

Peiris said as the war neared its end, the British and French foreign ministers had urged President Mahinda Rajapaksa to halt the offensive against the cornered rebels because of concerns for an estimated 300,000 Tamil civilians with them. Peiris said those Tamils had been used as human shields, and the Tigers had gunned down those that sought safety on the government side, so the president decided to press on.

If he had called it off, the war would still be going on. ........

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, this is just the last comment.

Hon. Yogarajan, on the other day I had a conversation with you. There, you made a point to me about the victory parade and I am not going to disclose that here.

Let me conclude my speech - I wish I had more time - by paying a tribute to the late Nelson Mandela who, I would say, did the longest walk for freedom. What amazes me in his personality is the fact that after spending almost 28 years in Robben Island, once he was released he had not an iota of vengeance. So, after quoting a part of his speech, I will conclude. This quote answers the question I should have posed to you, in ample. This is the speech, which was delivered by Nelson Mandela on the 27th of April, 1998 at the South African Freedom Day, I quote: On this Freedom Day, the Parade and the streets of Cape Town are alive with the unity in diversity of a society at peace with itself because the rights of all are respected. The diversity of colours and languages once used to divide us are now a source of strength. The basic law of our land, our Constitution, declares that we are all one. We have been liberated from a system that held us all in its chains, free at last to be who and what we really are, secure in the respect others have for our cultures and religions.

I think that answers my question. We have demonstrated our willingness for proper reconciliation. All we are waiting is for an active participation from your side of the table. Bring that and we are ready to sit down and finish this problem. But, have the courage to relieve your own people from the misery that they have undergone for the last 30 years and that lies with you, and not with us.

Thank you. [5.34 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Deputy Chairman, I am happy to follow the de facto minister of External Affairs as he reflected the view of the Government, and I am sure most of the backbenchers are there to listen to what he said, and not to the erudite Scholar, the Minister of External Affairs. Hon. Minister of External Affairs, we have been always saying that our foreign policy should be fashioned to meet the domestic requirement. But, sadly this is not taking place; whether it is economic development, a diplomatic engagement or whether it is trying to take advantage of the geographic location, they are the most important things that we have got to do. Unfortunately, none of these factors seem to be taken into account.

The foreign policy of this country is the biggest problem that we are facing today. While little Sri Lanka is basically struggling to come out of the militaristic victory which has taken place, the foreign policy has been pushing the little country back and not able to shine as the "Wonder of Asia."

Let me also start off by conveying my deepest sympathies to the South Africans on the demise of Nelson Mandela, a Statesman, who came into the world, fought on behalf of his citizens, went into jail and then led his nation to the greatest victory; he is no more with us. I think he is a leader that many have to emulate, especially the rulers and also to take note, as the Hon. Sajin De Vaas Gunawardena mentioned, when he left jail, he had no animosity towards anyone.

Going on further, I thought that the Minister of External Affairs has a challenge only from the Hon. Sajin De Vaas Gunawardena as a de facto minister. The Hon. Neomal Perera is the standard beneficiary because when everybody is travelling worldwide, he is the acting Minister. Now, we have a bigger threat from a backbencher such as the Hon. J.R.P. Sooriyapperuma who challenges and is exactly in line with the "Mahinda Chintana". So, these are the types of things that are projected to the world and makes our little Sri Lanka a vulnerable state. These types of stupid statements that are made are the ones that antagonize the good relationship with our best of friends.

You must be able to catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. You do not need to basically put our foreign policy into test. This is the time we require everybody to move from the difficult situation that is there. It is a dexterous situation; no question about it. But, you have got to ensure that the professionalism is brought in at this particular moment.

. . . , we should have our foreign policy once again where we are friends of all and enemies to none. What has happened to the Labour GSP? We have lost US Dollars 1.6 billion. This is not for aid. This is trade, not to be paid back but only to implement our Constitution. Look at the Free Trade Agreement with the USA. When you, Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, were with us in the UNP Government between 2000 to 2004, you were helping us and we were able to fashion the Free Trade Agreement with the USA. On 19th February, 2004, when we had a meeting with Mr. Robert B. Zoellick in Singapore, he told us, You win the election and we will ensure that you would get the Free Trade Agreement. Was that not what was mentioned and where is it?

1199 1200

You do not need to bend your knee to anybody. We have to maintain our own freedom, but you must ensure that what is good for Sri Lanka is done for Sri Lanka. What is the situation with the CEPA in India? Where is the Free Trade Agreement with Singapore? These are the essentialities of foreign policy; that is where you should fashion such policies.

You look at Singapore making a statement of pretty surprise, but on the reverse, I was thinking what else can Singapore do? It is not the business of countries to intervene in others' affairs, is what Prime Minister Lee is saying. But, what if the intervention is taking place in Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka is able to come out into the world? Then, Singapore will lose its pride. That is why people like them are making such statements.

Then, look at the situation with Britain. You thought you could catch them and camouflage yourselves by buying Rolls-Royce engines from them, thinking you could fashion British diplomacy that way. But, what happened? The British Prime Minister came here and displayed the feelings of the citizens of the UK.

Then, you look at the situation with Uganda. Hon. Minister, you went with the President and pledged Rs. 100 million for improvement of their water resources. That was one of your ideas. But, Uganda did not even come for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, after your investing such a lot of money in a country of that nature. On the Maldives, you spent Rs. 10 million on roads, but the Maldives also did not come for that Meeting. Now, you have there one of Asias brightest men and one of my very good friends, Mr. Abdulla Yameen, as President and these are the challenges you will be facing.

Then, look at Iran. You used Iran five years ago, especially during the Eastern Provincial Council Election in 2008. I can very well remember, the Iranian President came here and said that he would give money for the expansion of the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery. But, what happened? You tried to take Iran's side and fight the USA. Today, the USA and Iran are friends and what is happening to our foreign policy? Tell me. These are the matters that you need to open your eyes and turn your ears to without being, , . .That is one error you make.

Then, look at Myanmar. Look at what happened to Aung San Suu Kyi. She was fighting for human rights. She came up with David Cameron in Britain recently and said, Sri Lanka must put its human rights record right and also urged him not to come to Sri Lanka. These are the people that, at one time, Sri Lanka was luring in order to ensure that they fashion Sri Lankas foreign policy. It

was the same with Cuba and Libya. So, I just mentioned all these in passing to tell you that our foreign policy is far away from the reality, from what is required to take little Sri Lanka out into the world. Remember, Sri Lanka is in the world, not that the world is inside Sri Lanka.

All I would like to mention is, on the CHOGM, you spent Rs. 15,840,000 million and what was the return? I do not say it was not required; certainly, the CHOGM was required for the country. But, we should have fashioned it in such a way to show what is basically going on in Sri Lanka, to showcase Sri Lanka, not to have the CHOGM Business Forum, bringing in Chinese investors to show them saying, "This is the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting". All what you had to show was that little Sri Lanka is basically there. You missed a golden opportunity. You were running after unwanted things, tamashas. You should have told them, Yes, we are out of the problem. We now require money. But, you were trying to make certain that in every area the Heads of State were scheduled to visit, the roads were carpeted in 24 hours and you showed them that we are a highly advanced State. If only they went half a kilometre outside the areas where the CHOGM engagements were to be held, they would have seen the pathetic mess the roads are in.

Hon. Minister, at this moment, do not think of you on a personal basis. Remember, you are not just Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, but the Minister of External Affairs of Sri Lanka. That is the reason why I always question you. Where is your professionalism displayed in the Ministry of External Affairs? That is the necessity. It is the Sri Lankan foreign policy that is put to test. Look at the ratio of politically appointed diplomats to the career diplomats. Almost 70 per cent are politically appointed diplomats. The professionalism in the Ministry of External Affairs has eroded due to the fact that you have put in political appointees from outside. The sense of togetherness is no more there. Hon. (Prof.) Peiris, you may be the Minister of External Affairs by gazette, but this is not the mandate given to you to run the Ministry. Other people are running the Ministry for you. This is what needs to be corrected.

You had only 24 Heads of Government at the CHOGM. Most of the countries sent some other person to represent their Heads of State. You went after 54 Heads of State; that is what Sri Lanka was trying to showcase, but you did not live up to that expectation. Now, Hon. Minister, the President of our country is the Head of the Commonwealth. Therefore, we have to live up to what is expected of him by the Commonwealth.

You cannot preach to the world what you do not practise in Sri Lanka: media freedom and the independence of the Judiciary. The former Chief Justice was sacked in just 24 hours. Those type of things need

1201 1202

[ ]

2013 07

corrective action and that is what we are talking about at this particular moment.

The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena mentioned about punitive justice and restorative justice. Hon. Member, you said that you had released all the LTTE killers who were there. Well and good. But, I would ask you, why have you not released the 233 military people who are still in custody? Why have you not released the 325 people - that figure was given in answer to a question raised in Parliament - who basically spoke to an LTTEer? They are still in jail. Then, there are five people, who are less than 33 years old and who had spoken to Karuna Amman, still in custody without a charge. - [Interruption.] No, no, I would not give way, Hon. Sajin De Vas Gunawardena. - [Interruption.] You listen. Learn to listen. - [Interruption.] You can do that with President Mahinda Rajapaksa, but not with us. - [Interruption.] You are not allowing restorative justice to take place. Now, as the Chair of the Commonwealth, ensure that you walk the talk. All what we ask is, ensure that democracy is put to the test. That is what is expected.

Look at India. We require India as one of our closest neighbours who has been there with us at all times. They gave us the maximum support during the war and because of them, we were able to achieve a historic victory over the terrorists. India can do without us, but can little Sri Lanka do without India? These are the questions that you have got to answer. The answer that came from the Hon. J.R.P. Sooriyapperuma does not augur well on that score. Where is the Free Trade Agreement that was extended to have the CEPA - the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement - with India? That is what is expected. That needs foreign diplomacy at its best. Otherwise, we will lose the opportunity.

Then, Sir, I table* an article published in the "Mawbima" newspaper of 17th November, 2013 titled " . ".

Why have you not responded to that? Why have you not given in to Indias request to hand over KP? Who the hell is KP to us? He is one of the bunch of terrorists who helped to kill 74,000 personnel of the armed forces and the police. How many innocent Sri Lankans lost their lives because of the weapons for which this person collected money from overseas? Where is the Rs. 23 billion that was supposed to be seized when he was arrested in Malaysia? Has it gone to the de facto Parliamentarians? Where is it? - [Interruption.] To whose pocket has that money gone? - [Interruption.] So, on that

particular score, all what we are asking is, why are you antagonizing India against KP? Who the hell is KP to us? -[Interruption.]

Then, look at what the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne has to deal with. "The Sunday Times" on 24th November, 2013 carried the headline, I quote:

India retaliates in fishing crisis.

What happened? You get some navy personnel who are trigger-happy to go and arrest the Indian fishermen. We have 30 Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan prisons and 300 to 400 Sri Lankan fishermen are in Indian prisons. So, these are the matters over which you have got to engage with India. That is what is expected of a foreign policy, not to ensure you have a Minister of External Affairs who acts as pet poodles of the President, jumping when the President says "jump" and then asks how high he needs to jump and does it once again. - [Interruption.] That is not what is expected especially of our Minister of External Affairs.

Remember that you follow the traditions of the late Hon. A.C.S. Hameed and the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, who stood tall before the world and who were able to stand on their own feet. That is what we expect from you as well, Hon. Minister. That is where we call upon the Government to fashion our foreign policy on that basis. Tell me, are those in the Ministry of External Affairs working in the manner that is expected of them? What happened to the expanded outer maritime boundary we are supposed to gain for our country with the help of Dr. Hiran Jayawardena? Where is the benefit that has accrued to us? Owing to lack of professionalism - you appoint certain people who do not have professionalism - today we have lost that benefit for another four years. So, you have to act with professionalism. That is what is expected from the Ministry of External Affairs, not going from one African country to another asking how many Heads of State were coming for the CHOGM. At the end of the day, you displayed that - only 23 of them were here.

So, Hon. Minister, all what we want to know is, are you ready to take on the world on the basis you have spoken of? Our President says that people in glass houses should not throw stones at others. Is he basically saying that to protect himself or is he going to do what he has done? He has already done that and has forgotten what he has done. Now, you have challenged the rest of the world. What was the promise you gave to Ban Ki-moon in 2009? Who gave that? Is it the United National Party or is it the Government and the President? Who was it who went to Geneva and said, Human Rights protection and our policy would be in line with our Constitution, and as a result, we will be doing what is expected of us". Who gave that promise? Is it the United National Party or is it the President and you, Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris?

Then, who gave promises five times to the Indian Prime Minister and never stood by what was said? That is why we look a standard joke to India. They gave us one of the biggest slaps on the face by not coming here.

Now, the Indian Prime Minister's decision not to come here was certainly a challenging role for them. But, they took that decision against all odds for the simple reason that they thought they have been pulverized, at all given moments, and it is better to stand by their conviction rather than cringe and crawl, and come and stand with a club that basically means nothing to them. Where is the answer? That is what the Indian External Affairs Minister mentioned.

What is the situation on the Universal Periodic Review? You have been challenged now. These are matters that go on in the world in any case. You can say, who the hell and what the hell goes on in Geneva. Well and good! If that is the case, are you ready to challenge them in Geneva and win the Resolution against Sri Lanka if anybody brings it up again? That is the challenge that is before you. Last time, when we told you, "Ensure that you are ready for a challenge and give us also some opportunity to help you", you said, We do not want; we will win the Resolution. But, you lost it almost by 25 or 26 votes.

Then, Navi Pillay came to the country, went back and gave certain strictures. Have you responded to that? We are not bothered about what they say. This is our Mother Lanka as well. This is not Mahinda Rajapaksa Government per se. We, as Sri Lankans, also have the right to ask the Government as to what the foreign policy of our country is. This little Sri Lanka has the Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims, the Burghers and the Malays. When we gained Independence from the British in 1948, the Right Hon. D.S. Senanayake said, We have the stature and the ability to protect the Sri Lankans better than you. We, Sri Lankans, be it the Sinhalese, the Muslims, the Burghers, the Tamils, will all stand together and do better than what the British have done". Have we done justice to them? Just turn to your right and see whether the Hon. Douglas Devananda is able to say that. Go little further and check whether the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen can say that, and turn back and see whether your Tamil Friends are able to stand with you. Your Opposition Members of the TNA that won resoundingly in the Northern area are talking a different language.

We, little Sri Lanka, is being disintegrated owing to a bad foreign policy that is being adhered by the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government and you, as the Minister of External Affairs. Hon. Minister, we, as Sri Lankans and the Opposition, are willing to support you to ensure that no threat comes to Sri Lanka. But, remember to take into consideration what we are saying. You have a threat in Geneva in 2014. You have almost a hundred days. Will

you tell this House that you are confident of challenging any resolution that comes and able to win over them? If not, fashion the policy as to how you expect to overcome this problem. You cannot say, "Geneva? Go to hell. What if they bring in certain economic sanctions? You all will be okay. But, what will happen to the innocent people? What happened to the European Union Labour GSP, where we had a loss of almost Rs.165 billion or US Dollars 1.6 billion? Nobody talks about that. Now, there were 742 factories when you and I were Cabinet Ministers, but now it has come down to 199. Today, the Textile Association is saying that it is owing to the fact that the Labour GSP is not there in the country.

Then, coming on to Channel 4. Why did you say Channel 4 was a problem? In 2010, when the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe mentioned that this was a fallacy, we asked him, Why do you not take them to court? We further told the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, - it is in Hansard - "If the Government cannot take them to court, tell us, we, the UNP, will go to court". You only pay lip service to that particular issue and then that guy comes here. First of all, if he has done a heinous crime, why did you allow him to come to Sri Lanka? Who told you to give him visa? Could David Cameron tell you, "You must give him visa". No way! India refused him. So, why did you not have the guts or the spine to say, We will not give him visa because he made unwanted, defamatory documentaries against Sri Lanka". You allowed him to come because you now accept that it maybe the truth. If the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe told that it was an untruth, why did you not go to court? Two days later after this issue came out, he said, We are going to sue them in Geneva.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Give me just one minute, Sir.

You are basically jumping around Raj Rajaratnam. Why can you not go to court like the Americans? The Americans have done so. You are spineless creatures who are unable to hold onto your policies and then you beat around the bush not knowing what you are doing.

So, on that particular issue, we ask you, why did you allow him in? You stopped the Foreign Minister of Sweden coming to Colombo. You stopped the Opposition Leader in Canada coming to Sri Lanka. You did not give him visa. Why did you allow this surreptitious guy, who made defamatory documentaries against Sri Lanka, to come in? So, in short, you have done what you wanted to do and now you have to dance around to the tune of chauvinism. Thank you, Sir.

[5.54 p.m.] () .. ( ) ( () .. - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Deputy Chairman, may I begin by expressing our profound grief on the passing away of a great icon of our times, a colossus on the world stage, President Nelson Mandela, who was an inspiration to all who value freedom, empowerment, and participatory values. His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa has expressed his sentiments in two different communications which were issued yesterday: one, in his capacity as President of Sri Lanka and the second communication as the Chair-in-Office of the Commonwealth. My Colleague, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, Leader of the House also made an exhaustive statement assessing the signal contribution that the late Nelson Mandela made to the world in which we live.

In other post-conflict situations, I ask them, which is the country that has accomplished as much as we have done within a remarkably short span of four years? There is no other country which has done so much against overwhelming odds, dealing with the most convoluted and complex problems, under the most trying circumstances and achieved so much on the ground within a mere matter of four years, dealing with the fallout from an excruciatingly painful conflict, which spanned three decades in our Islands history. - - .

You cannot have highly selective and subjective yardsticks that are applied exclusively to my country. That is what I vehemently object to when I address all international fora.
