() FISHERIES AND AQUATIC RESOURCES (AMENDMENT) BILL . . Order for Second Reading read.

[10.46 a.m.]

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda - Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development) Hon. Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, I move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."

Sir, I thank you for granting me this opportunity to speak on this Bill to amend the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act, No. 2 of 1996, which is mainly aimed at fulfilling the international obligations ratified by Sri Lanka.

Sir, I am representing the part of this country where international norms and rules are blatantly violated by the intruding fishermen from our neighbouring country. These intruders not only enter illegitimately into our territorial waters, but also use the internationally banned fishing methods such as bottom trawling and monofilament nets which are known as "tangush nets", causing destruction to the entire habitat of corals and sea plants, including the continental shelf and also disturbing the natural and free movement of sea lives, diverting their direction. This has drastically affected the livelihood of the fishermen in the North.

I have taken up this issue at different levels in Sri Lanka as well as in India. I have taken up this issue with the Hon. Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development and with His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa; I have also written letters in this regard to the Indian Prime Minister Shri Dr. Manmohan Singh and to the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, Dr. Selvi J. Jayalalitha. I

667 668

even arranged two meetings between the fishermen societies in the North and in Tamil Nadu in Kachchativu during the Kachchativu Festival on 4th March, 2012 and on 3rd March, 2013. Although other Tamil political parties, particularly the TNA, have not even uttered a word about this injustice caused to our local fisherfolk, the party I represent, the EPDP, time and again, I have taken up this matter and stood firmly on our stand on this issue.

In spite of my party, the EPDP, standing up for the rightful thing irrespective of the consequences, I understand, Sir, that the Hon. Sajith Premadasa, during "Oral Answers to Questions" on 25th October, 2013, had raised issues tarnishing the image of my party. Unfortunately, I was not in the House at that time and I am thankful to the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena for answering that question on behalf of the Hon. Prime Minister, revealing the truth about the EPDP.

Nevertheless, I wish to take this opportunity, Sir, to enlighten the Hon. Sajith Premadasa, who is aspiring to become the leader of the UNP, on the issues raised by him in this House with regard to the EPDP during the course of the Question Time. With regard to his query on the course of action taken by the Government on the recommendation made in the LLRC Report about the EPDP, I wish to categorically state that although we welcome the recommendations in the LLRC Report, the allegations made against the EPDP in that have been made with an ulterior motive. To prove this, I brought to the notice of this House, with audio and its transcript evidence, the discrepancy in what really transpired when I gave evidence and the paraphrases stated in the Report as being conversations between the Members of the Commission and me.

During the course of my speech in Tamil on 4th April, 2012 in this House, I stated as follows: In the meantime, I wish to make a statement with regard to the allegations levelled against the EPDP in the LLRC Report. The LLRC has attempted mudslinging on us by referring to questions that were never put to me and by misquoting the conversation between the Commissioners and me when I gave evidence before the Commission. In order to prove my innocence, I submit to the House the audio recording of my oral submission, a copy of its transcript and excerpts from the LLRC Report containing allegations against the EPDP. I also wish to inform the House that I am going to take legal action in this regard. We feel that the allegations against the EPDP in the Report have been made with an ulterior motive. The LLRC Report was submitted to Parliament only on 17th December, 2011, whereas long before that, on 22nd November, 2011, an English newspaper had published that there is an allegation against the EPDP in the Report". That is what I stated in Parliament on that day. I

really sought legal advice to initiate a lawsuit against the LLRC, but I was advised that since the Commission is no more in existence, it may not be possible to take such legal action.

With regard to the Hon. Sajith Premadasa's repeated allegation during the course of the Question Time on that day regarding the EPDP, that it was involved in violence, I wish to inform the Hon. Member that all these are politically motivated allegations. During the tenure of office of the Hon. Sajith Premadasa's father, the late President Premadasa, similar allegations were made against us that his father was using us as a "killer squad" to take revenge on his political opponents. Will the Hon. Sajith Premadasa agree that his father would have ever made such a request? Neither did his father request us to indulge in violence against his opponents nor did we carry out any such acts. I have a newspaper clipping of the "Lakdiva" of June, 1994 wherein the lead news was that his father, the late President Premadasa, contracted my party to murder the late General Denzil Kobbekaduwa and promised to give 60 boats as a gift of gratitude for it. Will he agree that his father would have done it? Similarly, I have newspaper clippings of the "Aththa" of the 8th and 10th August, 1994, wherein the lead news was that we had been contracted to murder the then President Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga before the August, 1994 General Elections. The news states that the late Madam Sirima Bandaranaike made that allegation. Likewise, we were blamed for the murders of the late Hon. Raviraj, the late Hon. Maheswaran et cetera.

Many years have passed since all these sensational news were published; different Governments have changed since then.

Have any of them found even an iota of evidence with regard to these allegations against the EPDP? The judgment on the Hon. Maheswarans murder case stands testimony to my statement. The Hon. Sajith Premadasa has also referred to the violent incidents that took place during the recently concluded Northern Provincial Council Elections attributing those to the EPDP. I wish to inform him that the persons who were involved in those incidents are now charged before the court and the details with regard to the incidents are available with the police. The EPDP has nothing to do with them.

I am sure the Hon. Sajith Premadasa would agree with me that all these are politically-motivated, fabricated allegations levelled against me by my political opponents in order to tarnish my image, the image of my party and the image of the Government I am aligned to. With all the character assassination, I always stood firm with the party in power for the well-being of my community and my country. I would like to state what the late President Premadasa, father of the Hon. Sajith Premadasa, used to say. He said: Assassinate me if you wish, but do not assassinate my character.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, before I conclude I wish to take this opportunity to thank the Hon. Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources for his determined endeavour in uplifting the standard of fishermen in the country, particularly in the North, who have been worst affected by three decades of armed conflict. In the same breath, I would draw the attention of the Hon. Minister to the following shortcomings. Firstly, there are more than 40 multi-day boats available in Jaffna. But, the owners lack experience and resources for fishing in international waters. Secondly, I would ask him to establish fisheries harbours in Point Pedro, Inpasidy, Mathagal and Gurunagar and to rehabilitate the Myilidy Fisheries Harbour. Thirdly, while thanking the Hon. Minister for the introduction of the 25 per cent subsidy scheme attached to the Diyawara Diriya -2 loan scheme of the Bank of Ceylon for the fishermen from the North, I would request him to increase the number of beneficiaries under this scheme.

I also wish to take this opportunity to request His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa to make arrangements to resettle the people of Palali and Myilidy, most of whom are fishermen, in their original places of residence and help recommence their livelihood activities.

Finally, I would like to thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for granting me this opportunity to speak on this Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (Amendment) Bill which, I hope, if implemented fully, will help us to deal with the issue of intruding fishermen as well. Also, I would like to table* the newspaper articles which I referred to earlier in my speech.

Thank you.
