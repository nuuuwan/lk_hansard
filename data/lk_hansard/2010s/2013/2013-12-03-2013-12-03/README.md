( ) (The Chairman) . .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Chairman, thank you - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) . . rose. ( ) (The Chairman) Yes, Hon. Sampanthan.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I want to bring it to your kind notice, Mr. Chairman, that at the end of the Discussion we shall be moving for a Division on all these Votes that are being taken up today.

( ) (The Chairman) Okay, thank you. [10.12 a.m] ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, although Parliamentary convention compelled the Chief Opposition Whip a minute ago to move a cut of Rs. 10 at the commencement of this Committee Stage Discussion, my personal view is that we should, in fact, move a cut of at least several billion rupees from the Votes of the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development as the Treasury allocations for this super Ministry continues to increase annually by leaps and bounds, despite the end of the war four years ago.

I must say at the very beginning itself, that this Ministry has now acquired a reputation for being the most corrupt, the most wasteful and the most deadly Ministry of the Rajapaksa Regime. In fact, it is the source of many of the evils affecting our country today. It is a well-known secret that the destabilization and the undermining of many of the democratic values and institutions, - [Interruption.] for example; white van abductions, extrajudicial killings, other serious human rights violations, the physical as well as the technical suppression of the media, the culture of impunity for crime and criminals and the total collapse of the Rule of Law can be attributed to this Ministry under discussion now.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, you go ahead with your speech; do not look at them.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Due to the constraints of time, Sir, I am unable to deal with many of these issues. - [Interruption.] Please relax - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) .

235 236

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I am going to talk about something else. - [Interruption.] I want to take this opportunity to inform this House about the insidious attempt by this Ministry to change the demography of the City of Colombo, as it is doing in the North of this country. They are also now making sinister moves to change the demography of the City of Colombo. - [Interruption.] Prime property in the heart of Colombo is actually being acquired by various shell companies held by family members of this regime. The Krrish scandal, evolving millions of dollars as bribes, also involves some members of a family and has been discussed in this House before. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) , .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Therefore, I will not take any time to talk about it. But, I want to talk about the plight of the people in the Slave Island area, who have been forcibly evicted by the army on behalf of the UDA with false promises. It is a glaring example of attempts to change the ethnic demography of Colombo. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) . ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) In the guise of urban development, many families of mainly Muslim and Tamil origin, in the Colombo Municipal area have been evicted from homes; many of them third-generation deed-holders. - [Interruption.] Sir, many of the Slave Island residents who were evicted were third-generation deed-holders. They were evicted by caution threats and false promises using the full might of the military, who are virtually running the UDA now.

In fact, in 2007, Sir, houses of over 300 residents in Glennie Street, Slave Island, were demolished by the army. These houses were not shanties and some were actually two or three-storeyed houses and many had a history going back to over a hundred years. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) . .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) The residents were intimidated by the army to go to Weligoda in Mattakkuliya and they were asked to live in temporary shelters; they have been doing so for the last six years. In fact, again on the 8th of May 2010, 18 more houses in Mews Street - again, predominantly Muslims and Tamils - were demolished using brute force and thuggery and many people had to run for their lives leaving behind even their furniture and belongings. Subsequently, a man by the name of M.M.F. Rizmya, a resident of the area filed a fundamental rights case, FR 349/2010 in the Supreme Court against the UDA on behalf of the residents with Mr. J.C. Weliamuna appearing on behalf of the petitioners.

On the 11th of May 2011, the Deputy Solicitor-General informed the Supreme Court that a decision has been taken to construct a new block of the Baseline Road, Dematagoda Housing Scheme for the petitioners and the UDA agreed to give homes for these people. In fact, I have here the Court proceedings and I would like to actually read from these proceedings: "The Deputy Solicitor-General for the Respondents informs Court that he has received instructions that the decision.... " [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) Order, please! Hon. Member, there is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Azwer.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Hon. Member himself admits that he is discussing something that is before the courts. It is sub judice. It must be expunged. He cannot refer to it. He himself admits that it is before the courts.

( ) (The Chairman) I will look into that. Hon. Member, you go ahead. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) You decide, Sir. Do not let any asses

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] decide for you.

237 238

2013 03

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) There are nomonkeys

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] in this House except for you.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) [Interruption.] - I am reading from the court records, Sir. "........ and the new block of the Dematagoda Housing Scheme. The local council for the petitioners informed court that the petitioners are aware of the said construction of houses and, in principle, that they are in agreement to accepting the said houses".

So, likewise, these people were given a solemn promise by the Deputy Solicitor-General on behalf of the UDA that these houses will be given to them but what happened finally?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) They will be given better houses. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Once the Mihindupura Housing Scheme was opened two months ago, when the petitioners finally went to seek houses there, in total contempt of the earlier court order they were told that they will not be getting houses in the scheme as earlier promised. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) . ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, I would like to table* the affidavits which was given to court by the petitioners.

Sir, the petitioners and I went and met the fourth respondent who happens to be a gentleman called Anura Dissanayake, Assistant Director (Lands) of the UDA. The said respondent actually said that they should refer this

matter to Brigadier Samarasinghe. Then, when his office was unable, they were asked to meet someone called Mr. Prasad Ranaweera. What did Mr. Prasad Ranaweera say to these petitioners who were promised accommodation in this new housing scheme? The said Prasad Ranaweera informed that as regards the allocations of alternative houses from the new housing complex - to the utter surprise and dismay, I stress, "to the utter surprise and dismay" of the petitioners - they would not be granted alternative accommodation from the said completed housing scheme as the UDA had received instructions from higher-ups. This is what is there in the affidavit.

This gentleman, Prasad Ranaweera himself says that he has got instructions from higher-ups not to give these houses to these poor people who were chased out from their legal lodgings, where they have been living for over 80 to 100 years. These families were finally deceived and cheated and they were told that they cannot be given houses there. This is how it stands today. But, Sir, this is the catch of the whole story. - [Interruption.] However, the catch in this tragic story is that these innocent families have been deprived of a house because higher-ups have decided - [Interruption.] Sir, you know these gentlemen better than I do. They are like monkeys

performing for the Secretary who must be looking over from somewhere. They are more frightened of the Secretary than the President. These are dancing monkeys,

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

dancing for their supper. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) But, anyway, Sir, what I am trying to say is, the catch of this story is, the higher-ups had then decided to give the apartments to 237 families living in Railway Quarters in Dematagoda. Why did they want to empty the two and a half acres of Railway land in Dematagoda, Sir?- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) . . - [Interruption.]

239 240

- * . . Document not tendered.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Even the people who were living in those Railway Quarters never asked for any alternative accommodation. They were quite happy to go on living there, but they were forced to go from that land and take over the houses which were promised to the residents of Slave Island who were evicted three to six years ago. Why is this? The secret is, the ubiquitous group of Carlton companies had taken a liking to this two-and-a-half acre Railway land in Dematagoda. You remember, Sir, the Carlton Group of Companies. You and I, we remember the humble beginning of the Carlton Nursery, a little thatched hut in the middle of Tangalle. I have visited it with you several times. But, today, this Carlton Network is spreading its tentacles all over Sri Lanka and some of the best lands are now being acquired for this Carlton Company. I say with responsibility, the Railway land at Dematagoda has now been earmarked to be given to this Company. Innocent families have been forcibly uprooted from their ancestral lands because of limitless greed of one clan to divide prime property in the heart of Colombo among themselves. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Chairman) . . , .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) . . . What is happening in the guise of urban development it is a clear violation.

This is not only cheating, this is not only deceiving our own people, this is also a clear violation of the United Nationss principles and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As you know at least the officials of the UDA must know what the Vancouver Action Plan says. What do they say? Under paragraph 8 of Settlement Planning, it states, I quote:

Human Settlement Planning must seek to improve the quality of the life of people with full respect for indigenous, cultural and social needs. Settlement planning and implementation for the purpose of prolonging and consolidating occupation and subjugation in territories and lands acquired through coercion and intimidation must not be undertaken and must be condemned as a violation of United Nations principles and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

According to this same principle, the existing settlements can be improved without acquiring land, without coercion and intimidation as it is happening in Sri Lanka, today.

In fact, again I quote from the Vancouver Action Plan. Under paragraph "b" of "Recommendation B.8 Improving Existing Settlements" it states, I quote:

"The process must respect the rights and aspirations of inhabitants, especially the least advantaged, and preserve the cultural and social values embodied in the existing fabric."

We must actually respect the cultural and social values of the area and then develop that area. - [Interruption.] In fact, these were the principles I followed as Minister for Urban Development, Construction and Public Utilities under the then President Chandrika Kumaratunga. When we built the Sahaspura Flats for the shanty dwellers of Wanathamulla, we built it without dislocating them from their existing fabric, while preserving the ethnic and cultural values of the area. We did not want to send them to Rajagiriya; we did not want to send them to Avissawella. We kept them there and we wanted to improve their standard of living. But, this Government is, on one hand, slowly acquiring the land, and on the other, especially the Muslim people who are the targets, have been told to go to Bandaranayakepura in Rajagiriya, in the Kotte area. They are breaking up the UNP base vote so that they can win the next Municipal Council Election. While the Rajapaksa Regime continues to violate many of the international agreements we have ratified over the years, the President, in assuming his new role as the Chairman of the Commonwealth for the next two years, has agreed to accelerate efforts towards the ratification of all major international human rights instruments through the Communiqu issued at the conclusion of CHOGM on 17th November.- [Interruption.] . , . 17 CHOGM :

"They urged members to accelerate efforts towards the ratification of all major international human rights instruments to strengthen the implementation of rights and freedoms as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights" ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Nothing is violated. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) On one hand, he is violating the already-agreed principles and, on the other, he is secretly agreeing to implement this. Sir, what have you agreed to implement? As you may be aware, in the area of international Humanitarian Law, there are only a few more agreements or conventions which have to be ratified in Sri Lanka and all the others have been ratified over the years since 1950. But, one of the key conventions, which has to be ratified is the Rome Statute of the International Criminal

241 242

Court which has not been ratified. Thanks to the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe because of his foresight as Prime Minister in 2002. When the United Nations actually put pressure on the then Government in 2002, - [Interruption.] Sri Lanka refused to sign, to become a signatory to this. What did he say? He refused to do so on the basis that Sri Lanka had an independent and credible judicial system to deal with war crimes and other serious human rights violations, if it were to occur in our country.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) But, jokes aside, Sir, under this Communique, now President Rajapaksa has committed himself to implement and ratify the Rome Statute in this country and to accelerate it as soon as possible. He has also committed himself to ratify the following Four Conventions which have not yet been ratified under this Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes

and Crimes Against Humanity. : Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, Additional Protocol I, II and III to the Geneva Conventions and the Ottawa Convention. , .. . . He has gone and agreed to pursue the Vienna+20 process and as you know, one of the key recommendations of the Vienna+20 Declaration - it is in the Communiqu - is the establishment of a World Court of Human Rights. , . [Interruption.] That is what I am saying, Sir. While the "Nonises" and the "Monises" of the world make archaic and irrelevant arguments about our sovereignty to the fascination of the chattering classes of Colombo, the Rajapaksa Regime is cynically and willfully opening the doors for international scrutiny in order to win or retain the sympathy of the ultranationalist forces with the so-called patriotic grand standing. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) . For example, that is why for many of us who have been seeing through the duplicitous nature of this regime and understood its "Run with the hare and hunt with the hounds" policy, it did not come as a great surprise to learn that family members of this regime - that day you asked me whether it is true; I will come to this because you did not believe me. I have documents to prove, Hon. Gunawardena - have been making large contributions to the ruling Conservative Party since 2011, despite the pre-Christmas pantomime put on by Prime Minister, Cameron and President Rajapaksa on behalf of their respective constituencies during the CHOGM two weeks ago. "" . "" "" . . . Sir, I have here a letter written by a British MP, Hon. Tom Blenkinsop to Prime Minister Cameron on a letterhead of the House of Commons. It is addressed to David Cameron, PM, 10 Downing Street, London, SW1A ZAA. Sir, how many minutes do I have?

( ) (The Chairman) You have eight minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Now, I want to read this letter in detail because it is very important. You should know; I cannot blame you.

You do not know what is really happening behind that iron curtain at President's House. You dance here like fools without knowing what is really going on.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You are going to destroy the party, the UNP. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Then, you should be very happy. Why are you worried about it? - [Interruption.] That means, your heart is still with the UNP. Be careful. - [Interruption.] , .[ ]

( ) (An Hon. Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, that letter I referred to earlier states, I quote: "Dear Mr. Cameron,

"I am writing to you in order to express my concerns over recent news that a prominent donor to the Conservative Party has close links to the Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaskas regime.

I am sure you are aware of the growing controversy surrounding the reluctance of President Rajapaksa to alter his approach to the human rights of his own citizens. This has included calls for a full and independent UN led international investigation into the alleged crimes against humanity that took place during Sri Lankas two decades of civil war. I too support calls for such an investigation."

Then, the next paragraph, which is the important one, states, I quote:

Lycamobile, a large telecommunications company, has donated 426,292

That, I believe, is about Rs. 90 million. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is about Rs. 101 million.

"Lycas travel agency Lycafly became the preferred partner of SriLankan Airlines, which is chaired by President Rajapaksas brother-in-law; and

I am not blaming you, Sir, but your brother-in-law. We all have brothers-in-law whom we cannot really vouch for. But, this is what is happening. Then, the letter further states, I quote:

most recently Lycamobile was branded Gold Sponsors of the Commonwealth Business Forum ahead of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM)

I urge you to investigate links between Lyca and the Sri Lankan regime to see if there is a conflict of interest in Conservative Party receiving funds from bodies with such links to the Sri Lankan regime and their decisions in Government, such as their decision to attend CHOGM despite Sri Lankas human rights record."

Sir Jeremy Heywood is the Cabinet Secretary in the UK.

asking that he looks at this matter urgently.

I have heard that Sir Jeremy Heywood is conducting an inquiry into this complaint by the Hon. Member of Parliament. I think even for us in Sri Lanka, his final report would be of great interest.

Finally, let me say just one more thing. I am not going to talk too much. - [Interruption.] But, I would also like to get the response of the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development for this news item. - [Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) . [ ] ( ) (The Chairman) . . . . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) , . I want to get the response of the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development and especially of the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development, who is much more than a Secretary. I have seen his picture in police stations. When you go to the Matara Police Station, you could see pictures of the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development. - [Interruption.] In that case, you must have pictures of Dr. P.B. Jayasundera in all the banks in Sri Lanka. The Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development is supposedly not the Secretary in charge of the police. But, he is a very important person and therefore, we need to get a response from him.

"The Times" of London, as you know, is a very respected newspaper. It is an extremely respected newspaper and they do not write things lightly. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) . ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) What does the headline of the lead article in "The Times" of London of Tuesday, 12th November, 2013 say, Mr. Chairman? It states Cash for kidneys offer lures Britons and the article goes on as follows, I quote:

"British transplant patients are being offered illegally trafficked kidneys by an international organ dealer who promises to arrange surgery at a hospital chaired by the brother of the Sri Lankan President."

This is the lead article of The Times" of London. - [Interruption.] It further states, I quote:

"The hospital, Lanka Hospitals Corporation, is chaired by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Sri Lankas Defence Secretary and the brother of President Rajapaksa." ( ) (The Chairman) , .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, I table* it. I do not want to talk anymore. But, Mr. Chairman, this is a very serious matter. It not only reflects badly on the First Family, but also on the whole country. It reflects badly not only on you all, but also on all of us. Therefore, I think it is very important that the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development and its Secretary give us a convincing or credible answer about this allegation and if by any chance this allegation is not true, he can sue this newspaper in the United Kingdom. - [Interruption.] He can sue it so that it would not be dragged on for months and years. - [Interruption.] He can sue this newspaper in order to clear the name. * . .

Sir, I now quote an article from "The Hindu" of 20th November, 2013 written by Praveen Swami.

From Sri Lanka, questions about wars:

It is time New Delhi thought of something intelligent to say on the issue, because it goes far deeper than Indias interests in Sri Lanka. Instead, the issue is enmeshed with how India fought the wars..

Listen, my dear Friends of the TNA.

"... . it believed were necessary to survive as a nation - and how it will fight the wars it is fighting today and the ones yet to come.

A country, a nation must survive. That is the highest priority of a defence and security system that any country would want their forces to engage in.

Then, I would like to quote another section from the same article as this issue is being discussed on and off. Even the Opposition, Hon. Sampanthan, I was listening to you the other day, you also mentioned about this.

253 254

2013 03

The Sri Lankan Army claims to have been losing over 40 soldiers a day during the last phases of the war".

Listen!

"The former U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Robert Blake, sent a confidential cable to Washington, DC, on January 26, 2009 saying that the Sri Lankan Army has a generally good track record of taking care to minimize civilian casualties during its advances.

So, this is another section which interests all of us and which is being discussed. So, I hope the TNA also would understand the gravity of all these issues rather than trying to canvass international reactionary conspirators against our country and His Excellency the President.

, . I have with me a document titled, "List of countries by military expenditures" which indicates the world's top 15 military spenders. . , military expenditure as a

percentage of GDP, spending amount et cetera, . . Then, look at the document titled, World Development Indicators:Military expenditures and arms transfers. In that, Sri Lanka is far below the others. Singapore is a small country. There is no conflict there. It has never had a conflict except for a little time with Malaysia when it broke away from Malaysia. In Singapore, the military expenditure was 3.6 per cent of GDP in 2012. So, does the Opposition condemn Singapore? -[Interruption.] Do you all condemn Singapore for having a very high percentage on military expenditure? They have to secure their nation. They have to protect their nation. I will table* these documents so that you can go through them.

Sir, the Navy is there to protect our seas. It cannot be protecting the land. The Navy has to be developed because Sri Lanka is at a pivotal point of the maritime lines of the Indian Ocean. So, it is the duty of the Navy to protect our seas. We should strengthen the Navy in order to convert it to an efficient Force which not only protects our nation, but other nations also. The military expenditure of Sri Lanka is 2.4 per cent of the GDP.

I would like to quote a news item appeared in the "Vanity Fair" Magazine of 30th September, 2011. It states, I quote:

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Raj

Earlier this year, Raj Rajaratnam, founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund, was convicted of conspiracy and securities fraud in one

of the biggest insider-trading cases in the history of Wall Street. But there was another reason the federal government was interested in Rajaratnam-his alleged financial support for Tamil separatists in Sri Lanka...

That is why the Federal Government and the FBI were more interested in him. I quote further:

.... whose cause is spearheaded by the ferocious Tamil Tiger terrorists. Vanity Fairs David Rose gets the untold story from a Tamil Tiger turned F.B.I. informant.

The story goes on. It is worthwhile for all Members of Parliament to read this. I will table* this document to be placed in the library.

[11.17 a.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Chairman, I want to commence my speech by referring to the comments made by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena on the question of democracy. I will speak about this later in the course of my speech. But, let me publicly state that the most democratic election conducted in recent times in the past several decades was undoubtedly the election conducted by Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1977.

We are now discussing, Sir, the Votes of the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development and also the Votes of the Ministry of Law and Order. Our points of view may

259 260

not be the same as the points of view of the Government. We listened to the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena patiently and quietly and did not disturb him. We do hope that even if our points of view are different from the points of view expressed on behalf of the Government, you will kindly extend to us the same courtesy.

I propose, Sir, in the course of my speech today, to deal with the presence and the actions of the armed forces and of course, of the police, particularly in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. I must say that though the police may be accused of inaction at certain point of time, in the course of the elections in the Northern Province - I happened to be there quite frequently when the elections were taking place - the police officers, particularly those in the higher hierarchy of the police in the Northern Province, seemed very receptive to whatever we had to say. I also observed that at the meetings that were conducted on behalf of the TNA, there was police presence in sufficient numbers to ensure that the meetings were conducted without much disturbance. In any case, Sir, both the armed forces and the police are instruments of the Government and cannot but be reflective, at least to some degree, of Government policy. I propose, Sir, to deal with the role of these institutions, particularly during the course of the elections in the Northern Province, particularly by the armed forces.

And, in the course of doing so, rather than expressing my own views, which may be looked upon as views of the TNA and therefore not deserving of much attention, it is my intention to place before this House the views of very independent persons and institutions. I would think that such views would need to be taken quite seriously by the Government, in particular.

Elections, Sir, are a matter of concern to everybody. The preservation of a genuine democratic process is vital. It is the final bulwark of a free society. If we are not be able to have free and fair elections and if the democratic process cannot be upheld in a very upright way, this country cannot be a free country. What happened during the course of the Elections to the Northern Provincial Council, which were held after a long period of time? I think, Sir, I need to deal with that and in dealing with that, probably, the best way for me to present a very objective analysis would be to refer to the reports made by independent institutions and personnel who came in the form of both domestic and international observers. We had a team that came from the SAARC countries; we had a team that came from the Commonwealth and we had a team that came from the domestic non-governmental Organizations which monitor elections. I propose, Sir, to read to this House, the observations that had been made by these independent institutions because I do not want anyone to say that this is the TNA point of view.

May I first read, Sir, the views expressed by the monitors who came from the SAARC countries, which were reported in the "Ceylon Today" of 30th September, 2013. I quote:

The Group noted that during the campaign period, on behalf of the government, various authorities were announcing schemes or making promises, which is not conducive to maintenance of a level playing field between the various contesting parties, and puts the parties other than the ruling party at relative disadvantage. The use of government resources, including vehicles, buildings and personnel needs to be better controlled for achieving this.

The Group was dismayed by the role of the Armed Force personnel in an attack on the house of a contesting candidate, which event was recapitulated in a press conference by a PAFFREL representative who was at the scene. This was also corroborated by a reliable independent source. There was also information from reliable sources about their involvement...."

The armed forces' involvement.

"........in distribution of pamphlets and involvement in transportation of voters in support of selected candidates.

The publication of a fake copy of the newspaper Uthayan which was given considerable publicity by a TV channel was one of the glaring incidents of misuse of freedom of press and media for partisan purposes.

The newspaper had published false news of the alleged change of party by the very candidate whose house was attacked on the 19th night, and it also had an alleged statement of boycott of the poll by one party.

That is, by the TNA. The article further states, I quote:

The Group is not aware of any action taken for stopping the display of misleading information by the TV channel on the day of the poll.

There were reports of enticement for temporary government staff and involving of government staff in campaign-related activity during office time. The more blatant was the reported use of the trainee nurses, pupil teachers, teachers, newly recruited graduates, samurdhi workers, civil defence services workers in campaigning, during and outside office hours. It will be worthwhile to consider a law for prohibiting government servants from indulging in political activity, even outside office hours.

This is what the Commonwealth Observers say. There was a newspaper that came out - a fake copy of the "Uthayan" newspaper, which in fact, stated that the TNA had withdrawn from the contest and there was a TV channel called DAN TV in Jaffna which kept on publicizing that report throughout the whole day. I sent a fax to the Commissioner of Elections with regard to that matter. I will place that matter before the House before I finish my speech. This was the way in which the elections were conducted in the Northern Province and this report refers to the role of the armed forces and also the Government servants in regard to the manner in which these elections were conducted. There were a few questions asked from the Commonwealth Observers, Sir.

261 262

[ . ]

2013 03

I will read some of those paragraphs which clearly indicate what the Commonwealth Observers have suggested. What they have suggested is that the Seventeenth Amendment must be restored and that the Commissioner of Elections must be given a much more effective hand in regard to the conduct of free and fair elections in terms of the powers that had been conferred upon him by the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution, which unfortunately had been taken away later.

I will just read one answer given by the former Chief Elections Commissioner of India in an interview with "Ceylon Today", to a simple question which will put the matter beyond doubt, Sir. I quote:

In simple terms, the 17th Amendment should be implemented giving autonomy to the Elections Commissioner.

Again he says, I quote:

Instead of a long-winded answer I will simply put it as Over-arching Powers powers or better still, provisions envisaged under the 17th Amendment for an independent elections commission.

He also talks of the violation of the no-campaign rule by the Government party members and the fact that the Commissioner of Elections does not have effective control over the police force during elections after the repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment and the enactment of the Eighteenth Amendment. These are fundamental, Sir, because these are provisions that will ensure that democracy is preserved in this country by guaranteeing free and fair elections, which are necessary if there is to be a free society in this country.

Now, I will come on to the Report of the Commonwealth Observer Mission. They have also made some comments in regard to the way in which the Northern Provincial Council Elections were conducted.

They state in the course of their Report, I quote:

The Commissioner of Elections wrote to the Secretary-General of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and the National Organiser of the UPFA on 9 September 2013, noting that uniformed men were carrying out campaign activities for one of the alliances candidates, Mr. M. Remaddious. According to reports of domestic observer groups accredited by the Commissioner of Elections, activities in support of this candidate included organising large campaign meetings. The Mission saw widely available photographic evidence to support this assertion. These reports include reference to local election officials being obstructed from doing their duty in enforcing relevant regulations.

We also heard representations that uniformed personnel were distributing building materials to communities in the presence of the said candidate.

The Mission was told by a local official that the Grama Niladari had, in some villages in the Province, been approached by the military for a copy of the electoral register. Furthermore, in some instances this had been provided, and that it was subsequently used to conduct house-to-house investigation with a view to influencing the electoral outcome. An election official spoken to was directly approached for a copy of the electoral register by the military.

These are independent reports of independent Observers who came to this country. I do not want to unnecessarily blame the military but according to the Observers, this is what the military has done, they have gone to the extent of getting hold of electoral registers and campaigning with them. Can anyone say that this is part of military duty?

Sir, the Report goes on to state further, I quote:

In addition to this, persons employed by the military, including the frequently mentioned Civil Defence Force, were reported by domestic observer groups to have carried out door-to-door campaigns in the Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu Districts on 5 and 6 September 2013.

There was a house of a candidate that was attacked on the night of the 19th and a domestic observer from the PAFFREL who rushed there to investigate what really happened was also attacked apparently by the military.

The Report goes on to state further, I quote:

The Mission heard numerous representations from political parties and civil society groups about the voters fear of reprisals in the light of the electoral outcome, based on an apparently widely spread rumour that voting could be traced.

So, people were made to fear that if they voted in a particular way, how they voted could be ascertained and there could be consequences which could make them victims. Of course, I must say that the observers have commented very favourably on the performance of duties by the Commissioner of Elections, his staff and the officials who were responsible for polling and counting in the Northern Province, which clearly shows that they were prepared to recognize the good work of certain officials. But, they considered that it was their duty to point out several other things that had taken place.

Again the Report states, I quote:

These positive achievements were undermined by a compromised pre-election environment. Key concerns included the heavy presence and influence of the military, including persistent reports of overt military support for particular candidates, reported cases of the military actually campaigning for selected candidates, and military involvement in the intimidation of the electorate, party supporters and candidates.

The role of the military in the electoral campaign was consistently described to the Mission as a significant obstacle to a credible electoral process.

Furthermore, the fundamental freedoms of association and assembly were constrained in the pre-electoral period. Opposition candidates and their supporters, as well as voters at large, faced instances of intimidation and harassment, and the freedom to hold campaign meetings and openly interact with the electorate was restricted.

There were numerous reported cases of misuse of public resources, ranging from misuse of government personnel, vehicles and facilities for partisan political activity to inducements offered to public officials and voters, including conditional job offers, conditional higher salaries and the cancellation of loans. The media environment appeared constricted."

263 264

"The 18th Amendment to the Constitution, enacted in 2010, undermined the constitutional and legal framework for a credible and competitive election. In particular, the provision for an independent Electoral Commission has been negated.

Furthermore, there was an inadequate enforcement of existing laws. The Report goes on to state, I quote:

In this context, while voters on Election Day were able to express their will, serious and fundamental shortcomings in the equally important pre-election period meant that in our overall assessment, the 21 September 2013 Northern Provincial Council Elections did not fully meet key benchmarks for democratic elections.

This is a Report of the Commonwealth Observer Mission. So, I do not think that this is an acceptable state of affairs in this country. Given the fact that 2014 is generally looked upon as an election year where elections will take place in other parts of the country, not merely other Provincial Council Elections, there could be bigger elections. If this is how democracy is going to be practised, that may not be very desirable; it may not be a very good thing.

Our own domestic organization, the PAFFREL also made its comments known. It has issued a report where the same matters have been reiterated in perhaps a more effective way as they were able to interact with the people much better and get more information. So, Mr. Chairman, this is a matter of grave concern, because if this type of thing is allowed to go on - CaFFE also confirms that.

The CaFFE Interim Report on Sri Lanka NPC Election 2013: Signs of Hope Over the Broken Palmyrah Towards a Civic Administration for the Northern Province states, I quote:

CaFFE observers confirmed that the Military attempted to procure a copy of the Voters Registry through Grama Niladaris, Divisional Secretaries and Election Officials. The Military officially requested the Jaffna Elections Commissioner for a copy, which the Commissioner Mr. Achchudan rejected by saying, The Army has nothing to do with this election. Similar attempts were made to obtain the Registry through Grama Niladaris in Mullaitivu.

The report continues to state, I quote:

The Northern Province is the most highly militarized region in the country. There are close to 30 Army camps along the A-9 road from Vavuniya to Jaffna.

CaFFE observer in the North reported 18 incidents where unidentified men who have short hair that walk according to marching rhythm were conducting propaganda activities in Jaffna, Kilinochchi, and Mullativu on September 19. All propaganda activities were to stop on 18th September..

So, this is how the military has been behaving and this is how they have been involved in the elections. We won 30 seats out of 38 seats. - [Interruption.] I cannot hear you, Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, but I would like not to be disturbed.

( ) (The Chairman) Yes, Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I would like to say that you have a lot of experience about elections in the North. Whatever these people say, there may be some truth in that, you will have to admit the more basic fact, that this election comparatively was a free and fair election. You will have to admit that. - [Interruption.] So, you are admitting that. We have to make progress slowly.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I will answer you. We are discussing the Defence Vote. We are discussing the military. I must say that the election day was reasonably free and fair but even on election day if you go through the reports, you will find that there were military personnel standing outside the polling booths to interfere. I am saying, we can have political rivalry but if the presence of the military in Jaffna, when it is looked upon as being oppressive, in such a way even during an election campaign so as to influence a result through a process of intimidation and coercion, is that acceptable? Is that acceptable? Can we permit that? If that type of thing is going to happen in the Northern Province, in the course of the Northern Provincial Council Elections, what guarantee is there that it is not going to happen in Kandy in time to come? It will not take too long. It can happen in any part of the country. Involvement by the military in this way in the election process is totally unacceptable and must be stopped. It is indicative of the excessive, oppressive military presence in the North and the thinking on the part of the military that they are entitled to control and determine all activities in that territory. That is unacceptable. That is the point I seek to make, Sir. Who was responsible for this? Was it the Army Commander in Jaffna? Was it the Governor who was the former Army Commander who campaigned for the ruling party? The present Governor of the Northern Province campaigned for the ruling party.

() ( ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara - Deputy Minister of Labour and Labour Relations) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Chairman) What is your point of Order?

265 266

[ . ]

2013 03

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara) A person of your calibre and stature should not give false information. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Can the Government absolve itself from responsibility -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara) The army has not done that. Do not give false information. You are misleading the House and the public. Therefore, please do not give false information.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Sampanthan, you carry on. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you, Sir.

Sir, I want to deal with a certain other question. That is the plight of civilians, particularly women, and civilian activities including IDPs - Internally Displaced People, their livelihood, their freedom of movement and the ability to lead a life with self-respect and dignity in the Northern and Eastern Provinces in the present militarized situation when discussing the Vote for the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development.

I have been careful, Sir, in the course of whatever speech I made in Parliament about my comments in relation to the military. I am aware that it is a sensitive subject. I also aware that there are many young men who were involved. I must say that, perhaps, a very large number of them are well behaved disciplined people. Sometimes, when we keep them unnecessarily in a territory for our own political purposes, they might get a little confused with regard to their role, but left to themselves, they may be decent men, decent young men. But, there has been no question about it. There can also be a certain number of bad eggs. That could be quite a number, particularly if the military is sought to be used, in a way in which they should not be used. That number can increase.

I propose to deal with this matter not by giving you the TNA view on some of these questions but we are referring to reports of independent institutions which interact with the Government and which the Government interacts with. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in a Report has stated, I quote:

"Key concerns Outlined and underpinning this updates Are as follows:

Pervasive presence of the Military in all aspects of life engenders a feeling of insecurity with persistent monitoring, registration and harassment of IDP and returnee populations by state officials.

Continuing insecurity of women, particularly women-headed households and single women, and inadequate monitoring, prevention and response to Sexual and Gender Based Violence. (SGBV)

Arbitrary displacement of IDPs due to continuing military appropriation and extrajudicial acquisition of private residential and farming lands.

This is not what the TNA is saying. This is what the UN High Commissioner for Refugees is saying. I will gone on to the next comment that this organization has made.

Using data collected by UNHCRs survey, there is evidence that formal obstacles on the part of the Government restrict returnees and IDPs access to employment and livelihoods. Indeed, 18% of respondents noted military involvement in farming or fishing - with the highest percentage coming from Kilinochchi (25%) Mullaitivu (26%), and Mannar (21%) . Although a lower amount of total respondents (6%) reported military involvement in commercial enterprises, 14% of respondents from Mullaitivu and 10% from Killinochchi reported their involvement in commercial activities.

The military is involved in farming; the military is involved in fishing; the military is involved in commercial activities. This is having an impact on the livelihood of returnees. Can this be allowed? Must this continue? These are the questions we want to ask.

I will move on to the next issue, Sir. The Report goes on to state, I quote from page 14:

As noted above, a significant percentage of respondents noted that the military was involved in farming, fishing and commercial activities - thus placing a de facto obstacle to accessing employment and livelihoods by returnees and IDPs. Furthermore, according to information provided to OCHA fishermen face major challenges, not only regarding the lack of capital and equipment to resume fishing activities and increasing weather-related problems but there remains some restrictions to accessing their traditional fishing areas in some districts. In some cases, it is alleged that fishermen from the South have unhindered access to the coast, unlike the local fishermen who have to comply with regulations and procedure. Indeed, UNHCRs survey noted that 3% of respondents reported military restrictions as the major impediment to restoring their livelihood.

Sir, this is a serious problem and this is why we say that this must not be looked at in a non-confrontational way. The Government should realize that if these people are to recommence their lives and lead a respectable life in these areas, there is a need, a compulsive need.- [Interruption.] Thank you very much for your great advice. There is a compulsive need, Sir, to tone down the extent of the oppressive military presence in the North.- [Interruption.]

267 268

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Are you not defending your own fishermen in Jaffna? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) This Report further goes on to state, Sir -[Interruption.] Oh, my goodness!- [Interruption.] Mr. Chairman, may I have your attention, please? Sir, may I be allowed to continue my speech?- [Interruption.] Please answer me later on, Hon. Members. There has to some etiquette in this House. Please answer me later on. Mr. Chairman, may I continue?

( ) (The Chairman) Yes, please. You can continue. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) The Report goes on to state, Sir, I further quote page 18:

The Government of Sri Lanka should develop and offer a plan that ensures the reduction of the overall military presence in the Northern and Eastern Provinces to a level consistent with the security needs in a peace time territory in-line with the recommendations of the LLRC and as part of a credible efforts to ensure justice, equality, accountability and reconciliation.

That is the position, Sir, insofar as the military is concerned. I will now read out some of the statements made by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees after a visit to Sri Lanka. She was again compelled to say, I quote:

I was concerned to hear about the degree to which the military appears to be putting down roots and becoming involved in what should be civilian activities, for instance education, agriculture and even tourism. I also heard complaints about the acquisition of private land to build military camps and installations, including a holiday resort.

I am very concerned to hear about the vulnerability of women and girls especially in female headed households to sexual harassment and abuse. I have raised this issue with several Ministers, the Provincial Governors and Senior Military Commanders who attended the meeting with the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development. I challenged them to rigorously enforce a zero tolerance policy for sexual abuse.

There are also complaints, Sir, in regard to INGOs not being permitted to carry on their work freely. The INGOs presently come under the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development. Civil society also expressed concerns about the transfer since April, 2010 of the registration audit and control functions of all NGOs countrywide to a Secretariat under the Ministry of Defence and Urban

Development and the High Commissioner urges the Government to move the NGO Secretariat under the purview of a civilian Ministry. She also encouraged the Government to remove restrictions and create space for NGO and civil society activity that would support rehabilitation and reconciliation particularly, in the psychosocial field and to consult with and empower communities to find appropriate forms of local and national commemoration and memorialization. So, even the INGOs are being restricted, Sir, and here, I have a very graphic document, a document released by the Human Rights Watch. I do not want to comment on this, Sir, at great length, but it has monitored sixty acts of sexual abuse of persons who have been in custody. Both at official detention centres and unofficial detention centres, where the victims had been interviewed; where medical evidence had been sought and where there is proof; incontrovertible proof, a period of time as a continuing process, Tamils are being sexually abused particularly, females, even males in detention centres. The document released by the Human Rights Watch in early 2013 puts the matter beyond doubt. I do not propose to read any part of that document but this is something that we must be aware of. This is not, Sir. What I have stated today is not the position of the TNA. If I stated it as my position, it would not be accepted, may not even be considered. But, I have placed it from documents which nobody can controvert, nobody can contradict and which must be accepted as being something that is indisputable. What is happening in Valikamam now? Temples are being destroyed. Houses are being destroyed. Schools are being destroyed.

I had information that was happening in Kadduvan during the latter part of the last month. I telephoned His Excellency the President on 31st of October. I spoke to him at 9.00 a.m. in the morning. I told him, This is happening in Valikamam, Kadduvan areas. I do not think you should permit this because after all these matters are before the court, we want to talk to you and bring about some amicable solutions to this question, I think this should be stopped. He listened to me and said, I will try and have it stopped, but also kindly speak to Mr. Lalith Weeratunga, my Secretary and I will also speak to him. I spoke to Mr. Weeratunga. I spoke to him around 12 in the afternoon. He said he will definitely take action on the matter and he would get in touch with President himself. I spoke to him again at 5.00 in the evening.

I spoke to Mr. Lalith Weeratunga. He said that the President himself has spoken to General Hathurusinghe, the Army Commander in Jaffna and that he also had spoken to him, and that it will not happen again; it should not continue and if it happens, to please let him know. That was the assurance given to me. But, two days later, I spoke to them on a Thursday. On Saturday, 2nd of November, I was telephoned by people from Tellipala Hospital saying that in an adjoining village, Varuthalai Vilan, which they were able to see from the hospital,

269 270

2013 03

roofs of houses were being removed, doors and windows of houses were being removed and then the houses were being bulldozed. It is in defiance of the President's orders; it is in defiance of the orders of the Secretary to the President. Who is responsible for this? I telephoned Mr. Weeratunga - the person who gave me the assurance - and informed him that it is happening right now; that I just got a call from Jaffna. Nadeshwara College was the name of the school that was destroyed there a few days ago.

An Amman temple was destroyed, a Pillayar temple was destroyed and a Naga Tambiran temple was destroyed. Three temples were destroyed. I do not know who is doing this. I am not threatening anyone. But, I am only cautioning everyone that our deities are very powerful deities, and this may not be a good thing for you to do.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, please wind up now. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, I am winding up. Please kindly give me another three minutes. I will wind up. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) Please do not disturb him. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I have got information now, Sir, how Nadeshwara College and a house opposite it were bulldozed yesterday. They found gold there in the premises of this house. Apparently, a person who is not there now had buried the gold there in his foundation thinking that it will be safe. It appears the gold has been taken away.

( ) (An Hon. Member) By whom? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Somebody has gone in a helicopter", I am told. The gold has been taken in a helicopter. So, I do not think, Sir, these are good things. I do not think these things should be allowed to happen. I heard many people talk about the TNA today. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to deal with all that. But, you have much more to do with the LTTE than me. I do not know who KP is. I have not seen

him. But, he is your buddy. There is a Minister in your Cabinet who has been referred to the LLRC Report in regard to something that happened in Batticaloa sometime ago. You had the former Chief Minister in the Eastern Province who did not win this time. You made him win. I have nothing to do with the LTTE. You have a lot to do with them. Can you deny the fact that the LTTE influenced the election verdict in your favour in December, 2005? Can you deny that? So, please do not throw stones at us. We have nothing to do with the LTTE. We worked with them to bring about a political solution when we needed to work with them, but beyond that we never had any talk with the LTTE. I want to say that on the Floor of this House, and I want everyone of you to get that very clearly, that you have much more to do with the LTTE than I have or that we have.

Thank you, Sir.

[2.28 p.m.] () ( ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara - Deputy Minister of Labour and Labour Relations) Namo Buddhaya!

Mr. Presiding Member, in this Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development, I thought I must start responding to certain statements made by certain individuals, namely, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, who, I am glad is here in this House, the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, the Hon. R. Sampanthan and the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera.

317 318

2013 03

The Hon. Sumanthiran, last Friday - referring to the most treacherous statement made by the TNA Member of Parliament, Hon. Shritharan, who said that Prabhakaran was a hero, a freedom fighter and he should be commemorated - said that in a country, people who claim to be civilized should have the liberty to commemorate the dead. By his sarcastic comment, he has insulted our country. I must remind the Hon. Sumanthiran and all the TNA Members of Parliament that they are sitting here enjoying all the privileges and the facilities of Parliamentarians because we are a civilized nation. We know that the TNA is a proxy of the LTTE; it is the political wing of the LTTE and we have crushed the LTTE comprehensively, in style.

Sir, in similar circumstances in other countries, the corresponding political parties have been destroyed as well. For example, when Hitler was defeated in Germany, his political party, "Nazi" was annihilated. When Pol Pot was defeated and killed in Cambodia, his political party was destroyed. When Saddam Hussein was killed, his political party, Ba'ath, got evaporated. That happened to Hosni Mubarak also. When he was taken out of power, his political party was proscribed. But, after crushing the LTTE, we allowed the TNA to operate and survive and that is because we are a civilized nation. I think that is because our President is compassionate and kind and the Hon. Sumanthiran must not take his kindness as a sign of weakness.

I must also tell, Sir, that some nations commemorate the death of civilized individuals because of the contributions they have made for the upliftment and advancement of society. But, we know the LTTE has done the most heinous crimes and Prabhakaran has done every possible crime against mankind. So, we know there is no middleman in terrorism, either you are a terrorist or not. Therefore, it should be borne in mind that it is only a terrorist who can say that terrorists who are dead should be commemorated.

Yesterday, the Hon. Sumanthiran said - I could not reply to him - that the TNA will not come to the Parliamentary Select Committee because the Government Members are in majority. I must tell the Hon. Sumanthiran that he should be happy that we have at least invited them to the Parliamentary Select Committee because in actual fact, we should not have done so. As I said earlier, they are the political wing of the LTTE and we have crushed the LTTE. So, after crushing the LTTE, if we are going to talk to the TNA, it is like Winston Churchill talking to the Nazis after the Second World War. That is because the corresponding terrorist organization or the enemy has already been defeated. Now, Sir, why are they not coming before the Committee? They are not coming because at this Committee they will have face-to-face arguments or face-to-face talks. So, their bogus theories cannot be proved in that Committee. That is why they are not coming and are

giving lame excuses. They had taken advice from Thamilchelvam during the time of the war and now they are taking advice from Tamil Nadu politicians who shed crocodile tears for the Jaffna Tamils by day and rob their fish by night. That is the role of the TNA, especially Members like the Hon. Sumanthiran and the Hon. Shritharan.

I must also make a few comments on David Cameron, the Prime Minister of Great Britain. When he landed, he was accorded the same reception and welcome as for the other Heads of States. But, he completely ignored that. His response was very rude. He did not participate in any of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting discussions. He went to Jaffna, played cricket and came back. In Colombo also, he held a press conference and did not allow the local media personnel to ask any question. He responded only to the foreign correspondents. He flouted the freedom of speech of our media personnel and had the audacity to go to UK and complain about the absence of media freedom in our country.

We know that Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales also came. He conducted himself in a very regal manner, he was very charming, very pleasant, always greeting with a smile and behaved like an officer and gentleman. I am proud that he was in the Navy; I also was in the Navy for 35 years and that is why I am proud of it. But, Mr. Cameron failed to behave like that. So, that shows his upbringing and we can get a hint of the quality of the school he attended and the way he was brought up. He must know that he came here not as David or as Cameron. He came here as the Prime Minister of Great Britain. He represented the British people and also Her Majesty the Queen. So, when he came here, he should have acted and said things that should further the objectives, the role and the aims of the Commonwealth, because Britain was the country which created the Commonwealth. On the contrary, he behaved in this manner. So, I think he was catering for the parochial interests of his constituents back at home for the handful of votes which lies in the Tamil Diaspora. So, his behaviour was very unbecoming of a Prime Minister and in this process, he has brought disgrace to Great Britain in general, and also to Her Majesty the Queen, in particular.

Sir, Mr. David Cameron has also said that they must have a special investigation into the alleged human rights violations in our country. I must tell in this House that Mr. David Cameron has no moral right to talk about human rights violations in this country because when we were under subjugation for 150 years, we can remember, how their ancestors had violated our human rights. When we were under subjugation, they could not defeat us because we were very expert guerilla fighters and on different occasions, we have defeated them comprehensively. Thereafter, they aimed at hitting our

319 320

economy. So, in this process, they destroyed all our paddy fields; they destroyed all our cattle; they destroyed all our tanks and canals and killed all the men aged between 18 and 35. That is how they violated human rights in our country. So, David Cameron, whose ancestors have done this, has no moral right to talk about the human rights violations in our country. I must remind him that we are a predominantly Buddhist country and we, not only protected the rights of the human beings, but we have also protected the rights of the animals and birds well before the British. Regarding those human rights violations, if Mr. Camerons attempt is consistent, if not for reparation, we can demand at least an apology from them for the heinous crimes that they have committed when we were under subjugation.

Also, the war that we fought, Sir, is a war against terrorism. Although it is not defined in the United Nations still, the layman's definition is, "Terrorism is unleashing violence or massacring innocents to achieve a political aim. Therefore, whether the cause for terrorism is justifiable or not, terrorism cannot be justified because my terrorist today may be Cameron's terrorist tomorrow. Therefore, there has to be a concise and concerted effort on the part of the international community to address this menace.

When we addressed that menace and destroyed the LTTE, the most ruthless terrorist organization in the world, comprehensively, what happens? Instead of congratulating us, this is how the Western countries, including Britain, are treating us, levelling false allegations of human rights violations.

I do not think any other army in the world has sacrificed in the manner in which our army has sacrificed. They sacrificed their lives in that attempt to safeguard or protect the Tamil civilian lives. Twenty eight thousand soldiers perished in the battlefield and about 25 per cent of them would be still living if we had not thought of those innocent Tamil civilian lives. All that happened because of the "zero civilian casualty" concept that we were adopting and also because we have a President whose heart is compassionate and a Secretary of Defence, a war veteran, who is also a benevolent and a kind-hearted person.

Sir, it is true that a large amount of money has been allocated for Defence. It is necessary. We know that US President Thomas Jefferson had said, Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. So, we have to be vigilant right throughout if we are to maintain this peace we have got after 35 years of fierce fighting. Our military should be vigilant and therefore, our forces should be so equipped so that they will serve as a deterrent. As the navy is the first line of defence, it should be strengthened. We must buy surveillance ships, sophisticated radars and integrated

multi-sensor surveillance systems for them so that as the first line of defence, they would know when the enemy is arriving. We are the only navy - I was in the navy and I must tell this - in the whole world which has faced suicide boats and won that battle. Foreign navies can come here and learn from our navy how we fought, how we faced that threat, the tactics we adopted and the formations and the strategies we have used. In the process, we have lost so many lives and so much of naval resources. But, in the last stages of the war - this is very interesting and very important - during a dark night, we apprehended Soosai's family. Soosai was the Sea Tiger leader who was responsible for making many a hundred wives of naval personnel, widows and for the destruction of our fleet. So, we apprehended them out at sea on that dark night. Only the Navy Commander, the Secretary, Defence and His Excellency the President knew about that. We could have perished them; we could have destroyed them out at sea. But now, they are living, Hon. Sumanthiran, among the Sinhalese peacefully. That shows how we protected the human rights of the Tamil civilians even though some of them were very close relatives of the LTTE leader. That is why we do not take the comments of the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera or David Cameron seriously because we have been doing things according to our conscience.

Thank you very much.
