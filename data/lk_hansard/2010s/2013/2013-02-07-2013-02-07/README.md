( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I have looked at this Question and the sub judice rule, both. The first one, "whether a killing of a foreigner occurred in a holiday resort in Tangalle area on or around Christmas day of 2011" is not sub judice. The Answer should be, "Yes" or "No". If it is "No", then for everything else, it is "No." Then, he asks for "the name and the country of the person killed". If a person is killed, we know his name. Then, "the reasons for the aforesaid killing". All right, we will leave that aside, we will say it is sub judice. Then, he asks "whether suspects of the aforesaid killing have been identified". If they have been identified and you have filed an action, you must say so. Otherwise, the answer for that is, "No". Then, he asks about the jobs they have been doing.

So, I think except (a) (iii), others can be answered. If there is anything in (b) which is sub judice, tell us. Hon. Deputy Speaker, you can rule as to what is sub judice in these five questions which come under part (a) and the two questions which come under part (b). Part (c) is not relevant to that issue. So, there are seven components of which you can tell what is sub judice and what is not. All are not sub judice.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Deputy Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition has conceded that there are sub judice issues. If the Hon. Member wants, let him amend the Question, then, we are ready to answer. - [Interruption.] Yes, you have accepted that there is a sub judice issue. What more? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Any Minister can say that it is sub judice. So, let the Hon. Minister say that it is sub judice. If any of those is not agreed to by the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, then he can bring the issue to you. - [Interruption.] I am very happy that you have agreed that one Question is sub judice and the other four are not. All right.

( )

(The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, you and I know to play cards. I know which card you would try to play. Let us not get involved. - [Interruption.] This is not a game

131 132

of cards. A Parliamentary Question is a much more serious issue. Therefore, it is a sub judice matter. If the Hon. Member wants, he can amend the Question and thereafter, I would answer.

135 136

2013 07

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, when the Hon. M.H. Mohamed, a former Speaker, gave a Ruling on the appointment of a Commission to inquire into the death of Richard De Zoysa, he held the view that only when a charge sheet is filed, it becomes sub judice. In this case, there is no charge sheet. . "B" . "B" .. .

. . "B" Report . . "B" Report it is not sub judice.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) We have to ascertain whether -

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) No, it is one hundred per cent sure. The British High Commissioner has -

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) that is a different position. Whether it is the British High Commissioner or any other high commissioner, they can express their views. That is a different matter.

.. . . - [ ] . You have explained now. It is my turn to explain.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Let the Hon. Minister answer. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Please be more patient and more democratic. Listen to the other points of view also.

. You can go through it. I was also with you as we were in the Opposition at that time. We canvassed that viewpoint. Today, you are taking a different viewpoint.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I just want to refer to what happened. There was a Ruling given by a former Speaker, the Hon. M.H. Mohamed. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and the Hon. Minister were in the Opposition. I am the one who raised that point of Order. So, all I am saying is this. Let us study that. Let us not take a final decision today. Let it be there; go through that. Let the Hon. Member also go through that and meet you and then see how much this confirms it or not. I think the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara and the Hon. Minister have got to meet. This is not a game of cards; this seems to be a Game of Thrones here.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You are quite right. ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) - ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . Let us ascertain as to what the correct position is. [ ]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Sir, the Hon. Leader of the House wanted the incidents. Hon. Leader of the House, I will give you all the details. I do not want to make a speech in the House, but we will send you all the details. Kindly investigate into those.

I would also like to point out one other matter. My complaint on the Kuliyapitiya incident was that the police was informed of the protest earlier. The IGP's report is on what they had done later. If they had acted earlier, they could have prevented it. Sir, I am not going to speak at length, but I must thank the Hon. Minister for not denying the fact that the All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama worked for Milinda Moragoda at the Colombo Mayoral Election. All I am saying is, they have no power. It maybe a fraud, their saying that they can give Halal certification. The poor Muslims are paying a price for their greed. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I, very diligently and very quietly listened to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition yesterday. So, did I today when the Hon. Leader of the House read out the Statement, which was prepared in consultation with us, the Ministers in the Government; we also made our input into that Statement.

REPORTS OF 7TH FEBRUARY 2013 ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) 'Sir, according to the Standing Orders, I want to bring to your notice a breach of Privilege and this breach is continuing. This matter came up even when the last Select Committee sat in regard to the impeachment of the Chief Justice. As you know, the proceedings of a Committee can be reported formally only to this House. But, I find that what took place yesterday in the Committee of Public Accounts has appeared in the "The Island" and the "Daily News" of today without any such report being presented to Parliament. We know that what is reported in the newspapers is not what happened at the Committee. Certainly, we are not here to whitewash what the Governor has done. I would also like to tell you that when the Hon. Speaker comes, we will take it up with him, that we were very unhappy with the proceedings yesterday. It was I who first wanted this to be brought up before the Select Committee and we will take this up again. If they are going to print another part of this tomorrow or the day after in the newspapers, call them up. I can tell you one thing. This House would not allow a rogue to escape and we want to know what happened to the Employees' Provident Fund. But, Sir, this a continuing breach of Privilege.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I will refer this matter to the Hon. Speaker and appropriate action will be taken by him.

[4.29 p.m.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Madam Presiding Member, Even if everyone else is not doing good, I alone will. Even if everyone else is doing wrong, I alone will not. This has been stated in the booklet Heart of a Buddha written by Mrs. Shanthi.

The late Hon. Ananda Dassanayake whose death we are mourning today in this House, always tried to do good things. When everything fails around him, he used to stand tall. He was such a courageous person with a strong will. When everybody did wrong things, he did the right thing. He was a down-to-earth politician. He was humble. As a result, he would not tumble and he did not fumble.

Ananda Dassanayake is a name that we in the Legislature today cannot easily erase off from our memory. He was a former Trade Union Leader and a Senior Assistant Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. The Hon. Dassanayake had served the nation as a Senator, as a Parliamentarian and as a Governor of both Uva and Southern Provinces. He was appointed to the Senate in 1950 and later elected to Parliament in 1970 to represent the Kotmale Electorate. He remained as an MP for 17 years.

The Hon. Dassanayake was one of the eight SLFPers elected to Parliament in 1977 at the General Election. He served as the Governor of the Uva Province from January

207 208

[ ( ) ]

2013 07

1995 to 1999, and from 1999 to 31st January, 2002, he served as the Governor of the Southern Province. He functioned as the President of the Sri Lanka Independent Trade Union for several years before entering Parliament. He is an alumnus of the University of Peradeniya and began his career as a teacher.

He was a very close associate of the late distinguished leader, the Hon. D.A. Rajapaksa, whose son the present President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa even visited him when he was receiving treatment at the Intensive Care Unit of the General Hospital in Kandy. That was the affection and respect our President paid for the late SLFP stalwart. I remember many struggles he waged in the trade union field together with the Governor of the Western Province, "Jamal-al-Lail" the Hon. Seyed Alawi Moulana. They were both courageous men. Of course, the Hon. Alawi Moulana celebrated his 81st birthday, and, today in this House we wish him Godspeed and long life! But, his companion, comrade-in-arms, Ananda Dassanayake is no more.

Sir, I had several verbal duels with the Hon. Ananda Dassanayake in this House. I cannot easily forget that. In my formative years as a Member of Parliament, I had learnt lots of lessons from him. I must also submit that I improved my speaking skill - oratory - because of the verbal battle that we both engaged in.

When he was in the Opposition, I was in the Government and when he was in the Government, I was in the Opposition. He would not allow me to speak and I would not allow him to speak. We were both very close Friends in Parliament and outside. He would laugh it off and say, " ." " ." . .. - a person who jumped in front to save him was none other than the present President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa. As I told you, he had so much of regard for Ananda because the Hon. Ananda Dassanayake was very loyal to the party - the SLFP. He was a down-to-earth politician.

Madam, I must also say that I was able to do something for the past Members of this House because of the Hon. Ananda Dassanayake. After he was no more in the House and when I was the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, coming into Parliament I saw him at the Jayanthipura entrance. He was stopped by the police. He was asked to get into another vehicle. It was raining. He was holding a handkerchief over his head and running hither and thither into the vehicle. I felt very sorry for him. Immediately I came to the House and told the Speaker at that time that a school or a college would have heartily welcomed him as a distinguished old boy. But, to

a Parliamentarian, a Judge or a person holding any other positions, this Parliament was failing to offer that courtesy. I, as the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, straightaway recommended to the then Speaker that a Special Pass must be issued to all former Parliamentarians. I remember, Madam, after it was issued, he was able to come very freely and told me gratefully, " ." Thereafter, I took that Pass personally to the Hon. D.P. Wickremasinghe, a former Minister who was in Mawathagama and the Hon. S.D.R. Jayaratne in Chilaw, a former Minister of Fisheries and tears came from their eyes. Now, I must also tell, Madam, that that Pass is very, very important and useful to the former Members and wherever I go, - North, East or South - and meet former Members, they would say, " ." As a result of issuing those Passes to the former Members of Parliament, I always see in the Library and elsewhere in this House our former Parliamentarian, the versatile Buddhika Kurukularatne, who engages himself in a lot of research work and the producing of books. Also, my good Friend, the former Minister of State for Transport, the Hon. Alhaj U.L.M. Farook always comes to this House making use of that Pass.

By the way, I also should remind the House that I also moved a Motion in the House Committee and the Parliament to establish a Souvenir Shop. All the people, school children and others who visit Parliament like in other Parliaments buy Souvenirs. There are very good Souvenir Shops even in the United Nations. Thousands and thousands of our school children could buy something - a pencil, a book, a tie, some cups and saucers, greeting cards, handkerchiefs, et cetera - with our logo, the Mace, and take such Souvenirs to their villages, to their families and to their friends.

So, Madam, the Hon. Ananda Dassanayake, as I told you, was a man of great character, a man of sterling qualities. He was a man of amiable qualities and of courageous disposition. Another very significant connection of our association in the House was that there was a request at that time from the Muslim Members of Parliament not to serve ham, bacon or pork in the restaurant and he readily agreed, .

I remember the former distinguished Speaker, the Hon. W.J.M. Lokubandara was able to stop even beef as a result and we all welcomed that. At a time when the Hon. John Amaratunga and the Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake are asking for such dishes once again, we remember how much the Hon. Ananda Dassanayake respected the religious sentiments of the Muslim community. When talking about it, he knew the Halaal custom of consuming meat, mutton, chicken et cetera by the Muslims. At that time, there was no Act for this. The All Ceylon Jemmiyathul Ulama (Incorporation) Act, No. 51 of 2000 was passed in 2000.

209 210

Madam, I would like to table* the following documents in the House which states: " ?" and also the English translation of it which bear the caption, HALAAL CERTIFICATION FEES IS IT REQUIRED? and also

?

* .

.

Today, I see a marked difference. There are people - Muslims and non-Muslims - who do not know the exact meaning of "Haraam" and "Halal". Madam, you come from Ampara passing Samanthurai, Kalmunai, Kattankudi, Eravur, Valachchenai, Oddamavadi and through famous Valachchenai and Mannampitiya bridges to Colombo without any difficulty. The Valachchenai bridge was built with funds from Spain, initiated by former Minister, M.S.S. Ameer Ali. As a result, you know the sentiments of the Muslim community. Therefore, when some UNP Muslim Members on the other side were spending their time in Afghanistan and some leaders were spending their time in the gondolas in Venice, we were here attending to every issue the community faced. As the late Hon. Ananda Dassanayake wished, he would have fought along with us. I think the Hon. C.B. Rathnayake is also aware of it because he comes from Nuwara Eliya. When I see you Hon. C.B. Rathnayake, I remember a Muslim village - Hapugastalawa - closer to Nawalapitiya in the Kotmale Electorate. The Hon. Ananda Dassanayake used to help the Muslims there to put up Ahadiya Schools and distribute books to those schools. I think it is the village of the Hon. Rauff Hakeem too.

So, all in all, Ananda Dassanayakehe was a man of all seasons. He was a man who fought for what was right. As I told you earlier, he was a courageous man. He first came to know about the antecedent of the late S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike from his own father. .... . 1950 16 . . We can gauge how much senior he is. Here is a nice epilogue about him.

. .

Like father like son; wherever I meet him, he smiles. I always say to him; . I am very happy he and his family members are in the distinguished Visitors' Gallery today.

.

The other day, Madam, I wrote a book and it was released on the 31st of January, 2013 at a celebration held at "Thassim Villa", the residence of Alhaj Deshamanya S.B.C Thassim. This is a biography of Senator S.Z.M. Mashoor Moulana,

Mashoor Moulana was 81 years old. Coincidentally, the place where the launch of the book took place was also No. 81.

Here, in this book, I have mentioned about three Senators. One is Jinadasa Niyathapala, the other one is Mashoor Moulana and the third is Ananda Dassanayake. Out of the three Senators, Ananda Dassanayake is no more and only Jinadasa Niyathapala and Alhaj Mashoor Moulana are there. I table* this book for all Members to read about this most senior Muslim politician living amongst us today. It is of course written in Tamil.

All Members of this House will know what the Hon. Ananda Dassanayake has done and also the contributions Senator Mashoor Moulana has made for our country.

The Hon. Ananda Dassanayake was a Senator from 26th October, 1961 to 15th October, 1967 elected by Parliament. Those days, 30 Members comprised the Upper House or the Senate; 15 were elected by Parliament and 15 were nominated by the Prime Minister. The Hon. Dassanayake was elected by Parliament.

As a Member of Parliament, he was a robust Member, a courageous Member, a talented Parliamentarian and also an educationist in his own style. The Hon. Ananda Dassanayake served as a distinguished Member of this august Assembly for exactly 16 years, 9 months and 10 days. May I, in his own faith and belief, wish him Nivan Suwa!

[4.47 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Madam. I am making a speech today on the Vote of Condolence of the Hon. Ananda Dassanayake. Though I did not have the opportunity of

closely associating with the Hon. Ananda Dassanayake, I have known him and met him as a Governor. He hails from my district, the Nuwara Eliya District. He was a leader who came from Kotmale. My late leader, Hon. Savumyamoorthy Thondaman appreciated him as a person with simple habits and a person who was very close to the people. He was also a trade unionist who was devoted to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Trade Union in our areas, and he did a great service to those people.

The most redeeming feature of this great man was that he was one of the few graduates of that era who became a teacher, who was elected to be a Senator. He served his people very devotedly with a lot of courage. He was always a very friendly person, a person to whom you could speak, who was always willing to speak about his people. He was a person with a lot of humility and was always keen to serve his people.

I did not have the opportunity of meeting him in this Parliament. But, however, his services are even today appreciated and valued by the people of the Nuwara Eliya District. He has left his son, Mr. Kumara Dassanayake to serve his people. He was also in this House and I have served with him in this House. Today, he is continuing his services to the people through the Provincial Councils.

The Hon. Ananda Dassanayake was a simple man. We all pay tribute to him for him being so close to his people more than for anything else.

I convey my condolences to his family and wish to tell his family that we all salute him as a peoples leader with a lot of compassion for his people.

Thank you.

PRIVILEGE : "DAILY NEWS" AND "THE ISLAND"

REPORTS OF 7TH FEBRUARY, 2013

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Madam Presiding Member, the "Daily News" and "The Island" newspapers of today, 7th February, 2013 published news items in their front pages indicating that the Employees Provident Fund cleared the air with respect to all questions and allegations made against its fund management activities, particularly with respect to investments in the Colombo Stock Exchange, at the Committee on Public Accounts - COPA - yesterday, 6th February, 2013. The news items paint a picture that the EPF convinced all Members of the COPA that there was absolutely no problem with respect to its investments and the rate of return paid to the members.

Furthermore, the headline story of the "Daily News" contains a number of derogatory statements about me in particular. This is a breach of my Parliamentary Privileges as a Member who is attending to official functions of the COPA. These stories planted by the Governor of the Central Bank who was present at the said COPA examination of the EPF are wholly untrue and in total violation of ethics that is expected of such a high official. Given the ethics that we follow as Members of

217 218

Parliament, I do not wish to detail the events that actually took place in the Committee prior to its Report being tabled.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . ( ) (The Presiding Member) ? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Madam Presiding Member, I do not mind this Hon. Member raising a matter of Privilege. But, he is making accusations against the Governor of the Central Bank. It is unfounded and the House cannot accept it because the Governor of the Central Bank is not present here in the House to answer.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) It is not a point of Order. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You had better do it on your own without dragging Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal. . . . - [Interruption.] No, it is not done. You know it.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) In summary, I would like to give you an accurate account of the meeting that we had. We met under protest of the Meeting being chaired by the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, who has been given the task of overseeing the Employees Provident Fund. The Meeting was concluded abruptly upon a Ruling given by the Chair that the Committee should wind up because the Parliamentary staff need to leave while the Governor of the Central Bank was being questioned on a serious audit query as to why the EPF had purchased shares of the utterly loss-making The Finance Company.

COPA will be summoning the senior officials of the EPF, including the Governor of the Central Bank, to answer multiple queries with respect to questionable EPF investments in the Colombo Stock Exchange and that will be done very soon. The publishers of the "Daily News" and "The Island" referred to above, have acted in

violation of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, more particularly, Item 9 of part B of the Schedule which prohibits the publication of proceedings in Committees of Parliament before they are reported to Parliament.

Therefore, Madam Chair, I request you to refer this matter to the Committee on Privileges.

Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Madam Chairperson, I am very happy that my good Friend, the Hon. Shantha Bandara, has drawn the attention of the Minister of National Heritage regarding the archaeological importance of the Dambadeniya Rajadhaniya. Also, he said that the Dambadeniya was the Third Kingdom of our country and it is a very illuminating story. The Dambadeniya Kingdom was founded by the King Vijayabahu III to counter the invasion of Kalinga Magha. His reign was followed by the reign of Kalikala Sahithya Sarvanna Panditha King Parakramabahu II and it was the golden era of literature in our country. . 56 . . "" . . ? . Later, Mr. R.J. Senanayake represented Dambadeniya and also Kelaniya simultaneously creating a record in Parliamentary elections. There is also a Cultural Square project which is in the making.

Like this, Madam, there are certain other places also where the Hon. Minister must pay his attention. Recently, after the 65th Independence Day Celebration - it was a historic celebration - where you were also present. I went up the hill of Koneswaram where you find the Lovers Leap and other historic sites. Especially, a large number of Hindus and Buddhists visit that place and lovers tie things like small beads there so that their love will bear fruit. The people who want to bear children also do the same, tie small cradles for their bharaya.

Then, there is the Thiruketheeswaram Kovil. ! . , , - - . ! There is a Buddhist Temple, . . Mosque . The other day His Excellency the President also visited this Mosque.

It has now become an ancient city. The new town is moved to the other side, across Menik Ganga. Still, attention should be paid to these sacred areas so that the cleanliness and other things are maintained. There is a special place called Kadjuwatta in Katugoda, Galle. I

have visited there when I was the Minister of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs. That was supposed to be the first mosque built in the Southern Province. Then, also Godapitiya, Akuressa, Porwai Palliya, where the bomb blast of the LTTE took place. That was the last bomb of the LTTE, because there was a Saint buried there. The Minister, Hon. Mahinda Wijesekera and others were injured. He is still trying to recover from those injuries. The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie escaped death by the skin of his teeth. Porwai and such places also must be maintained.

Then, Beruwala is another historic place where the Arabs first landed. Now, Madam, action was taken in order to declare Beruwala, that part of the Mosque where Masjid Al-Abrar, the first Mosque built by the Arabs in Sri Lanka is situated, as a sacred area, and give all the facilities so that the Muslims of the area could maintain their cultural heritages. The late Deshamanya Hon. M.A. Bakeer Markar, former Speaker of Parliament took a lot of pain in order to get this declared as a sacred area and also his son, his successor in Parliament, the Hon. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar also devoted much of his time in order to improve the conditions of the Beruwala town. China Fort, on the other side of the railway line, is also a historic town. Like these, there are several places. I do not want to quote everything for want of time.

I think we have got a very good Minister, the Hon. (Dr.) Jagath Balasuriya who will protect national heritages, our culture, our customs and the religious beliefs of all the communities, of all faiths - the Buddhists, the Hindus, the Christians and the Muslims. He is a person of understanding. When I talk about the South, he will be very happy because his better half is the Governor of that Province. She has been appointed for the second time in succession. Kumari is a gracious lady, who is taking lot of interest in order to develop the Southern Province.

Therefore, I commend the Motion that was brought before the House by the Hon. Shantha Bandara. - - . That is why Prabhakaran said,

" ! ! !" There are treasures in the Eastern Province and other places.
