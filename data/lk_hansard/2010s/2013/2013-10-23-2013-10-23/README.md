asked the Minister of External Affairs:

(a) Will he state -

(i) the number of foreign monitoring trips that the Monitoring Member of Parliament (MMP) of External Affairs has taken during the time he was appointed to the said post; and

(ii) whether he is the de facto Minister or Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs?

(b) Will he also state in respect of the aforesaid foreign trips of the MP referred to in (a)(i) on per trip basis -

(i) the costs of airfare;

(ii) the costs of hotel accommodation, internal travel and entertainment expenditure;

(iii) the payments made by the Sri Lankan Embassies abroad to meet the costs of the MMP; and

(iv) the benefits that the Ministry of External Affairs derived?

(c) If not, why?

() .. ( ) ( () .. - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Hon. Speaker, this Question has been asked on a wrong premise. The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena has not undertaken any overseas visits on behalf of the Ministry of External Affairs. The Ministry of External Affairs has not incurred any expenditure whatsoever on account of overseas visits by the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, none of the

205 206

[

2013 23

matters referred to in Question No. 4 (b) by the Hon. Member - airfare, hotel accommodation, internal travel and entertainment payments made by the Ministry - arise because no expenses for any of those reasons have been incurred by the Ministry of External Affairs.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, my first Question to you was, the number of foreign monitoring trips that the Monitoring Member of Parliament has undertaken. So, now you say that that particular Member is the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena. Is that correct? I did not ask about the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena. You are the one who is saying so.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) I understood the Question. Obviously it was referred to -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I asked only a direct Question with regard to what is in the newspapers and what is reflected from the Ministry of External Affairs. Now, you have put a name to what I guessed. So, are you saying that there were no expenditure incurred by the Government on him?

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Hon. Member, I can answer on behalf of the Ministry of which I am in charge. That is the purview within which I can accept responsibility to Parliament. So, as far as my Ministry is concerned, no expenditure has been incurred. If expenses have been incurred by my Ministry, then, it is my responsibility to reveal those particulars to Parliament. But, I am telling you categorically that no expenses, whatsoever, have been incurred by the Ministry of External Affairs. That is the fact of the matter.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am so happy to see that you as the Minister of External Affairs are in full control of the Ministry of External Affairs, but that is not reflected from the Ministry. So, I am only trying to tell you that there must be a very strong foreign policy, because lack of such a foreign policy is the problem in the country today. Vacillation, convolution and the lack of consistency have led the country to anarchy. I am sorry to say that today the country has been made to look a - [Interruption.] My second Supplementary Question is this.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) These are pronouncements; these are not questions. These are pronouncements which we do not accept for one moment; these are not questions at all. This is Question Time. This is not a time to pass such -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) As much we are made to listen to what you say all the time, please listen to the question that I am posing to you.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Sure; what is the question? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I was trying to tell you that I am so happy that you are in full control of the Ministry of External Affairs. But, that is not reflected from the personnel in the Ministry of External Affairs. With all that, there is no consistent foreign policy also. There is vacillation, convolution and also, there is lack of consistency.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . . . Our country is going through turbulent times. In this turbulent time, you have got to carry the -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) point of Order . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Speaker, I would like to ask about the propriety of raising a question of this nature in the House by an Hon. Member. - [Interruption.] Wait, wait.

207 208

Since the name of a Member has been mentioned, it refers to the conduct of a Member of this House. Therefore, he cannot ask a Question like this unless he moves a substantive Motion.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Hon. Speaker, the Member can express his own view but he cannot express the views of officials in the Ministry, who have not been named. He is speaking for -

[Interruption.] Sir, I strongly -[Interruption.] , . . . . . . .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . Hon. Minister, in the next 20 days we will have the CHOGM. As the UNP, we are happy that the country has got this opportunity. There are 54 Heads of State that need to come. Today, Kenya has said that they want the African countries to boycott this Meeting. According to your Ministry officials, up to now, only 14 Heads of State have confirmed their coming to

Sri Lanka. Is this correct? How much of money have you spent? You have been doing a lot of travelling in order to make them come to the country. I hope it will be successful.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) ? () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Hon. Speaker, there is no truth in the reference that was made to Kenya. We have checked that position. There is no decision by the Government of Kenya not to attend the Meeting in Sri Lanka. That is absolutely incorrect.

[5.23 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Presiding Member, I am happy to contribute to this Debate and add something on the investments that are being brought into Sri Lanka as well as on the Regulations under the Merchant Shipping Act, which are being taken up today.

Firstly, let me mention about the investment agreements that are there, saying that they are a step in the right direction. But, I guess the focus must be more on countries that can really trade with us rather than adding numbers to the game. Belarus is a country that is basically good to have connections with, but what is the trading we can do with one another? To keep on adding such countries is appreciative and I think that should be mentioned here. Otherwise, you would think that the Opposition is mentioning it just for the sake of doing so.

I would appreciate if the Ministry of External Affairs would ensure that we have more commercialization of the foreign policy. Look at India, which is staring at us. You have the CEPA, which is being spoken of. Every time the Minister of External Affairs of India comes here, his pet poodle is the status of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. It has moved from a free-trade agreement to an enhanced free-trade and then on to the CEPA. India is knocking at our door and it is up to Sri Lanka to say "yes" or "no" at this particular moment. We must realize that little Sri Lanka is certainly at a geographically well-located place, but taking on India, I guess, is asinine. India can do without us, but can we do without India? That is the stark reality. I guess that is the foreign policy that has got to be adopted, where it must be able to meet up with the domestic requirement.

Sri Lanka is having a production base and it is far too greater than the domestic requirement. So, when there is a surplus capacity, we must create a market around us and the market that can be created around us is the world at large, but more so, with the closer trading partners. We have India and then the extended versions of such closer partners - the SAARC, the BIMSTEC or the ASEAN - and that is the way to go forward. So, while all these investment agreements are certainly laudable and appreciative, we must ensure that India is made our closest trading partner. That is where we call upon you to explain what the situation is with regard to the CEPA. For the last three or four years, it has been a no-go situation or a sand-in-the-gears approach. So, that is where we call upon the Government to ensure that it sees the wood for the trees. There is no point in signing one hundred agreements worldwide, under which you would not do trading worth even one hundred dollars a year, against what is potentially possible with India, which we have ignored or have kept aside trying to play India versus

China. At the end of the day or in the long run, it is we who would get affected. So, I guess it is necessary that we get a responsible answer on this area. We could basically see that tremendous progress can be made if the CEPA is used with the Chambers of Commerce positively contributing in the process. There is certainly a great fear, but it would realize if you walk blindly into the situation.

After the CEPA, you can also see a lot of noise being made about the Free Trade Agreement with China. China is a massive trading country and it is more inbound than outbound. Just after the visit of the President to China, I guess you accompanied him, Hon. Minister, you suddenly come back and say, We have a Free Trade Agreement with China. If you have free trade agreements of this nature, like plucking fruits from a tree; then there is something radically wrong with the policy of our Ministry of External Affairs. I do not think that that is what is required because the manufacturers in this country are having an uneven playing field. The manufacturers in Sri Lanka are of the best quality. Unfortunately, they have got to compete with other countries in the region where the prices are absolutely low. Our rupee is unrealistically high and our cost of infrastructure - electricity, water, roads that are being used as well as the fuel used for the entire system - is one of the highest in the world. So, when the input costs are high and the rupee is overvalued, you would obviously make our production much more uncompetitive against what would come from our region. This is where a huge burden is placed on the Sri Lankan exporter.

If you look at India, the Indian Rupee was roughly around 48 against the dollar just about six or seven months ago, but today it is almost at 60. So, it is a devaluation of almost 22 per cent. Now, where is the Sri Lanka Rupee? It should have been devalued by about 30 or 40 per cent, but is artificially kept at a particular point to show that devaluation has taken place only by about 4 or 5 per cent. So, if you look at the devaluation per se relatively between India and Sri Lanka, the devaluation alone has helped the Indian exporter. Considering the magnitude and the critical mass that is there in India, you are basically putting our exporters totally out of the picture. So, this is the macro picture that has got to be looked at by the planners of our country. I do not think, at this particular moment, there is proper planning; it is a knee-jerk reaction that is made. That is why it is reflected in the balance of payments. Today, you would see in the balance of payments a yawning gap, ever expanding owing to the fact that the exports are declining and the imports are increasing and as a result, having a direct impact on the trade balance. When the trade balance has an impact, it obviously has an overall impact on the balance of payments.

Now, in the service industry, we are certainly making progress in the country as well as in sending our labour

287 288

out of the country and that is the only area which has a salvaging effect at the moment. But still, that is not sufficient to cover the gap in the balance of payments. So, Hon. Minister, I am sure you have a big, contributory role to play and I guess it is necessary to ensure that we have a more robust investment drive taking place, protecting the domestic industry and the exporters' rights. Just saying, "We have this number of investment agreements" as you have reflected today - you have one with Luxembourg; you have one with Palestine; you have one with Seychelles and you have one with Belarus - would not be enough. But, are all these countries exporting at this particular moment? Luxembourg, yes, certainly; yes, Belarus is in operation. In any case, Luxembourg was covered very handsomely with the pre-agreements that were there during the period 2001 to 2002. The other counties are nice to add on to have relations, but not in export terms. So, Hon. Minister, at this particular moment, all I want to say is that we have got to move in the correct direction.

Touching on the areas of the Free Trade Agreement with China, this is something which needs to be handled very cautiously. It is certainly a boiling pot our manufacturers are in, fighting against it, but are unable to compete within the SAARC region. Imagine, when we open the floodgates into China, where you have such a lot of cheap production going on and you are able to send that in, you will basically demolish the production base of Sri Lanka. I was at a function and I was able to mention this to His Excellency the President as well and I am sure, with the knowledge of the Chambers and with other decision makers, he would put it right. But, at this particular moment what I would worry about is that a free trade agreement would mean an inflow from China and an outflow from Colombo. What is the outflow that we can send to China? Garments were being mentioned. I mean it is ludicrous to even think that we are able to send garments to China when it is infested with that trade. Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar - which is a threat to the entire region - as well as Thailand, from an upper market point of view, are going into China. There is no special relationship, which basically says, Okay any item that comes from Sri Lanka will be bought for nothing". No, it is done on market conditions.

Then, the other one you said was tea. I mean, China is the biggest tea manufacturing country and on that basis Sri Lanka can certainly send quality tea, for sure. But, it is not the quantity, it is not the volume that is there, it is both the overall value and quantity that have to be looked at. So, being a former Minister of Trade, I feel just trading garments and tea and opening the rest of the industry for the items coming in - it was reflected by some of your opinion makers or decision makers as almost 8,600 goods - would certainly reflect that this is an area that needs to be looked at with caution. So, I would just mention that there is a necessity to look after our trade in a more cautious manner.

Then, what I would like to add is this. Please ensure that the Foreign Ministry and the Trade Ministry have a more harmonious relationships with regard to these issues and you are able to commercialize the relationships that you have. Finally, foreign policy is commercializing that decision into what is good for our country. I guess that the Ministry of Investment Promotion is doing certain things in the right direction at the moment and I am sure, you, with your knowledge, must be able to do much more than that. But, I guess with your preoccupation with other matters the emphasis that needs to be paid on the commercialization process of the Foreign Ministry may lack. So, ensure that you have competent people that commercialize this and ensure that benefit accrues to the country. At this particular moment, being a manufacturer vibrantly involved in the trade activities of Sri Lanka and being a Member of the Opposition, we see these difficulties. Since I have been able to speak to some of your Ministers, I have personally managed to to ensure that we close the doors on certain wrong items that are coming from India and Bangladesh into Sri Lanka and open the doors for items which are right, but that is not sufficient enough. When the potential is far greater, we are only at the tip of the iceberg in these types of issues. After all, this is our national economy. It is not a blue colourized economy or a red colourized economy or a green colourized economy; it is the national economy we are talking of and we need to have practical people handling this.

I was particularly intrigued to see the Hon. Champika Ranawaka referring to the Sampur Coal Power Plant Agreement. After a Cabinet reshuffle and the knowledge he had prior to being removed from the Ministry, he did express that the Sampur Agreement is certainly detrimental to Sri Lanka. Reading through the final lines, I find it is more or less a diplomatic operation that is going on. Satisfying India at the financial expense of Sri Lanka is what the Minister surmised in his roundup at a press conference. He mentioned that the loss could be as much as Rs. 6 to 14 billion. This is not a figure that I plucked out from the sky. It is the Hon. Champika Ranawaka, a responsible Minister, having prior knowledge and being the former Minister, who said this. He mentioned that this can be the impact on the country - the loss is Rs. 6 to 14 billion. If you take the average of this, it is much more than what you are spending on the Samurdhi movement today. Only Rs. 9.6 billion is being spent on Samurdhi. This operational loss that could take place will be a humongous loss. So, I feel that there is a necessity to pay attention to what this Hon. Minister has stated.

Going on further, obviously it is necessary to ensure that investments come into the country so that growth will take place in a robust manner. However, we have to ensure that quality investments come in. In the recent past, it has been very difficult to get investors to come into the country. A lack of investments coming in the

289 290

[

2013 23

right direction has made the country to go into investments taking shorter directed approaches. That is why you have suddenly gone into casino-related investment development. The country is certainly jerked because of this issue at this particular moment. The Maha Nayaka Swaminwahansas on one side, the religious dignitaries such as the Archbishop and the Muslim and the Hindu religious prelates on the other, have certainly expressed their concern by saying that this is not the investment required for the country. Taking a short cut to investment drive at the expense of long term interests of the country is certainly what is being played around. I support that view whole-heartedly.

There is no necessity to say that there was an attempt for casinos to be brought in during the time of the UNP and as a result this is happening now. If that is the case, you all have all the powers, why have you not stopped it? There is no legalized casino operation licence that is being given. I was pretty surprised to hear the word "casino" that was being downplayed or being doused by the Ministers up to now, suddenly appear in the newspapers. The Ceylon Today newspaper carries a news item under the heading; New Casino Bill in House before Budget 2014. The Government has not withdrawn the Casino Bill, says one Member of the Government and another Member says that they are going to introduce the Casino Bill in a different form.

I am interested to know - I may seem mischievous on this particular subject - about the investments that are being brought in. Today, two of the biggest projects: one from Rank Holdings and the other from John Keells are both casino-driven. The Government pursues to say that there is no casino licence being given. Hon. Minister, is it for us to believe that you have a huge investor with US Dollars 400 million coming from Australia or US Dollars 500 million coming from some part of the world into John Keells operation and those guys will say that we have built a place and a casino is not there? They say that their main objective is a casino. If they do not have a casino licence, how are they going to operate? , ? .

Today, the Daily Mirror newspaper states, Govt. to Amend Casino Bill". This has been said by the Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena and it is the very Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena who says that there is no casino licence being given. Then, what is this Casino Bill that is coming in which is related to these two mega investors that are coming in? I only mention this in passing because of the fact that today we are talking of the investment drive. I would like to tell the Government to be more serious and consistent in their approach. If they are defending an issue, defend it properly. If they are attacking an issue, attack it properly. Do not run with the hare and hunt with the hound and at the end of the day

take a vexed, nebulous approach. That is what is being done today. So, Hon. Minister, all we can basically say is, that is the difficulty that you all have. Owing to the lack of consistency, owing to the lack of coherency and owing to the lack of deep-rooted macro planning, you have a knee-jerk reaction that is taking place. Today, that is the reason why foreign investors are not coming into the country. A classic example is the Al Futtaim Group in Dubai. During the war - hats off to the Government for being able to get investors of that nature - they came into the country taking the risk. They invested almost Rs. 4.5 billion when the war was on. But, what happened? In the first Budget that was introduced by the President in 2009 - for the year 2010 - there was a reduction in duty for small cars.

Then, what happened was, within two months, the balance of payment was so grave that they basically reduced the duty and later increased it dramatically. Thereafter what happened was, companies that invested here said that this was like a banana republic. The President who is also the Minister of Finance comes to Parliament and states in the Budget Speech, This is the way forward. Then, the very person who said, This is the way forward, in two months' time says, I am sorry, that direction is wrong. So, if the person who is at the helm is saying so, there is obviously a problem. So, these are the matters that need to be corrected. These are the matters that need to be reflected and remedial action must be taken on these.

Now, I do not want to deal any further on that area; I would like to talk about the shipping industry. I guess shipping is a very important industry that we can touch upon. The industry that is there before us is staring at an opportunity that we are losing. We are losing for the reason that we are becoming uncompetitive. Proliferation of ports or increasing the number of ports in Sri Lanka does not necessarily develop the shipping industry. We had a golden opportunity when my political Guru, the late Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali became the Minister of Trade and Shipping in 1979. During his period he did a revolutionary change in the shipping industry in Sri Lanka. What did he do? He looked at the geographically well-located position of Sri Lanka to ensure that we try to maximize the benefits that we can accrue out of the shipping industry. That was the reason why he basically looked at the first thing that was there: commercializing the Sri Lankan opportunity. The flag of opportunity or the flag of convenience - as they call it - is the first thing that should be done. The Regulations that you have moved today on the Merchant Shipping Act does ensure that you have got to pursue this type of area. Countries like Panama and Liberia have maximized the opportunities in this area. So, on that particular basis, I would like you to ensure that you make use of the opportunity that is staring at us. Open the doors to ensure more such investors come in because Sri Lanka is accepted in the world as a shipping hub. Also, an

291 292

opportunity does exist because of the peaceful environment in the country. If the Ministers in charge of shipping were in the House today, I guess it would have been more contributory. But, today the Ministers do not know what is going on. There is a remote control that is operated from one or two places and the Ministers have only become rubber stamps in operation. It is necessary to have a strategically-thinking team. People like you, instead of sitting here, should be in a Ministry, Hon. Sir. These are the problems that are there. You have square pegs in round holes and you play around with the national economy and today we have seen the resultant problem. Of course, there is a mess-up in one area. It is the national economy that you are playing around with. Therefore, it is incumbent on me to mention that these are the ways to take the economy forward. The flag of convenience or the flag of opportunity - as was mentioned - should be maximized. Those are the areas from which little Sri Lanka can earn millions of dollars without even putting a single cent in. You do not need to go after aid; you do not need to go in an investment drive with a begging ball. All you have got to do is to ensure that you make use of the flag of convenience or the flag of opportunity to get more shipping vessels to come in. Likewise, we must also develop a merchant vessels development team because when more merchant vessels come into the country, it obviously necessitates more staff to come on to those vessels.

When that happens, there will be an obvious utilization of those ships and regional trading will take place. The shipping industry will expand from that and with that expansion, you will have inbound and outbound shipping. The Government has done a right thing by having entrepot trading. These are all contributory. We, being an island nation, it is necessary for the shipping industry to play a pivotal role. But, it does not play the role that is expected. You have a Chairman in the Ports Authority who is more interested in filling the sea rather than running the port. He runs the ports on the basis that even if vessels do not come, having a port is good enough. These are the type of hideous transactions that are taking place. So, all I want to state today is about the merchant vessel development opportunity that is there before us which is not being exploited. We must ensure that we utilize this and maximize the opportunity.

The next one is the coastal shipping. We have many ports starting from Colombo to Galle, from Galle to Hambantota, from Hambantota to Oluvil, from Oluvil to Trincomalee, from Trincomalee to Kankesanthurai -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I will just take another two or three minutes. So, there is a necessity to promote more coastal shipping because it is cheaper and more versatile we can utilize the unutilized capital intensive operation that has been put in place today. You have investment-driven ports that are staring and doing nothing. The Hambantota Port is the biggest port idling in the world. Though you have the Trincomalee Port which is a natural harbour, you do not need to spend a single cent on it and it remains unutilized. Then, you have added on the Oluvil Port also. All I want to basically say is that coastal shipping is a good opportunity.

Today, the Hon. Champika Ranawaka who is a Minister in the Government and Udaya Gammanpila have mentioned that instead of the five-hub concept, country is turning to be a casino hub. The Government quite rightly looked at knowledge-driven, ports-driven, aviation, and computer-driven opportunities but those were only words that were spoken. They are not exploiting the real situation and now they are taking the easy way, as I said, with casino operation and that is the end of it.

I know time is a problem. So, I just only want to mention one thing. Look at the sense of absurdity of the Chairman of the Ports Authority. He thinks that we are gullible and that we are idiots and that peoples tax paying money can be used in the way he wants by filling 500 acres for the Colombo South Port Development Project. There is no logic behind filling 500 acres and trying to build an additional city there. You have the same land available in my electorate, in the Colombo North. There is a Himalayan type garbage dump in Colombo North, staring before the port, which can easily be used for fertilizer and that 30 or 40 acres of land can be put into commercial use. These people do not get such ideas because they cannot make money out of it. As a result, they would prefer filling the seabed - I do not know with what - and building a city there instead of taking the garbage dump away and putting it into good use. The Chairman, Sri Lanka Ports Authority says, Congestion at Hambantota Port: Vessels anchored in outer harbour await bunkering. Does he think that we are a pack of idiots and that what he says is accepted as gospel truth? The Port has been opened for almost 13 months and the commercial vehicles that are coming in is the only thing acceptable. There are no gantry cranes; there is no permanent staff but he is making a call that the Hambantota Port must have its second phase of development. You have already spent Rs. 68 billion while having an amortization cost of Rs. 6 billion, and not having a revenue of more than US Dollars 100,000. But, he is trying to go for the second phase instead of maximizing the existing port. Is he singing hosannas for his dinner? These are matters that need to be mentioned

293 294

[

2013 23

because the Government Members do not have the courage to mention these because if they do so, they will probably be politically harassed. As a result, they turn towards us to get this communicated. That does not matter because we have got to play a national role. We will certainly do it. We must reveal the bluff of these people. The element of corruption in the Colombo Port and in the Hambantota Port is making us uncompetitive. You have Hong Kong on one side, Malaysia on the other; you have Singapore on one side and Fujairah on the other side. Then, you have Oman on one side -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Ravi Karunanyake, you have already exceeded your time. So, please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Please give me one more minute.

Sir, you have Sri Lanka that is not able to provide something which is competitively advantageous. On that particular basis, we will lose the competitiveness in the shipping industry. - [Interruption.] So, Hon. Presiding Member, when there are Members here who do not understand what is going on, who get up like a jack-in-the-box and shouts, you must ensure in this House that they are named. That is why he is not allowed to sit on that Chair anymore. So, Sir, all I want to say is that these are mentioned in good faith for the development of the country to ensure that corruption is eliminated, and competitiveness and value-addition is brought into the system.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you very much.

[6.24 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Sir, might I be permitted to preface my speech by congratulating, on behalf of the whole House, the Hon. Speaker who has chartered a new course of action and today the Parliament is entering a new era in technological advancement by displaying the proceedings of this House in the digital screen outside, setting the stage to go further to telecast the whole proceedings live on television in the future.

Sir, I should also say this. The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris deserves all plaudits for very cleverly chartering a splendid course to lead and guide his able and versatile band of men and women at the Foreign Ministry to make Sri Lanka hold its head high as a proud nation and for creating the environment to make Sri Lanka the "Wonder of Asia" as envisaged by "Mahinda Chintana", which is in my hand.

Sir, before proceeding further and speaking about the four agreements that the Hon. Minister presented in this House, I have to make clear certain misconceptions, and aspersions which were cast across the Floor of this House. I think there are certain Members in this House who have made it a habit to make wild allegations against highly- respected officials and bureaucrats of this Government who are helping the Government in order to sustain and develop our economy. They have no other job in this House other than to, over and over again, mention the name of the Dr. Priyath B. Wickrama, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, then the name of Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal, the Governor of the Central Bank and the name of the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, Dr. P.B. Jayasundera. I think this particular Opposition Member resembles a worm who wants to live happily in a pit of mud and that is what is happening. Now, Sir, there are certain people who wear a pair of trousers, a coat and a tie and come here. I mean, we know of certain people who have been taken before courts for violating exchange control regulations and even their guarantors.

305 306

[

2013 23

. Their passports have also been taken. Sir, there is a pithy saying in Sinhala that, , " " . . , . . Port , airport , , hospitals , harbour , , - . " , , " , .

What an utter untruth he and other Members of this House have said from morning, deviating from the main subject, about the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport. What a canard they were trying to make out in this House. Sir, I want to tell you that I have here with me the monthly statistics of MRIA, the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport for the year 2013 from March up to September.

Now, Sir, under Flight Movements, the number of international arrivals is 395 and the number of departures is also 395. The total is 790. Then, the number of domestic arrivals is 89 and the number of departures is also 89. The total is 178. The total number of aircraft movements is 968. The number of scheduled movements is 772, the number of non-scheduled movements is 169 and the total number of movements of ML/SLAF is 27.

Then, look at passenger movements. See the record made in such a short time from March 18th up to September. The breakdown is given here. I will table* it to be included in the Hansard.

I will give you only the total. The number of international arrivals is 1,824 and the number of departures is 10,180. The total is 12,004. Then, the number of domestic arrivals is 8,072 and the number of departures is 6,822. The total is 14,894. The grand total number of arrivals is 9,869 and the grand total of the number of departures is 17,002. Then, the grand total including transfer is 26,898. Also, the number of transfer passengers is 8,037. , . Sir, you also came there. Mattala Airport 125 . Their transit was at the Mattala Airport and their next destination maybe Malaysia or Maldives.

Sir, I would mention about the cargo movements also. There are hives of activity. The cars are being unloaded in the Mattala Airport and are being brought here. I must place on record an appreciation in the House for the great services rendered by Dr. Priyath B. Wickrama, the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and also the Vice-Chairman, Mr. Kamal Ratwatte of Mahawalatenne fame. Now, these are the men who matter because they make Sri Lanka economically viable and sound.

Then, Sir, I have the monthly statistics of the BIA for the year 2013. I have no time to explain all but I will be very brief. The number of international departures is 2,783,636. All the details about domestic arrivals are also given. Then, the total number of transfers is 1,041,981 for that year. Sir, cargo movements is also like that. The total number of exports is 90,445 and the number of imports is 53,401. Mind you, during the months up to September, the total number of cargo movements was 143,846. I will table* this also.

Then, the details of aircraft movements are also here. Sir, as I said, Mr. Prasanna Wickramasuriya, the Chairman of the Airport and Aviation Services Limited, Mr. Kamal Ratwatte, Vice-Chairman and also Mr. Priyath B. Wickrama, the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority are doing a great service. So, this takes the lid off the canard they are spreading. The Hon. Opposition Member like a " " from the Mattakkuliya area comes and says all these things everyday in this House. So, there must be a full stop put to this. It is utter nonsense, Sir.

Now, Sir, I would only touch upon the agreement between the Government of Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and the Government of the State of Palestine for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income. Now, what is Palestine?

Palestine is the land of our first Qiblah. Our first Qiblah was in Jerusalem. It is called Masjidul Aqsa.

Now, there is a danger, Sir. The Zionists are trying to excavate and bring the down the Mosque. This Mosque is the place from where the Holy Prophet ascended to heaven. It is so holy to the entire Islamic world. This is what the Holy Quran in the Chapter "Bani Isra-il" states, I quote:

307 308

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

There is a fine article in Tamil in the "Muslim Murasu" today, which states, I quote:

"- ".

This is what is happening. The whole world is against them. They have deprived all Palestinians of human rights. Navaneetham Pillay comes to Sri Lanka saying

there is violation of human rights in Sri Lanka. Let her go to Palestine. I told this in Parliament when she was in this country. I said that if she writes a correct report by visiting Palestine, she will receive the Nobel Peace Prize.

Now, Sir, what is happening? This newspaper describes it in full and I have no time to read the whole article.

[ ...

" ' ' . . .

, . .

' ' ,

3,000 or it is almost 5,000.

' ' , ."

This is what the Zionists are doing. They are producing pictures in order to dupe the whole world. What is the United Nations doing? They must take action on this.

Sir, when His Excellency the President was in the Opposition, he brought a Motion in this House supporting the Palestine cause. Who asked the Hon. Imtiaz Bakeer Markar and me not to speak at that time? It was none other than the Prime Minister at that time, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe. That is how he treated the people of Palestine. Now, some of those Muslims in his rank, the remnants, are crying for him.

" . ."

Sir, anyway, now what are they asking?

" - .

'-' .

, . .

Sir, there are 54 countries in the OIC, Organization of Islamic Countries. They can all get together.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay, Sir. Then, I would take my memory back to 1968. Al-Aqsa faced the same calamity. There was an excavation; not only an excavation, they set fire to certain areas.

We had a massive demonstration in Colombo at that time led by Alhaj Badi-ud-din Mahmud of the Islamic Socialist Front and the Hon. Alhaj M.H. Mohamed who was the Minister of Labour at that time in the Dudley Senanayake Government. The entire Muslim community came and I think that was the first demonstration in the last century that was able to take all the people to Maradana Mosque Grounds. That was a massive demonstration. We pledged our support and even the Buddhists and others wanted to help in the re-building of Al-Aqsa. That is the spirit in which the Buddhist community, the Sinhalese and others respect the highly venerated places of Islam.

Thank you very much, Sir.

ADJOURNMENT ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , " " .

. . Question proposed.

DEVELOPMENT OF TALENTS OF YOUNG SPORTSPERSONS

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Presiding Member, it is my pleasure this afternoon to move this Adjournment Motion. Sir, I move,

"Sri Lankan sportspersons displayed distinct talents by winning one silver medal and five bronze medals at the Second Asian Youth Games Festival held in China. Furthermore, Sri Lanka was awarded the hosting of the Asian Youth Games Festival of 2017.

It is moved in this House that a programme be prepared with the intervention of the Ministry of Sports to develop the talents of young sportspersons who demonstrated their talents at this Games Festival to create sportspersons that are able to win Asian and Olympic level medals in the same way that it was done earlier by M.J.M. Lafir, Dr. Nagalingam Ethirveerasingam, Duncan White and S.L.B. Rosa, then by Susanthika Jayasinghe, Badra Gunawardena, Damayanthi Darsha, Sugath Thilakarathna and Nadeeka Lakmali.

Mr. M.J.M. Lafir, was the first world champion of Sri Lanka in billiards. Then, Susanthika Jayasinghe is one name that not only the sporting world, but the entire nation cannot forget.

Sir, these are models for our future sportsmen and women. They are the Sri Lankan national flag carriers and good ambassadors when they go out. Sir, I know that the Minister of Sports, my good Friend, the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage is taking great effort in every field of sports in order to keep in line with the modern trends in the sporting world and also to ensure that what is mentioned in the Mahinda Chintana about sports is carried to the letter, under his able guidance, by the Ministry officials. I think last time also when I moved an Adjournment Motion, he waxed eloquent about carrom. I have the Hansard with me of that day. The Minister of Sports made a very interesting speech on that day. I will quote from the Adjounment Motion moved by myself on 21st November, 2012.

Sri Lankan carrom player Mr. Nishantha Fernando brought immense prestige to Sri Lanka by winning the gold medal awarded to the World Carrom Champion at the World Carrom Championship, 2012 held in Sri Lanka for the sixth time.

From where is this Nishantha Fernando? He is here; he is working in Parliament. So, the Sri Lankan Parliament has produced world recognized champions in certain sports. Sir, we are thankful and we are very proud, as Members of this House, that our Parliamentary staff are clever to bring laurels for our country. The team at that time was comprised of A. Upali Premachandra, R.D. Anura Shantha, R.D. Sujeewa Lasantha, A.T.S. Pushpakumara, B.D. Jagath Kumara and others.

Then, Sir, look at the encouragement given by His Excellency the President himself. The Daily Mirror of 22nd August states, I quote:

It is quite noteworthy that this outstanding achievement of Susanthika in 2007, was during the period of HE Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was the President of the Federation at that time, who took initiative in this matter, which speaks volumes of his commitment to the sport and his leadership. Today we are proud of the fact that HE Mahinda Rajapaksa, is the only Head of State, to hold the post of President of a National Federation. IAAF President Lamine Diack commends his contribution to world of global athletics and appreciates his efforts and leadership to develop athletics thus far. Interests of HE in sports are known in every circle. He has initiated action to start a trust Fund. It is to his credit that the second synthetic track as well as the international stadium, Mahinda Rajapaksa International stadium was built.

. . . . . ? . .

Now, Sir, the Minister of Sports is taking a very keen interest in order to promote a sports festival during the CHOGM that is to be held here. So, all in all, it augurs very well that we are going to rise very high at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and also in the international sporting field.

Then, I further quote the "Daily Mirror" of 22nd of August, 2012, which states,

We are quite strengthened by his devotion...

That is the President.

.....and keen interest in sports, himself being a past sportsman.

That was, I think, when he was at Nalanda College and the Thurstan College.

Again, I quote:

317 318

2013 23

At same time we value his daily habit the interest in sports where he pays his attention to sports pages to read sports news. What is more valued is his concern for sports, where we, sports administrators, are often inquired about the news items and questioned about issues highlighted, seeking answers of action proposed, at the same time, suggesting to us the better course of action to resolve any matter/issue. This no doubt prompts us, to be alert, and resolve issues, as well as to improve ourselves, to be better administrators.

It goes on to state further, I quote:

Next set of achievers for AASL are those who shone in Asian Games. The first Asian Games Gold medal is from Dr. Nagalingam Ethirveerasingham, with a new Games record at the Games in 1958 in Tokyo. The Games of 1970 in Bangkok reminds us of the great achievement of S.L.B. Rosa when, as a bare foot runner, he became our first double Gold medalist in 5000m and establishing a Games record in 10000m.

Sir, talking about Dr. Nagalingam Ethirveerasingham, he was born in Jaffna; he is a Tamil. We met him recently when we went there. There was the Northern Provincial Council Election recently and a new Chief Minister has been elected. I think the Hon. Minister must concentrate on Jaffna and improve the stadiums all round. I also state before the House that the Santhenkerny Stadium should be developed to an international level because there is enough space in Kalmunai. Sir, I will come to your Ministry and discuss this further.

Again, I quote further:

It is in 1974 Tehran Games that AAA became known globally to produce top 400m runners with the splendid performance of W. Wimaladasa, who won the 400m Gold with a New Games record. Wimaladasa along with Sunil Gunawardana, Kosala Sahabandu and Premachandra won the 4 x 400m relay, also with a record time of 3m 7.4 secs. Not to be outdone are the achievements at 1998 games in Bangkok, when Damayanthi Dharsha, emulated Rosa, as another double medalist winning the 200m in record time as well as in the 400m. At the same event, Sugath Tilakaratne maintained his high standards set in 400m in Fukuoka in1997 to win the Gold medal. In the Busan Games of 2002, Susanthika shone in winning the 100m and Damayanthi Dharsha in 400m. We salute other athletes who brought honor by winning Silver Medals with the first Silver medal from M.A. Akbar in pole vault in Games in Delhi in 1951 with many others in later Games winning silver medals along with some winning Bronze medals, at many an Asian Games, with special mention of the 4 x 400m mens relay team, which carved a niche for few years.

Then, Sir, we also have football where persons like Hashim Deen and Amanullah excelled very much. I think the Hon. Minister himself knows about the actions of certain officials, as he castigated them last time also. The whole world is laughing at us as far as the ruling of the FIFA is concerned. I remember when F.A. Yaseen was the former President of Federation of Football in this country, he had the Yaseen Cup presented every year. He was doing very well and after him, there was a police officer, a DIG, who took over and it was run very well. Then, somebody else came and ruined the good name of the game.

Sir, there are also several other sports like volleyball, carrom, elle, pole vaulting, shooting and cadetting and all those have got to be improved because the President of the country is encouraging the Hon. Minister and all of us to do so. Whenever a sportsman wins a medal here or abroad, the President is the first person to invite him and felicitate him at his official residence, Temple Trees. He is such a great sportsman.

Before I conclude, Sir, I must also pay tribute to the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa, Member of Parliament, who has been selected to lead the Sri Lankan Rugby Team at the coming international rugby tournament. Yoshitha Rajapaksa and Rohitha Rajapaksa are also capable persons who have taken up rugby and after their advent to the playground, I think the standard of rugby has gone up.

There are also night races. I think I told you that if we go on in that fashion, in a planned manner, one day, we may be able to win the Madrid Grand Prix of Spain. We have to produce men of that talent showing them as model Sri Lankans so that Sri Lanka will be hailed as the Wonder of Asia through the efforts of sportsmen.
