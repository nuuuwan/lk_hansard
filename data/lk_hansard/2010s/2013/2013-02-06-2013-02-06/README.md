QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

I

TENDENCY TOWARDS COMMUNAL INCIDENTS IN THE

COUNTRY

( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, in his speech in the House on Thursday, 24th January, 2013, the Deputy Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs, the Hon. M.K.A.D.S. Gunawardana, stated that there are no ethnic or communal incidents in the country. While he was speaking, a mob

consisting of both the sangha and laymen led by Matale Vedahamuduruwo, were parading the streets of Kuliyapitiya carrying photographs of a pig with the word, "Allah" written across it. The police had been informed earlier that such a protest was being organized but they failed to take any action to prevent this demonstration. The intervention of the Provincial Council Member, Mr. M.N. Nazeer, as well as the Member of Parliament for the area, the Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, prevented the situation turning ugly. I am tabling* the letter addressed to me by the Member of the Provincial Council, Mr. Nazeer, regarding the incident in Kuliyapitiya, because the Government is replying tomorrow and I hope the Hon. Minister will make a copy available and go into it.

I like to highlight one sentence in that letter.

" ."

, . I think you should go into it. If this is correct, did he use his political patronage to prevent the police from taking necessary action? This is just one of the many incidents that have taken place in the country recently. Altogether, there have been 10 attacks on mosques and 10 protests at various towns. This is an explosive situation which must be addressed immediately by the Government.

The present situation is being fuelled by rumours. I read in the newspapers yesterday that the Venerable Kirama Vimaljothi has said that Saudi Arabia is training Muslim youth to be terrorists and that there is damage to Buddhist Shrines in the East. If this is true, this is serious. But, the matter is for the Venerable Vimalajothi Thero to inform the Ministry of Defence if terrorists are being trained and to make a complaint to the police if places of worship are being damaged.

( - , ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva - Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management and Leader of the House of Parliament) You are not complying with the statement. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I am just telling you about the situation. I have given you time to reply till tomorrow. So, you have time to reply. You are not going to reply today. So you cannot

49 50

- * . . Placed in the Library.

complain now. - [Interruption.] I am giving you more facts, so that you can go into them. Tell me whether they have gone into these issues and made complaints. I am going to meet the Venerable Galaboda Aththe Gnanasara Thero and others tomorrow. But, what I say is, if you make statements like this on these types of issues, there must be an inquiry by the police and by the Ministry of Defence. This is a very serious matter and you cannot just take this up to the country. That is all I have to say.

The Government has taken no steps to control this escalating situation. Divisions are being emphasized rather than minimized. The first canard is that the Sinhalese are becoming a minority in the Sinhala areas. There is a so-called map showing an increase of Muslims in the seven southern provinces with the Sinhalese being a minority in the near future - . That is what they say. Another map shows the country without any Muslims at the time of the arrival of the Portuguese. It was the Muslims who warned King Dharma Parakramabahu VIII not to allow the Portuguese to come into the country. Unfortunately the King did not follow the advice of the Muslims. The Sinhala ratio has increased from the time of Independence, 1947 when it was 63 per cent to what it is today to 75 per cent. But, the ratio within the minorities has changed since a large number of Tamils have left the country. I do not want to go into those reasons. Rt. Hon. D.S. Senanayake said that the Sinhalese are the majority in the country and will always be the majority, but the Tamils and the Muslims also have the right to live in this country and to be treated equally. If the Sinhala population is in danger of being depleted, we in the UNP, will be the first to raise the issue in this House.

Secondly, there is the question of Halal certification. To the best of our information, Halal certification is an entirely voluntary matter. If anyone has forced Halal certification on business organizations, there must be provision for an inquiry by the Government after a complaint is made. Unfortunately, this is not so. A businessman in the South complained to me that he was being pressurized to take the Halal certification. The Government must inform us why a private organization is assigned to perform this function which is the responsibility of the SLSI.

Hon. Minister, I want to point out that Section 3 of the All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama (Incorporation) Act, No. 51 of 2000 does not give the power of certification to this institution. Even in their own website, they do not claim any law. There is a single point for clarification but they say that they are trying to act under the Islam law. That means, they are trying to act under religion in terms of an issue pertaining to doing business. I want to tell you that.

There is another matter which you can inquire into; as to why the President of All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama, M.I.M. Rizvi Moulavi in 2011 summoned a whole lot of people to the GOH to tell them to vote for Mr. Milinda Moragoda as the mayoral candidate of Colombo.- [Interruption.] Anyway, the Muslim leadership - [Interruption.] . . [ ] . [ ] . . This is not Mannar. This is not Mannar to be threatened. I asked the President of All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama to come and meet me. They are businessmen - [Interruption.] . [ ] , .

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

[ ] . . . , , . . , . [ ] , .

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

[ ]

The Muslim leadership I met are all in favour of resolving this issue in a manner acceptable to all the parties. The Hon. Kabir Hashim was with me. They are meeting even the Buddhist clergy. They have met Venerable Iththapane Dhammalankara Thero and Venerable Sobhitha Thero. I will even arrange for a meeting with Venerable Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thero. We are doing our best. We do not want this matter to go out of control. - [Interruption.]

Therefore, I have to ask the Government - [Interruption.] , .

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

. . . [ ] . [ ]

Therefore, I have to ask the Government why they are allowing this issue to boil over. Why did you fail to start a discussion on the issue with the Muslim community and the business community? - [Interruption.]

51 52

[ ]

2013 06

... ( ... - , ) (The Hon. A.R.M. Abdul Cader - Deputy Minister of Environment and Renewable Energy) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Minister, when we were in Galle, some people were trying to run a campaign against Islam financing. There is also the allegation regarding the Law College Entrance exam. Since there is a suspicion of wrongdoing, an independent committee should be appointed to go into this matter, correct any anomalies that may have occurred and punish those responsible, if any. Do not try to sweep this issue under the carpet. As the Muslims say, if there is a Muslim who is responsible for this, punish him. Do not punish the community. The Government should not sweep this issue under the carpet. It is not in the interest of the Sinhalese, Muslims and the Tamils nor the country as a whole. Today, many individuals are manipulating competitive exams for consideration. That is a fact. Therefore, all those who have done so must be exposed, whether it is a Muslim, a Sinhala or a Tamil. If any Muslims are involved, the Muslim community should not suffer for it.

A wrong interpretation has been given to the word Jihad to mean a military and a terrorist campaign to destroy non-believers. An eminent writer on the subject, Rudolph Peters in Jihad in Modern History describes the concept as the inner struggle by a believer to fulfil his religious duties. Even before the Prophet, Lord Buddha preached that we need to free ourselves from thanhawa.

There is a famous saying of Lord Buddha in Dhammapada. It states, I quote:

103. Though one may conquer a thousand times a thousand men in battle, yet he indeed is the noblest victor who conquers himself.

Though one may surround a magistrate a thousand times, the noblest man is the one who conquers himself.

There are a number of websites which are highly derogative of the Islam religion. The Government which blocks websites highly derogative of the Government has not taken any action so far to block these websites. None of these are excuses for the breakdown in law and order. If the Government had taken early action in regard to the incident at the Dambulla Mosque, the breakdown of law and order would not have spread.

Hon. Minister, I do not know, I received some information this morning. You can go into it and tell us tomorrow what it is. There is a fear that a similar one is

being organized in Warakapola on the 9th of February. Since the Honourable Muslim Minister, the Saladin of the Muslim cause has not brought it up before, I am taking it up.

We are also surprised by the silence of our Muslim Ministers in the Government on this issue. Have you been told to be silent? You can shout at me now. Why do you not take the issue up? Like the way you shouted at me, take this issue up. The silence of those who made such a hue and cry over the Muslim Chief Minister in the Eastern Province is deafening. Holding office seems to be more important than faith.

You are not going on the straight and narrow path, Hon. Minister, though you are shouting at me.

There is also a talk of repeating 1915. The clash between the Muslims and the Buddhists in a perahera passing by a mosque escalated into an all-island riot. As a result, Sinhala leaders, such as F.R. Senanayake, D.S. Senanayake, D.B. Jayatilaka were locked by the British and Henry Pedris was executed by a firing squad. They made a communal clash an excuse for executing one of our young leaders. It was a Tamil, Ponnambalam Ramanathan who came to the rescue of the Sinhala Buddhists.

The rights of the Sinhalese must be protected. But, there is no need to take away the rights of the Tamils and the Muslims. We are all proud of the history of the Sinhalese and the contribution we have made to safeguard the Theravada doctrine. We have a rich culture. Similarly, the Tamils and the Muslims have their own cultures rooted in Sri Lanka. They too have made a contribution to this country.

The peoples of Sri Lanka referred to in the preamble to the Constitution enshrined the right to equality in Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Thus this right should be enjoyed by all the people of Sri Lanka. The President appointed the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission which has already submitted a Report. The recommendations highlighted the need for a Sri Lankan identity. The report states, It becomes necessary to articulate a common vision of an interdependent, just, equitable, open and diverse society. The development of a vision of a shared future requires the involvement of the whole of society. Has the Government accepted these resolutions?

In 1931, the Donoughmore Commissioners stated, Communalism is as it were a canker in the body politic, eating deeper and deeper into the vital energies of the people, breeding self-interest, suspicion and animosity and preventing the development of a national spirit. Communalism brought us the ethnic riots of 1983 and a war which went on till 2009. Thirty years after the ethnic riots, we still have not been able to find a political

53 54

solution which would bring harmony between the races and religions. What is happening now will only aggravate the situation. One single act can provoke a backlash throughout the world. We are all aware of it. We do not want that to happen. I need not mention what impact it will have on us in the international fora where we are already facing criticism. I cannot accept the statement made in the House by the Leader of the House of the Governments offer to appoint a Select Committee to go into this matter. We are aware of the steps taken by the Government with regard to the earlier Parliamentary Select Committee on the Constitution. It is another means of opening the old wound. Therefore, I want to ask the Government to tell us what effective steps are being taken to restore confidence and maintain law and order including prosecution of those involved in these incidents. We appeal to the country to maintain law and order and not to allow communal passions to overtake us.

Thank you.

FINANCING (AMENDMENT) BILL

. . Order for Second Reading read. [.. 2.36] ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , " () " .

.

. . Question proposed.

[2.38 p.m.] ( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Hon. Speaker, this is a Bill to amend the Convention - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

61 62

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, this matter was taken up at the Consultative Committee. The Bill was presented at the Consultative Committee only today. At that particular moment, I did ask the Deputy Minister of External Affairs and his legal luminaries in the Ministry to please tell us whether there is a definition to the word, "terrorist" in this particular Bill. Unfortunately, it was the Deputy Minister of External Affairs who was present. Then, it was mentioned that there is no definition to the word, terrorist. We then asked them how they can bring in this Bill before Parliament in order to be enacted when there is a lacuna in the system. Up to this moment, Sir, there has been no explanation given as to who a "terrorist" is. So, is it at the behest of the Government, the Secretary of Defence or what is it? That is not known. Why can it not be clearly spelt out in the Bill which will be passed and then become an Act?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) It is given on page 16 of the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Act, No. 41 of 2011. If you go through that, you will see who a "terrorist" is and what a "terrorist organization" is. Hon. Member, I think we discussed this at the Consultative Committee. I do not think we should go into trivial details like this. Let us go on with the Bill and pass it. - [Interruption.] I explained it to you at the Consultative Committee. Even our legal luminaries explained as to who a "terrorist" is. For your reference, go through page 16 of the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Act, No. 41 of 2011. It is clearly mentioned there.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is not defined there. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) It is defined. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If there is a problem, let us sort it out. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Yes, of course. - [Interruption.] Let me explain it to you during the course of my speech. You have time to speak -[Interruption.] Well, this is only an amendment to the existing Act. This Act is already in force.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You are asking Parliament to make this legislation - ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) The Act is in force. This is only an amendment brought in order to remove certain clauses in this Act. That does not make any change. This is for the smooth functioning of the financial institutions of this country, for the people of this country.- [Interruption.] Sir, we explained this in detail and it is self-explanatory in this Act.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I may not be a lawyer but common sense develops on me at this particular moment to ensure what is brought before Parliament -

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) So, I will explain that to you in my speech. You can raise your points during your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, but the lawyers at the Consultative Committee themselves said that there is no definition for a terrorist.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) There is no definition in the United Nations Charter. There is definition for the terrorist here. He mentioned to you about the United Nations Charter. It has nothing to do with this Act - [Interruption.]

Sir, it gives me honour to speak when His Excellency the President is present today in the House because he is the one who eradicated terrorism in this country. I am happy to bring in these amendments to regularize the prevailing legal framework of the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Bill.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) , . 2005 .

This is relevant to the suppression of terrorist financing only, to prevent funds coming into the country through illegal means. So, we are bringing in only an amendment to this Act. This Act has been in force. So, while presenting this, I would like to state as to when it had been brought up and why it has been brought up.

The International Convention of Suppression of Terrorist Financing was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on the 9th of December, 1999 and opened for signature on the 10th of January, 2000. The Government of Sri Lanka became a signatory to the aforesaid Convention on the 10th of January, 2000 and ratified the same on the 8th of September, 2000. The aforesaid Convention came into force in respect of Sri Lanka on the 10th of April, 2002. Hon. Speaker, it was necessary for the Government of Sri Lanka to make legislative provision to give effect to Sri Lanka's obligations under the aforesaid Convention and the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, No. 25 of 2005 was enacted on the 8th of August, 2005. This is an existing Act, Hon. Speaker.

The Financial Action Task Force - FATF - is an authority functioning under G7 countries. The recommendations of FATF are: international standards on combating money laundering and the financing of

terrorism and proliferation. They form the basis for a co-ordinated response to these threats to the integrity of the financial system to help ensure a level playing field. The FATF adopted the revised standards in February 2012, which are considered as international standards and all countries are expected to fully implement measures in line with these recommendations.

Regarding actions taken by us, the Parliament of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka in 2011 has approved the revisions of the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, No. 25 of 2005 - CSTFA - and Prevention of Money Laundering Act, No. 5 of 2006 - PMLA - in line with the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force which is an inter-governmental body incorporated by G7 countries to work as a global policy setter on anti-money laundering, to counter the financing of terrorist groups on money laundering and to review the Legal Reviews Committee approved by the Advisory Board of the Financial Intelligence Unit of Sri Lanka. The functions expected are: adopt legislation amending the Prevention of Money Laundering Act to make all FATF designated offences predicate offences; adopt legislation amending the PMLA to include foreign offences as money laundering predicate offences; adopt legislation that makes clear that money laundering and terrorist financing crimes and assets freezing, and forfeiture cover income, profits and instrumentalities of crime and property to the corresponding value; adopt legislation amending the Terrorist Financing Law to cover sole provisions of funds, foreign offences and domestic offences committed by non-resident Sri Lankans as well as residents; adopt legislation that establishes an effective and timely mechanism to freeze terrorist funds and other assets pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267 and 1373. Accordingly, the CSTF (Amendment) Act, No. 41 of 2011, and PML (Amendment) Act, No. 40 of the 2011 were effective from 6th November, 2011 in this House.

Two legislations related to the United Nations Security Council Resolution - UNSCR - Nos. 1267 and 1373 have also been gazetted under the United Nations Act, No. 45 of 1968 by the Minister of External Affairs on the 15th and 31st of May 2012 respectively to be effective from such date. The Financial Intelligence Unit of Sri Lanka - FIU - was established in March 2006 under the Financial Transaction Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006 - FTRA. The FIU which was under the Ministry of Finance as an autonomous body, now functions as a Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in terms of the Order made by the His Excellency the President on 23rd March, 2006 under Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 1437 dated 23rd March, 2006.

Accordingly, the FIU is responsible for implementation and administration of the provisions of the FTRA to facilitate prevention, detection, investigation

65 66

and prosecution of offences of money laundering, terrorist financing and other unlawful activities defined in the Act. The legislations related to anti-money laundering and countering of terrorist financing in Sri Lanka, the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, No. 25 of 2005 and Prevention of Money Laundering Act, No. 5 of 2006, have been formulated based on 40 recommendations on AML and nine recommendations on CFT of the FATF and in terms of United Nations Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing respectively. The FATF which I mentioned earlier has the sole authority to implement these in all countries facing these issues. The Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Act, No. 41 of 2011 was reviewed at the FATF Plenary Sessions held during 18th to 22nd June in 2012 in Rome, Italy. While commending on the progress made by Sri Lanka with regard to the implementation of legal review in line with the FATF recommendations, the FATF is of the view that exception section for humanitarian grounds included in Section 3 (3)(2A) of the Act constitutes a significance deficiency. During the time this Act was brought into force, the Government was doing humanitarian assistance in the North. Therefore, to prevent anybody going to courts against the officers who were implementing humanitarian assistance and to safeguard them, we had to look at the humanitarian aspect when bringing in this legislation. Today, we are bringing in an amendment to remove only that section in the Act. That is, Provided however that, providing assistance on humanitarian grounds by a person or body of persons, shall not amount to an offence within the meaning of this Act. That is the only section that we are going to remove from this Act.

And also, Hon. Speaker, I would like to refer to the point that the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake mentioned that a terrorist is not defined in any UN Convention. This Act too only defines what a terrorist act is. Any person who carries out a "terrorist act" as defined in Section 8 of the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Act, No. 41 of 2011 will be a terrorist. This is defined in page 16 of the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Act, No. 41 of 2011, which I will read to you now: 'person' includes a body of persons; and 'terrorist act' includes, the use of threat of action, which involves -

(a) the use of threat of action which is designed to influence the government, or to intimidate the public or a section of the public;

(b) the use of threat of action which is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause,

and such action,

(i) involves serious violence against a person;

(ii) involves serious damage to property;

(iii) endangers the life of another person, other than the person committing the action;

(iv) creates a serious risk to health or safety of the public or a section of the public; or

(v) is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system.

Hon. Speaker, I want to state that under this Act, three cases have already been filed in the High Court of Colombo. Two cases are against office-bearers of the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization - TRO. One case has been fixed for trial.

Thank you, Hon. Speaker. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . [2.53 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, listening to the Hon. Deputy Minister of External Affairs, I would like to make one point.

Page 16 is not an exhaustive definition of terrorist act. It says, includes. We have signed international conventions. We have signed Commonwealth agreements and there are others. Within the international community law, there are parameters of who a terrorist is. It is the position of the External Ministry that international law and the international community has not defined who a terrorist is. One convention may not but there are other UN conventions and the international law applies. I think that is one clarification we all require because there is apprehension in the minds of the people that this will also be misused. It has happened so far. The only definition of a "terrorist" in Sri Lanka is, if you are against the Government, you are a terrorist. If you come over to the Government, you are a patriot. So, we are worried about this definition.

There are two matters I want to raise. Firstly, why are you making this amendment? In 2011, you all brought in a proviso to allow money for humanitarian causes. The TRO case has nothing to do with that proviso which you have referred to. I am going to talk about that later.

I quote Clause 3 (3) of Act, No. 41 of 2011:

Provided however that, providing assistance on humanitarian grounds by a person or body of persons, shall not amount to an offence within the meaning of this Act.

All you are doing is, you are deleting that proviso.

Hon. Deputy Minister, how much of money came into the country under this proviso? Did you get billions of rupees which was misused? Otherwise why worry about

67 68

[ ]

2013 06

it? You brought in a proviso in 2011 and you are taking it out in 2013. In between, is this the answer you are providing to the question, What happened to the LTTE funds, the ships and the petrol stations? Where is the money that the Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella mentioned? My allegation, my contention is that you passed this so that you could bring LTTE funds into Sri Lanka and now you are taking it out. Tell us then what has happened to the LTTE funds? What has happened to all the money? There must be over a 500 million or a billion dollars of LTTE money in gold. Was it given to KPs organization? Was this a specific purpose provision allowing the money to come, which will now go into Krrish buildings, various other things under the sun, Trilliums and all? Is this a money laundering provision whereby the Government was a party to taking the money of the LTTE, which should either belong to the Government of Sri Lanka or otherwise given to the poor Tamil diaspora from whom it was collected? You have used it now to bring the money in. This maybe why the land prices are going up, because so much of properties are being purchased and in the meantime, you are closing it up because you do not want it anymore, no one else wants it. I do not think even the TNA is aware of it. I do not think even you all are aware of anyone who wants it . So, this was brought in for a specific purpose and this is the money that the LTTE collected. This is the money that belongs to the country. So, why do you not tell us, Hon. Deputy Minister -

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Is the only issue that you are raising regarding the money or are you also raising the matter raised by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) No, I have a different issue. But, on the Hon. Ravi Karunanayakes matter, as I said, page 16 is not exhaustive.

What I am saying is, you brought in a provision. No one asked for it. Now, you are removing it. So, why did you bring it in? In the meantime, you have not accounted for what happened to the LTTE funds. You all must tell us what happened to the ships. I am told that the ships were sold. Everything was sold and the money was taken. So, what you are doing under the guise of all these conventions and all is that you used this and you brought the money in. This is the money that belongs to the people. Will the Government table here and tell us what happened to the LTTE funds, the jewellery and the gold and give us a debate on it? The jewellery of the poor people of Kilinochchi were taken. That money has been brought in under this provision and it will be closed.

The other issue is, the Hon. Deputy Minister of External Affairs says that there are three cases in High Court. You are faced with a very serious problem. How are you going to try these? Because from the High Court you can go up to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court and you can at any time ask for a decision. If the Supreme Court is not functioning, how can you have this? I do not want to go into all the details here. But, what I am saying is, the Hon. Speaker, myself and three other Members with the Prime Minister are parties to a case in regard to the Parliamentary Council and whether it can make observations in respect of the Hon. Mohan Peiris. All I am saying is, when the case came up the other day, the judges were ducking it. You have to take a decision one way or other, whether this Act is valid or not. As long as you do not take it, the whole thing is suspended. I am not going to tell the Supreme Court as to what decision they should take. But, I am saying that they must take a decision and all of them must sit down, the whole Supreme Court must sit down as one bench and give their decision one way or the other. The country will decide whether they are correct or not. There will be arguments about it. But, you cannot have a dereliction of duty by the Supreme Court when this main issue is taken up and they cannot pass the ball around. That is the main issue.

An Hon. Member here is asking whether I want Hon. Mohan Peirs to sit on the bench. All I can say is, he is the sixth respondent and I have no objection to him sitting on the bench if the other respondents who are lawyers - like the Hon. Swaminathan and myself - are also allowed to sit on the bench. After all, we also exercise judicial power. We are from the House and I have a longer practice than him. I have been an Advocate; so has the Hon. Swaminathan, and my judicial status is not in doubt. So, I have no problem. If he sits, we are also willing to come and sit on the bench. Then, whatever you say, Hon. Speaker, we will listen to it. You know we are not partial. But, whatever it is, the Supreme Court must hear and finish this. Otherwise, it is useless talking here and having cases before the High Court. But, I would like you to tell us why you brought this and what happened to the money; who played out that money.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Okay, you explain that in brief. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, you are being misled. You check the Hansard. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) No. You explain in brief. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , "terrorist" . [ ] . [ ]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Now, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran may speak.

[4.31 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, the Hon. Deputy Minister of External Affairs has brought in this amendment in a mighty hurry in order to satisfy certain foreign elements, to be able to show that something is being done with regard to international obligations.

Sir, before the House recessed - the Sittings were suspended for a while - the issue was raised as to the precise definition of the term terrorist. Now, we understand that in the Convention, that word is not defined. Perhaps, it was impossible to define, as was explained, because a terrorist in one persons eyes is not a terrorist in another persons eyes. Sri Lanka also supports the Palestinian people and their struggle, who are described by some others in the world as "terrorists". So, it is understood that there is no unanimity in the international arena as to the word terrorist or as to what the precise definition ought to be.

But, in this Act, an offence was created in 2011 by the introduction of Section 2A, whereby if any material support or resources are provided to a terrorist, terrorists or a terrorist organization, that becomes an offence. Acts of terrorism are defined. That too is not in a satisfactory manner because it says, it includes, but, it is not an

81 82

exhaustive definition. So, there is a serious issue there. But, more serious is the fact that the word terrorist is not defined. One of the definitions of the word law itself is that it must be precise. Particularly, in criminal legislation, people must know what the offence is; people must know what they are prohibited from doing. If that element is not there, then it seizes to be a law. So, that is why we raised this issue. Merely saying "people involved in terrorist activity" is one thing. But, when you say, any person who supplies material or resources to a terrorist, describing or labelling a person in the present, in the past, in the future, whatever it maybe - as a terrorist - then, there is a serious issue that arises. Who is a terrorist? Without the definition of the word terrorist, can it be made an offence to give material support or resources to an undefined person?

Now, I can understand the Governments difficulty in defining who a terrorists is. There are persons who bombed the Sri Dalada Maligawa; there are persons who killed 600 policemen; there are persons - as the speaker before me said - who killed young monks in Aranthalawa. They are all with the Government. There are persons who are wanted criminals - publicly proclaimed criminals - in the neighbouring country, India, for murder and for abduction of minors. Now, they are Ministers and Deputy Ministers and when the State pays them their salary, the State itself - the Government itself - will be guilty of the offence described in Section 2A. That is probably the difficulty they have in defining the word terrorist. - [Interruption.] Nevertheless, if there is no precise definition, that will cease to be law. I am glad that in the Officials' Box today, the person who taught Jurisprudence to me is also seated and he will agree with what I am saying. I am sure, Sir, you too would agree, having gone through that institution a little after me and studied Jurisprudence, that law must be precise, particularly penal legislation. People must know what they are prohibited from doing or, in this case, whom they are prohibited from helping.

Now, the word "terrorism" is a very broad one as was just demonstrated in this House. The Hon. Member from Kandy from the UNP accused this Government of State terrorism, and the Hon. Member who spoke just after him accused the UNP Government of State terrorism. So, both agreed; both the Government party and the main Opposition party, agreed that there is State terrorism. It is just that one is accusing this Government and the other is accusing the previous Government. So, with regard to the word "terrorism" in this House itself today - even from both sides of the House - there is agreement that State can be involved in terrorism.

Now, when the Hon. Member from Kandy raised the issue about white vans - [Interruption.] When the Hon. Member from Kandy raised the issue about white vans,

there were many noises made. But, there was this person called Kumar Gunaratnam who was taken in a white van. But, when powerful countries protested, he was produced; he was produced and he was allowed to go out of the country. Now, who was responsible for that white van abduction? Was it not the Government? It can be this Government or the previous government or the one before that, but the point is, successive governments are involved in acts of terrorism and that is affirmed in this House by both sides. There is no question about that.

Now, the word "terrorism" or "terrorist" is also a convenient word to use. On the one hand, we have eradicated terrorism in this country. Well, very good! If that is the case, then why do you bring this paranoia again? Why frighten the people with terrorist activity? If terrorism has been eradicated, then so be it. We are all happy that terrorism has been eradicated. But, we know, as you yourself concede today that State terrorism has not been eradicated. That is thriving today. There is nobody to check it. But, in order to get over its difficulties, what the Government does is, it whips up this fear of terrorism. Anybody who is with the Government is a patriot. Anybody who dissents is a terrorist - immediately a terrorist - whoever that maybe. And, it has come to such a sick state in this country today that we have gone so down, that in international conferences we have to clutch at straws like this to be able to show that we are complying with this international obligation and that tiny ones, when most important ones, the more important obligations, the important undertakings given to the international community, we are prepared to willy-nilly betray.

We gave undertakings to the UN Secretary-General by a Joint Communiqu issued on the 26th of May, 2009; three specific undertakings were given. None of those has been kept to-date. We gave several undertakings to India. The Deputy Minister of External Affairs is here. I do not know where the Minister is. The Hon. Minister of External Affairs with the Minister of External Affairs of India issued a Joint Communiqu implementing the Thirteenth Amendment in full and going beyond that to make devolution meaningful. Where has that gone? On the 4th of February we heard utterances, No, that is all not necessary. We do not have to devolve power like this. Now this is your problem.

Where is the Witness Protection Bill? When the Commission of Inquiry was appointed to go into 16 identified human rights violations and when they were inquiring into the death of five students in Trincomaleee and 17 aid workers in Mutur, while the inquiry was going on there was video evidence that was being led. Suddenly, it was stopped by a direction given by the Hon. Minister of Defence saying, There is no legal provision, we will bring in a law; we will be enable evidence to be taken and we will bring in the Witness Protection Bill. Where is that Bill? Where is that law? That is why the

83 84

[ .. ]

2013 06

very eminent persons that you invited to oversee the work of that Commission left the country in disgust. You invited them and you declared them to be international eminent persons. In their statement they said This Government has no political will to comply with international standards in conducting this inquiry and they left. So, these are your problems. Why do you not address those issues? You have a serious issue with regard to accountability that keeps coming up. In the United Nations Human Rights Council, a Resolution was passed last year. You have not complied with that at all. Instead of establishing an acceptable independent mechanism to look into that matter, you go and establish a military tribunal. The very persons who are accused of those offences hold court and they report back saying that there is no such person called a missing person. Can anything be more laughable than that? This is the reason why the country is facing difficulties.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, there have been skeletons found in Matale. That must be investigated. I agree with the Hon. Member from Kurunegala. Though it happened 20 years ago, or even more, those offences must be investigated and the culprits must be brought to book. How can there be mass graves in this country? You cannot go and face any person in any international forum merely passing this law removing that proviso that made provision for humanitarian assistance to be taken out of terrorist financing is not going to help you. This is a straw that you are clutching that will not help you one bit. So, why do you not get hold of proper strings? Settle the national question in the way that you have undertaken to the international community that you would do without going back on your promises. Hang on to a strong rope and investigate human rights abuses; address the accountability issues in a transparent and honest way boldly to ascertain the truth. Once the truth is ascertained, the country can go into a phase of reconciliation. Nobody wants revenge in this country. Nobody wants revenge. But, that does not mean that the truth can be swept under the carpet. The truth must be ascertained. That is fundamental to the communities reaching a level of reconciliation.

The Hon. Joseph Michael Perera has brought up a very important issue which needs to be resolved without much delay. In this regard, all of us know that the last official revision of the Legislative Enactments is the 1956 Edition with the 1967 Supplement and that is why when

121 122

we amend any law prior to 30th June, 1956, we always refer to the Chapter number of the 1956 Legislative Enactments.

However, a similar reference is not made to the Chapter number of the 1980 Revised Edition of the Legislative Enactments due to the fact that this Edition is considered as an unofficial Edition. This is because after 1972 and 1978 Constitutions, laws had to be made in all three languages and the official versions are the Sinhala and Tamil versions. Article 23 of the Constitution requires that all laws and subordinate legislation shall be enacted or made and published in Sinhala and Tamil together with a translation thereof in English. However, the 1980 Revised Edition has not yet been completely translated into Sinhala and Tamil though much of it has already neared completion.

Since 1972, the Sinhala and Tamil versions of every Act, including amending Acts, are available. However, this is not the case in regard to laws enacted by Parliament prior to 1972. All the laws enacted prior to 1972 which are in operation currently will first have to be translated into Sinhala and Tamil before a revised edition of Legislative Enactments can be officially prepared. This is what is intended to be completed by the project that is envisaged to be approved by Cabinet very shortly.

The Volume of Laws which needs to be translated into Sinhala and Tamil is considerably large. This work which has been progressing for some time has not yet been finalized. Every effort is being taken to complete the required translations as soon as possible. A revised edition of Legislative Enactments involves the consolidation and revision of all laws in operation at present and hence such a revision cannot take place until the translations referred to above are completed.

The last revised edition of subsidiary legislation was the one done in 1956 and the same issue relating to the absence of Sinhala and Tamil translations of subsidiary legislation, regulations, rules, orders, by-laws et cetera, has resulted in not having a revised edition of subsidiary legislation since 1956.

The volume of subsidiary legislation is much larger than legislative enactments. This would be an exercise that would have to be undertaken once the revised edition of Legislative Enactments has been finalized. Further, in this regard, all subsidiary legislation made prior to 1972 would require to be translated into Sinhala and Tamil before such revision is undertaken.

Therefore, Madam Presiding Member, you would understand the enormity of task that we are faced with in trying to complete these translations, particularly, those laws which were enacted prior to the 1972 autochthonous Constitution that we had adopted. Therefore, although work has now progressed, we have faced this time and again, and particularly when I visited some of the courthouses in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, lawyers who are practising in the original courts, particularly in the criminal courts, asked me whether they could, at least, have the three important pieces of Legislation, that is, the Evidence Ordinance, the Criminal Procedure Code and the Penal Code at least to be translated into Tamil because those lawyers who are practising in those courts do not have Tamil versions of these three important pieces of Legislation. Such is the issue faced by some of the lawyers in those courts. This has, time and again, been pointed out to me by several judges of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal that they encounter these problems and therefore there must be some kind of consolidation and this revision has to be done very fast. Therefore, we have now set up this project and hopefully, Cabinet would give approval soon so that we can expedite this project and bring this whole issue to some conclusion.

Together with that, I must say that there is a large number of provincial legislation as well which has been enacted by several provincial councils. Sometimes it is very difficult to trace those legislations also when we have to trace some piece of legislation for some requirement. Since all these difficulties are there, in the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Justice, last time I pointed out that the Ministry wants to set up a legal information centre where whatever information relating to pieces of legislation, regulations, rules, provincial legislations, by-laws and all the information could be obtained from a single source or place. Therefore, it is one of those proposed projects of the Ministry of Justice to have a legal information centre set up in the near future.

I must finally thank the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera for having brought up this Motion to highlight the importance of this important project. Thank you.
