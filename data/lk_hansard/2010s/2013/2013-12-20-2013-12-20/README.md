( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Mr. Speaker, I would like to get a clarification from the Hon. Prime Minister and the Government - it is good if you can do it today itself before the Debate is over - as to why one of the leading promoters of tourism in Sri Lanka has been denied entry to the country. We have heard of Mr. Geoffrey Dobbs who really started the boutique hotels down South. You are aware of it. There are some in Tangalle and because he is moving, others too have started. He started the Galle Literary Festival and I think recently they had a reading of Gotas War there. He has got a lot of publicity in all the leading travel magazines and literary magazines. He has also, to my knowledge, got a lot of money - about US Dollars 4 or 5 million - to Sri Lanka by way of donations. He has been having some local issues. I also met him on the night he was leaving and I said, When you come back, contact the Government. You know people in the Government. I

3175 3176

know people. Talk it over and resolve it. But, this morning he had e-mailed me saying that when he came to Sri Lanka, he was denied entry. The Commissioner-General of Immigration and Emigration has told my Secretary that he is an undesirable person to come in. I think this is going to affect the tourist industry at the peak. In fact, his hotels are the ones - the boutique hotels - that get the best income from tourism. You can listen to him and if you think that he has done something wrong for which he cannot be forgiven, then there is a way of doing it and you can give him time to fold up his businesses. Personally, I do not approve some of the things that have happened. I do not think it is a matter for really denying a person's entry to the country. But, the final decision lies with the Government. Today, when you have abruptly stopped him, the only reason that we can come to is that someone is trying to get at these properties; not merely the hotels that we know, he owns some properties in the Galle Fort, down South. It is going to be a big blow for tourism in the whole of the South. So, I would like to inform the Government of this. I do not know whether the Minister in charge of tourism was even consulted. I myself was going to speak to the Minister in charge of tourism. This will break investor confidence and tourism.

"...... CIFL is dependent on new deposits to meet expenses and repayments, thus operating as a ponzi scheme."

I am quoting from the Central Bank On-Site Report. Ponzi scheme , pyramid , . * .

29 , , . , . ?

. ; . . . They have done a very good job. They have said that this is a ponzi scheme.

Ponzi scheme , , . Why was this put under? ? SEC ? Colombo Stock Exchange ? . , knowing that these people have been violative? . Credit risk ; non-compliance with CBSL directions ; accrued interest direction ; bad and boubtful debts direction compliance ; single borrower limit direction compliance ; credit administration weaknesses ; non-availability of customer evaluation ; unethical credit related practices ; default interest .

Look at what is stated under Item 5.2 Investment Risk. Hon. Minister, this is unbelievable, I am telling you honestly. I was shocked when I saw this. It states, I quote:

Lack of Ownership of Real Estate Assets

The company does not hold the legal ownership for six properties amounting to Rs.984.0 mn of the balance sheet and 97% of the real estate assets

The company did not hold ownership of 97 per cent of the real estate assets. It is 97 per cent.

The company holds ownership of only three properties worth Rs.42.0 mn.

Sir, I am asking you how did this company manage to get an "all-clear" from the Central Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Colombo Stock Exchange to raise more money of innocent people? How did this happen?

Then Item 5.2.1.1 (e) states:

Negative Net Worth

Adjusting for assets with no ownership to the company, unearned income accounted for as profits and investments with no documentary proof, the negative net worth of the company would be Rs.1.47 bn as at 30.04.2011."

This company was junk. It was bankrupt in all technical assessments. Sir, Item 5.2.1.2. is on fraudulent activities that have taken place. I will not mention the name of the Presidents Counsel here. I do not want to throw mud at people. This is the report; this is the reality. Now, the Central Bank is saying that no finance company has folded up, and nothing has been liquidated. True! They are not being liquidated because innocent depositors are almost forced, I am sorry to say this, to convert their deposits into 60 per cent of non-voting shares of absolutely no value. It has no value. Ultimately, what is happening?

. , - - . . . I mean, you cannot let this continue. This is a white-collar crime, a daylight robbery. ? , implement . operational risks , financial reporting deficiencies , non-availability of audit trails - . Under "Non compliance with CBSL Directions" it states, I quote:

.... CIFL will be in violation with the Finance Companies (Capital Funds) Direction, Finance Companies (Risk weighted Capital Adequacy ratio) Direction and Finance Companies (Minimum Core capital) Direction.

They violate everything and yet they get an "all-clear". Why? That is the question. Why did they get an "all-clear"? Is it because of connections with the high-ups? Is it the question? I am not making that allegation, but it is a fair question to ask. Has money changed hands?

There is another document which includes findings of the on-site examination of the same company. Similar issues had been found and the director says, I quote:

You are requested to table this letter at a Board Meeting within 7 days from the date of this letter and inform the undersigned of the action taken and progress achieved within 14 days from the date of this letter.

So, was action taken? Was this tabled? Where is good governance? good governance . . good governance . This is good governance. Good governance has been completely thrown out of the window.

Over the past 7 years, not a single finance company has collapsed, and consequently had to be liquidated.

It further states, I quote:

... indicates an absolute ignorance of the financial sector,...

I quote:

The Central Bank had advised the public to invest in companies registered with the Central Bank, because registered finance companies are expected to conform to certain norms and practices

That is true. Confidence is given to the people because they put big advertisements to say that it is regulated by the Central Bank. Central Bank

. , . . register . . .

So, Sir, the thing is that these are not happening. I also wish to table* a page of the Road Map 2013" of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

Actually I must also commend that this is something new. Over the last few years, they had been putting out a road map which gives a sense of stability as to what the Government is planning to do. I do appreciate that. Even though sometimes what is in here and what is achieved differ significantly, at least an effort has been taken.

there are several points mentioned. One is, I quote:

The number, extent and frequency of on-site examinations will be increased

That is good. We need them to do that. They are saying that they will do that. But, doing is not what is important. What is important is taking whatever necessary action that needs to be taken after you find out in the extreme case that the on-site examination report

calls a company a Ponzi scheme. So, they have said that early warning system will be identified online. I do not know whether these have been done. These are crucially important. One last thing that they have mentioned is that some companies are under management agents. Management agents . , 30 50 .

I have here with me two statements in that regard. I will table* those.

One is an article that appeared in "DailyFT" of 2nd May, 2012. It states, I quote:

The recent buy of a 12% stake of The Finance Company (TFC) by the National Savings Bank (NSB) is completely value driven and an investment to the future of both corporate entities,

? The Chairman of The Finance Company at that time. So, that was completely value-driven. Do you know, Hon. Deputy Chairman, the value of a share of The Finance Company today which was bought at Rs. 50, not too long back?

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, please wind up now. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, give me one more minute, and I will wind up. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) You have taken almost one more minute. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) So, now it is less than Rs. 10. Is he right or is the market right? He is not right. The market is right. They are in such a great difficulty.

I just want to read out the accounts of The Finance Company for the quarter ended in September, 2013. My God! The loss for the period is Rs. 908 million. It has increased from Rs. 656 million. The net asset value per share is Rs. 46.17 negative. So, the reason why I am

saying this is because there is another huge company with some Rs. 40 billion assets and tens of thousands of depositors. Please do something.

[1.15 p.m.] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda - Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development) Hon. Deputy Chairman, thank you for the opportunity granted to me to speak on the Committee Stage Discussion of the Votes of the Ministry of Finance and Planning for the year 2014. It is because of the far-sighted vision and the sincere commitment of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, that the country is set on the right economic footing today. Since the end of conflict in early 2009, the economy of the country started to revive and was gaining momentum in spite of adverse external economic environment. While most of the economy of the developed and developing countries were on the decline or standstill, the economy of our country started to grow under the far-sighted vision of the Mahinda Chintana.

Today, the economy of the war-affected areas, particularly, the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, have started to bloom because of the vision of His Excellency the President and the dedication of the Government under the guidance and directions of His Excellency to revitalize the economy of these regions. Taking into account the three decades of dilapidation, decay and despair of the economy of the war-affected regions, which not only missed the economic impetus, to keep on par with the economic development of the rest of the provinces, for over three decades but also have lost all the infrastructural framework needed for reactivating the economic activities, the Government embarked on a mammoth task of accelerated development drive for these regions.

The meticulous planning and execution of a wide range of rehabilitation and development activities such as rehabilitation of highways, important provincial and rural roads, railroads, bridges, village tanks, irrigation canals, construction of houses including reconstruction of damaged houses, public places, places of worship, schools, hospitals, large-scale irrigation and water supply schemes, projects for providing telecommunication facilities and electricity supply from the national grid et cetera, carried out in these provinces stand testimony to this.

Earlier, it took more than 12 hours to travel from Colombo to Jaffna on the A-9 Road, but now we can

3233 3234

2013 20

travel in 6 hours. Frequent power failure was the order of the day in Jaffna earlier, and the Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu Districts and most parts of the Mannar District were without power supply. Now, they get an uninterrupted 24-hour power supply and there is disruption only when maintenance work is carried out. The Jaffna Teaching Hospitals Emergency and Surgical Unit is a well-equipped unit in a teaching hospital in the country today. The base hospitals in Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Mannar and Vavuniya are amongst the best base hospitals in the country. Today, the North and the East are self-sufficient in agricultural produce.

Since the Eastern Province was cleared from the clutches of the LTTE, large sums of money have been spent for the development of that province. Similarly, today priority has been given to the development of the Northern Province. For example, the Budget allocation for capital expenditure for the year 2014 for the Northern Provincial Council is the highest, Rs. 5.8 billion, out of all the provinces. Similarly, the per capita recurrent expenditure allocation for the Northern Provincial Council is Rs. 16,360, while most other provinces get less than Rs. 10,000.

The TNA Members of Parliament themselves witness all the development initiatives of the Government in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. They enjoy all the benefits but come here and cry saying that no economic growth is taking place in the North and the East. Every foreign dignitary who visited the North and the East including Madam Navanethem Pillay and Dr. Chaloka Beyani, had commended the accelerated development drive of the Government. But, the TNA Members of Parliament in this House at the Second Reading Debate of the Budget spoke of an erroneous methodology adopted in calculating the economic growth of the Northern Province. Rather than trying to pluck hair from the eggshell, you must speak of what you see with your own eyes.

Even after USA officially ending the nine years of war in Iraq in December 2011, according to UNHCR reports, still there are 1,000,000 IDPs. Out of 1,332,400 IDPs at the end of that war, only 25 per cent has been resettled to date. But, within two years, our President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa has achieved what the self-proclaimed human rights guardians of the western world could not achieve in Iraq. Within two years after ending the conflict, 90 per cent out of 353,400 IDPs were resettled. That is, 318,067 people were resettled by the end of 2010 and the balance was completed in the subsequent year.

His Excellency the President has not confined rejuvenation of the war-affected provinces only to economic development initiatives. The Government has endeavoured to bring back normalcy in every sphere of

human activity in those regions. The civil institutions which were either defunct or under the dictates of the LTTE have now been re-established. All the courts are functioning today. As assured, His Excellency the President instructed to conduct the Northern Provincial Council Election in September this year. The TNA was crying aloud that the elections would be flawed and not be free and fair. But, their victory itself is proof that the election was free and fair and their anticipatory assertions became illusions.

Similarly, their contention that the Parliamentary Select Committee to Recommend and Report on Political and Constitutional Measures to Empower the Peoples of Sri Lanka to Live as one Nation would not bring about any tangible results to the problems of the Tamils is another delusion. So, I take this opportunity to invite them to take part in that Select Committee and make use of the available opportunity for the betterment of our society. We have to find solutions to our problems. The Tamil people have missed many opportunities in the past that could have brought about a dignified resolution for their aspirations. The intransigency of the LTTE and the TNAs subjugation to the LTTE dictum caused us to lose all those opportunities. We cannot afford to miss opportunities all the time. Hence, I request them to heed to my appeal. In the meantime, I wish to request His Excellency the President to consider the request made by many stakeholders that they want to be a part of this process. Only an inclusive process can bring about a lasting solution.

There are elements within and outside the country trying to tarnish the image of our country. All the mega development activities carried out in the war-affected regions have been overshadowed by the actions of these people. The LLRC Report contains home-grown recommendations. The Government, under the directive of His Excellency the President, has already taken initiative to implement these recommendations. In spite of the reservations that we have with regard to the intention of the LLRC, particularly with regard to the adverse comments made against me without any bona fide evidence, I wish to appeal to His Excellency the President to take necessary action to fast-track implementing some of the proposals in the LLRC in the manner that development activities in the North and the East were fast-tracked, at least in areas where the Government is in agreement with the proposals. Through such actions only, we can counter the damage caused to the country by these people.

I take this opportunity to thank the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, the Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning, the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa, the Minister of Economic Development and Dr. P.B. Jayasundera for their painstaking planning and implementation of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksas vision and mission.

"According to Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy Visiting Associate Professor Razeen Sally, in the foreseeable future, Sri Lanka is unlikely to become the 'wonder of Asia' or the 'miracle of Asia' - as expressed in various catch phrases - unless the country adopted key changes to its policies."

I quote what Professor Razeen Sally stated from the article:

" 'It could be, the potential is there, but it's not going to happen ....."

It is not going to happen.

" ......and that is very much because of the policy environment,......." of the present Government.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Chairman for the opportunity given to me to speak today, the final day, on the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Finance and Planning. This may be the fourth time that I am saying this. In every Budget, including the mini-Budget that was presented in 2010, I made it a point to record the fact that it is a violation of the principles in the Constitution for the President to occupy the Minister of Finance portfolio. I say this for the record. It is quite clear when one reads the provisions of the Constitution that as the Head of the Cabinet, the President can appoint anyone as Minister of a particular subject including himself. Yet, if you read through the provisions, there are dual controls that are prescribed where the President and the Minister of Finance have to act in conjunction and those provisions cannot be complied with if both the President and the Minister of Finance are one and the same person.

Having said that, this years Budget has been not very different to the previous years in the way that forecasts have been made. When one reads the fiscal management reports of the actuals that have been realized on the forecast and the adjustments made to the forecast for the

subsequent years based on the actuals and the large chunks of allocations for certain sectors, it continues with a particular trend and I like to suggest that that is not a trend that is healthy for the country. The foreign borrowing limits have been increased periodically. Even the limits of borrowing in the Appropriation Bill were challenged last year and there was a ruling by the Supreme Court in regard to this, consequent to which the Budget had to be passed with a two-thirds majority last year. It could not have been passed even with a two-thirds majority because it was totally in violation of Article 157.

Yet, at least, taking cognizance of the sentiments expressed by the court last year, a two-thirds vote was considered necessary for the passage of the Appropriation Bill. This year, unfortunately, the views have been reversed by the same court and that highlights the level of independence that we have in those institutions. I have often stated at budget debates that although we are still following or said to be following the principle that Parliament shall have full control over public finance, in actual practice that is not so. Parliament has either abdicated its function of being in total control of public finance or that power has been totally usurped by the Executive, with the result that we spend one full month debating the budget proposals, when those debates, apart from highlighting to the public the serious issues that are in the proposals, really does not matter to the proposals in any way at all. What the Executive prescribes is done and this merely becomes a talk shop. But, even if it is merely a talk shop, we still can use that to bring the issues to the attention of the public so that the people of this country, at least, know the true facts with regard to the financial management in this country, or the mismanagement that is going on in this country.

If you look at the figures, for instance, projections are made. As I said earlier, in the Fiscal Management Reports of 2010, 2011, 2012 and up to 2014, when you compare the projections with the actuals, it is a humorous trend, because the moment you know that a particular projection is not achieved, next year the projection will be what was achieved last year. Then, you achieve even less the following year and you drop the projection for the subsequent year to even less. If one looks at the Government revenue, it has been far far below expectations and it has been continually declining. There is said to be growth but that growth does not really reflect in any benefit being derived by the people in terms of jobs or income, or even meeting the rising cost of living. The lack of revenue is matched by cutting down on expenditure, and that is a good thing that we cut down on expenditure when the revenue is less. Revenue is very low and getting lower and the expenditure is also getting cut. But, the crucial question is: Where is the expenditure getting cut? Where are the deductions coming from? The Recurrent Expenditure cannot be reduced very easily because that accounts for mostly salaries and various payments that have to be continued.

3267 3268

It is about 70 per cent of the total expenditure and continues to remain that way. The Capital Expenditure is generally curtailed when the revenue is low. But, here we see a trend, a very disturbing trend of reduction in expenditure in certain sectors, which are crucial and ought to be given priority. Expenditure on Education has been cut. Expenditure, as a percentage of GDP, has been steadily declining and that is not a good state of affairs. We know what happened last year with the demand for 6 per cent of the GDP to be allocated for Education. Now, there are disputes with regard to how that is calculated. But, of the Government expenditure, if one is to look at the amount that is allocated as a percentage for education, it has been declining and this decline is not merely in the Central Government but that reduction on expenditure is reflected in the expenditures incurred by the Provincial Councils also.

Secondly, expenditure on health has been starkly reduced since 1990. If one were to look at the figures, it has been steadily decreasing. It is true that in these two sectors, there is activity in the private sector also. But, that by no means, can be an explanation or an excuse for reduction as a percentage of the Governments expenditure. In the health sector also, not merely the Central Government but every Provincial Councils expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP has been steadily decreasing. There is more decrease in the Provincial Councils in the sectors of education and health than you find the decrease in the Central Government. So, these are serious troubling trends and that causes a question as to what the direction we are going in.

The expenses with regard to economic services such as agriculture, irrigation, water, energy, transport, communication have all seen a marked increase. So, coupled with Government expenditure reduction on services such as health and education, and on the other hand, the increase on economic services such as agriculture, irrigation, transport, communication and the like, it certainly makes living for an ordinary person in this country more and more difficult. Education, health, welfare and community services, have been steadily suffering because of the marked decline in the allocations for that. Even other public services like civil administration has seen a marked decline.

Now, the construction industry as an activity has been booming. Most of the economic activity is seen in the construction industry and that is no surprise because large infrastructure development has been undertaken by the Government. We see that right across the country; we see that in the city, we see that in other places, we see that in the South and most notably, we see that in the North and the East. That is a positive good step.

But, the question that we have been raising constantly is, whilst we welcome infrastructure development, how

does that compare with the upliftment of living conditions of the people? You do need infrastructure development. You need to make the country take it to another level, to a developed country status but that we will not achieve merely by brick and mortar, by merely concrete structures. All of that is good. No one is saying that that is bad. But, where does the priority lie?

First, the living conditions of the people should improve and more expenditure needs to be incurred on health, education, social services, livelihood development, on economic activity that will actually help people to become self-sufficient, being able to maintain their families, preserving their dignity and affording education to each child at least up to the Advanced Level, and on health services to have healthy people, cutting down on activity that hinders the health of the country. All of that, the Government must undertake at least, side by side, with the mega infrastructure development.

Secondly, all this infrastructure development, as has been highlighted right throughout this Discussion and even before, has not really matched the needs of the community. Many comments have been made about the night races, the port in Hambantota and about the airport in Mattala. Now, leave aside all of these banter that takes place in this House and ask ourselves the question: "Truly, are these signals, are these indicators of a particular direction that the country is being taken in, while the needs of the community is very different to what is being dished out?" The motor racing industry has come under sharp criticism around the world. In a world that is conscious of conserving energy, even we say that reducing the duties on hybrid motor vehicles, on energy savers must be the declared policy. What is the carbon footprint when we have gallons of fuel burnt just to excite a few in the country? That is not responsible economic activity. It might be a cash cow; it might give you something now, but is that a responsible action? Leave aside all other inconveniences: violations of road rules, violation of the law, and all that, and from a different perspective, just look at it and see where the priority lies. If this is something that the Government has commenced, seeking to promote this activity, then what is the signal that is being given to the country? Then, there is so much talk about casinos.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Chairman) Yes, Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) My Learned Friend, by now, should know that there is no provision for the races in the Budget. That has nothing

3269 3270

to do with the Budget and the Government. It is a private matter; anybody can go. cart races .

( ) (The Chairman) That is not a point of Order. - [Interruption.] Hon. Sumanthiran, you can continue.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir, I will continue. ( ) (The Chairman) Yes, you can continue in the dark. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Member may refer to me as Hon. Member, but I do not think he should call me his "Learned Friend". The phrase Learned Friend is reserved for learned people to call each other. So, I do not think he should call me his "Learned Friend". - [Interruption.] Lawyers call each other Learned Friend. We recognize each others learning, Hon. Member. - [Interruption.] I know you do not know that. But, the Chairman knows that. As a member of the learned profession, the Chairman knows that. So, I am addressing the Chair. There is a way in which the Hon. Members refer to each other here; we call each other Hon. Member. We will stay with that. - [Interruption.] By referring to me as your "Learned Friend", you are trying to raise your standard. That, you cannot do. - [Interruption.] For that, you must have some learning and it might be a little difficult at this stage in your life to acquire that learning.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) I think the same thing can be said about you. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Why are you shouting for the Hon. Azwer? - [Interruption.] Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, you are young enough. You still have the time to go and learn something proper. So, why do you not utilize the years that you have ahead of you? - [Interruption.] Hon. Member from Galle, who is shouting from the back, without doing that, why do you not go and study something and become a learned person without following the bad examples of that other Gentleman on your side? - [Interruption.] That is all right; that is not your problem.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, you have only one minute left. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I will wind up.

I was asking the question about the direction in which the country is being taken. I gave two examples. - [Interruption.] I gave the example of racing, but what about casinos? Why is it illegal in this country? It has remained illegal for a very good reason. It is a huge social evil; it destroys families; it destroys communities. If, for a few dollars, the Government wants to mortgage the health and the goodwill of the country, the family life of the country, which we recognize as the basic unit of society, engage in all these mega projects and go in the wrong direction, then, it spells doom for this country. I have only spoken about the country as a whole; that affects all of us. I wish, on this last day, that the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, Minister of International Monetary Co-operation and Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning, who is here, will take note of that.

Thank you. [.. 3.05]
