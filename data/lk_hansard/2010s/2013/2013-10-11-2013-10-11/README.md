[2.29 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak on the COPE and its Report. As a person who was actively engaged in the activities of the COPE, I am glad to say that the Chairman has done very good work, which is exemplary. I do not think any previous Chairmen worked like this. We have examined 247 Public enterprises of which almost all are running at a loss. The reasons are bribery, corruption, inefficiency of people and overstaffing. I want to thank the Hon. DEW Gunasekara for taking follow-up action. We have sent the Report to the secretaries of ministries and we have asked them to report on it. This is very good work and we will continue to do that.

I would like to speak something about electricity also. The Sunday Leader of 5th May, 2013 under the heading Gross Financial Mismanagement by CEB states, I quote:

While electricity consumers are being thrown from the frying pan into the fire with atrocious electricity hikes, the management and

engineers of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) keep pointing fingers at the political hierarchy..

The Lanka Transformers Limited was set up as a subsidiary. But, actually what happened was, this subsidiary was gaining profits and the Ceylon Electricity Board was losing. At the end, we find that the company which is supplying electricity to the Ceylon Electricity Board is getting profits but the Ceylon Electricity Board is running at a loss. The reason is that the people who are in the Lanka Transformers Limited are the three top men in the Ceylon Electricity Board. When the Ceylon Electricity Board is losing, Lanka Transformers Limited is gaining profits; the same people are there. The article further states, I quote:

"So the million, or rather billion dollar question is, how did the most lucrative subsidiary of LTL, LTL Projects, which could have brought in so much profit for CEB, end up in the private hands of the LTLs top three?

Then, I want to refer to some queries made by the Auditor-General with regard to the Ceylon Electricity Board. Under accounting deficiencies, he points out that Rs. 100 million to be received from the Treasury for establishing the Sabaragamuwa University has not yet been received. Also, the following observations were made regarding the accounts receivable and payable by the Board: a sum of Rs. 28.667 million out of Rs. 226.028 million outstanding from the Lanka Electricity Company, which is a subsidiary company of the Board, as at 31st December, 2010 has remained unrecovered for over a period of five years without any progress. So, how can you expect the Ceylon Electricity Board to be properly run? I think now there is enough hydroelectricity; we have water there. You can get electricity generated from water itself. - [Interruption.] No, you can generate electricity - hydroelectricity - from water and that is cheaper.

Then, Mihin Lanka (Pvt.) Limited has been running at a significant loss. The loss in a number of years had been as follows: in 2007/2008, it was Rs. 3,356 million; in 2008/2009, Rs. 4,657 million and in 2009/2010, Rs. 5,722 million. The liability of the company as at December, 2010 had been Rs. 2.4 billion.

Then, the Editorial of the Daily Mirror of Wednesday, 17th July, 2013 captioned Lanka heading for crash landing states about the SriLankan Airlines as follows, I quote:

The lead story revealed that the Treasury, using public money, had decided to bail out the highly-publicised SriLankan Airlines which when launched had proclaimed itself as the flag carrier of Sri Lanka paradise. The Treasury will pay Rs. 25 billion of the Rs. 36 billion the national carrier owes to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation for fuel which was supplied on credit. The CPC, which itself is facing blazing losses not only due to unpaid fuel bills but also due to other swindles and scandals - had threatened to cut off supplies to state institutions which exceeded credit limits. ..."

1361 1362

[ ... ]

2013 11

"If this wholesale waste and abuse of public funds without accountability or transparency continues, it is plain that Sri Lanka is heading for a crash-landing soon.

If we do not take corrective measures regarding those institutions which have been run at a loss, a time will come when the Treasury would not have money to pay the salaries. Sir, there is no need for Mihin Lanka (Pvt.) Limited. I think the Chairman has made a suggestion that it be taken over by the SriLankan Airlines. That is a very good idea.

Also, this COPE Report has made some very good recommendations under the titles "Redundant Institutions", "Subsidiaries of State owned institutions not accountable to Parliament", "Adverse Role of Trade Unions on Decision Making", "Need for Shifting to a Cost Accounting System", "Appointment of Heads of institutions and members to the Board of Directors", "Presentation of Annual Reports in Parliament" and so on.

I hope that the State and the relevant institutions will implement the recommendations made by the Chairman, the Hon. DEW Gunasekara.

Thank you. [.. 2.39]

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, there are only a few things I want to raise here because if I want to talk about this, I can talk for the entire day. But, I am so disgusted; I am telling you I am so disgusted that I do not feel like talking because there is so much of corruption in these institutions and it is a sorry state of affairs that we, this Parliament, cannot even prosecute these people.

Just take a few examples out of this thick volume. I will take the issue on the National Savings Bank on page 40 of the Second Report From The Committee on Public Enterprises. You know that is one case where the Government has taken speedy action. Now, you have to think about why they did that. What is the issue that I am talking about? This is on page 40. It states, I quote:

The Rs. 390 million had been invested in The Finance Company which was in a negative return on a decision taken by a Sub-committee of the Board of Directors.

I am the person who brought it up in this House. I was the first person to have told this country about this transaction. The price of the share was Rs. 30, but the National Savings Bank purchased it for Rs. 48. I asked "Why?" I questioned this Rs. 390 million worth transaction. What happened? Today, Sir, do you know the price of the The Finance Company share? Do you know how much it is? Those days, people threw mud at us and said that it is only a political issue. They are asking questions: why such and such a person, the Chairman of the National Savings Bank, bought this share. The person by the name of Preethi Jayewardena, who was appointed

1371 1372

to that Board by the Central Bank also defended the transaction by the National Savings Bank and said, No, no. This is an absolutely superb investment. It reflects the actual price of the share".

50 share ? 10.90, . ? . . . 500 . It shows the bias nature of dealing with these people. "If you are with me, you are okay. If you are not, you are screwed". . " . , . ". That is the situation of this country today. That is the sorry state of affairs of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, Sir.

? We have no place to even speak about these issues. We have come to this House to Debate the COPE Report, but none of the Members of the Government thus far, spoke even two words about it today.

Let us take the issue of the Board of Investment which is on page 52 of this Report. It states, I quote:

The Committee queried about the investment regarding the Hyatt Regency Hotel and enquired the basis of approving this investment without giving due attention on their share capital.

, 100 . Hingurana Sugar Industries Limited .

What is Hingurana Sugar Industries Limited? What is Kantale Sugar Industries Limited? We know what happened. The Sevanagala Sugar Industries Limited and the Pelwatte Sugar Industries Limited were expropriated because of political issues. The Sevanagala Sugar Industries Limited was owned by the Hon. (Mrs.) Anoma Gamage and her husband, Daya Gamage. But, what about the Hingurana Sugar Industries Limited? They said that those companies were not making profits. The Pelwatte Sugar Industries Limited was owned by Harry Jayawardena, one of the smartest, astute business people of this country. How can you say that the Government can appoint a Minister who is a better businessman than Harry Jayawardena? I do not believe that. Harry Jayawardena was making money; Daya and Anoma Ganage were making money. Those companies were running at a profit. . .

, ? Who owns the Hingurana Sugar Industries Limited? Do not try to act here like babies like you do not know. The Hingurana Sugar Industries Limited is owned by the people who own the LOLC and the Browns, by Ajith Devasurendra. I will tell his name because that person was in school with me; he was senior to me. I have no fear. ? It has not produced even a kilogram of sugar, but it was not taken over. Why? What are the reasons?

? . . .

The next company is called Penfield. It was supposedly a British company. The Penfield investor had been selected to hand over the Kantale Sugar Industries Limited. But, I found out that Penfiled is not a British company. The mans name is Delgoda. It is not a British company. If you go to its website, you would see that it is a Sri Lankan company with some British address also on it. So, this is the problem.

The Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, when he was speaking, mentioned the fact that unsolicited proposals are being accepted; not accepted but they have rather become the norm. I have here the Government Procurement

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now. You have taken 10 minutes more.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I will wind up, Sir.

So, this is a bunch of untruths and I tell you, Sir, I am sorry to be standing here this afternoon as a Member of Parliament of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. I am disillusioned; I am disgusted! I am sorry to use such words. Why do I say that? Because this is a den of thieves! All what we are doing is act like cops and robbers, trying to see who is robbing where. We quickly catch one fellow here when another is robbing there.

When we catch that fellow also, a third fellow is robbing somewhere else. So, we forget about the first fellow and the second fellow. They are all here to rob, steal, pilfer and to rape the national assets of this country! I hope next year, when I stand up to speak - if I am alive - on the COPE Report, it would be on a better situation.

I encourage Members of both sides to work under the Hon. DEW Gunasekaras leadership, to see if we can reduce the number of pages in the COPE Report next time and that we can at least speak of some good things about the Public enterprises.

Thank you very much.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) , . . ; . .

Mr. Presiding Member, today marks another milestone in the path of progress of Parliamentary democracy as envisaged by Mahinda Chintana which promises to the nation, an effective administration devoid of inactivity, ineffectiveness and portraying transparency all round in

good governance. The COPE was able to enhance the prestige and dignity of Parliament and earn the confidence and admiration of the people.

Sir, the Hon. DEW Gunasekara has carved a niche in the annals of Parliamentary life. He is one of the best-known Chairmen who headed the COPE. There have been distinguished Chairmen earlier. The COPE is a very powerful body. I can remember, Sir, it did not even spare the Secretary to the Prime Minister, the Army Commander and the Secretary to the Treasury. When they failed to come before the Committee, they adjourned the sittings and said, "He has to answer the call of the COPE as it is like answering the call of Parliament". It is so important, Sir. Therefore, I think we should place on record our deep appreciation of the work done by our worthy Minister, the Hon. DEW Gunasekara. We know how committed and dedicated he was; he came to the Committee everyday; he gave guidance to others; he led from the front and 244 State institutions had been examined thoroughly and exhaustively and today, the Second Report is before the House.

Today also marks a historic day because this is the first time in the history of Parliament that a COPE Report has been discussed fully, exhaustively for two full days.

Sir, there had been certain references made by two individuals and I am ashamed and sad to say that they turned the COPE Report the way they want, instead of having a healthy Debate on it, in order to sling mud at certain individuals who came for examinations and answered the COPE. Yesterday, we saw how the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti threw mud at the Chairman of the SLBC, Mr. Hudson Samarasinghe. . COPE . But, I have to meet these arguments, like what the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera said. Sir, in fact yesterday, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - some people call him - said "". I protested and it was not recorded. I think you have to go through the Hansard and remove it because how uncultured and uncivilized it is for a person to call the Head of the Nation, who had been elected twice by the people, "". He does not have the sheer courtesy -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, I was not in the Chair at that time. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I was not referring to you, Sir, but to the Chair. Thank you very much.

1391 1392

( ) (The Presiding Member) Okay. We will check it. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Anyway, that has to be gone through and taken out of Hansard.

Then, there is a contract called "contra deal".

Then, there is another institution, Sir, which the COPE examined. That is, SriLankan Airlines. SriLankan Airlines a very clever Chairman, Mr. Nishantha Wickramasinghe, . Now, look at its performance. SriLankan Airlines has invested into the future, to keep in line with the vision of the Sri Lanka Government, of 4 million tourists in the year 2020 and earning up to US Dollars 8 billion from tourism. In line with this, the fleet of the airline has been increased to 21 aircraft from a fleet of 13 aircraft in 2010/2011, reflecting more than a 50 per cent increase in the fleet. Is this not a gigantic jump, a great achievement, I ask you? The airline has increased its capacity by 27 per cent and has carried 4.5 million passengers, which is an increase of 48 per cent passengers in 2012/2013 compared to 2010/2011. In addition, there is a growth of 34 per cent in revenue, to US Dollars 840 million compared to 2010/2011. The Sri Lankan cargo has carried 17 per cent more cargo volume with an increase in capacity of 8 per cent. . . . .

In line with the vision of the Government of Sri Lanka, after the end of the war, the capacity increase was taken upfront in order to be in a position to spearhead the growth in tourism. However, the airline also experienced higher losses as it takes time to deploy this capacity at the correct yield in growth markets. Due to this increase in capacity compared to 2010/2011, the losses in 2011/2012 have increased. If the airline had maintained the fleet of 13 aircraft, the net loss in 2011/2012 would have been 25 per cent less, from a loss of US Dollars 182 million to US Dollars 137 million. This is the story and this is the correct picture. The economic conditions in Europe contributed heavily towards the increase in losses at that time and when the regimes in Greece and other countries

like Italy and Spain are falling and eating the dust, we are getting up and flying high.

Talking of new ventures, the SriLankan Airlines has been invited to join the prestigious airline alliance, increasing the SriLankan Airlines network and enhancing the image of the airline. Then, comes the cabin upgrades. Business Class cabin is to be refurbished with flat beds and new in-flight entertainment systems are to be introduced.

Then, talking about operations of the Mattala Airport, it is going to provide a full complement of Ground Handling Services for passenger flights, and Engineering Base Maintenance operations were ceremonially commissioned. Also, Sir, the other day, the Colombo Port Expansion Project took place. Dr. B. Priyantha as Chairman has completed a splendid job.

Seven and a half kilometres have been added to the landscape of Sri Lanka by reclaiming the sea. Now a fully

1395 1396

new township is coming up over there. Instead of losing land, the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime has increased the landscape of Sri Lanka. That is why we call Sri Lanka the "Wonder of Asia. Also, an advanced airline technical training academy is going to be set up at Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport to provide a gamut of training courses for local as well as regional students. We heard this before the COPE. Airport Chairman Prasanna Wickremasuriya and Vice Chairman Kamal Ratwatte together with the other officials going great guns.

Then, there is another area. What is that? Some people throw brickbats at Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal, the Governor of the Central Bank.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Give me one more minute, Sir,

Look at what Mr. Cabraal says in today's "The Island" newspaper: It states, I quote:

In the post-conflict economy, Sri Lanka recorded many important milestones. Per capita income doubled to reach over US dollars 2,900 in a relatively short period, thereby elevating the country to an emerging market economy status; the economy grew to a robust US dollar 59 billion, from about US dollars 24 billion in 2004; inflation was controlled at single digits for more than four and a half years;-

What a great achievement!

If you can only read the excerpt of the speech delivered by Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal at the 25th Anniversary Convention of the Association of Professional Bankers published in today's "The Island" newspaper, you will be convinced more than I do in the House today. I am tabling* the rest of his speech.

It is my duty to say this in conclusion. While recognizing the importance of all the departments which have helped us in the preparation of the COPE Report, we must not forget the Hansard Department headed by Ranjani Jayamanne. We are also thankful to the Secretary to the COPE, Mr. M.N. Peiris. I think he is in hospital at the moment. We pray for his quick recovery and good health. He was doing a wonderful job with his able staff.

I am personally aware of the efficiency and co-operation of the staff of the Hansard Department. All Committees including the COPE meet on Sitting Days

and I have seen for myself how the Hansard Reporters have to run up and down to cover the Proceedings of the House as well as the other Committees. It is no easy task to cover all the Committees at the same time. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to them and say that they are one of the most efficient Hansard Reporters in any part of the democratic world. Also, I am thankful to the Hon. Speaker, the Chairman of the COPE, the Auditor General and his staff and all those who assisted in the preparation of the COPE Report.

Thank you very much. [.. 4.35] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . , 19 . COPE . .
