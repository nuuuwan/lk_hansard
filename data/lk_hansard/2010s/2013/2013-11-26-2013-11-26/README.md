asked the Minister of Finance and Planning:

(a) Will he inform this House of -

(i) the current amount of foreign reserves in the Central Bank;

(ii) the current per capita debt;

(iii) the total debt burden; and

(iv) the State debt burden?

(b) If not, why?

..

:

() (ii)

.

In economics, the debt-to-GDP ratio is the key indicator to measure the debt burden of a country and not the per capita debt. This is because the debt-to-GDP ratio gives an indication as to whether an economy produces goods and services that are high enough to pay back debts. Accordingly, a continuous improvement in Government debt sustainability was reflected in the declining outstanding debt-to-GDP ratio from a peak of 105.6 per cent in 2002 to 78.5 per cent at end of 2011. Fiscal consolidation efforts together with higher economic growth contributed to the reduction in the debt burden.

May I also add that our target is to reduce our debt-to-GDP ratio to 65 per cent which is the prescribed amount by all international monetary authorities.

When something is not good for you all, you compare it with some other variable, not with the GDP. But, when the economy is going down, with the inflation the amount goes up anyway.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Mr. Presiding Member, thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to participate in the Second Reading of the Budget Debate. According to the Budget, expenditure for the year 2014 is Rs. 1,985.6 billion. The expected revenue is Rs. 1,437.4 billion. The total deficit is Rs. 5,161 billion. The Government expects to get Rs. 235.5 billion by foreign exchange and Rs. 280.6 billion by domestic financing.

885 886

Though the war was over four years ago, the yearly expenditure on defence did not decrease. But, every year it has increased and even for 2014, the lion share of the Budget goes to defence.

The Government allocates money to various departments, organizations and public enterprises and Parliament has its control over the expenditure through COPE. The Hon. DEW Gunasekara, Chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprises, has given some good recommendations. The COPE examined the accounts of about 247 institutions and out of them, the majority is being run at a loss. This is merely due to corruption and overstaffing. He has recommended closing down some uneconomic public institutions. He has suggested taking action regarding defunct institutions. The Janatha Fertilizer Enterprise Limited is to be liquidated; the Hingurana Sugar Industries Limited is to be re-established; the Kantale Sugar Industries Limited is to be re-established; the Sri Lanka Rubber Manufacturing and Export Corporation Limited is to be liquidated; the Lanka Salusala Limited is to be reconstructed; the Lanka Fabrics Limited is to be re-established; the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment is to be re-established and the State Trading (Co-op) Wholesale Company Limited is proposed to be liquidated.

According to the COPE Report, losses at 249 Government ventures exceed Rs. 19 billion. The loss-making institutions are: the Ceylon Electricity Board, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, the Sri Lanka Cricket, the State Timber Corporation, the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation, the Lankaputhra Bank and Mihin Lanka. According to this Report, Sri Lanka Cricket has incurred a loss of more than Rs. 2 billion at the time the previous Interim Committee was in charge. The COPE Chairman has recommended closing down of some of the defunct institutions.

In regard to the cost of living, no measures have been suggested in this Budget to bring down the cost of living. But, taxes have been imposed and have been raised in some cases. According to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, a family needs Rs. 49,000 per month to live. With regard to unemployment, about 50,000 persons are unemployed in Jaffna and no development work or projects have been started in Jaffna to generate employment.

The EPF loses billions in the stock market. The trade unions have called upon the President to carry out an independent inquiry into the loss of billions of rupees by the EPF after investing in the Colombo Stock Exchange. The National Savings Bank bought 7 million shares of The Finance Company at Rs. 49.74 a share, totalling Rs. 390 million. The CEB projects made a loss of Rs. 94 billion this year. The Ceylon Electricity Board is run at a loss, but a subsidiary of the CEB is being run at a profit.

The two Directors of the CEB are also directors of this subsidiary company, which is earning a profit. We are worried that the Government is squandering monies investing on unprofitable ventures.

We have a port where no ships come; we have an airport at Mattala, but no planes come there. All these were constructed on loans given by China. We have to develop the country by bringing in foreign direct investment to this country. You must get foreign companies to come and invest their money and develop the country. For that, we must make the conditions favourable in Sri Lanka.

I think in the 2002 Budget, the then Minister of Finance, Hon. Ronnie de Mel said that you cannot prepare a good budget if there is an ethnic problem. Before 1956, we did not have any Sinhala-Tamil problem. Only in 1917, there was the Muslim-Sinhala trouble and leaders like the Hon. D.S. Senanayake and others were jailed and Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan had to go to UK to get them released. But, the problem between the Tamils and Sinhalese started when the Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike passed the Sinhala Only Act in 1956. He promised to bring the Sinhala Only Act within 24 hours. When this Act was passed, political leaders like the Hon. Pieter Keuneman, the Hon. Colvin R. de Silva and the Hon. G. G Ponnambalam criticized this, stating that it would lead to a division of the country. But, the Hon. Colvin R. de Silva said, If you have one language there will be two nations. If there are two languages there will be one nation. The late Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam said it would lead to parting of ways. The Sinhala Only Act made the Tamils second class citizens and it humiliated them.

When the Tamils started protesting against the Sinhala Only Act, many problems started. In 1956, 1958, 1961, 1977 and 1983 there were pogroms. This was mainly due to the Sinhala Only Act. Until such time this Act was passed, no one spoke of separation. Before 1956, nobody spoke of separation. The late Hon. S.W.R.D.Bandaranaike laid the foundation stone for the minorities to think of separation. Some national leaders are now criticizing the TNA, but the TNA has not asked for separation.

With regard to enforced disappearances, at the end of the war, according to the Human Rights Watch, dozens of LTTE members surrendered to the army, together with Rev. Fr. Francis Joseph, a Catholic Priest, South of the Vadduvaakai Bridge on 18th May, 2009. The relatives do not know the present whereabouts of these people who were taken in a bus by the army along with the priest.

When the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, came to Sri Lanka and visited Jaffna, he said that the human rights violations here should be tackled by March, 2014. China, a friend of our country, also held the same view.

In a multiethnic society, democracy is the enemy, because the majority community will be in power all the time. In 1983, some constitutional experts in Canada said that in a multiethnic society there must be a balanced representation. This could have been done in Sri Lanka in 1948.

I also request the Government to give amnesty to the LTTE suspects or to the accused and release them the way His Excellency the late J.R. Jayewardene did. By doing this the Government can now show its goodwill.

Thank you.

TRIBUTE TO PARTICIPANTS AND OTHERS FOR THEIR

ASSISTANCE AT CHOGM

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, Sri Lanka today is enjoying a great moment in its long and colourful history of 2,500 years as a result of our hosting the CHOGM. This panoramic Conference that was held has made the honour and dignity of Sri Lanka rise to Himalayan heights. We are also overjoyed about it. It was a proud moment for every Sri Lankan as our President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa was elected the Chairman of the Commonwealth Heads of Government, representing 2.2 billion people in the world and also one fourth of the total population of the world.

There were various attempts made in order to scuttle the holding of the Conference in Sri Lanka, fully backed by the demons of a Diaspora. But, all those efforts were futile, very puerile and did not work according to their machinations.

Sir, I must also record that - it is very interesting - the Diaspora made all such attempts, but appeared childish, I should say, because a lot of nonsense was said from that side about David Cameron. The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe also explained in the House today, the atrocities and human rights violations that have been committed by Great Britain. They should not throw stones at others, as His Excellency the President said at the CHOGM Media Conference.

More evidence of this hypocrisy is spotlighted in the "Daily Mirror" of 23rd, November, 2013. This is very interesting, Sir. The "Daily Mirror" of 23rd November, 2013, under the caption "India questions Camerons stand", states, I quote:

India has questioned British Prime Minister David Camerons style of addressing war crime allegations in Sri Lanka and averred that such style is counterproductive.

Cameron, who left Colombo after attending CHOGM, had set a four-month deadline for Sri Lanka to order an independent probe into alleged brutality against civilians or face an international UN-backed investigation.

977 978

However, Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa shot back immediately, saying 'people in glass houses shouldnt throw stones', adding that Sri Lanka would 'take its own time' in probing alleged abuses.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Azwer, there are two more speakers to speak. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay, Sir. This article further states, I quote:

Government sources in Delhi dismissed Camerons approach. 'It is not our style to go and talk like Cameron did'

That is what India says. Then it goes on to state, I quote:

this can be counterproductive. We know what could be an effective approach and our interlocutors also know what India desires,' a senior source said."

This is very important, Sir.

Again, I quote :

Claiming that India has not lost leverage in Sri Lanka after PMs decision to skip the CHOGM owing to domestic compulsions, the source said,'The fact that external affairs minister went (there) is a sign of commitment to Sri Lanka Just as Sri Lanka cannot be wished away, India cannot be wished away.' Meanwhile, sources clarified that Delhi did not have any favourite in Maldives Presidential polls.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Azwer, please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I will only say this, Sir. I must place on record that Mr. Kamalesh Sharma, the Commonwealth Secretary-General, paid a very great compliment to our Hansard Reporters of Parliament. The proceedings of the meetings were well recorded and produced, and placed before the delegates on the following day itself. Also, we should take note of the fact that there were four reporters who were brought from England. Mr. Kamalesh Sharma told our Hansard Reporters, You are excellent and better than any other Hansard Reporter I have seen around the world. That was really an acceptance of the abilities of our officers in the Hansard Department.

Together with that, we also endorse what our great cricketer, Muttiah Muralitharan said in defence of our motherland contradicting David Cameron, the British Premier. We wish good luck to our President and to our country. Thank you.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Thank you very much. . 3 .
