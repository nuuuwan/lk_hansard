[4.13 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would like to participate in this Adjournment Debate on the state of education in the country. This is one of the more serious issues afflicting the country today. The Hon. Deputy Minister who spoke before me appealed that we should look at these issues beyond political affiliations and I would like to endorse that and appeal to the Government to trod that path.

Today, the Mover of this Motion and, more particularly, the Hon. Member of Parliament of the UNP from the Hambantota District placed before this House several statistics, several facts and up to now, none of those have been addressed from the Government side. We see the Hon. Minister of Education running here and there, up to the Officials Box, outside the Chamber, back in, consulting various people, Monitors and all. We will await to see what he will say today in response to all the facts that have been placed in this House. The Hon. Member from Hambantota made very serious allegations against the Hon. Minister about Questions that have been asked in this House, the replies given by the Hon. Minister himself and that those Questions have been repeated. So, the Hon. Minister has got yet another opportunity to place before this House and to the country the actual situation with regard to all of those statistics that have been asked of him.

The Hon. Deputy Minister who spoke before me stated that today the situation is better than the time before. I would like to seriously contest that. The education sector has continued to deteriorate. That is a fact. There is a great amount of anxiety in the minds of parents and educationists in this country. About six months ago, we saw a heightening of that when, for three months, the Federation of University Teachers Association went on strike, seeking amongst many things, primarily, a larger allocation of funding for education. That has not been done. Six per cent of GDP comes down as the suggested percentage of spending. There is a very definite and good basis for requiring that percentage of spending. Despite that, even today, the

439 440

spending or the allocation for education is less than 2 per cent of GDP. This is hardly satisfactory. Presently, there is no excuse for relegating education to such low priority. This is a sector that must receive the highest priority, if anything else. There was a special Consultative Committee on Education where the need for reform of this sector was felt and overhauling of this whole area is a matter that nobody disputes. There have been serious studies that have been done with the World Bank and various other agencies. But, actually for the Government, it does not seem like a priority.

In fact, whatever initiatives that have been taken have been retrogressive. I cite, particularly, the examples of appointing principals as colonels, majors, captains and so on and subjecting new entrants to university to what is called leadership training and euphemism, which is actually military training. So, the militarization that we have been subjected to, unfortunately for a variety of reasons over several decades, now continues very strongly advocated by the Government at a time when we should be moving away from that, at a time when, particularly, the children should be weaned away from even thoughts such as that. A particular path has been chosen and is being taken. I do not blame either the Minister of Education, the Minister of Higher Education, the new Minister of Education Services or the Monitors of those Ministries. I do not think any of them have anything to do with these matters because the direction in which this country is headed is determined by just one family and I do not think these Ministers have any say in these matters. But, they are here and we will hear another sad speech by the Minister of Education, who will not be able to answer any of the queries that have been raised today. That will be a reflection of the general state of the country, but more sadly, the situation with regard to education.

On the issue of schools, the appointment of teachers from the Civil Defence Force - the numbers were given - particularly in the areas in which there was a war for several decades, is a matter of great concern to us. The Hon. Member gave the figures of three persons who have been appointed from the Civil Defence Force to schools in Mullaitivu. But, there were over a hundred persons whose names were written and the Directors of Education of several districts were actually instructed to appoint them as Sinhala Language teachers to the different schools that were mentioned in that letter. Those were persons not even from the Civil Defence Force, but from the Army. Fortunately, that project has been stalled now; it has been put on hold. But, this is the direction in which the Government is moving. The schools in the North particularly, cannot have one function, cannot have a Prize Giving without inviting military personnel in the area even to be the chief guest. It is the army who conducts meetings to congratulate children who pass the

scholarship examination. The militarization of those areas is very easily seen by the involvement of the military in the affairs of civilian schools; not only the military, even powerful politicians, Ministers, in those areas force themselves onto schools. There are instructions given that no function of any school should take place without Ministers from that area being invited.

I will mention an incident with regard to the Uduvil Girls College since that has been mentioned in this House several times. That is a school that was started in the year 1820, the oldest girls school. It was started by the missionaries from America. It is now being run by the Jaffna Diocese of the Church in South India and is one of the premier educational institutions of this country. Some years ago, utilizing an internal dispute in that school, a Minister of the area actually went into the school with soldiers, with tanks - I saw that with my own eyes - during school hours. He conducted meetings and encouraged children to go on strike and jump over walls. This is the kind of involvement powerful politicians of that area indulge in. This is a matter about which I have personal knowledge, not as a member of the TNA or a Member of Parliament, but well prior to my entry into politics as an Attorney-at-Law who handled certain court proceedings. Because that was protested too much, today in this House we hear someone parroting the Uduvil Girls College incident forgetting what he did in that school and what damage he caused, not only to that school but also to the culture of education and to the discipline of students in a place like Jaffna. But, that will all come back and some day those persons will have to answer to these very serious intrusions they have made into an educational society like Jaffna. They may have their own grievances, they may have a grievance against the educated people, but that is not the way to vent their spleen on education, educationists and educational institutions. We need to do a complete overhaul of the education system in our country. Otherwise, this country will not progress; this country will not prosper.

We need to be in step with the developments around the world. We are still stuck in a particular groove and that has mainly to do with the gap between the secondary education and tertiary education. Persons who enter universities were afforded, free of charge, education at tertiary level, cannot find employment thereafter. It is not their fault, but the system and the kind of training that is afforded to them, does not make them persons who are employable. Although so much is talked about the free education, it is also true that free education has had a negative impact as well on our society. The value of education is not appreciated. It comes free and when it comes free, students tend to think that it costs nothing. It costs a great deal to the country and they must know what that cost is.

I propose - I have said this once before this House - that a costing, particularly of tertiary educational courses

441 442

be done and that students be made to pay for that. I am not suggesting that they pay for it at the time they enter the university but some scheme by which, even subsequently in their working life, that they be made to pay back to the State, the cost that the State has incurred on their education; if not by cash, by different methods that they contribute back so that they know the actual cost, the value of the education that is being afforded to them.

With these words I conclude and I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity given.

[4.40 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. I am glad to speak after the Hon. V.S. Radhakrishnan. I do not know why I always get the opportunity to speak soon after him. He has been praising the improvements in the education system in the Central Province. As a Minister of Education who had been in the Central Provincial Council, he cannot say bad things about education.

Sir, we are still supposed to have free education in this country. I wish to say that the Hon. Minister has introduced a new scheme: 5,000 feeder schools and 1,000 super schools or " " This supiri pasal scheme is not good for our people. We thought initially when you siad that you were going to build 1,000 new schools of a highly-developed nature, that it is a good thing but you have taken a hitch about the primary schools in this. You know that education in the plantations was taken over only in 1978. That is, only for the past 35 years, we have had come into the mainstream of education. We always had schools up to Grade 5 in the estates. After Grade 5, we came to the town to study further up to the GCE (Ordinary Level). We did not have GCE (Advanced Level) those days. Now, we have GCE (Advanced Level) in a few schools. We have GCE (Advanced Level) in Science only in four schools in the plantation areas. So, we always came from the estate to the town school to study beyond Grade 5.

So, this feeder schools - sapiri pasal - system was there for the plantations always. When you create 1,000 new schools, we also should get a fair share. We must get at least 75 schools in the whole country. But, how many schools have you given us? If you take the Kalutara District, not a single school has been given for us. Why? They came and proposed Millakanda Tamil Vidyalaya as a super school. But, they

445 446

[ ]

2013 07

said that they have to remove the primary section from that school. When you remove the primary section, what can they do? This school is in the Bulathsinhala Town. So, the children in the town will have to find an estate school to join a feeder school. After going there, they have to come back to the town for their post-primary or secondary education. If you take Maskeliya, - the Hon. V.S. Radhakrishnan also spoke about this - St. Josephs College, Maskeliya is a very good school where we had classes from Primary up to Advanced Level. But, this school was not included in the 1,000 Then, the parents and the SDS came and spoke to you and you converted it into a school. But, they had to remove the primary section. To remove the primary section, you did not provide land or you did not provide buildings. The parents have now rented a house and Year 1 and Year 2 classes are being conducted in that premises and the rent is being paid by the parents. If you abolish this Primary Section in St. Josephs College, Maskeliya, then the people in the town have to send their children to a feeder school in an estate up to Year 5 and then get them back to the town for the post-primary or secondary education.

This situation does not fit into our scheme because we come to the town school for secondary education. So, what is the method out of this? Continue to give us or super schools and at the same time allow them to continue the primary section. You will not dare to remove the Primary Section in Royal College, D.S. Senanayake College, Ananda College or Nalanda College because those parents are very powerful people. They can even get the Minister changed. But, when it comes to an estate school, they are not powerful people. You forced us to remove the Primary Section. You forced us to rent a building to run a primary school and we are paying from our pockets. Is this the true free education that we are planning?

Your concept of developing 1,000 schools to a very high standard is welcome. It is good. Your idea of developing 5,000 primary schools to feed these schools is also very good.

Out of these 5,000 schools, you must give us at least 7 per cent, say 350 schools, to be developed as good primary schools. Similarly, you must provide at least 70 of these for our community and while providing that, do not remove the primary section from the town schools because the people in the town have to send their children to these primary schools.

Then, if you take Advanced Level, we are not having enough graduate teachers, so we are unable to have schools with Advanced Level. We have only four schools with Science for Advanced Level. Because of that we are not creating enough Science graduates. When we do not create Science graduates, you cannot appoint Science Teachers to teach in the Advanced Level classes. So, when you continue to have only four schools to teach

Science and when you continue to have a shortage of Science-educated children from the Tamil community in the up-country, you are unable to ever create more Science schools in the up-country.

We have to find a way out. You must admit Science-educated children even with lower qualifications as an interim measure - say for six years - so that about five batches can pass out. Then, make them teachers; give them an opportunity. Three years back, the Government of India offered 20 scholarships to send our students to India for a BSc Degree and after that to do a BT course - Bachelor of Teaching - in India. So that when they come back they can join our education scheme. Sixty children were sent abroad. They are coming back and now they are assuming teaching posts. Now that India has done had scheme for three years, you must also take up this scheme. You can send 20 children every year for Science education in India. When they come back, offer them teaching opportunities. They will take up teaching opportunities and maybe in another five years time, we can have about 75 schools with Science education.

You have a target. You say that today less than 20 per cent is studying Science and you want to increase this. If our country is to be developed in future, we must have more Science graduates. That is your policy. But, that should not be restricted to a part of the community. It should also reach our people. Our people also deserve it as citizens of this country. They also should get an equal opportunity. To do this, you have to create more Science teachers. This can be done by you and you have the capacity to do it. If you have the heart to do it, this will be successful.

At present, we have one major issue. That is, less than half per cent of the university admissions is secured by the students from upcountry. We are nearly 7 per cent in this country but we get about half per cent of the university admissions. That is because our education is still backward. Maybe we entered the mainstream late but that does not mean that we have to wait another 35 years to reach the standard of the rest of the country. An accelerated programme is essential so that more of our children will be able to get into universities. I request the Hon. Minister to devote some special attention to this issue and take action. Thank you.

[4.50 p.m.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I must, first of all, record my appreciation of the great work done by the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane, Minister of Education. I think he had to face a lot of fast bowling and so far he is battling it out in the middle very successfully.

447 448

Sir, I also must congratulate the new young Minister, the Hon. Duminda Dissanayake, who was appointed lately by His Excellency the President as the Minister of Education Services. He is a son of a very great leader of the North Central Province who steered the affairs of Rajarata, the Hon. Berty Premalal Dissanayake, as the former Chief Minister of that area.

I was also very surprised when the Hon. Vijitha Herath chose to cast aspersions on him saying, '' '' , , , banners ; ; ""

Sir, particularly, the Hon. Minister of Education is a Member of the Colombo District. There are a lot of shortcomings in schools in the Colombo. From time to time, we have brought it to the notice of the Hon. Minister. Also, Dr. (Mrs.) Hajarjhan Mansoor prepared a report with regard to that and gave it to you. That report was submitted to His Excellency the President at Temple Trees.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair.

, [ ] .

, , [ ] .

Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. CHANDIMA WEERAKKODY] took the Chair.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, Al-Iqbal Balika Maha Vidyalaya is in very bad shape in the Slave Island. Then, schools like Al-Nasser Muslim Maha Vidyala at Grandpass, Al-Ameen Vidyalaya at Slave Island, Sir Razik Fareed Muslim

Vidyalaya at Mattakkuliya and also Al-Hijra Maha Vidyalaya at Dehiwala need upgrading, better facilities and also more funds to develop education. Particularly, Al-Hijra Maha Vidyalaya at Dehiwala, where we also live, is on the bank of a canal, which is not a suitable place. I think the Hon. Mohan Lal Grero also knows that very well. If this school could be shifted to another place, it will be well and good because students can either fall on to the road and meet with an accident or sometimes they may fall into the canal itself. It is a very unsuitable place for a school. But, people at that time thought it good to start a Muslim school in that area and that has been done.

Then, Sir, there have been difficulties in obtaining playgrounds for certain schools. Here is a letter with me written by Al-Haj I.L. Mawzook, Principal of An-Noor Central College of Panagamuwa in the Kurunegala District. It states, I quote:

- 1500 60

I have visited this school several times for prize-giving and other functions. I think this is one of the best schools in the Kurunegala District. , playground

An assembly hall for Thunduwa Muslim Maha Vidyalaya at Panapitiya is also very essential for this school. Panapitiya village is one of the oldest villages in the Galle District. It became a Muslim village in the Galle District owing to the efforts of Mr. P. de S. Kularatne, one of our great educationists, at the request of Sir Razik Fareed at that time. Sir, it is in your area in the Galle District. I know that you are also taking very good interest in promoting education. They have invited me also to visit them saying that you will also be present.

Sir, these schools are lacking toilet facilities. I am happy to state that the Hon. Minister of Economic Development has sent all Members of Parliament a circular to recommend schools which need better and modern toilet facilities.

Then, there is the question of Moulavi teachers. We are once again thankful to the Minister for appointing a hundred odd Moulavis but there seems to be another hundred to be appointed and it will take a long time. The All- Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference is always persisting that Moulavis should be appointed. From all the Arabic Colleges, year in and year out, there are Moulavis who pass out. Therefore, I would kindly urge the Minister to appoint Moulavis and help Arabic and Islamic education in the colleges.

In Sura 96: Verse 1 of the Holy Quran, it states, I quote:

"Iqra' Bismi Rabikallazi Khalaq"

which means, "Read, educate yourself in the name of God who created you". This Quranic Sura was well quoted by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa when he went as the Chief Guest to open a four-storeyed building at the Muslim Ladies' College in Bambalapitiya. The Hon. Minister was also present. I am very thankful to the Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie, his son, Mr. Nauzer Fowzie and the family members who donated funds for it. Also, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Minister of Economic Development laid the foundation stone recently at the Fathima Muslim Ladies' College in Bandaranaike Mawatha, which is one of the primary State-controlled Muslim Girls Schools in the Island and Z.A.M. Refai Hadjiar has come forward to donate the necessary funds for it.

Then, Sir, there is a request to restore the Malay Language as a subject for the GCE (Ordinary Level) Examination. Now, Sir, it is quite absurd to restore the Malay Language as a subject for the Advanced Level Examination when, for obvious reasons, it has been discontinued for the Ordinary Level Examination. I have a letter written by the Conference of Sri Lankan Malays - COSLAM - signed by Mr. T.K. Azoor, the President and a former Principal of Zahira College, Colombo. Sir, I table* this letter.

All the details are there. There are 350 million people who speak the Malay language. It is the Lingua Franca of Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and also, in other countries like Singapore, Thailand, Philippines and Surinam, significant minorities are speaking. Particularly, Malays in this country have contributed a lot for the safety and security of the country from the time of the English rulers. They have developed canals and there are various places we could recall their habitations like in Jawatta, Ja-Ela and Chavakachcheri.

Malays are dedicated, very patriotic and very well-known throughout the world, particularly in Sri Lanka. People of the calibre of great leaders like T.B. Jayah and Justice M.T. Akbar, came from this distinguished clan.

Jaffna schools need a lot of help and assistance. Although at one time, Jaffna was very high in educational standards, certain schools have fallen from that standard now. Particularly, after the destruction of Jaffna, Osmania College and Khadeeja College, which were two great colleges that were run very well catering to the Muslims of the entire Northern and other provinces, are also in a

dilapidated condition today. I think lately,

. The Deputy Mayor of Jaffna presided over that and also Moulavi Sufiyan is taking a lot of interest. Jaffna is a place that produced great leaders like Senator A.M.A. Azeez - ...

-, Justice M.M. Abdul Cader, Dr. M.H.M. Abdul Cader and the first Muslim Mayor of Jaffna Quazi, M.M. Sultan. There had been a lot of cultural and other activities. Even leaders from India came and had lectures in these colleges and addressed Meelad Shareef meetings and the the other functions in Jaffna from time to time. Therefore, all these need to be attended to very urgently.

I would also like to mention that there is a high level of educational standard in the Eastern Province today. I must emphasize that. Once in the 1960s, when we went to a village like Maruthamunai from where Senator Mashoor Moulana comes, we could not find a graduate or an Advanced Level student. But, today in one house you find two lady doctors and that is the advancement made. I hope and pray that playground facilities will be given to all these schools in order to help them to develop their sporting skills.

Thank you very much.
