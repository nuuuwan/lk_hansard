Hon. Speaker, we all know that everyone makes these types of speeches. If anyone breaks the boundaries of free speech, both the civil law and the criminal law are available to take action against them. If someone says, We are going to take arms to defend the sovereignty of the people, is that an offence? There is a school of thought that says you have a right to bear arms in defence of liberty. But, according to this, anyone who belongs to that school of thought has to be locked up under the PTA.

[3.18 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Deputy Speaker, right at the outset, I wish to inform this House that I do not agree with the Motion of No Confidence that has been presented to this House. There are reasons for that. There are also reasons why I wish to speak today and bring out certain contradictions that this House should take note of.

The Mover of the Motion, the Hon. Member from Kalutara, very clearly stated that this is not personally aimed at the Hon. Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare but that he is presently the holder of that office and, therefore, this Motion is being moved. I do not agree with that because the Motion substantively states that the incumbent Minister is not fit to hold this post. I do not agree that it is the failure on the part of the Hon. Minister that resulted in this tragedy which we all recognize as a national tragedy because the child who was executed, was so vulnerable, was so weak, had been abandoned, been in prison for seven years and her life was taken away for no fault of hers and I do not think it is appropriate to now find scapegoats for that national tragedy. I think the Government as a whole is responsible; in some sense, all of us are also responsible for this.

The fact that a child had to falsely state her age and go abroad as a housemaid to sustain her family here, is an indictment on all of us; that we still have people in this country who are unable to make ends meet, who cannot generate enough livelihood and are forced to send their young girl children into hostile environments like this. That is something, I think, the Government of the day must take very serious note of particularly with regard to sending workers to Saudi Arabia and many other countries. I am not for a moment calling into question the laws that are extant in those countries. I am not for a moment challenging the Shariah law but I am seriously suggesting to the Government, not only because of Rizana Nafeek, but also the fact that several people who have gone as housemaids to the Middle East have returned in a coffin. Several have been very badly injured and cruelly treated. There are several who have gone missing, who have run away from their employers and have not been found. All of these things have happened, and has happened mostly in the Middle Eastern countries where our womenfolk were forced to go and find employment in order to sustain their families. This is a terrible indictment on us and I wish that the Hon. Minister - although there is a Motion of No Confidence against him that is being debated in this House - will in future take steps to address and redress.

The contradictions that I am raising have to do with what happens in our country. Mr. Deputy Speaker, today

we will find Members from both sides of the House waxing eloquent about the laws that are extant in Saudi Arabia and about the provision that makes confession admissible and so on. We do have a law that makes confession admissible. Earlier in the day, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition raised that issue about the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the only law that is extant in our country today that makes confessions admissible and all of us know how these confessions are obtained. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition raised a very important issue today.

This Prevention of Terrorism Act is still being made use of against political opponents. Mr. Azath Sallys situation is an example but that is not the only one. There are persons who have been arrested. There were four university students who were arrested in Jaffna, along with them 39 others. Only the university students have been released but those 39 others are still incarcerated without even once being produced before a magistrate because there is a Regulation made under the Prevention of Terrorism Act that makes it possible for the defence authorities to call somebody a "surrendee" and send him for what is purported to be rehabilitation. You are depriving a person of his personal liberty without any judicial intervention; such is the rigour of this draconian law.

Today, you will talk about the confession of Rizana Nafeek and from both sides you will condemn it, but what are you doing in this country even today? You are using a worse law than what is even extant in Saudi Arabia. You have no worry about that. You will use this law because you think it will enable you to remain in power, to crush any kind of opposition to your rule. I am not saying this only against this Government. That law was brought in by the United National Party in 1979 as a Temporary Provisions Act valid for six months, extended and then in 1982 made permanent. Even when Emergency was lifted with such fanfare here, the Prevention of Terrorism Act was further strengthened. We pull wool over the eyes of the international community saying that we have lifted the Emergency, but the PTA was further strengthened and it is being used. So, what is the point of both sides crying foul today about the laws in Saudi Arabia when you yourself apply worse laws in this country?

There is something else that is happening. We are talking about the right to life of Rizana Nafeek and that was denied. I take this opportunity to once again express our heartfelt condolences to her family. She had a right to live and that was cruelly taken away. But, we do that in our country today. Do we not? We do that without thinking. At present the right of the Tamil people to live in their own land in this country is being taken away by this Government.

2005 2006

Never before in the history of this country was land grabbed from a community like the way it is being done today - 6,381 acres - all in one go. The Land Acquisition Act was not enacted for such a purpose. It was to take over land for public purpose. "Public" meaning the public of that area for a playground, for a cemetery, for a hospital or for a road that that public there will use. But, what are you doing today? You are not taking over one plot of land. You are taking away about 9,900 families separate lands by one sweep, by one notice under Section 2 of the Land Acquisition Act. Is that not taking away their right to life in the traditional areas in which they have lived on land that they have inherited?

There is a definition of genocide. Genocide is not merely killing a race. Genocide is also moving people out of their traditional habitat. That is a historic definition of genocide. In several countries - in Canada, in the USA with regard to the Indians, in Australia with regard to the Aboriginals - this has been established. You move a particular community, a particular race, a particular people out of the traditional homeland where they have lived for centuries, for generations. It is clearly genocide. Now, that is happening right before our eyes today.

We are eulogizing about Rizana Nafeek and I do not find anything wrong with that. We should. As I said before, it is a national tragedy and we must all acknowledge that and take responsibility for that. But, the contradiction is, while today we agree on that, we are ourselves perpetrators of greater violence that is happening in our country. I cited two examples of the Prevention of Terrorism Act still continuing to be a law that is extant and the land grab by the military to establish a cantonment - that is what that notice says - not only 6,381 acres, but several thousand acres in other places as well, all belonging to the Tamil people. No other community of this country has ever been put to peril like this. You scream your head off when you are asked questions in international fora saying, We are being unfairly treated. Why is there so much unnecessary attention on Sri Lanka?" Why would not there be attention on Sri Lanka when you are committing genocide at the scale that you are doing?

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) No, you cannot mention his name. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I have to mention his name, Hon. Minister. - [Interruption.] Anyway, this is not a Motion against only the Hon. Dilan Perera but also against the Ministry itself, which had failed to protect Rizana Nafeek. So, that is the issue.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) There has been a Debate today, where many of you have spoken to defend the Hon. Minister. What have you done? You had three speakers to throw mud at the Members who proposed and seconded this Motion. It is a shame! I was ashamed to sit in this House when the Hon. Rohitha Abeygunanwardena spoke. - [Interruption.] He was only speaking about the Mover of the Motion and not about the proposal. Then, we heard two others, the Hon. Minister of Sports and the Hon. Jagath Pushpakumara. They were both only throwing mud at others and not talking anything useful. We also heard the honourable Professor of Law - Minister of External Affairs - and the Minister of Justice. They were both speaking -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) . . ( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) . . [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) . . [ ] . .

The Hon. Minister of External Affairs and the Hon. Minister of Justice were talking about the process of getting pardon for Rizana from the King of Saudi Arabia, the letter written by His Excellency the President, his meeting the Crown Prince and other processes. But, this is not what we are talking about.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Then, what are you talking about? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The three Members who spoke on this - the Member who moved it, the Member who seconded it and the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera - spoke about the issue behind the execution of Rizana Nafeek.

( ) (An Hon. Member) Hon. Member, you do not know what you are talking about at all. - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) When this incident happened in 2005 and when the case was filed in 2006, there were issues. One issue was that that child was less than 18 years old, a juvenile, accused and she had certain rights. Did this Government do anything to counter that in the courts of law? - [Interruption.] The case was filed in 2006. A verdict in a primary court was given in 2007 and the final order of the High Court was given in 2010. During this period, did you take up the juvenile nature of this accused in court? You did not; you failed to do it. - [Interruption.] Then, where is your defence? All this time, you all shouted unworthy things. Did you show that you did take this up in court? You did not show it.

The second issue is about the death of this infant. The housemaid was accused of having strangled the child to death.

To prove that this child was strangled, there should have been a postmortem report which should have been challenged, which should have been asked for by the lawyers who appeared for this country on behalf of Rizana Nafeek. But, you have not shown that you did put this forward. In this way, you have failed to fight the case of Rizana in the courts of Saudi Arabia in a proper manner. So, you have failed and this is what we are accusing you of.

The third is, during the period of the trial, if you had acted against the agent who sent this child abroad or the person who got the false passport done, if you had convicted them - [Interruption.] They were taken to jail in 2010. If they were taken to courts in 2007 or at least before 2010 when the appeal was being heard, then you would have had a chance of winning this case on behalf of Rizana. But, you failed to do that. After all that, what do you do? You come here and throw mud at those people who are trying to point this out. Do you know why we brought in this Motion? We brought in this Motion in order to focus on the issues that are happening in the Middle East. Your Government is dependent on the monies remitted by these poor workers in the Middle East. But, you failed to look after them. Even today, in Saudi Arabia, more than 1,300 people are suffering. What is the action you are taking? You are collecting more than Rs. 6 billion every year as Foreign Employment Bureau charges. But, to what extent are you looking after these people? They are the people who are sustaining this economy. You have failed them and that is why we brought in this No-Confidence Motion against the Hon. Dilan Perera or the Ministry of Foreign Employment

2081 2082

Promotion and Welfare and your Government. We cannot debate a Motion against your Government in a day. We will have to meet for 10 days because there are so many accusations that we have to make against you. Further, to bring in a No-Confidence Motion against you, we will have to print a large book to file that Motion.

Under these circumstances, we ask you to look at this issue afresh, so that at least there are no more Rizana Nafeeks who will be executed in the Middle East because of your inaction. I feel you have not answered the queries raised by the Opposition and as such you should all support this Motion. Thank you. [.. 7.13] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon.
