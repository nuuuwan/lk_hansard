( ) (Mr. Speaker) , point of Order ?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Speaker, I saw you in your Chambers. I am raising this point of Order to get a clarification because the Hon Members of this House have got to be educated on certain rules and regulations that bind us.

1179 1180

Yesterday, the Hon. Anura Dissanayake raised a Question of Privilege and he requested you to hear the relevant CD or the tape recording and give an Order. This cannot be allowed according to the Standing Orders.

I have referred to Erskine May and also another two Parliamentary experts, M.N. Kaul and S.L. Shakdher. I think, we, ourselves have to be educated, otherwise this will set a bad precedent. . Sir, their contention is this: A Member should be very precise and place before the House the facts of the case and state how his Privilege has been infringed upon.

He has to present the case before the House for the Chair or the Speaker to take cognizance of that fact. So, this can become a wrong precedent which the House is not bound to follow. There are good conventions and practices that have been set in the House of Commons as explained to us by the world famous Erskine May, M.N. Kaul and S.L. Shakdher. Therefore, Sir, I would request you to ask the Hon. Member - you may, in your own way decide upon it - that he should place before the House the relevant facts and state where his Privilege has been infringed upon and thereafter, you will be able to give an Order on that. The onus is put on the Chair. It is not nice and it is not correct for you to go through CDs or tape recordings and then give an Order. Sir, with honour, I would like to submit to you that it is not the duty of the Chair. That is my contention.

Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . , . .

There are false allegations being levelled at international forums by the TNA to tarnish the image of

the country and that of the security forces. The concerns of the TNA, I view as contemptuous and hilarious because their continuous, treacherous attempt is to paint a wrong picture to undermine the economic development in the country, dissuade investments, persuade tourists to boycott the country, reduce volumes of international trade and to strike at the root of the economy, which is vibrant at the moment. So, I must ask the TNA which is now shedding crocodile tears for these Tamil people, where were they when the LTTE killed the Hon. (Dr.) Neelan Tiruchelvam, the Hon. A. Amirthalingam, the Hon. A.Thangathurai, the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, the Hon. V. Yogeswaran and his wife?

Also, they are finding fault with the army entering the University of Jaffna. I must say that when I was in Jaffna during the peace talks, the LTTE forcibly entered into the Tamil schools, took out the children and utilized them for their activities. When the principals were objecting, they mercilessly assaulted them in front of the students. Where was the TNA at that time?

In conclusion, Madam Presiding Member, I must say that there is a Sloka in the Veda which differentiates man from animal. I quote: " "

. . . . [4.39 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Madam Presiding Member, I wish to speak today, first, congratulating the previous speaker from the Opposition, the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake. He made a very good speech and it was like reading the LLRC Report again. He pleaded for reconciliation between the communities so that we would not have another fight between communities in this country.

The Hon. Felix Perera also said that there has to be reconciliation and development but, at the same time, if your Government does not respect the rights and wishes of the people in the North and the East, we will never have peace in this country. This is what we have always been saying. The Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that a woman whose child died near a bridge wanted to go near that bridge to shed tears for her child but even that was refused. This is exactly what I have been saying in this House before.

Maybe the Tigers did build some cemeteries and tombs for their dead. For you, they may be Tigers. For the Tigers, they may have been soldiers of theirs but, for the family, as the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake said, they are a brother or a father or a son. It is necessary for them to go back to the tombs, shed a few tears every year in remembrance of them and wipe out the grievance from their minds. A grieving person needs an opportunity to grieve. If you deny that, it is more inhuman than killing a person.

1237 1238

Saying that, I wish to go on to speak about the current situation in the country. You are saying that you will not give police powers to the provincial councils. What does police powers mean? Police powers mean, law and order. Is there law and order in this country today for you to deny police powers to the provincial councils? If you cannot do it properly, you must give it to somebody else. Then, it would be done much better. Instead of that, you want to hang on to powers that you have but not discharge your duties under those powers in a proper manner.

We know that in the '30s and the '40s, it was only the elite who contested elections and then, at that time, they did not have so much of a competition. The rich, who had the respect of the people of their area or electorate and people who were admired and considered as benevolent were elected to the first two or three Parliaments. But then, in 1956, Parliament became a peoples Parliament. The SLFP depended on the Pancha Maha Balawegaya to bring the ordinary people into Parliament. That was a good thing; it was a change in the nature of governance in this country. The 1956 Government was held as a peoples Government, a Government that would look after the ordinary man. But today, what do we have? Your Government has abandoned the Pancha Maha Balawegaya and now, handed it over to the Pathala Lokaya.

That is the reason why we are having a crime reported every other day and some lower-level politician of your party behind it. This maybe because of the current system of elections where there is a need to cover the whole district and you need people to work for you. The pathala lokaya thought that this is the best way to get protection from the Government because if they are part of your system, they can be protected. The police has been politicized. So, they thought that to get protection from the police, the best thing would be to join the Government. So, they, who were earlier behind politicians, themselves became politicians; you have given them nominations and made them Pradeshiya Sabha Members. Due to their underhand activities and because they have a lot of money and muscle power, they have sometimes become chairmen of the Pradeshiya Sabhas. These are the people who are holding the law and order situation to ransom today. They are manipulating the whole system, getting involved in crime in a big way. They are peddling drugs; they are involved in rape and incest; they are misbehaving in every manner but politics gives them protection.

We saw recently a series of killings in the Kahawatta area. The police have failed to find the culprits. There was one person who was on the staff of a Minister in your Government. He has been found totally innocent by the DIG who has now been arrested. If that police officer, who is a criminal, considers another criminal as innocent, this case has to be reviewed all over again.

Today, there is a need to relook at the way you tackle crime in this country. As a person who moves with the Tamil community, I wish to state that traders and business people with means in this country have become targets of the forces who are acting in connivance with the criminals to extort money from them. There was a person from Gampola, a trader in groceries and a wholesale merchant in that area, who was abducted. He was kept for seven days and then they demanded a ransom of Rs. 100 million. He was released only after he paid Rs. 60 million to the abductors. After he was released, the police asked him to make a statement. I brought this issue to the attention of the IGP and he himself asked me to talk to this person to go and make a statement to the police. But, he refused. I believe now that it must have been because the higher-ups in the police themselves were involved in abductions and ransom taking. So, probably he would have thought that if he makes a statement to the police against somebody who is very much in force, then his life and future would be doomed. He refused to come up to make a statement.

This shows very clearly that the present criminal who was in the police may have been behind this type of abduction. Earlier, we thought that the police were there to find and stop crime. If police themselves take to crime, I do not understand how we are going to maintain law and order in this country. I know of three persons in the Kotahena area. One was involved in money lending, maybe, at high rates of interest and the other two who were abducted were mere traders. Their families are still looking for them. One of them has a nephew who contested an election under your party itself. But, he himself cannot find his uncle who was abducted and probably disposed of.

The jewellers in the Sea Street complain that extortion is taking place. Ransom takers are bold enough to give their account numbers to these people to pay in the amount that is demanded by them. Why is this situation prevailing? Is it because the people do not trust the police? Otherwise, they would definitely come up and ask the police to protect them from these ransom takers. It continues. I know very well an issue of this nature in Sea Street. When the present IGP was the Senior DIG for Colombo, we made a complaint to him then. He put a team, traced those people who were taking ransom, caught them and they were dealt with legally. A large number of persons who had deposited funds into the accounts of those ransom takers were able to recover a part of their money. But, today when that Senior DIG is the IGP, he is unable to stop this probably because the DIGs below him do not report to him but to somebody above. This is the reason why there is a breakdown in law and order. These officers who are appointed as special favourites of the people controlling the Ministry of Defence act with impunity. They have no fear and that has been exposed today with the arrest of DIG Vass Gunawardena. This type of situation has to change and

1239 1240

unless it changes, we will not be able to bring any sort of clarity to the law and order situation in this country.

I am sure this Government has to rethink at least about the reconciliation that the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayaka spoke about. It was so realistic and I was glad that a person who was involved in 2005 in bringing the current President to office for the first time, is today critical of your Government as far as the issue of the Tamil people in the North and the East are concerned. However, I do not see eye to eye with him on the issue of provincial councils. I feel that provincial councils is the first step towards reconciliation. The whole issue in this country started from the need for executive power at the provincial level for people in the provinces to feel that they are being looked after on an equal footing. If everyone is treated equally, then there will not be a need for a breakdown in the relationship between communities. If each community is allowed to look after its own needs, that will be the first step towards reconciliation. I believe that provincial councils is the essential first step towards reconciliation in this country.

Thank you.

, . Sir, the Defence Secretary was addressing students following the National Interest Module of the inaugural MPhil/PhD Programme of the Kotelawala Defence University. It was a very fine, a timely and a significant speech. What did he state there? The Daily News of 19th June, 2013, states, I quote:

A viable National Security strategy needs to be aligned with the aspirations of the people, and it must have public support. This will ensure the safety of the nation. The governments prime duty is ensuring the safety of the nation...

..."the nation"..., not the North, the South, the East, the West or the Central.

...while guarding against various threats,

Then, he goes on to state, I quote:

"Even after the war ended and peace dawned in 2009, this bias against the Government led to Sri Lanka being taken up at the United Nations Human Rights Council. Although the initial Resolution against Sri Lanka was defeated that year,...

We are thankful to the Muslim nations. In this House, I must repeat it once again. I further quote:

..two more were sponsored by the United States in 2012 and 2013, and successfully passed.

This is why the biggest responsibility of the government of Sri Lanka even today, in the post war situation, is to ensure the continued security of the country.

He is very worried.

. . ;

. He further goes on to state, I quote:

Without security and stability, there will be no economic development.

He tells the truth to the nation, to the whole Diaspora and to the whole world as to how they are committed to preserve stability and peace and safeguard this country. He further states, I quote:

The maintenance of National Security is therefore of the utmost importance.

He categorizes the most important aspects of present national security concerns. What are they? I quote:

"There are several potential threats in todays context that Sri Lanka needs to be concerned about. These include:

The possible re-emergence of terrorism..."

Hon. Presiding Member, I too wish to join my good Friend, the Hon. Shantha Bandara, in conveying our sincere thanks to His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa for granting the "Deyata Kirula" National Development Exhibition of the year 2014 to Puttalam and Kegalle area including the Kurunegala District.

As the Hon. Minister is aware, I was responsible in looking after the Electorate of Puttalam for 15 years continuously. I looked after the interests of the people of Puttalam like the apple of my eye and even the suburban areas and the electorates. Therefore, Sir, we are very happy about this. Particularly, the Puttalam District and the areas that have been included from Kurunegala District should be developed. Not only a large number of people, but millions of people are drawn to see this novel project of "Deyata Kirula" Exhibition that His Excellency

has initiated. They enhance their knowledge about the development schemes of the country and particularly, school children are benefited largely. They can come and see what is happening in the country; all these development schemes and how they are going to be benefited.

Sir, my Colleague, the Hon. (Mrs.) Sriyani Wijewickrama, said a little while ago that although she went round the exhibition grounds on all the days it was held, she could not see all the stalls. In contrary to that, what happened there? There are mischief-makers even among us. There was an SMS sent during the time "Deyata Kirula" Exhibition was held in Ampara. The mischief-makers were sending SMS asking for Muslim ladies not to go there and if they go, their Purdah or Hijab will be removed. But, it was proved to be utter nonsense. As a result, the number of people turned up for the exhibition reduced on the first day. But, when the Government sent the correct message to the people in the Ampara District, where the largest number of Muslims live, they came in large numbers. Muslim ladies and Muslim girls particularly from girls schools did not leave the grounds. They wanted the exhibition to be extended for some more days. This is the change that has taken place. I said in the earlier debate also that there are mischief-makers even now in order to disturb whatever good things that the Government is doing. They are there to destabilize and create confusion in the country. Sir, the Holy Quran says that mischief- makers roam about on the earth but they have no salvation from God.

About Rs. 1,000 million has been allocated for the development of Hardy Advanced Technological Institute and the Cabinet had voted money at that time. All the electorates in Ampara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee and even Polonnaruwa were developed spending Rs. 15,000 million for each. The Cabinet sanctioned Rs. 60,000 million.

Then, if I recall my memory, Sir, one of my brothers-in-law, Adham Hamid Sameen, also attended the Hardy Advanced Technological Institute when he was young. As a result of the knowledge that he gained, now he is lucratively employed in the Middle East. The Hardy Advanced Technological Institute is one of the best institutes in the country. The graduates who come out of Hardy do not have to wait in the employment queue because they are readily given employment.

Sir, I am very happy that all those benefits are now going to be accrued to the Puttalam District and also to the Kurunegala District of the North Western Province. When I was there, we were able to build about 20 schools and the biggest auditorium at Zahira National College, Puttalam. They have named the auditorium at Zahira College, Puttalam as the "Azwer Auditorium". Earlier, it was very difficult to run through the Kalpitiya Road. I think the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Minister of Economic

1275 1276

Development, has gone there and already gathered the views of the people about the development schemes that should be initiated in Kurunegala - the Hon. Shantha Bandaras area - and also in Puttalam. He came and had discussions.

One thing we must remember is that whatever we do, we must be patriotic. I appeal to my own Muslim brethren in this country, first we must be very patriotic and loyal to our country and that is taught to us by Islam. Now, look here. This is about one of our greatest leaders; I picked up this article from todays "Daily News" under the caption, Educationist and Patriot: Dr. T.B. Jayah. In 1937, there was a Debate in the State Council regarding the demands of minorities and what did he say? He said and I quote:

'We might stand up for our community, but it cannot be said that we have stood against the interests of the country as a whole. "

He said, "We stand for our community, but we are not against the country as a whole".

He further said and I again quote:

'I have always said, and I repeat it today, that I consider the interests of the country as a whole, to be paramount.'

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I will wind up now.

I am very happy that the brothers of Puttalam have also joined me and they have always been patriotic unlike some other mischief-makers. They will be with us and they will improve not only that electorate but also other electorates. I know the Chairman of the Puttalam Urban Council, Mr. K.A. Baiz, is improving the Puttalam town and building new bus stands, new libraries and even the Puttalam Lagoon is going to be developed as a tourism area and named the "Colombo Face" like the "Galle Face Green" in Colombo. He has created that promenade, which is very very beautiful and I think after the "Deyata Kirula" Exhibition, the area will further improve. I also must place on record our appreciation and thanks to the Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya for the hard labour that he is putting in for that exhibition.

Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) .
