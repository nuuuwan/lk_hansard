(a) Will he state -

(ii) the other countries covered by each High Commissioner or Ambassador from his base station if any;

(iii) the experience of the Ambassadors/High Commissioners who have been appointed from the diplomatic service;

(b) Will he also state -

(i) the number of staff members in each Embassy or High Commission posted from Sri Lanka; and

(ii) the annual cost incurred on aforesaid staff in each Embassy or High Commission separately?

(c) If not, why? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) . .

I would like to table* the answer on behalf of the Minister of External Affairs. There is a detailed report on what you have asked.

* : * : * Answer tabled:

(a) (i) List attached (Annex 1*)

(ii) List attached (Annex 1*)

(iii) List attached (Annex 2*)

(iv) List attached (Annex 3*)

(v) The promotion, projection and protection internationally of Sri Lankas national interests in accordance with the foreign policy of the Government and to advise the Government on managing international developments in keeping with the best interests of Sri Lanka. (Annex 4)

(b) (i) List attached (Annex 5*)

(ii) List attached (Annex 5*)

(c ) Does not arise. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, there is a huge hue and cry in the media that you all have recalled the Sri Lankan Ambassador in Saudi Arabia. As of now, we have been informed that he is still functioning in his normal capacity. So, is it just a gimmick to the media or is it to appease certain forces or has he been recalled as of this moment?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) He has been recalled. He will be here before the 30th of this month.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) His term finishes on the 30th in any case. Is that not so?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) No, his term does not finish. But, he has been recalled.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, my second Supplementary Question is this. Today Sri Lanka is very much on the

821 822

world map, not from a positive sense but absolutely from a negative sense.

Are your ambassadors worldwide capable and geared to handle the present situation, especially when the Government has intentionally violated the Constitution and no country less than America, Britain, Australia, South Africa, India, Malaysia and the European Union and the ICJ - all of them - are taking a common stand against Sri Lanka? How are you going to protect the image of Sri Lanka and ensure that we do not get reprimanded for the inefficiency and incompetency of the Government?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) It is not relevant, Hon. Member. Nevertheless, I would like to tell you that the same ambassadors have been serving since May, 2009. They were able to finalize the operations against the LTTE in those countries. But, they were unable to do so during the previous regimes. I think that is a good example of the capacity of our ambassadors. So, our ambassadors are capable of handling the situation in future also.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, while I appreciate that your job is to ensure that the Government is kept afloat, there was no success in Geneva in March, 2012 and we are going into March, 2013 with the same type of environment in a much more hostile climate. So, do not discount what we are saying. From our point of view, we are asking a question because it is not only your country but our country as well. So, I would greatly appreciate if you can ensure that Sri Lanka is brought into the proper perspective, not from a negative sense but from a positive sense. I would appreciate that you get the Hon. Minister of External Affairs to get to the main points and put our country into the proper perspective without touring the world.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Our ambassadors are capable and they will handle the situation properly.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What about your Minister? - [Interruption.]

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) What is the point of Order, Hon. Minister?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Sir, unless there is a Substantive Motion, the Hon. Member cannot accuse me saying,

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

. -[Interruption.] No, no. How can you do that? - [Interruption.] Sir, he may be having a limited vocabulary; I cannot help that. But, if you are casting doubt, there are ways of doing that using Parliamentary language. My Friend has a very limited vocabulary, which is exhibited over television everyday. I cannot help it.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, you carry on. If there is anything against the Standing Orders, it will be expunged.

857 858

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I am not as old as him; I am not as wise as him, but I speak much more truthfully unlike the untruths he uttered here. - [Interruption.] If you want to be scornful, you can be so. You also must have the ability to listen to what is being said. I say with full responsibility that my good friend Gamini Gunaratne signed a contract with Sheraton and the hotel is coming up at Kollupitiya Junction. What you were referring to has nothing to do with the Sheraton Hotel. Why are you misleading Parliament? That is the first question I am asking you. My innocent question to you was: "Who are the owners?". You said, the ITC. I asked you to mention the directors. You say that US Dollars 73 million is the first investment that would be made. How is that such a five-star hotel would come here and invest only US Dollars 73 million on a hotel when you say Shangri-La is investing US Dollars 496 million on their hotel? ? - [Interruption.] No, no. I listened to you, Hon. Minister. You did not allow me to interject. - [Interruption.] I am sorry. You also learn to listen a little. You have lost your ability to - [Interruption.]

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The Agreement is signed between the Chairman of the BOI and the Company Secretary of ITC Limited, "Virginia House", 37, JL Nehru Road, Kolkata, India.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, where does that refer to the Sheraton Hotel?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Our Agreement is with WelcomHotels Limited.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You said Sheraton.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) So, that company can -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Here, you said that you are bringing in the ITC and they are the ones who are - [Interruption.] We are idiots. Sir, we are less wiser than him. We are younger than him. But, Hon. Minister, learn to listen to what we have to say from the Opposition, the Opposition's point of view.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) What is the point of Order, Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Sir, I will explain this whole thing.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, no. I am sorry -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) In the case of hotels, there is somebody -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) No, it is not a point of Order. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, it is my time he is using. - [Interruption.] For God's sake, ensure - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Karunanayake, you carry on.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) He had enough time to tell the truth in this House.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, no.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Now, he is getting up and using my time to further mislead the House.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No.

2013 23

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Just learn to listen a little. - [Interruption.] There is no point in repenting. This is the level you will be in when you have got to sing hosannas for your dinner. To protect your ministership, you do not need to say untruth like this.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, no. You do not know -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am virtually telling you, my good friend, Gamini Gunaratne has the contract with the Sheraton Hotel. Why are you going against him?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Do you think the Hilton Company owns the Hilton that is here?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is exactly what I am saying. In your enthusiasm to show the strategic development companies that are brought into this country, you mentioned that the ITC - Indian Tobacco Company - is bringing the Sheraton into this country, which is an absolute untruth.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is an untruth. That is why they are using the company WelcomHotels because they do not want to bring the Sheraton anywhere close to it as Mr. Gamini Gunaratne has the contract. So, please do not try to temper with the actual situations in this country. - [Interruption.] Anyway, learn to listen a little. The country's present situation, I appreciate. We, the responsible Opposition, had been running the country in a manner that had been perdurable, the benefits and dividends of which are now being used by you. We will never do something that basically goes against the interests of the country. But, when the Government is dishing themselves out to disaster, what can we do? This stragetic development project was brought up in 2008. At that particular time, we did say that it is a good move, but it must be brought in with benefits to the country.

The most important thing that you have got to look at is the basic investments that are coming into this country.

861 862

I told you that I appreciate it. The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, whether he is connected with this or not, if given a task, does it at any cost. That is also dangerous, but he does it at any cost and we give that credit to him.

( ) (An Hon. Member) Why is it dangerous?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Listen, will you? Just because you are in front of him, you need not go to him on bended knees.

What I am saying is, if given a task, ensure that it is done in a national spirit. You must have consistency. You brought in the expropriation Bill in November, 2011. That is something which was disastrous. If you wanted to do something which was detrimental to the country, ensure that you bring in certain things that are there. Mr. Nihal Sri Amerasekara went before the Supreme Court when you had an urgent Bill brought before this House. On that particular basis, when there is a doubt, you cannot bring a Bill before Parliament as an urgent Bill. Today, the former Chief Justice who gave the verdict is basically not able to answer on that particular issue. The Statement that was read out by the Hon. Speaker in Parliament said that there was a doubt in that Judgment. Today, see what has happened. So, urgent Bills cannot be brought in that way. Today, you are paying the price for it because the investors coming into this country say that the expropriation Bill this Government brought in November, 2011 irks them. The Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa once said from the Chair that the Right to Interpretation of the Constitution lies only with the Supreme Court and the Judiciary of the country. Then, when the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution, you say, No, we do not accept that. So, you are intentionally violating the Constitution. Therefore, these are matters that the foreign investors are looking into. Give an answer, Hon. Minister.

Look at the system that is prevalent in Pakistan. Their Supreme Court has taken in the Prime Minister for corruption. If the same was done here, those guys would have gone missing being abducted by white vans. But today, the Pakistan system is still going on because a sense of independence is there. The Executive is there; the Legislature is there and they have the judicial system going on. The same Judiciary got another Prime Minister out once before; the same Judiciary is after the present corrupt Prime Minister. That is the way the system must go on. Just because you do not like to hear out what the independent Judiciary has got to say, that does not mean you have to impeach a Supreme Court Judge. You can do it in style. You do not need to do that within 24 hours.

Give them a decent period of time to present their case and then do it. Then, you would not have to face condemnation from the world like you do today. America is complaining from that end; the ICJ, the European Union, South Africa, Australia, India and Mauritius speak out against it from this end. Tell me of a country that has stood with you all today and said what you have done is the correct thing. There is the sense of absurdity here.

Then, you are bringing in an Order under the Strategic Development Projects Act today to bring in investments, saying that the Welcomgroup is coming in with a strategic development project. US Dollars 73 million is, the Hon. Minister says, what is going to be invested. The land was purchased at US Dollars 73 million. Then, tell me, from where is the rest of the money going to come for investment? You are giving the company tax holidays, excise holidays, exempting them from the Ports and Airports Development Levy and from VAT. Tell me what you are going to charge from those guys. Tell me, why do you not give the same benefits to the Cinnamon Group? Why do you not give the same to the Aitken Spence Group? The Hon. Minister knows, he was involved with it, that there was a company which had asked to obtain land 24 months ago. It was given to them. Two months later, it was withdrawn. Is that the treatment given to the local companies? So, that is why we are saying that there has to be a sense of consistency and coherency. There should be fair play to everybody, not just because somebody wants to come and whitewash their money. Later, when I speak about the Krrish deal, I will tell you about that. That is a clear-cut case of trying to whitewash money.

You tell me how to build four towers with 91 floors with US Dollars 496 million? Who has given them those rights? This is a company that has obtained approval within 24 hours while other companies are struggling for a long time. The former Treasurer of the United National Party, Mr. Milroy Perera, a pure Sri Lankan, wants to build a 36-storey building in Buthgamuwa. He has been struggling for three years and two months to get the approval and even to date, he has not got that. So, what is the difference? Just because they are Sri Lankans, do they need to get harassed or just because they are Indians, do they need to get a special privilege or just because they are Chinese, do they need to get better privileges? All we are saying is, investments have to be brought into this country. For that, you have to create a conducive climate and the most important one is the trust that flows from this august Assembly. If we intentionally violate the Constitution, which you all have done now and proven to the world, how do you get investments into this country?

Then, the Supreme Court must be independent. You need not play around with the independence of the Supreme Court. Who are the foreign investors who are going to come to an unknown country, a beautiful little country - our motherland is beautiful and maybe the best

863 864

[ ]

2013 23

country in the world - without guarantees? That is where you are basically going to have a problem because you are unable to provide such. You said that you would get US Dollars 2 billion investment in the last year. What did you get? US Dollars 671 million up to September, and then you struggled and brought it up to US Dollars 823 million at the end of the year. The BOI that came before a Parliamentary committee gave us this information. And now, you have put US Dollars 2.5 billion for this year. I am telling you, with the disaster that you have served yourself, how can you get investors coming into this country? You may be having jokers like Krrish Group coming here, trying to whitewash their monies, bringing in an investment of US Dollars 10 million and saying, "We brought US Dollars 10 billion into this country" which is untested, unknown. Even in India, they have not performed themselves and they are coming here and showing beautiful structures, beautiful brochures and at the end of the day, what is left? I am telling you, 46 investors in Bristol Street brought in by the United National Party in 1983 were kicked out in less than one month without being given alternate places and compensation. Just because you want to give Krrish Square Towers a nice environment, you take away the innocent people who have been there for 30 years paying rates to the CMC, paying rent to UDA, as was gazetted by the late Hon. Kingsley T. Wickramaratne in your Government. Is this the sustainable development that you are talking of?

So, where does the Strategic Development Projects Act provide the humanitarian face to this type of thing? This is what we are basically talking of. We are a country which is working very hard to destroy ourselves. Unfortunately, this is the Government that you all are in. We, as the Opposition are trying to protect the country. Our job is not to protect the Government but to protect the country and its innocent people. So, Hon. Minister, we

respect your aim. But, tell the truth that is required. You need not be saying we are less wise; we maybe so. That is why we are on this side instead of being on that side singing hosannas for dinner. There are respectable Hon. Ministers on that side who said, ", , . ". Do not lose your sense of respectability. That is what has happened to the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara. Look at the way the Hon. DEW Gunasekara voted. Look at the way the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana acted. Look at what the Hon. Chandrasiri Gajadeera did. Look at the way the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha acted. That is your conscience. That is why we get up from the Opposition and tell you when you are wrong, that you are wrong. If you are right, we say so. We say that the Hon. Minister has brought in investment the correct way. But, what has he brought in? Look at the situation.

You are talking of strategic development. You gave me an Answer in Parliament on the 21st of February, 2012 and said that Shangri-La Investments is bringing in US Dollars 462 million. Then, on the 8th of January, 2013 you have basically said that it is down from US Dollars 462 to US Dollars 408. In February, 2012 you said that Shangri-La Hambantota investment, - your King's area - is US Dollars 525 million and now you have brought it down to US Dollars 120 million, US Dollar 405 million loss. Where has it gone to? Is this hype that is being done? These are the strategic development projects for which you have given approval with no excise duty, no VAT, no corporate tax, no hundred per cent land tax, no airport and port levies. Is this what is expected from them?

. . 315. 565. . Shangri-La, WelcomHotels ? ?

In February, 2012 you said that the investment on the Colombo Port is US Dollars 500 million. Now, you are saying that it has come down to US Dollars 460 million. Then, the investment on Steel Corporation - I do not know what investment it needs. It had been running and only changed hands from Dubai to a local company. Once again, we think it has been only whitewashing the black money that is there - you have said is US Dollars 80 million and it is US Dollars 50 million down here. In February, you mentioned that the investment on the Colombo Port is US Dollars 1,310 million. On 8th of January, 2013 you said that investment is down to US Dollars 500 million.

, , Sheraton Hotel . , . . Strategic Development Act . . Today, look at the Stock Exchange. You were talking about the Stock Exchange. You were talking about the investment climate. You were talking about China. You were talking of Bali, you were talking of Maldives.You were talking about Thailand. I am saying with all responsibility that the Maldives basically receive 975,00 tourists and their average spending is US Dollars 425.

In Colombo, we have one million tourists and their average spending is US Dollars 73. So, what is the purpose in having one million or two million tourists coming in? If the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa or one of the American passport holders goes out and comes, he is also treated as a tourist. That is the difference that is there in this country.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Member, you have one more minute.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, you are going on that basis. Thailand has 12.2 billion tourists. Are you going to compare them with us? What is the problem in Bali? They had problems eight years ago. There is nothing at all now. They had a 33 per cent increase last year. Why do you, a former Finance Minister, and Deputy Minister now utter untruths to the IMF also? These type of things are not expected from a person like you. I can imagine the others who are there. I am standing here as a principal Opposition speaker. We need clarity. You are coming before us and saying that you are giving an exemption when we know that it is an absolute untruth. Market capitalization is 20 billion. That is 33 per cent of GDP.

The total GDP is only US Dollars 60 billion. You are talking of only 288 companies that are listed. There are 10,000 registered companies. Tell us whether this is right or wrong. You are basically talking about investments. Last year you targeted US Dollars 2 billion, but only US Dollars 893 million came in and in that infrastructure was also included, not only the Foreign Direct Investments that you are talking about. When we were calculating, we

did not include infrastructure in that. Today, it is all infrastructure-related. Likewise, this year you are targeting US Dollars 2.5 billion. I am you will not be able to get even 20 per cent of that. That is the stark reality. You see the sensitivity that is there today.

I mentioned about the Americans. They are going to send three secretaries to Sri Lanka. Are they coming here to ask how you impeached our Chief Justice so that they also can impeach their Chief Justice? Is the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence coming here to see how you lift people in white vans so that they also can do it in America? No, they are coming to tell you to put your house in order if you want American investments in this country. If that is the case, please comply with the international rules that are there. Why is the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris in India today? He has not gone to get investments. He has gone to see as to how we can basically rectify the errors that have been created. What are the investments there? There are 16 billion investments between the two countries. That is good. That is the thrust of the Indo-Lanka Agreement. We developed it even further. Today, there is no quantitative direction.

Where is the CEPA? We ask this from the Government. India is the biggest trading partner with us. Ensure that we treat India as a fair player rather than a threat to us. Together, we can basically be a threat to the world. But, if we try to take India on, we will never be able to go forward but we should not go to them with our knees bended. That is the way you have got to take regional trade into world trade. That is how the countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos developed and today Myanmar has joined them. Myanmar has become the biggest threat to us. We are not the only investor. We are not the only girl on the beach. Sri Lanka is struggling to come forward. We have to get our apparatus fall in proper order; an independent judiciary; a Government that does not intentionally violate the Constitution and a Government that is basically able to have a proper record in their systems, not having taxes that change from one month to the next month. That is where the consistency is applied.

Then, Hon. Minister, we are asking about your policy, but you basically asked us at the last debate, What is your policy? Your Government is saying that they are not privatizing. You are saying, Electricity should be privatized. The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama says so. Basically, you know the situation today due to climatic conditions. AirAsia has suspended their flights to Colombo. They had seven flights to Colombo but they have suspended all that. Gulf Air had 10 flights but they have suspended all that. Well and good! Korean Air and the Turkish Airlines are coming. But, what is happening to the airlines that operated from here? AirAsia suspended their flights because they knew that there is no revenue coming from this particular sector. It is the same

867 868

[ ]

2013 23

with Gulf Air also. So, then, there must be something radically wrong in our approach. Hon. Minister, just because we, from the Opposition say so, do not treat it like cyanide. This is where you all go wrong. If you did what we basically said, today we would have been able to have an economy that is capable of withstanding the pressures of the international world.

Today, the Europe is in recession and America is just coming out of recession. You have the Asian tourists who are spending but you have not been able to take them on in the correct way. You mentioned that tourism in Maldives is reducing, but I am asking you this. Is US Dollars 423 spending per day not something which we would love to have? Last year we went down from US Dollars 86 to 73. So, either there are no quality tourists coming in or you are just adding numbers to show that you have had one million tourists arrivals. We are totally with you. Tourism has to be developed. We said this first and now you are basically following us. So, Hon. Minister, all we ask is to just confirm what your policy is. You all say, No privatization. I must say that you have gone on record saying that the CWE was ruined owing to the fact that bread was sold at Rs. 3.50. We resurrected that and made it a debt-free institution and I salute you for saying that. One thing that you all did correctly was, you were able to make that loss-making institution a profit-making one. So, that means, you know where the problem lies. You, as the Minister in charge of International Monetary Co-operation, know the external conditions for internal affairs. So, you are basically speaking the truth. But, does your Minister of Power and Energy accept what you say? If that is the case, what are you saying? Your personal opinion is against the Cabinets opinion.

Then, you say that Cairn India is advancing; that is also a strategic development company.

What is the strategic development in that to give tax benefits? They are coming in for opportunities. It is a company that has been given the best opportunity without any tender procedure and you are giving them tax exemptions as well. What more are you expecting to give? You basically did Phase I. It was a failure and then, you did Phase II, which was also a failure. All these explorations and benefits take place just before an election and you mentioned it at the Presidential Election in 2010. . . . .

' ' :

"Cairn advances phase II drilling in Mannar basin by 3 months."

So, what is this particular one? Phase I was a failure; Phase II was a failure and also Phase III will be. It is not that you do not have oil in this area; the cost for oil

exploration or excavation is not sufficient enough to make it commercially viable. That is the difference.

Hon. Minister, looking at strategic development, we ask you about Hyatt Regency. What is Hyatt Regency? You basically expropriated the right of Golden Key Celestial Towers into them. But, you have still not got the legal right because the company that owns it is not the one you have expropriated. You could have sold the Celestial Towers to the value of Rs. 9.5 billion which was the offer that came from KPMG, and the offer that came from Mr. Lakshman Watawala was Rs. 8.5 billion. You sold it to a company called "Sino Lanka Hotels & Spa (Pvt.) Limited, which is not even government-owned but owned by four people. You sold the company at Rs. 3.5 billion and the share capital was Rs. 40. If you had sold it to KPMG at Rs. 9.5 billion, all the Golden Key depositors would have been paid.

Then, with the impeachment of (Dr.)(Mrs.) Shirani Bandaranayake, you made a big song and dance. At the end of the day, what happened? You basically played out with the money of Golden Key depositors who were very ably assisted by the Governor of the Central Bank. I am naming him because we have gone before the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption with official proof and told, He is the person. But, nothing has been done against him.

Mr. Presiding Member, the Minister of Economic Development is seeking approval to pass an Order under subsection (4) of Section 3 of the Strategic Development Projects Act, No. 14 of 2008 and published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1782/28 of 31st of October, 2012, which was presented on 8th January, 2013.

Sir, before I proceed further, I want to refer to certain matters mentioned by our good Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. We witnessed nauseating verbal diarrhoea in his speech which had been made over a hundred times in this House. He was batting right and left without an aim or target but he never reached the boundary line or sent the ball above the boundary line for sixers. He is a person, Sir, who is blaming the Government, every

Minister including the Hon. Sarath Amunugama, Minister of International Monetary Co-operation and Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning. What the country knows and has to be repeated is that when "Sathosa" was under him, he was told, He destroyed the entire co-operative movement. Against our wishes, the outlets were kept open in the night.

Sir, the Cabinet Memorandum dated 25th November, 2011 states, I quote:

New urban development initiatives are envisaged by attracting large investments in order to develop Colombo as a middle income city in terms of the long term development framework of the Government. The new urban development strategy is also proposed to provide housing for shanty dwellers presently living within the city,...

Is that not a good thing? Even Dr. N.M. Perera, a former Mayor of Colombo, for whom I have great respect and regard was one person who had been quoting Erskine May in this House. I also learned from him how to quote Erskine May. But, he could not remove all the shanties. It further states, I quote:

. so as to ensure better living conditions and provide them opportunities for urban employment and livelihood activities. The new plan for urban development is also designed to protect the green belt areas, waterway reservations particularly with regard to the Beira Lake,...

In ancient Rome, Sir, when the King died, the page or the court crier goes round the City of Rome crying, King is dead, King is dead and the following day, the same page or the court crier goes round the City of Rome saying, Long live the King, long live the King. - Now, you can say, Queen is dead, Queen is dead and we will say, Long live the new Chief Justice. The Ceremonial Sitting of the new Chief Justice was held peacefully in the morning today.

They purposely destroyed Mr. Lalith Kotelawala because they wanted to buy the property. That is how they ended up buying especially, the Celestial Towers. Who bought it? It was Mr. Gamini Senerath. Who is he? How could he buy Celestial Towers for Rs. 450 million? That was offered for Rs. 950 million and you bought it for Rs. 450 million. Why? Because you made sure that Mr. Kotelawala came down so that you could buy his properties. So, this is what is happening in this country. - [Interruption.]

There is one crowd that is greedy to get all the properties in Sri Lanka. This is the reason. It is not because you want to develop the country but because this crowd is greedy. They want to capture as much as possible and bring their money inside through other companies and invest in these -

, it is very sad to see that our Governments development efforts are continuously criticized not only by the Opposition but some NGOs also. Having won a terrorist war, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa is trying his best to advance the country to make it the "Miracle of Asia".

However, instead of giving support, our efforts have been widely criticized by the Opposition in Sri Lanka and abroad. This is clearly a wrong approach. Please understand that the ultimate loss will be on our own country and if you continue to block our work, the ultimate loss will be on our next generation.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) What is the point of Order, Hon. Member? ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, in this House, he cannot - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, you may continue with your speech. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) You are blocking the advancement of your own people. I urge you to understand this negative trend and instead of blocking us, I invite you to join us for national development so that we can receive the best in this peaceful time, which we see after 30 years.

The Ministry of Economic Development, under the leadership of the Minister, Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa, has been driving our economic development and despite obstacles successfully enhanced the tourism sector by many successful, forward-looking initiatives. Our ODI amounts have increased from the range of US Dollars 600 million during the war time to more than US Dollars one billion in the post-war economic development phase.

During the period 2011 to 2013, many strategic development projects of large-scale have been approved by Parliament. I commend the Economic Development Ministry for introducing large-scale projects to enhance our tourism sector to cater to the 2.5 million tourist goal set by the Government.

Guided by the Minister, Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa, during the period 2011 to 2013, the Ministry of Economic Development successfully commenced the Krrish Transworks Colombo at US Dollars 450 million, Shangri-La Hotels project valued at US Dollars 240 million, and the mixed utility complex with luxury hotel at US Dollars 140 million. The mixed development project by John Keells Holdings has a project value of US Dollars 500 million and I am happy to say that it is the first-ever new concept of City within City in our capital Colombo.

The mixed development project by WelcomHotels Lanka (Pvt.) Limited will bring US Dollars 140 million. Its investor, Indias ITC Company is also joined by world renowned Sheraton Hotels. Indias ITC hotel has an

929 930

annual turnover of US Dollars seven billion with 29,000 employed across 60 locations in India. It is among the top ten corporates of India.

Next, let us look at the Krrish Project. Krrish Transworks project is a mixed development project of US Dollars 450 million. The Agreement between UDA and Krrish is for a 99-year lease period at a lease value of Rs. 4.9 billion. The project implementation period is 60 months. We are pleased to say that the complex will have four towers of 70 storeys each. Three towers will have high-end residential apartments.

The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, MP is of the belief that these are poor investors. However, Sir, we believe that we should not be unusually concerned about the initial investment value or how much the investors are bringing at the start. In fact, we cannot expect investors to bring high amounts of cash dollars initially. They are not overnight investors who want to bring some cash at start and then leave. They have come here for long-term investments. We should not forget long-term investment prospects for short term revenues.

All these efforts are made by the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa to improve our tourism sector to a world class industry. In fact, he is a rare Minister leading the economy of a country coming up as an emerging economy in the world. I highly commend him for his strong commitment and dedication in creating the next stage of tourism development and economic growth.

We are very pleased that our tourist arrivals increased by 25.4 per cent to a record high in December, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. Thanks to the efforts of the Minister, Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, and the staff of his Ministry. December, 2012 recorded 122,252 tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka compared to the 97,517 in December, 2011. This is one of the highest arrivals within a month. Our total tourist arrivals surpassed one million and during 2012, the number increased by 17.5 per cent bringing it to 1,005,605 from 855,975 in 2011. The arrivals from North America increased by 20.7 per cent to 59,236 in 2012 with visitors from the United States increasing by 22.6 per cent. The tourist arrivals from Western Europe reached to 373,063, an 18.4 per cent increase from 2011 and the arrivals from Eastern Europe increased by 43.6 per cent with 72,401 tourists. The arrivals from East Asia increased by 38 per cent, to 132,730 with tourists mainly from China. In fact, 58.1 per cent of the total arrivals from the region were from China. Also, arrivals from South Asia in 2012 increased by 4.2 per cent and 176,340 came from India. The tourist arrivals from Pakistan also increased by 9 per cent while the arrivals from Australia and New Zealand increased by 24.3 per cent in the year 2012. I am pleased to say that we earned over US Dollars 1 billion in 2012 from tourism

compared to the US Dollars 830.3 million in 2011.

Then, I would also like to stress on export development, which is guided by President Mahinda Rajapaksa and implemented by the EDB. The export growth has indeed been satisfactory during 2011and 2012 mainly due to the pragmatic programmes and policies adopted by the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government and also due to the resilience shown by the private sector despite numerous adversities. The crisis aggravated in 2012 in the developed countries, especially in the West and the USA, which absorb 55 per cent of our exports. This has adversely affected our exports. The slowdown is not confined to Sri Lanka alone. The exports from India and Thailand also slowed down during the recent past. It is of utmost importance today to turn around that tide in the exports sector if we are to achieve our export goals.

It is observed that Asian countries have shown a substantial economic growth and India and China are expected to show strong, positive growth in 2013 and 2014.

Therefore, the potential in these markets is very high and we are concentrating on diversifying our markets into BRICS and other emerging markets.

I stress that the involvement of exporters is very important to collectively confront the challenges faced by our export sector. We strongly believe that the private sector is the engine of growth. The public-private partnership is the key to achieve success in export development programmes, which is a key concept of our Government.

( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. R. Yogarajan. You have 15 minutes. [5.38 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for permitting me to speak on this Order.

Today, we are debating an Order made under the Strategic Development Projects Act. This Act was created so that whatever concessions given to an investor are known to the public. However, does this serve the transparency that is expected from the Act? If a project brought up is gazetted just like this after the whole deal had been made, what is the purpose of this Act? This Act presumes that the public would know what is happening. If you are having a project to be implemented or you have some land to be offered for a project which you have identified - maybe, a hotel or a multipurpose project like what you have suggested now - then, you should offer it through a tender procedure to the public. It should be

advertised so that a local or foreign investor would be able to compete and get it. That is the way. But, all the projects you have done or have offered to foreigners on a platter have always been through private negotiations. That is the issue we have to discuss in this House today because this Act itself presumes that there would be transparency and equal treatment. But, we cannot expect equal treatment from your Government, which passed the Divineguma Bill in spite of the Supreme Court saying that it was against Article 12 (1) of the Constitution which deals with the right to equality under the Chapter on Fundamental Rights. Because you had a two-thirds majority, you passed the Bill utilizing the two-thirds majority -

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) . .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Maybe. I am just talking about the attitude because under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution, you are supposed to give equal opportunity to all.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) Yes, we are giving them equal opportunity. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Equal opportunity means, you must advertise, publicize and give everyone an equal opportunity -

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) You log on to the website. All the lands that are available for investors are on the website. Anybody can make an offer even now.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) If you say that - ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) So, do not mislead Parliament. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I am not misleading. That is the impression that everybody has, that these are done as private deals. Anyway, Hon. Minister, we commend you because you have brought three good investors to this country. One is the ITC. You must see the properties they maintain in India, fabulous properties. Good! But, at the same time, you are making one-to-one deals which are not transparent.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) These are not one-to-one deals. These are very transparent deals and we have given them 30 days.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Then, you have brought TATAs and you are giving them seven acres in Slave Island.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) If there are any objections, 30 days are given. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You are ejecting people from Slave Island - ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) Until the 30 days are over, we will not sign the agreement. That is according to the Act.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) So, you will sign the agreement only after today. ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) Yes. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) If Parliament rejects, no problem, we will withdraw it.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, Parliament cannot reject. You have a two-thirds majority. So, there is no issue of it. You have brought TATAs; very good!

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) You do not have a backbone, all your people. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You have a two-thirds majority. ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) No, we will not use the two-thirds majority. If it is essential we will use, but here -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You did it twice already. Here, in this House, my Friend, the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe talked about the impeachment of the Chief Justice.

935 936

2013 23

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) I do not like to answer.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I do not want you to answer, Hon. Minister ( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) I will answer you if you make a responsible speech. I do not want to answer people who do not know anything.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Hon Minister for the commendation you gave me.

The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe was speaking about the impeachment. He gave some information to this House. Why did he speak today about the impeachment? The Hon. Speaker agreed that he would give even 10 days for the Debate. My party asked for five days, they were willing to settle for three days but you gave only two days. There were certain things that were missed. But, when he says here that you have passed it, you have got over it, you have a two-thirds majority to do it. At the same time, at least - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) We have 160 Members, and still we managed with two days. You have only 45 Members; so why could you not manage with two days?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) As far as your 160 is concerned, has any Hon. Member got the independence to say what he wants?

( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) Absolutely! . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No. How many of your Members, how many lawyers in your party told me personally that they were against the impeachment. They said they were against the impeachment but they had to vote because they are part of the Government. - [Interruption.] I know. There is nothing -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) What is your point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, my good Friend, he must know - he is a senior Member - the Standing Orders. He must know that he cannot, even through innuendo, cast aspersions on the conduct of the other Members. How does he know the minds of others? How can he read them? Therefore, it must be expunged.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Yogarajan, you continue your speech. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) There are no aspersions cast on anybody. We all know why it happens. They belong to your Government, you followed the Government Whip and you voted. Heart-to-heart, how many people voted against their conscience? If you gave a conscience vote on that issue -

( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) We gave. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, nobody did that. So, at least give us the opportunity to speak about it, do not interrupt. When my Friend, the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe was speaking, as many as eight Members from your side interrupted him with the so-called points of Order and took away eight minutes from his time.

If you are have democracy in this country, if you respect the views of the Opposition -[Interruption.] The Hon Minister says that he interrupts me because I am talking irresponsibly. Then, give us an opportunity to talk responsibly. Do not interrupt us. Do not play a negative role. Give us a chance to say what we have to say. If you do not agree -[Interruption.] You have speakers after us. The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe appreciated your Hon. Minister, saying he remains in this House every time and he makes it his responsibility to answer many of the queries we raise. That is very honourable. So, let him do it. Do not interrupt us. Give us the opportunity to speak. Let him answer us. That is the way to do this. [interruption] Hon. Sumathipala, do not interrupt me again, please.

937 938

Now, when you go and deal with people who are coming with their own proposals for the advertisement or the gazette that you have issued, then, you have to make a deal where you have to offer more than the other person. When there is a tender, when there is equal competition, you get the best offer; the best deal. But, you do not get the best deal through negotiations. So, this is why we say, make it more transparent, make it more open so that everybody feels that the fair thing, the right thing is being done.

You are now hoping to have two and a half million tourists in another three years time. You are gearing yourself for that purpose. Good! But, at the same time, see the quality of the tourists that came during the last year. Two hundred and seventy five thousand tourists came from India. Out of the one million tourists you count, 275,000 tourists came from India. Out of the 275,000 tourists, 225,000 are persons who came in the morning and went in the evening.

( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) Do you mean that Indians are not quality people? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I do not say that, I am an Indian origin person myself. I do not say that.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) So, what are you saying? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) What I am saying is, out of the 275,000 people, 225,000 are people who come with a bag in the morning and hand over that bag and go back with another bag. They are people who are just flying carrying stuff up and down, they are not tourists. But, including them, on the 30th of December, you have declared -

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena) We did not count transit passengers as tourists. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) They are not transit passengers. They come in - ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena) count , .

Yogarajan) So, you have already counted them as one million. Okay, very good. We are also happy. We also feel that tourism is the only hope for us -

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) Are you jealous? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan)

We are not jealous. If you build it up to one and a half million or two million in two years time, when we take over, it will be easier for us to go to as much as three million. So, do not worry. We are with hope.- [Interruption.] You do not remember, Hon. Minister, in 2001, the share market index had been in the region of 700. When we gave back the Government in 2004, we brought it up to 4,000 and it went up to 7,000 during

your period. That two-and-a-half years made a big difference. I am sure the Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala who was part of the process of creating the 2001 Government will accept that we changed the trend. Like that, if you had been able to rebuild the tourist industry after the war, then, - [Interruption.] No. Hon. Minister, there are some people who can flourish only in a Government. So, they remain in the Government.

I know somebody with whom I worked for a long time. I told him that representation in Parliament for my community is more important than being a Minister. He did not accept it. He preferred to be a Minister. So, what did he do? He sacrificed the Ministry of Estate Infrastructure. - [Interruption.] You were the Minister for that subject for a while. But, you also gave it up. - [Interruption.] So, Hon.Minister, this is the achievement of the people who are with you. This is not what we are expecting, Hon. Minister. We are expecting proper development. I have a lot to say but, there is very little time.

Your Government is running only on the remittances from people who are working in the Middle-East. We have just had a tragedy. We had Rizana Nafeek beheaded in Saudi Arabia. Can your Government ban the sending of women to Saudi Arabia? Most number of complaints from women come from there. Today, there was a meeting at the Ministry of Child Development and Women's Affairs, where there was an overwhelming proposal that sending of women to Saudi Arabia should be stopped. Even your Members of Parliament agreed. But if you do that, you cannot balance the- [Interruption.] No, Minister, everybody's personal right can be controlled to some extent. - [Interruption.] There is the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment and there is an Act for that. Under that Act, you can impose certain conditions. Every person's personal right can be regulated. You can regulate - [Interruption.] - No. The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment even today insists that there must be an acceptable foreign employment agreement. So, like that you can always impose certain regulations to stop it. But, you would not dare to do it because 400,000 out of the one and a half million workers are working in Saudi Arabia. This is a very unfortunate situation.

Your Government has increased government debt from US Dollars 4,800 billion in 2011 to US Dollars 5,900 billion in 2012. There is an increase of 22 per cent. -[Interruption.] No. This is the total outstanding. But in 1995, the total borrowing of the country was US Dollars 1,100 billion. Now, it has increased by six times in six years.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, Your time is over. Please wind up.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) So, you are living on borrowed money.

Thank you.

Sir, the Police Service has become an inseparable service in the public life of Sri Lanka. For anything and

everything at any given time - if we need something to be done, if your life is to be protected, to control traffic systems on the public roads, to check on all types of robberies that are taking place and at every such moment - the public need the services of the police. Not only that, we, as Members of Parliament, have been provided with PSOs by the MSD. We must also be thankful to them because they are also doing a job throughout day and night, since certain Ministers and others have to travel right round the country almost daily.

We must also place on record an appreciation of the service now rendered by the WPCs - Women Police Constables. That is the latest recruitment to the force. Now, they are manning almost every police station and they are doing their duties very well. In Madras, they have a woman DIG. I think we have one or two women police personnel in the rank of SPs in this country. In time to come, there will be women DIGs also in this country.

Then, Sir, I want to draw the attention of the House to the anonymous calls to the Ministers and MPs, particularly during the time of the Resolution against the Chief Justice and after that. Even the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa got an anonymous call and my life was also threatened by several calls before I signed and affirmed, as a Member of the Parliamentary Council, the name that was sent to us for assent by His Excellency the President. Police investigations are now being conducted in that regard. Sir, these calls emanate from public booths. They say that they cannot trace them. I was told by my cousin, Dr. Haris Z. Deen that in England there is a system to trace all such calls from public booths. I would recommend to the IGP that that system be studied and introduced in this country. Otherwise, this will become not only a nuisance to the public, but at times it is a real threat to our lives.

I must also, Sir, say a word of appreciation for the IGP, Mr. Ilangakoon. He is a great gentleman in uniform. He is one of the best IGPs that we have had in Sri Lanka. I must also mention DIGs of the calibre of Mr. Anura Senanayake. He is doing a wonderful job in an around the City and the suburbs. Then, we have a Senior Superintendent of Police, Prishantha Jayakody. He comes on the radio every morning in the "Dasa Desa" programme, which is well co-ordinated and conducted by Mr. Hudson Samarasinghe, Chairman of the SLBC. He gives every detail about the accidents, robberies, and thefts that take place around the country. They also take serious action against harassments to women and children. What the public should know is presented to them through Prishantha coming on that programme. These police higher-ups go to bed very late in the night after their long, arduous job and although they are able to get up early in the morning, they get up and carry on their service on behalf of our nation.

Then, there was an agitation at one time that there should be Tamil-speaking police officers particularly in the Tamil-speaking areas in the North and the East. That should also be implemented. Now, they are taking in Tamil officers. In Tamil-speaking areas - the entries should be taken in the Tamil language. That is also being implemented now. I think where there are certain drawbacks and shortcomings in this regard and that also should be looked into. Then, Sir, all in all, I stand to commend the Adjournment Motion proposed by my good Friend, the Hon. Shantha Bandara who is commending the steps taken by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa to increase the allowances paid to the Police Force by Rs. 4,500.

Then, Sir, I must say this in my concluding remarks. During the time of the Leader of the Opposition, when he was the Prime Minister, these things never happened. They never cared for the police officers. We are caring for the police officers. We are very thankful to them, especially to Mr. L.P.S.P. Sandungahawatta, the Senior Superintendent of Police, who is in charge of Parliament security and all the police officers who are guarding you and me at all entrances and exits of Parliament.

Thank you. ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva - Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management and Leader of the House of Parliament) , . , .
