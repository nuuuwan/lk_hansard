( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena - Minister of Water Supply and Drainage and Chief Government Whip) , .

. There must be due notice given about the Executive Committee Meeting of the IPU, CPA and the SAARC Parliamentarians' Association. Sir, what was fixed for yesterday did not take place and you were announcing about today's Meeting just now. With due respect to you, Sir, there must be time given for the Exco Members to come. We cannot make an announcement at 1.00 o' clock and expect the Members to come at 4.00 o' clock. That is not correct. So, I would request you to give time at least till tomorrow, please. I think the Chief Opposition Whip too would agree with me.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Then, Hon. Member, accordingly, that Meeting can be rescheduled for tomorrow at the same time.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Thank you, Sir.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we, in the House have assembled today to pay our tribute to the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis whose entry through local politics, through the Municipality in Negombo, itself created history, in that, he not only became the Deputy Mayor but subsequently was the youngest Mayor of Negombo. It was also quite remarkable and unique that he had this rare distinction of having his own father as a Member in the Council while he was the Mayor of the Negombo Municipality. Except for the defeat in 1970 in the General Election, as we all know, which reduced the

763 764

United National Party to a mere eight seats, in the National State Assembly then, he was able to ultimately regain the Katana Electorate in the by-election held in 1975. That by-election and a few others which followed the General Election of 1970 were virtual precursors for the landslide that UNP gained in 1977. In 1977, he was pitted against the young actor turned politician and the son-in-law of the Prime Minister of the incumbent Government, Mr. Vijaya Kumaranatunga. With a massive electoral swing, it was not difficult for him to win the Katana Electorate comfortably. But, to me, from my personal reminiscences in this House, what impressed me was his articulate self as the Chief Opposition Whip in this Parliament. When I was in the same seat that you occupy, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, from the year 1994 to the year 2000, I had the privilege of being the Deputy Chairman of Committees in this House and it was during that time that I became very close to the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis since he was then the Chief Opposition Whip. He also had this rare distinction not only of being the Cabinet Minister twice of two important portfolios; that of Textile Industries from 1978 up to 1988 and thereafter, as the Minister of Transport and Highways during the Premadasa Government. But, what was unique in the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis was that he had this rare distinction which very few in the House have. Perhaps, his compatriot, the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera, also could claim but he can claim one more than the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis because he ultimately ended up as a Speaker of this august Assembly. But, though he could not become the Speaker of this House, he was both the Leader of the House from 1993 to 1994 and then, also holding the other important position of being the Chief Government Whip. By holding these two positions, it is inevitable, as somebody with such a long track record in Parliament from the year 1960, that he was so conversant with the traditions, the Standing Orders and the etiquettes in this august Assembly. I was a witness to that since I had seen him manage the very rebellious Opposition benches as the Chief Opposition Whip during the Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga Government from 1994 to the year 2000.

Though there were some change in political allegiances towards the latter part of his political career, that did not take away from him the extraordinary tact and mature leadership he gave and showed all of us, young politicians, in the House when we entered politics for the first time. To me, as somebody who was quite young and been thrust to be one of the Presiding Members, I learned quiet a lot from the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis. I also know that in his personal life, he had to face certain unfortunate bereavements in his family. But, he never lost his composure. When he lost his son under tragic circumstances and when I condoled with him about the demise of his son, he said, "God has willed that it happens that way. We all have got to accept the Will of God". Though he was a believing Buddhist, though there is no

concept of God in Buddhism, he said something to that effect, which impressed me a lot. His composure, the equanimity he displayed during very difficult times, both within and outside the House, is an example for all of us to follow.

Sir, I am pleased to be able to participate in this Vote of Condolence and pay tribute of myself personally and that of my party, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, to the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis' bereaving family.

Thank you very much. [..2.24]

So, I think a politician like the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis is an asset to the country. His demise is a great loss. He contributed immensely towards the United National Party and also the country. He was a party stalwart. He was a man of principles and was able to give certain directions and leadership to the Gampaha District. So, on this occasion, particularly because of the fond memories I have of the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis because he stood with my father at the most critical time to salvage the United National Party, I would like to pay my condolences to his family.

As a result of leg-pulling tactics of the leaders who are now running the oldest party, the party that won Independence, the United National Party, sad to say, has fallen into the present abysmal depth. This would not have ever happened if the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis was alive because he was a brave man, and was ready to call the spade a spade because he possessed the strength of the Dhamma. He had the strength of his people. He was a meritorious man.

. . in charge . . . . He used to say, Azwer, you are the only person who is giving me dates, I am very happy. My very good Friend, the Hon. M.H.M Naina Marikar - a former Minister of Finance who represented the Puttalam District - when he travels to Colombo, drops in at my place and brings vegetables and the other products that are grown in the Puttalam District".

Sir, the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis was a very good friend of the Muslims. I must emphasize that. He represented the "Little Rome" in Sri Lanka, the Negombo Electorate. The people loved him, he served everybody alike. Al Hilal Maha Vidayalaya, Negombo was the beneficiary of his benevolence. He did a lot of things to build it up. I remember the late Mr. S.M.A. Jabbar, former Chairman of the Quazi Courts of Sri Lanka was able to develop that school because the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis helped him. Mr. Anis Sheriff, a former Deputy Mayor of Negombo, was also very close to him and I also recall with gratitude the services rendered to the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis during his political career by Mr. I.L.M. Thassim of Palangathure, Kochchikade and his son Mr. Nesmiyar Thassim, who was elected for the fifth time - he is the most senior member - to the Municipal Council.

The Hon. Wijayapala Mendis was 84 years old when he passed away. He was born on 16th December, 1928 and breathed his last on 1st September, 2012. He studied at Maris Stella College and Harischandra Vidyalaya, Negombo. He later took to planting and business In 1953, he became the owner of the Kelani Valley Transport Company. He had roots in the UNP since its inception and played a major role in the partys Youth League. He built up and gave strength to the Youth League of the United National Party. At 27 years, he became the youngest Mayor of Ceylon. He was a Buddhist, lived in "Little Rome", Negombo and was so loved by the people; they showered affection on him. During the elections held in March and July in 1960, he won the Katana Seat. Having won the same seat in 1965, he became the Deputy Minister of Public Works, Post and Telecommunications. Except for defeat at the by-election in 1970, he represented the seat throughout. He was the

Minister of Textile Industries in 1977 and in 1989 he became the Minister of Transport and Highways. He initiated to build up the main road up to Puttalam.

I proposed that in the then Government group that this road should start from Puttalam, which initially was started from his area. Later, he reversed the process because the World Bank gave money to construct the road only from Puttalam to Colombo and I should say in this House that today it is nicely carpeted due to efforts of the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa.

After the defeat of the UNP in 1994, he became the Chief Opposition Whip in Parliament and served in that capacity from 25th August, 1994 to 21st July, 1998. He joined the People's Alliance Government in 2000 after forming the UNP alternative group because a man of his calibre could not withstand all the vituperative attacks that were directed against him and therefore, he had to take that alternative.

After the 2000 General Election, he became a Minister without Portfolio. At the 2001 December election, he lost his seat but he remained actively engaged in politics and social service.

Sir, I am reminded by my Colleague, the Hon. Hunais Farook, that the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis helped the Kandakuliya Muslim Maha Vidyalaya in Kalpitiya to a great extent and all the other Muslim schools also. I remember that Mr. M.I.B. Hafi, a former Provincial Councillor and Uhad Mohamed, the Chairman of the Kalpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha who had the greatest regard for this man - Thenahandi Wijayapala Hector Mendis.

Sir, for record purposes, I would say that he won the Katana seat with 23,950 votes in 1977. Mr. Vijaya Kumaratunga also contested at that time and he polled 19,738 votes. Then, in 1970, the Hon. K.C. de Silva of SLFP won with 22,370 votes and the late Hon. Wijayapala Mendis of UNP polled 11,589 votes. That was the lowest number of votes he ever received in his electorate but later he was able to increase it. After the death of the Hon. K.C. de Silva, there was a by-election in which the late Hon. Wijayapala Mendis polled 20,747 votes against Mr. D.J. Fernando Pulle of SLFP who polled 19,697 votes. So, the record goes in this way.

Sir, in this Parliament, there had been very colourful personalities, great leaders and I would now record in this House that the Hon. Maithripala Senanayake served the longest period in Parliament; 45 years, 2 months and 15 days. Then, Sir, the Hon. Abdul Cader Shahul Hameed, the Former Foreign Minister who represented Akurana and Harispattuwa served for 38 years, 3 months and 20 days as a Member of Parliament. Then, Hon. Mohamed Ali Ahamed Abdul Majeed of Samanthurai - I attended one of his nephews, Kamal Musthapha's wedding yesterday and he is the son of a former Finance Minister. The late M.A. Majeed's son, Nasser Majeed was also with

791 792

us in the same table. They were recalling with vivid memory the days when the Hon. Abdul Majeed was a good pal of the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis.

The Hon. Wijayapala Mendis served this House for 35 years, 7 months and 18 days. The Hon. Alick Aluwihare who represented Matale served this House for 39 years, 10 months and 14 days.

These are the records of great men who have shaped the destiny of our Legislature and who have left their footprint intact in the soil of history which will never be erased from the highest legislature that we are privileged to sit in today.

Therefore, Sir, I would like to say that the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis lived a happy, contented life and also breathed his last happily. I know for one thing that he was light-hearted. '' . . , '' , deputy .

I must also place on record my deep appreciation of the services rendered by his beloved wife Nanda to him - she was a tower of strength to him.

On behalf of the Muslim community, I convey my condolences to Nanda Mendis and his children, Manori Mendis who is in England, Dilupa de Silva who is in Australia and Nadika Sirimalwattege. His son, Davindra Mendis was a Provincial Councillor. He pre-deceased Wijayapala Mendis. I know he suffered a lot. He felt very sad and sorry at the loss of Davindra Mendis who was there to take up the reins after him. That was a political stigma that he had to carry. It was almost a conspiracy that he lost his son.

In the true sense, as a Muslim, I wish him a better afterlife. May the turf lie softly on his grave. .

[4.25 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I thought it was my bounden duty to speak on the Vote of Condolence of one the great legends of the United National Party.

Though I had a personal involvement today I thought it was more important to come and mention the true facts which has really moved the political landscape of our country. It is only known to two or three people whose names I will reveal before too long.

The Hon. Wijayapala Mendis, as I knew him was a colossus and a legend of the United National Party. He

was instrumental in the formation of this great party. He was blessed with a versatile and supportive wife, three daughters and a son. I was more involved with the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis through my good friend, his son-in-law, Mr. Aswin De Silva. As a matter of fact, I did not know that Mrs. Mendis is in Australia. It was coincidental that I happened to speak to Aswin just a couple of hours ago. I told him that I am going to make this revelation and he said, Please do so.

The previous speakers who knew the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis better than me mentioned about his credible performances. So, I do not need to further add what he has done for our party, for Negombo, for the Gampaha District and for the country as a whole. He was referred to as one the most versatile and youngest mayors. He became a mayor at the age of 23 years. It is something which very few people can achieve. He was elected repetitively through the United National Party in February and in July 1960. In 1965, he was re-elected. In 1970, he had a brief respite from Parliament but with the advent of the by-election in 1975, he came back to Parliament. Then, he re-enforced himself thereafter in 1977, in 1989, in 1994 and in 2000.

In 1994, I happened to come to Parliament. One day, there was one particular Debate that took place in this House on AirLanka and I had to speak after the late Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle. After the Debate concluded, the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis called me and said, Young guy, well done! This is the way that you have got to do politics. Do not be afraid. Call a spade a spade. The more genuine you are in politics, the more the sincerity that people will see in the person before them. This was only one episode but there were many more that took place. Sir, it was in 2001 that we really saw the shining colours of the Hon. Wijayapala Mendis.

That is the reason why I came to this House, to mention this particular incident. In 2001, politics in this country took a very grave turn. The Hon. (Mrs.) Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga won the Presidential Election, held the General Elections and won the General Election in 2000 and from their onwards the country had a crisis situation. The economy was no worse than what it is at this particular moment, going down day by day. That was the time, major players in the then Peoples Alliance, the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane and so on with nine or ten other Members of Parliament crossed the Floor of the House, on 6th October, 2001. At that moment, with something still stirring in mind, there was still one Member who was unable to come over to make the threshold of 113 in this House. So, it was a deliberation that went on for a couple of days - nervous times. Then, one of the most vibrant young politicians that the UNP ever had, the Hon. Gamini Atukorale, turned to me and said, Ravi, you know Mr. Wijayapala Mendis and you know his son-in-law. Why do you not

793 794

[ ... ]

2013 21

speak to him? I, myself with courage backed by the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, after speaking to the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, happened to call Mr. Aswin. I said Mr. Aswin, there is a need for the Party to get assistance from you. I want a firm 'yes' and not 'no' ". He said, You are telling me an impossibility, but let me speak to my father-in-law and come back to you. The telephone rang at about 10.30 p.m. in the night and he said Ravi, my father-in-law said with happiness, he would listen to what you have got to say at 10.30 p.m. at Mrs. Kamini de Liveras house at Sea View Avenue. So, we - myself and the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne - very nervously went to meet this colossus, this legend and a person whom I would never forget for assisting us to topple the Peoples Alliance Government in 2001. When we explained to him as to why we were there he said, Son, you do not need to explain about my Party, the United National Party; this is the best time I am going to repay my debt towards the United National Party". He further said, If only one is what is lacking, here is my resignation. Go and give it to Parliament and say, here is the valuable vote. I said, No, Sir, I do not think that is right". I said that my leaders, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and the Hon. Gamini Atukorale would like to speak to him. He said, Why do I need to speak to them? It is our Party; it is your Party; we need to get it coming back to power and here is my vote. That is how it happened. When it was confirmed that the support would be given on the 8th of October, the Sixth Parliament was dissolved on the 10th of October, 2001.

So, I thought it is my bounden duty to come and speak of this most voluminous and most valuable political decision that was taken by him because only three or four persons knew about this. A very few spoke about this, because the only thing that he said was, Just keep only the people who matter informed about it. So, I thought it was nothing but fitting to say that today. I thank him for helping me as a young politician then, to help to make my Party come in to power.

All the other Hon. Members would speak much better than I could about him because I did not have the political experience of working with him. But, all I could say is, that Negombo and Katana, as it is known today, have flourished with the Free Trade Zone, which he nurtured as one of his children. He ensured that the textile industry moved from the GATT - the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs - and managed to pursue to get a higher allocation of quota from the United States of America. With my political guru, the Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali, he formed the Textile Quota Board and made tremendous success making the textile industry a force to reckon in Sri Lanka.

Thereafter, he handled the transportation sector with great ability as it was his family business that he knew so well. From there onwards, he made a mark that every Member of United National Party could be proud of.

Mr. Presiding Member, I thought that I would only reflect this opinion because it was something very special for us. Only a very few knew about this and it was my bounden duty to say so. I thank him for what he has done for the United National Party and for our country. I do not want to labour anymore. All I would say is, may his soul rest in peace!

I hope this message would be conveyed to all his family members, some of them are here and to his wife who is in Australia with the rest of the family. I would greatly appreciate if this message is communicated through you.

Thank you.
