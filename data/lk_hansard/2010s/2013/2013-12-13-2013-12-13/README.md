.. ( .. ) (The Hon. C.B. Rathnayake) , . , . . [10.35 a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr.Chairman, for the opportunity given to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of Transport. I am glad both Ministers are present in the Chamber and are actively engaged in this Committee Stage Discussion.

Talking of the allocation, yet another year, we see a huge disparity between the allocation made for the Ministry of Highways, Ports and Shipping, which is approximately Rs. 150 billion and the Ministry under discussion, the Ministry of Transport, which together with both recurrent and capital expenditure, amounts to only Rs. 50 billion. Now, this disparity shows in various ways.

We recognize that it is important to develop infrastructure; it is important to build roads; it is important to build highways. But, the benefit of that will be reaped by the general public only when the transport services function properly. Now, the disparity in this allocation that I just highlighted will only benefit car-owning few people in this country. Unless public transport is developed to keep up with the development of the highways and the roads, the ordinary public will not benefit by that massive infrastructure development. The Hon. Minister for Private Transport Services is here, but we cannot leave everything to the Ministry of Private Transport Services hoping that, in different areas, people will become entrepreneurs and start services. There are many areas in our country where the locals in those areas are just not rich enough or do not have the means to start transport services. You can allow private transport services, but that should not be at the expense of developing an efficient public transport service, and this disparity in the allocation shows very much how the public transport sector has suffered in the last several decades and continues to suffer.

For instance, there is the Gami Seriya transport service - being the transport system in the villages - and there is the Sisu Seriya - school children transport service. Now, how efficient is this? I will come to the village-level transport services in a moment, but with regard to the school transport service, the Minister was heard, just a moment ago, talking about electronic identification of children getting into a bus, entering schools and so on. But, even in the city, how many schools have proper school bus services? We still have a

2049 2050

[ .. ]

2013 13

plethora of vans and other means of transport and we need to get out of that. When we went to school, we went by school bus and that was an efficient service. I am glad that that is a policy today, but we need to see that is realized very soon.

Talking of the policy, where is the National Transport Policy? The National Transport Commission Act, that was passed many years ago, in the Preamble stated that it is to provide for a National Transport Policy.

That is a controversial piece of legislation, as you know, because that has been cited as an example of a Parliamentary Act that takes away powers that have been devolved. Under the Reserved List of the Constitution, the first matter that is stated is, National Policy on all Subjects and Functions. This is purported to be the national policy on transport. But, where is that policy? Where is the policy that has been developed by several experts? Is that in operation?

The reason why I am asking this is, I do not agree that there can be, under the guise of national policy, an inversion into subjects that have been allocated to the provinces. I talked about Gami Seriya. In the areas that were devastated by the war, the public transport is still something that is in dire straits.

In 2010, when the TNA visited many of these villages and we came back, we made a report in Parliament and we met the President in June 2010. There were two things that we asked: one was with regard to housing; the other was with regard to transport. We asked that each household be given at least one bicycle, so that until the transport services become efficient, there will be some transport means that are available to those families. But, that was not done. We are thankful to the Government of India, which has given more than 12,000 bicycles. The transport services in those areas are still pathetic and that needs to be developed. But, that needs to be developed by the provincial Ministry of Transport.

If you look at the Constitution, the subject is under item 8 of the Ninth Schedule under Provincial Council List. I quote:

Regulation of road passenger carriage services and the carriage of goods by motor vehicles within the Province and the provisions of inter-provincial road transport services.

Now that the two Provinces, the East and the North, are both functioning, the Provinces must be permitted to develop the transport services there. That is not being done. That is not allowed to be done. I want to draw your attention to the news item in the Daily News of yesterday. The Governor of the Northern Province states that the Northern Provincial Council is violating the Constitution because they are attempting to set up Transport and Housing Departments under the Province. Is this a responsible statement by the Governor?

The Chief Minister of the Northern Province is an expert in the law. He had been a judge of the Highest Court of this country. He retired 10 years ago. The Constitution very clearly lays out that road passenger carriage services and the carriage of goods by motor vehicles within the Province and even inter-provincial transport services are in the Provincial Council List. It is under item 8 of the Ninth Schedule.

Item 5 is on Provincial Housing and Construction. When the Constitution states that housing and construction is a Provincial Council List subject, when transport service is a Provincial Council subject, how dare the Governor say that creating departments for these two are violation of the Constitution? The Governor being a military man is an expert in some other areas. Under his command, there were several extrajudicial killings. He maybe an expert on that, but he must know to leave constitutional matters to constitutional experts, and not go round making pronouncements like this, making himself a fool. When the Constitution can be read by everybody and understood, when the provision is very clear that the matters that he has mentioned in yesterdays papers are both provincial matters, how come the Governor say that the Northern Provincial Council is violating the Constitution? This is the reason why we want the Governor removed. We must have a person, we must have a civilian who has some respect for the law, who will at least read and understand the Constitution. If you look at the Article 154B (4)(a) of the Constitution, this is one of the grounds in which a Provincial Council may pass a resolution for the removal of the Governor, that he has intentionally violated the provisions of the Constitution. Yesterdays pronouncement is a very clear indication of his intent to violate the Constitution. When the Northern Provincial Council is functioning well within the limits of the Constitution, the Governor goes and says they are violating the Constitution. That act is certainly an intentional violation of the Constitution and, I hope, the Northern Provincial Council will take suitable action to pass a motion for his removal.

Now, what about the other violations of the Constitution? The Governor says so much about transport and about housing. Section 31 of the Provincial Councils Act states, I quote:

The President shall appoint the Chief Secretary of each Province, with the concurrence of the Chief Minister of that Province.

Has the Chief Secretary been appointed with the concurrence of the Chief Minister of the Northern Province? No. After two months, still the letters of the Chief Minister to the President in this regard have gone unanswered. Who is violating the Constitution? Who is violating the law? Is it the Northern Provincial Council that is violating the Constitution and the law? Or others in the Executive and their agents to the Governor who are violating the Constitution and the law? Recently, a few days ago, the DIG, Mr. Pujitha Jayasundara was appointed for the Northern Province. I have nothing against that gentleman, but look at the Constitution. What does the Constitution say about the appointment of a

2051 2052

Deputy Inspector-General of Police? Article 6 of Appendix I of the Constitution states, I quote:

The I.G.P. shall appoint a D.I.G. for each Province with the concurrence of the Chief Minister of the Province.

The Chief Ministers concurrence was not obtained for the appointment of the Deputy Inspector-General, Pujitha Jayasundara to the Northern Province. Who is violating the Constitution? Are we violating the Constitution? You make appointments for the post of Chief Secretary. You do not change the appointment when there is a new Chief Minister. The law requires that the concurrence of the Chief Minister must be obtained. That is not done. You appointed a Deputy Inspector-General of Police now, just a few days ago. Your Constitution states that the concurrence of the Chief Minister must be obtained. You do not do that. But, you have the gall; you have the brass to accuse the Northern Provincial Council of violating the Constitution because they want to appoint a department of transport and a department of housing. And, as I read out to you, both transport and housing, are in the Provincial Council List. So, why can they not establish a department of transport and a department of housing? The question is, who is violating the Constitution? One must not make statements like these. We understand, as I said, the Governor is an expert in extrajudicial killings but he is not an expert in the Constitution. He must know where his expertise lies. If he does not know at least then he must read. He must read the Constitution and understand or get advice from people who can understand the Constitution.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Chairman) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Azwer.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Chairman, he is exhaustively discussing the provisions of the Constitution, the Amendments to the Constitution and about the Governors appointment. But now, we are discussing in Committee the Votes of the Ministry of Transport. - [Interruption.] . Therefore, I think it is better that he, as a lawyer, confines himself to the subject before the Committee. The Governor is a very good Governor. There is no problem about him. If the Hon. Member has got any personal ill-feeling towards him, he can settle it elsewhere.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, that is not a point of Order. ( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Sumanthiran, you go ahead with your speech. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I said that the Governor had made a statement with regard to the Department of Transport of the Province. Transport is a devolved subject. But, the Governor has made a pronouncement that establishing a Department of Transport in the Province is a violation of the Constitution. - [Interruption.] How dare he does that? I am not discussing anything else; I am discussing the Votes under the Ministry of Transport.

I am saying, not only with regard to the Department of Transport - transport is the subject matter of discussion today - but even with regard to the Department of Housing, the appointment of the Chief Secretary and with regard to the appointment of the DIG, in all of these matters, the Constitution is being violated willy-nilly by the Central Government and its agent, the Governor. Then, this Governor has the confidence to say that the Northern Provincial Council is the one that is violating the Constitution.

Look at Item 1 of the Provincial Council List - Police and Public order. Now, has the Constitution been implemented? Who is violating the Constitution by not establishing the Provincial Police Unit? When the subjects and functions were assigned to the different Ministers in the Province, the Governor had a problem with regard to the use of the word Police. He wanted that amended to Law and Order. But, the Constitution says, Police and Public order. The Governor does not know that. He wanted it changed to Law and Order. But, the word Police is there in the Constitution itself as the very first Item in the Provincial Council List.

So, I suggest, Sir, as we are discussing the Votes of the Ministry of Transport and this issue has come up with regard to the establishment of a Department of Transport in the Province, which is well within the Constitution and is a matter that is envisaged in the Constitution to be a subject matter under the Province. As I read out the provisions now, this Governor, violating those provisions and making pronouncements saying that, complying with the provisions of the Constitution is a violation of the Constitution, must now stop this, or in any case, he must be removed.

Thank you very much.
