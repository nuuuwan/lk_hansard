Philippine Syndrome . At the moment you are getting about US Dollars 5.8 billion as foreign remittances coming into this country and a sense of complacency is there. Your exports are reducing; your imports are increasing and the balance of payments is increasing. As a result, you are living on the money that people overseas are sending to cover up your balance of payments. The day the Middle-East decides to localize their jobs, what would happen to our people who are working there? When they localize their jobs, the remittances coming into this country would basically dry up. When that dries up, what has happened to the Philippines and what has happened to Vietnam would obviously set in Sri Lanka too. So, these are the areas that we have to be mindful of.

, . . We are not the only girl on the beach. You have Myanmar that is contesting and coming up very fast, developing with low-cost productions with a captive market there and with China and Thailand bordering her. There are enough resources. So, you are basically having a threat coming from Myanmar. Then, you have India on the move. You have China and India, the two giants, looking at the entire world economy together. Then, you have little Male. My good friend, Mr. Abdulla Yameen, I am happy to say, has been elected as the President of the Maldives and you will have a shining star coming up from there. The threat from the Maldives will take tourism away from here if you do

not open up and they will take away the financial market from here. I know his capacity and will tell you - [Interruption.] I am not paranoid. I am only giving an example, not like your President who wanted to back up the one who went off. So, on that basis, you have a threat coming from Myanmar, you have a threat coming from India and a threat coming from the 250,000 voters in the Maldives. So, if you do not align with them and awaken to the realistic threats that are there, little Sri Lanka would not be the Wonder of Asia, but an absolute "disaster" of Asia and that is what you are heading towards. CHOGM was a clear example.

Your foreign policy should be dictated by the domestic requirements. But, this foreign policy that is adopted by you all, maybe the Mahinda Chintana or any Chintanaya that is there, is not in line with the domestic requirements. We have to export and basically survive. If you do not export, we will perish. On that score, we have got to increase the trade opportunities that are there. So, more trade agreements to increase our market share is what is required. Our foreign policy should be dictated from that.

In your own document, you are basically saying that there is a deficit in your trade balance because your exports amount to US Dollars 9,700 million and your imports amount to US Dollars 19,800 million. The resultant difference is US Dollars 10,100 million. So, when you basically project this type of thing with external factors that are not so conducive, how can you get investors into this country? This is why you have got to rely on people like Packer.

You are basically discussing your fiscal policy. What you are going say is, "We are giving such and such to the people". , .

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You should have been here to listen to the Budget Speech.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Why should we have been here? What is going on here is reported verbatim and we do not need to be here to know what is going on.

Well and good! -[ ] NRFC 2 1/2 , 9.5, 10 . ? Is this not a fraud? You are basically allowing the NSB to give at 9.25 per cent and you are getting the NDB to give overseas debentures at 9.75 per cent. Then, you are paying Treasury Bills in rupee terms at 11.25 per cent, but in dollar terms you are paying at 9.75 per cent. Look at the risk exposure.

Our rupee is overvalued. India has devalued it from Rs. 52 to Rs. 63. India is a mighty country in this big region and if Sri Lankan Rupees is overvalued, we will lose our exports to India and to the competitive countries in the region. So, we have to be realistic. If a 20 per cent devaluation is going to take place over the next year, what is going to be the impact of the loss that is made on the exchange rate? The poor NSB savers will have to take that on or the NDB shareholders will have to take on.

So, the Government is basically delegating its responsibility to the private sector and getting the taxpayers to pay that, taking the external risk off. This is the type of hypocrisy and robbery that is taking place. Now, give us an answer to this? Making a short-term gain, you say, "We have got a balance of payment that is high". It is borrowed money. You say that you are taking long-term loans. Are there any 30-year loans taken in the last couple of years, except for the World Bank loans, ADB and JBIC loans? What are the loans that have been taken for more than 25 years? Your Chinese loans are for 6 to 7 years. Your commercial loans are for 5 years. Your bonds are for maximum 10 years. So, is this long term? It is medium term and short term. So, you are borrowing short term and investing long term. What is happening?

There is an overcapacity in the ports now. The JCT, the Chinese-built port which is the Hambantota Port, the Trincomalee Port, all of them have an overcapacity. Now, with the seventh generation vessels, major companies like Maersk, MSC, CMA CGM, which were basically coming nine times a week are now going to come three times a week owing to the size of the ships increasing from 6,000 to 18,000 containers. So, you are going to have less calling in. Then, you have the other G6 lines like Hapag-Lloyd, NYK, OOCL, APL, MOL and Hyundai which control another 18 per cent. Among these nine shipping lines, they control 55 per cent and there is going to be less calling in Sri Lanka.

So, increasing the shipping rate by imposing this charge to take on the domestic charges may be a disadvantage for you. So, just look at that area. From an exporter's point of view, I must say that the Government has taken a step in the right direction by giving them an advantage of US Dollars 140 a container, which has now been put on the shipping line, by getting the importer to pay for it rather than the exporter. When credit is due, we will certainly give that. But, look at it from an overall point of view.

. . .

You have immense competition coming from the Ports of Singapore, Malaysia, Salalah, Fujairah and now the Indian ports are also competing. They are manufacturing and exporting. Sri Lanka is now not designated as a hub port, but as a way-by port and that has brought about a huge loss for Sri Lanka. So, the Government must ensure that they get back the hub status that we had. Big shipping lines have basically nominated this as a way-by port and put Sri Lankas shipping industry to jeopardy.

This is the type of hypocrisy that is going on. You are permitting the countrys wealth to be exploited and allow them to have overseas accounts. Furthermore, they basically say, except where foul play is suspected. So, all the foul players can be out there - no problem. But, the genuine people will be questioned and always be probed.

The spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of China has said, This is an issue within the Commonwealth, but at the same time I believe that on the human rights issue, dialogue and communication should be enhanced among countries. He has further said, Due to differences in economic and social development of different countries, there could be differences on human rights protection. So, what is important is that the relevant country should make effort to protect and promote human rights, while other countries in the world should provide constructive assistance.
