compensation. Accordingly, by letter dated 24/04/2013, SLBFE has been informed that a sum of Rs. 400,000 was approved in favour of Walimunidevage Sheelawathie.

However, as there are discrepancies in the names given in birth certificate, marriage certificate and passport, the SLBFE is now in the process of clarifying

the legal heirs. Once those discrepancies are clarified the arrangements will be made to pay the compensation.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, this is a grave matter which I want to bring to your notice because the police is planning to question and take into custody some Members of the UNP, according to the information that I have. Let me first explain the background. The UNP is a party that is engaged in electoral politics. So, we take a very keen interest in election campaign management and we have taken part in workshops, both in Sri Lanka and abroad. Recently, making use of a facility, as parties on both sides have done, we asked the Friedrich-Naumann-Stiftung to arrange a workshop on election campaign management and we had the assistance of the Director of Campaign Management of the Free Democratic Party, Mr. Manfred Richter. I think the Friedrich-Naumann-Stiftung has helped a large number of Members on both sides of the House and all parties to run workshops, seminars and even to go abroad. This workshop was also a prelude for us to get ready for the Provincial Council elections. He gave us the benefit of his experiences in Germany as well as what he knew from other countries. Subsequent to that, there has been a campaign saying that there was a plot to overthrow the Government. Any party that is engaged in electoral politics can overthrow a government by the ballot not by the bullet. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Let the Hon. Leader of the Opposition speak. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) We certainly are engaged in overthrowing it by ballot. - [Interruption.] Yesterday, the Resident Representative of the Friedrich-Naumann-Stiftung, Sagarika Delgoda had been taken to the CID and questioned from 9.00 in the morning till 7.30 in the evening. Again, today she has been questioned on these issues. What was spent on them and a whole lot of questions had been asked. Now, I ask: "What is the relevancy of this?" We are certainly getting ready for elections. We have also said that we want to campaign, agitate and get a national election in 2014. I mean we are entitled for it. Under the Constitution, the electors have the free right of franchise. Political parties can operate. We are members of the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Charters first principle is on political parties. You want to host the CHOGM but you will not allow political activity to go on in this country.

Just three weeks back, under the guise of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, you took action to detain a political opponent. Now, this is also a means of trying to break up normal political activity. Why are you doing this? Now, - if the police has finished questioning Mrs. Delgoda - I hear they are going to question her again and then come and take in some of the Members; I have instructed my Members what to do. We are taking it up internationally. So, I am asking you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to convey this to the Hon. Speaker and ask the CID as to what they are doing. After all, I do not think they should be harassing Mrs. Delgoda anymore. Today, the police had asked whether they had given money to the LTTE. I mean, if they want to know who has given money to the LTTE, the best is to ask the Members of the Government. You do not even know how to give money because part of the money did not go to the LTTE; you do not know what happened to that. What happened to the rest of the money is known to Mr. KP who is there. But, this harassment of Mrs. Delgoda because she organized the workshop for the UNP - of course, she did not organize. She got down a speaker for a workshop organized by the UNP - and the harassment of our Members who may be questioned must be stopped immediately. Otherwise, we will have to resort to other action. Anyway we are taking this up internationally. This is going to be a big issue for a country that claims to host the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. Certainly, Hon. Deputy Speaker, not only can we overthrow a Government by the ballot but the system also occasionally accommodates

Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. JANAKA BANDARA took the Chair.

( ) (The Presiding Member) .

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) , () . .

The Gazette Notification No. 1804/17 dated 3rd April, 2013, which has been submitted for approval to Parliament today, is related to the appointment of Japan Export Vehicle Inspection Center Company and Used Car System Solutions Company Limited for the purpose of pre-shipment vehicle inspection bound to Sri Lanka from Japan based on the applications submitted by them. Before these appointments were made, there was only one company, namely, Japan Auto Appraisal Institute - JAAI - which had been appointed under Gazette Extraordinary No. 1454/30 of 20th July, 2006. With the appointment of these two new companies, the total number of companies authorized for this purpose of inspection and approval will be increased to three.

So, why have we made this change? Firstly, the pre-shipment inspection of vehicles bound to Sri Lanka from Japan is considered useful since it will help to ensure that quality used vehicles are exported to Sri Lanka from Japan. Now, this is the procedure which is pursued not only by us but all countries that are importing used vehicles from Japan. This system will enable us to identify the roadworthiness and usability of the vehicles as well as to ascertain whether the vehicles are damaged, thereby improving the overall standard of used vehicles coming into this country. Another aspect is, it will also help to identify whether some of these vehicles are stolen or not. So, these are some of the practical issues that we are trying to remedy.

Many countries around the world have also implemented the pre-shipment inspection systems to ensure that substandard vehicles are not imported to their own countries. The existence of three companies instead of a single company, as at present, to inspect used vehicles from Japan will end the monopoly of one company and increase competition and service delivery in the market, and would help reduce the cost to be incurred by importers regarding this in the future. I also want to

add that whenever we have meetings with the Chambers based in Japan, which are made up of companies that are exporting used vehicles to Sri Lanka, they have made a regular request from the Government that the number should be expanded, so that this work would be expedited and the vehicles could be dispatched to Sri Lanka and sometimes even the payments to be made, can be reduced.

Now, while this is an important step, some questions were raised particularly by our Parliamentary Group regarding the mode of selection - how have these two people or two companies been selected in addition to the one that was used to carry out these functions? The selection of these two companies were made after getting the required information from the respective institutions and consulting the relevant stakeholders including Sri Lanka Customs, Department of Trade and Investment Policy, Department of Motor Traffic and the Department of Import and Export Control.

Some of these requests were also made by our own chambers in Tokyo. The final selection has been made after obtaining recommendations from the Sri Lankan Ambassador in Japan for the applications made by these two companies. So, Mr. Presiding Member, I seek the approval of the House for that Gazette Notification.

Member, I am telling you categorically that we are not going to buy special vehicles for CHOGM. A decision was made that existing vehicles, vehicles that belong to Ministers and Ministries, will be taken over for this. So, you have to accept that assurance.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I am glad you are saying that but I am not convinced. As it happens, you will, in fact, do that. I will tell you why. Hon. Minister, I have a lot of respect for you, you know that. A persons word must be believable. The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris word, I am sorry, cannot be believed because he had said so many things in the past, which had gone completely the other way.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) It is the Government's position that I revealed . () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) The Government's position, according to the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, has been that they will give the Thirteenth Amendment plus. According to Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, the LLRC Report has been implemented and that there are so many things happening. Then, also according to the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, many things are happening in this country. But, as people who live in this country with our two feet on the ground, we know that it is not the case.

Anyway, I will give you the benefit of the doubt and will actually not talk about what I was going to talk, except mention one thing. That is, in Trinidad and Tobago, they had the CHOGM Summit in 2009. They were also, originally, going to bring some vehicles. Just like here, the Opposition protested and asked, "Why do you have to bring new vehicles when you can use the existing vehicles?" Instead, what the Government of Trinidad and Tobago did was - in fact, at the same time, there were two summits: the Summit of the Americas and the CHOGM - they bought 200 regular vehicles. Among

those 200 vehicles, they had 80 Prados, 60 Santa Fes and 60 Mazdas. You know, the average cost was only US Dollars 33,600 per car. Those were regular cars. So, what happened was, they bought the cars, used those for the Summit and thereafter sold those to various people who wanted to purchase them.

Maybe, you want to purchase some vehicles because they say, Look, Prince Charles is coming and he has to be driven around in luxury cars" and so on. I looked around. When you have a summit or some event of this nature, what do you do? You do not buy Rolls-Royce cars. You rent them. There are so many places in the world from where you can rent Roll-Royce cars. I will table*, Hon. Minister, the information of such a place called Ahlan.

This is one of the biggest Roll-Royce renting places in the world. So, if at all, you want to bring some Roll-Royce cars instead of purchasing those, I will give you all the details and table them. Now, the details are here with me.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Do you want to table the iPad? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) No, I will table the printout. Also, there are Bentleys, - [Interruption.]

Another factor of concern is the continuing non-recognition of the exports sector by the government. There is no recognition coming for the exports sector from the government, particularly in the form of an annual awards ceremony,

It further states, I quote:

Yet another drawback which is holding up the growth of the exports sector in general and the SME sector in particular is the absence of a national industrial policy. How could the State expect the exports sector to thrive in the absence of a national industrial policy?"

There had been a plot hatched quite recently by getting down some Germans - foreigners - to this country and conducting lectures as to how to topple this legally-elected Government. This is against our Constitution, I should say straightaway. This morning, the Leader of the Opposition himself acknowledged in the House the fact that there had been classes conducted by certain Germans who have come here through the Friedrich Naumann Foundation and other organizations, with the help of a local lady called Delgoda.

Now, we must find out where this lecture was held and how that was held. Sir, there was a foreign conspiracy and Germany was divided into two: West Germany and East Germany. There were more deaths and murders in that country at that time than the stones of the Berlin Wall. Now, both these nations are together as one nation.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . ... .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, it is a new phenomenon in the world of sports when cricket was introduced among the womenfolk. It took the world by surprise and, I believe, that this is one sport of ladies that could bring us glory after the brilliant performances of Susanthika Jayasinghe.

I am very happy that my Colleague, the Hon. Victor Anthony who represents the electorate where I served earlier, has brought this Adjournment Motion with pious intentions. It is lately that Mr. Ravindra Pushpakumara, one of our fast bowlers and now a coach went round the country and spotted talents. He has brought in three male cricketers who have been chosen from the Jaffna Peninsula and the training is being given to them in Colombo. We hope that it is the intention even of His Excellency the President himself that one day a Tamil boy from Jaffna should take the centre stage in the world of cricket and bring much more glory for us than what Muttiah Muralitharan has brought. Pushpakumara has visited several areas in the North and the East and surprisingly he has discovered a female cricket team in a Muslim school in Mannar. That is amazing because even the girls in Colombo schools and other areas do not play cricket.

Sir, I have here with me, the "Daily News" of 12th April, 2013 which carries a photograph of our winning womens cricket team that went and even defeated the world champions - England. A photograph had been taken at a function held in Colombo and they are seen very beautifully clad in their normal casuals in contrast to what they wear in the grounds, padded up and with gloves when they play. The Sri Lankan women cricketers did well in the ICC Womens World Cup in 2013 and they were honoured by Sri Lanka Cricket at a grand Felicitation Ceremony held at Taj Samudra Hotel recently.

Sir, I know, the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage, our energetic young Minister of Sports, is batting all round the wicket. He is trying to improve cricket, football, volleyball and the rest of the games. He is a dynamic figure in that respect. I think everybody looks up to him in order to develop the games that they are engaged in.

273 274

Sir, the same "Daily News" has further reported what Mr. Upali Dharmadasa, the former Chairman as well as the present Chairman has said at that Felicitation Ceremony, I quote:

. Sri Lanka Cricket Chairman Upali Dharmadasa said that the Sri Lankan women cricketers performed exceptionally well in the Womens World Cup held in Mumbai and they have brought honour and fame to their motherland. Securing fifth place in the womens cricket world cup 2013 is a significant achievement for Sri Lanka when compared with previous tournaments where they have failed to live up to expectations."

The Sri Lankan Womens National Team Skipper, Shashikala Siriwardena, said that it was a great pleasure to represent Sri Lanka at the Womens Cricket World Cup 2013. They have discussed how to achieve an individual goal by working as a team and worked hard to achieve success. Also, Sir, the Sri Lankan Cricket has supported them in enormous ways since 2006 and our thanks should go to Harsha de Silva for guiding them along with the Team Manager, my good friend, an old boy and Captain of Zahira College Moors' Sports Club - Mr. A.R.M. Aroos. He even managed the team at the recently-concluded successful tour of India.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, can you please wind up now? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Yes. One name that comes to our mind where we can never forget is Mrs. Gwen Herat. She is the one who took womens cricket to the doors of ICC. She wrote several valuable books on the many aspects of cricket and was able to do much for the development of the game, both males and females. Thank you.
