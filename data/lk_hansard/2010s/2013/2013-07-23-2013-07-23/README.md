619 620

2013 23

* : * : * Rest of the Answer tabled: i. The appointees should be native-born nationals of the country of appointment. Only if native-born nationals are not available, Sri Lankans who have acquired the nationality of the country of appointment or Sri Lankan passport holders who are long-resident in the country of appointment are considered.

ii. The appointees should be over the age of 40 and below 65 on the first appointment and are expected to relinquish their duties on reaching the age of 70. iii. Appointments are to be made for terms of 05 years at a time, which are renewable with the mutual consent of the Government of Sri Lanka and the appointee. iv.

General Terms :-

* The Government of Sri Lanka reserves the right to terminate the tenure of any Honorary Consuls whose performance or conduct is found to be unsatisfactory.

* The appointments of Honorary Consuls should generally be limited to countries where there is no resident Sri Lanka representative, unless there are exceptional circumstances warranting appointment in countries where there is resident representation.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, I take this opportunity to ask you a supplementary question as you tabled most of the Answer with our permission. Recently, an Hon. Member of Parliament from the United Kingdom had been referring to the death that took place in Tangalle and he said that our judicial process has come to a virtual grinding halt. That has certainly affected the good relations and the tourists who come to this country. As you know, there is a travel advisory. As you are from the Ministry of External Affairs, how would you try to intercede on behalf of this and take away the impression of the travel advisory that is negative to our country? How would you do so?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Speaker, that does not pertain to this Question. Therefore, it does not arise.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Is it irrelevant?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) The death that took place in Tangalle has nothing to do with the appointments of Honorary Consuls.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Surely, you are the Deputy Minister; you are not an incompetent Minister. You have got the -

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) There is no relevance between the two but if you ask that Question separately, I will tell you what we have done.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, I never thought that you would run away in such a manner. You know, the Honorary Consul whom you have appointed in the European Union has told our Ambassador in the European Union and Belgium, Ravinath Ariyasinghe, to say about the Labour

623 624

[ ]

2013 23

GSP. Now, the Honorary Consul whom you have appointed has said, Why do you not try to get this Labour GSP back again? You know this country is starving for cash; exports are dwindling; problems in balance of payments are there and US Dollars 1.6 billion is a loss to the country. So, why do you not look into this matter that your Honorary Consul, whom you have appointed to Belgium, has said about not getting this Labour GSP back again.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Speaker, this Question does not arise. - [Interruption.] What the Hon. Member has said now and what you have asked in this Question are two different matters. So, that does not arise, Hon. Speaker.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, my third Supplementary Question is this. The Hon. Deputy Minister is struggling to answer in a very bad environment because he has made more enemies than friends in this world. Your foreign affairs policy should - [Interruption.] Please answer my Question.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Speaker, he is referring to the Labour GSP. It has nothing to do with the appointment of Honorary Consuls.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Minister, I am trying to help your Government that is alienating your external affairs -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Please do not try to help the Government. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Do you not need any help? - [Interruption.] Thank you. Then, I will be provocative. You have made enemies with the USA, the European Union, Japan and India. What the hell is the Ministry of External Affairs doing?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) We have done a lot through the Ministry of External Affairs but that is not relevant to the Question you have asked, Hon. Member.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What is relevant is to make sure how vulnerable your Government is. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . : : THALAESSEMIA PATIENTS IN NORTHWESTERN PROVINCE : WELFARE PROGRAMMES 2999/'12 5.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, we are talking of substance. She mentioned that it will be revealed through the Hon. Deputy Minister but it was not revealed. The senior Minister started the Debate by mentioning that 51 per cent will be held back -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, no. They are misleading Parliament. The Hon. Speaker, who was there -

, , () . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. (MRS.) SRIYANI WIJEWICKRAMA took the Chair. [4.54 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Madam Presiding Member, thank you very much for this opportunity to participate in the Debate on the Sri Lanka Electricity (Amendment) Bill that is before us.

Before I start a discussion on the issues connected to electricity, better known as the "blackouts", I need to remind this House that today is yet another inauspicious black day being the 30th anniversary of the Black July, 1983. I need to remember this day. Thirty years is a long time but yet the events of July, 1983 were such that those are etched in our memories. For the average Sri Lankan Tamils who lived through that time, it has split our existence like BC and AD; it is as though there are two sections to the history. Even to this country, that would apply: the pre-1983 history and the post-1983 history.

The magnitude of the violence that was unleashed is such that it brought so much dishonour to this country, that this country would never be the same again. I was a student at that time in Colombo and I remember that day when I had to spend most of the day on the streets. When mobs came to attack, we moved up and down the road having left our house open. Our house was not attacked only because a venerable Buddhist monk - I wish to record that here - who lived down our road personally went up and stopped the mob from coming into our road. He took his life in his hands and did that. We ourselves took shelter in a Muslim house nearby which gave us shelter and subsequently Sinhalese friends kept us in their house for four days and then we were put in a ship and transported to Jaffna. That was the second such incident in my life, the first being in the year 1977 when there was violence unleashed against Tamils in Colombo.

Then too, I was transported by air from the Ratmalana Airport to Palaly by the Government of Sri Lanka. So, twice in my student days, I was taken away from the Capital City, once by air and once by ship, totally at the cost of the Government of Sri Lanka to the North. The Government being uanble to protect me in its own Capital, thought that I would be safe in my home and sent me to my homeland. When people use the word homeland, there is an issue that is raised: how can you say that it is your homeland? But for me, having grown up in the cosmopolitan city here, the Capital of this country, that was an acknowledgement by Governments at two different times that this was not my home; that my home was in the North and that it was in my homeland that I would be safe. I did not say it then but the Sri Lankan Government said that was my homeland and sent me there for my sefety.

Many others were sent to the East likewise. That is how the fact that the North and the East is our homeland came to be confirmed even by successive governments in Colombo. During that violence, the Government was complicit with those who perpetrated the violence. That is acknowledged now. In the year 2004, President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga very boldly acknowledged and apologized on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka. Twenty one years later some might say, Too little, too late. That is the history of this country. Yet for all, I do not regard it as "too little or too late". I think that was a magnanimous gesture by the President of this country, acknowledging and apologizing. That is important for us to go forward together, the acknowledgement.

When we talk about the 1983 violence, many immediately say, Remember how that started; remember that 13 soldiers were killed in Thinnaweli, Jaffna and that is why the violence started against the Tamils in Colombo and other places. Violence by the Tamil youth had already begun by the year 1983; that is true but violence, as never known before, commenced after 1983.

713 714

Many of my friends who were students in Colombo schools, whose houses were ransacked, whose houses were burnt, whose relatives were killed, who were chased away with only the clothes that they bore on their back, joined many of these Tamil youth movements who had resorted to violence by then. They saw no chance otherwise, no other way to protect themselves from the marauding forces, with the State looking on or actively encouraging those who practised violence. I said the violence from the Tamil youth, from the Tamil side had begun before 1983. But, how did it begin? We must remember that violence against the Tamil people of this country, unarmed Tamil civilians of this country, did not happen only in 1977 and 1983. Those were the two years that I remember and I was personally affected. But, well prior to that, since 1956, in 1956, in 1958 and in 1961 periodically, violence was unleashed against unarmed Tamil civilians. Then, at that time, there was no violence from the Tamil side, either from the youth or from anybody else.

In discourses like this, I know it is futile to start a conversation as to who started the violence. That is not done; that is not necessary. Ordinarily, that would be the case. But, I think in this case, it is important to note when the violence commenced, who commenced the violence and for how long that violence was practised. Since 1956, for almost two decades, there was no reaction. There was no revengeful violence from the Tamil side. That must be noted. By saying this, I am in no way condoning or finding excuses for the violence that was practised by the Tamil youth. No, I am not doing that. But, I want the country, I want this House to see things in perspective. When the Tamil people of this country, in peaceful ways, in democratic ways, asked for a share in the governance structure of this country, they were roundly beaten. Violence was unleashed against them. Even the protection that they had in the Constitution under Article 29 was taken away in 1972. They asked for federalism. The country was, to the contrary, specifically made a unitary State in 1972. In the Constituent Assembly between 1970 and 1972, the Tamil leaders made a plea for very reasonable measures. All of that, every one of those proposals, was defeated by a majority vote. Majoritarianism reigned not only in the voting but also in the physical attacks. Standardization for tertiary education was brought in and many Tamil youths suffered a great deal as a result in the 1970s. It is in this background, having no other way to protect their dignity, protect their person, protect their property, to ensure a reasonable future for themselves in this country that the Tamil youth took to arms. Again I say that is no excuse but that is a fact; pressed against the wall, cornered, they took to arms. But, as we all know, violence begets violence. Violence by the State gave rise to violence by militant Tamil youth whose violence did not stop with only attacking the State; as is often the case that also could not be contained and

they did many things that were not acceptable at all. Particularly, the attacks against the civilian Sinhalese, the villagers, attacks against Buddhist religious establishments and worst of all, the attacks against the Muslims and the ethnic cleansing that they indulged in were all totally unacceptable acts of violence.

What started as almost a necessary act of self-defence against violence that were unleashed on our people in turn became an instrument of oppression against others as well. Today, we stand here 30 years after that cycle with a possibility that we can, at least, now learn our lessons together, eschew violence and move forward recognizing that there are different peoples in this country who should all have a right to participate meaningfully in the governance of this country; that is all that is asked for. The fact that one is a permanent majority and the others are permanent minorities should not always affect their destiny. At least in the areas in which the minorities or the numerically-inferior peoples are a majority, they must have their say in day-to-day affairs. Now, that wisdom that that is the way in which the governance structure must be changed came early, I say "early", after the 1983 Black July carnage. It was soon after that event that our good neighbour India intervened. There were discussions and within four years, on the 29th of July 1987 the Indo-Lanka Accord was signed. Some structural changes were made even though substantially it did not change anything. A few structures called the "Provincial Councils" were created through which people in the different provinces could, at least to some extent, have a share in governance and it enabled the North and East to be one unit and the Tamil speaking people there to have some say, albeit in a very restricted sense, in the affairs of governance. That is how the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution was brought in, in late 1987. Although it did not amount to any meaningful devolution, at least, it restructured the governance in this country. In people's minds, there was a shift and then, there was a commitment in November 1987 by President J.R. Jayewardene that this system would be improved upon so that there would be meaningful devolution. Madam, Presiding Member, that was all in 1987, four years after Black July in 1983. But, 30 years later, as I said after a full cycle, perhaps after a full generation has passed, we do not seem to have learnt those bitter lessons from history. We hear calls now to go back to the dark ages, to go back to that pre-1983 era, an era in which democracy meant the rule of the majority; that the minorities could live in this country but only so long as they live on the terms dictated by the majority.

That is not democracy; those are not democratic sentiments. Those are the very antitheses of democracy. That is what is known as majoritarianism. That has been, perhaps, the worst curse that this country has had to endure. Today, as I stand here remembering the Black July 1983, I cannot but help go back in memory to these events; remind the country most humbly to remember that past; to remember those events of July 1983 which changed the course of history of this country; which changed the image of this country totally. This country

was never again to regain its past glory. The beginning of the slide was July 1983 and 30 years later, and four years after the end of a violent war, with all the things that are said in this House about this glorious magnificent victory, still, what is the image of our country? What have we built for ourselves? What have we built for the future generation of this country? If we have not learnt our lessons through these 30 years, I am afraid we are doomed. But, if we take stock, if we are not carried away by that sense of victory, if we look back to ask the question, "why did these things have to happen in our country?", then, perhaps, there is a light at the end of the tunnel and if we learn from our history, we can make a change.

It was this Government that appointed the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. Even at that time, the thought process was right. For reconciliation to take place, the President rightly understood that we have to learn lessons from the past.

It was persons he hand-picked. He did not ask for advice from the other communities. Surely, when you appoint a Reconciliation Commission, you consult the different communities that need reconciliation. No such thing was done. He appointed whomever he was pleased with. Nevertheless, even that Commission, having heard representations, having heard the cry of the people who were actually affected, having heard from a wide cross-section of the people of this country, came up with certain recommendations. These are not our recommendations; these are not even recommendations of persons we nominated to be on that Commission. These are entirely the recommendations of a Commission that was, in its entirety, appointed by His Excellency the President himself.

We have bones to pick with that Report of the LLRC with regard to accountability issues. But, that apart, they have made recommendations for the future. The Opposition, including the main Opposition Party and the TNA, have consistently asked that those recommendations be implemented. What are those recommendations with regard to power sharing, with regard to devolution, with regard to a permanent political solution for this country? What has that Commission, that you yourself appointed, recommended? No, you have not learnt those lessons from history yet. Even after being advised by your own Commission, the triumphalism still reigns and you are unable to see the wisdom of your own appointees.

Take a very simple thing like elections to the Northern Provincial Council. Why is there such reluctance, why is there such a fanfare about just holding an election that ought to have been held a long time ago in any case? Even after the end of the war, after a Presidential Election was conducted in January 2010, after a General Election was conducted in April 2010 in the whole of this country including the Northern Province, why was the Government unable - not unable, unwilling - to conduct

the Provincial Council Elections in the North? Eventually when forced - when His Excellency the President travelled to Japan he gave an undertaking - see the drama that was created. For 25 long years this system was all well and very good for you. Even the Parties that have enjoyed ministerial portfolios in provincial governments have started saying that this system is bad, it is wrong and must be done away with.

Unashamedly, blatantly, public pronouncements are being made saying TNA will win the Northern Provincial Council Election and that is why you do not want to share power. How do you like that? Where else in the world will you find an argument such as that? We have no shame. Even after the countrys image has nosedived to this extent, we are determined to drag it further by sentiments such as that. We do not even know that it is wrong to say that. The whole structure was created in order to share power between the different communities and you are now saying. "Now, we cannot have it; now we must scrap it because a community other than the majority community is going to have access to that power". Surely, that is the whole reason for creating this structure.

When the Government reluctantly announced the elections, we said that there was a plot that had been hatched to scuttle this election, not to hold this election and to use the judiciary as a last resort to stop the election. Now, that has also started. Last week, an application has been filed in the Court of Appeal. I do not want to say anything further on that but an application is now pending in the Court of Appeal seeking to stay the elections to the Northern Provincial Council only, not to the other two provinces.

You have your own judiciary now having illegally removed the de jure Chief Justice from her office; by violence you have kept her away and put in place the Adviser to the Cabinet. With that judiciary, what is it that you cannot do? For that, you will tell the world, What can we do? Our independent judiciary has thought it fit that election must not be held. But, the whole world knows how independent your judiciary is. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Madam Presiding Member, with regard to the Election, I was saying that the Government is unable to win the hearts and minds of the people. The military is participating in this Election in a big way: interviewing candidates, selecting candidates and threatening potential candidates of the opposition political parties. We have raised all these matters; we have documented them. We have given instances and we have complained to the Commissioner of Elections. Unfortunately, the office of the Commissioner of Elections is also not independent now. Because of your Eighteenth Amendment by which you abolished it, the independence of all the Commissions that were previously there is no more; now he is only a Commissioner. At least earlier when he was the Commissioner, he could exercise the powers of that independent Election Commission. Now, he is an appointee of the Executive and he carries out the wishes of the Executive.

We are not saying, do not give jobs. Give them as much as you want. We are only noting it that you are deliberately doing it in the run up to the election. But, still even those who get those jobs will not vote for you. You have tried it before.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) How do you know?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We know it because in 2011, you gave cash, you gave sarees; you gave vetties. Thirteen Ministers went and stayed in Jaffna and campaigned; the President himself campaigned for three days. - [Interruption.] And, we swept the polls in 2011. If the Hon. Member wants me to record all this, I will say it. But, that does not mean that what you are doing is right. You are interfering in the democratic process.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Not at all. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You are giving lands. Crown Grants have been given in Welioya. They are not even State lands. Those are lands which were held by private deeds by Tamil people who were driven out of that place in 1982. Their lands have been appropriated by the State and recently, the Head of the Executive had gone there and dished out Crown Grants.

Now, this is the manner in which this Government is behaving. They are issuing -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Madam, I rise to point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He being a lawyer of the Supreme Court does not know the Standing Orders and what is before the House. The Debate is on the Electricity (Amendment) Bill. He is talking about lands; he is talking about the amudes and other things. Therefore, he must be taught, as a lawyer, how to abide by the Standing Orders of this House. He still has not learnt that. He has only learnt to put guineas inside his pocket, diasporas' guineas. That is all.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka that is referred to in this Amendment Bill is now known as the "Presidents

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

Utilities Commission" because this Commission made a tariff revision. It called for public representations over 100 or 200 peoples representations and in April this year, made a recommendation against all public opinions, against all representations. But, on the 1st of May since His Excellency the President went back on that and gave what is called a promise, a "May Day promise", the Public Utilities Commission or rather the "Presidents

Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka" has now changed its tune. After having not listened to the representations from experts, from the members of the public - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Today, we are discussing the Sri Lanka Electricity (Amendment) Bill.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am discussing the conduct of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka, not the conduct of the President.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

I am saying the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka is not doing its job listening to the public, but it is listening to the President.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

So, I am not discussing the conduct of the President;

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

I am discussing the conduct of that Commission in wrongly following the dictates of the President. [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

It should not be doing that. [Interruption.] - That is why it is now called the "Presidents

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka".

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He being a lawyer must know that he cannot make an innuendo on the conduct of the President. That must be expunged.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Now, what has happened as a result is that the Public Utilities Commission has also become like that Select Committee -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) , . [Interruption. ] You are a lawyer.

725 726

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I was only discussing the conduct of the PUCSL, not His Excellency the President.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

Hon. Azwer, you sit down. You cannot understand this. So, you sit down.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You cannot take us for a ride. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I was saying that even what is called the Parliamentary Select Committee, the PSC, does not stand for Parliamentary Select Committee, it stands for "Presidents

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

Select Committee." Now, Madam, there is a serious lack of confidence in these institutions of the Executive, of the Commissioner of Elections, of the PUCSL, of the Ceylon Electricity Board, of -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Madam, I rise to a point of Order. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) What is your point of Order? All these tariff revisions that we are discussing today have brought the confidence of the public -

( ) (The Presiding Member) ... . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Madam, the PSC was appointed or the names to the PSC were duly announced by the Hon. Speaker of this House. So, it is a Parliamentary Select Committee, not a Presidential Committee. He does not know the difference being a lawyer. What type of lawyer is he if he does not know the difference between a Parliamentary Select Committee and a Presidential Committee? This is the Parliamentary Select Committee appointed by the Hon. Speaker. He is almost bringing an indictment on the Hon.

Speaker also. That must be expunged. Ask him to withdraw that. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) .

All that I am saying is, the Parliamentary Select Committee that was appointed is known as the "Presidents

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

Select Committee". That is all I am saying. It cannot denigrate that; it can only lift its image. [Interruption.]

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena - Minister of Water Supply and Drainage and Chief Government Whip) Do not get his advice.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Chief Government Whip - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Chief Government Whip, without sitting on the front row, is sitting next to the Hon. Azwer and winding him up. That is the cause for all this interruption. If the Hon. Chief Government Whip sat in the front row, none of these disturbances would occur. It is only because he is sitting next to the Hon. Azwer and giving - [Interruption.] Ah! There is another honourable - [Interruption.] No, no. He is very quiet. The Hon. Chief Government Whip must take his due place in the front row without sitting with troublemakers at the back. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . ( ) (The Presiding Member) . .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay. Madam Presiding Member, I was saying that the tariff revision on electricity went through such a process that the confidence of the public in how this processes are done have suffered a great setback and even the promise made on the 1st of May, has been greatly misunderstood by the Ceylon Electricity Board. They have not adhered to the promise that was given to the people. In any case, whatever concession that is said to be given for those who consume less than 60 units or less is immaterial because if there is a refrigerator in a house, it will definitely exceed 61 units. If you exceed 61 units, that relief is not available. According to a survey done in 2011, 56 per cent of the households in Sri Lanka have refrigerators.

So, Madam Presiding Member, the whole manner in which the electricity tariff revision was approached can be compared to what I spoke of for most part of my speech - the Governments attempted reconciliation. All the wrong directions in which they have gone is emblematic of how they have handled the electricity tariff revision. That is why when the Sri Lanka Electricity (Amendment) Bill is being considered today, the 23rd of July, 2013, 30 years after the Black July - 1983, I thought it is appropriate to draw a parallel between the two and place that before the House.

Thank you very much.

[6.05 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Madam Presiding Member, I am glad to speak after the Hon. Minister, who said " ". We know that you have given electricity to all but today all cannot afford to use electricity. This is the sad state that you have put this country into. The electricity to the plantation workers started coming in after 1996 when the former President created the Ministry of Livestock Development and Estate Infrastructure and provided funds for providing electricity to the plantations. Also, the Ministry of Irrigation and Power then had rural electrification projects through which plantations were also served. There was the Ministry of Livestock Development and Estate Infrastructure to provide for the needs of the people in the plantations. Today, we have got rid of that Ministry and there is no project under the Ministry of Power and Energy to provide electricity to estates. You still talk about " " - "Electricity for All but extension of electricity supply to the plantations has come to a standstill and provision of electricity to the people in plantations has stopped.

In 1996, the electricity penetration to the plantation people was as low as 20 per cent but by the year 2005, it had increased to 72 per cent. It was your Government, I acknowledge that. During that period, vast expanses of plantation areas were provided electricity but today, you

seem to be neglecting this group of people by keeping them out of this electricity boom that you are trying to create. Why is this discrimination? Is it because six of the Parliamentarians from the plantation areas are with you and they do not ask you to provide better services to the people in the plantations or is it because you feel that these people do not need or deserve any development? You are all aware that the plantation people have contributed to the economy of this country for over six generations, for 180 years and still they live in line rooms.

The Ministry of Livestock Development and Estate Infrastructure was created for providing them a better lifestyle, a lifestyle where they were brought out of the line rooms and provided with proper housing. Between 1995 and 2005, 23,000 houses have been built in 10 years at the rate of 2,300 houses per year. But, during the period of the current President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, under the Mahinda Chintana you have built only 4,200 for seven years. Why is this Government so discriminatory towards these people? Those six Members of Parliament from the upcountry are with you. Is it because they neglect their people; they are interested only in the perks that they get and not speaking to you about the needs of their people? I understand that the only Cabinet Minister who is representing the plantation sector rarely comes to Cabinet; he had not been sighted in the Cabinet room for the last three months and so, maybe his neglect is the cause for what is happening to these people.

It is unfortunate that the peoples representatives who are in your Government, whom people believed joined this Government to get them their needs and their services, have neglected the people. However, all the Parliamentarians from the plantation areas who are with the Government, go out into the public, to the media and say that they are hanging on to this Government to provide services to their people. But today, we do not see any of the services reaching our people. Is it the policy of your Government or your President or is it the principle of Mahinda Chintana to discriminate against the people who have contributed so much to the economy of this country?

As I said earlier, 72 per cent of our people do have access to electricity but are they able to enjoy the benefits of electricity? The cost of electricity for those who consume over 61 units is so high that our people cannot afford it. Anyone who consumes 61 units has to pay over Rs. 1,200.

The total income of a plantation worker is in the region of Rs.12,000. To spend 10 per cent of their income for electricity is so difficult. They live in very difficult circumstances because of the cold weather in the plantation areas. They used a small immersion heater to heat the water for bathing or for their daily ablutions. But

735 736

[ ]

2013 23

today, because electricity charges have gone up, they cannot afford to use electric heaters and they have to give up using hot water. They have to go in search of firewood which is not available. The boilers in the tea factories are today converted from oil to firewood because of the cost. So, the management does not allow the worker to pick firewood within the estate. Therefore, they do not have firewood. Electricity is too expensive and they find it so difficult to use hot water, which is so essential because of the cold weather. But, what are you doing? Are you giving them any special treatment? Are you giving them any subsidies? You are only increasing rates. So, although they have an electricity supply, they are unable to utilize electricity.

Our Member, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva once said that they are poor in the use of power because they cannot afford it. In all other countries, they measure economic development and wellbeing of people based on the power they use. Sri Lanka being the most expensive country for use of power, people have had to give up the use of power as time went on. People use more power when there is development. But, in our country, though you say there is development, the people have to reduce their consumption of power because they cannot afford to use electric power. It is a shame that you do not bother to look at the needs of the plantation people from whose area most of the power in this country is generated. They have a right to use power. For several years, power lines had been running over their heads but they did not have power in their homes. But today, though they have power in their homes, they cannot afford to use that power.

You have also put a stop to extension of any more power lines within the plantations and these people are now in a very sad state where they cannot have access to power anymore because you do not have any special schemes to provide power as the Ministry of Nation Building and Estate Infrastructure has not been voted any funds as there is no such Ministry.

Your Ministry has no special projects for the plantation people. Then, you have a scheme; one of your Members who spoke a few minutes ago talked about the provision of electricity and the payments for service connection to be provided through the Sumurdhi scheme or a Samurdhi Bank. They give a loan and that money will have to be paid back through the electricity bill over a period of time. It is so difficult for the plantation people to access this because they are not Samurdhi recipients. You have shut them out from receiving Samurdhi benefits. At the same time, they are poor; they are unable to afford; they have to be certified as low-income families for accessing the Samurdhi loan. But, the Ceylon Electricity Board offices are generally shunning this responsibility.

I had an issue in the Ragala region where seven poor families wanted to get electricity through the Samurdhi loan scheme. But, the CEB office initially refused. Then, I had to speak to the DGM and get him to speak to the regional office or the area office to give them the forms in the first place. When they went up, the authorities said, You are not Samurdhi recipients. Then, I had to speak again to the then Secretary and get the Electricity Board to instruct the Samurdhi Bank to give them a loan form.

After they got the loan form, again hurdles were put in their way. So, why is this discrimination against the people in the plantation sector?

Last week, I went to Deltota where some poor families live. They have saved money; they have wired their homes but they are unable to get electricity connection on the concessionary scheme that is available to the adjoining village but not available to their estate. When I spoke to the Area Engineer and the Commercial Manager in that area office, they were not aware of this scheme. Why has it not been extended to the plantation people? Why this discrimination? I call upon the Hon. Minister to request the CEB to give proper instructions so that even the plantation people could access the Samurdhi loan scheme to get their electricity connection.

We speak so much about power and providing the people with power to use in other activities. The people in the plantation sector are poor because the salary they are paid for their employment in plantations is very low. The World Bank has done a study and said that only those who are involved in some sort of self-employment in addition to working in the plantations are above the poverty line. But to do that, they need electric power, so that they can engage in some sort of small industry or domestic manufacturing exercise like making some clothing in their homes. But, for all this, they need power, which is not available to them.

The education of the children in the plantation sector, who have no access to electricity, is also being affected. They, being a group of people who need some sort of affirmative action, are left without any assistance. The assistance could have come if there was a Ministry of Estate Infrastructure which the President thought was not necessary or thought that these people do not deserve and abolished that Ministry. The progressive policies of your own previous government under the then President, (Mrs.) Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga have been reversed by the present President. However, the Representatives of our people still hang on to your Government, which is a shame.

Thank you.
