( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It has to carry the legacy of the institution that fell by. So, as a result, the true aspects of the auditors who certify is carried forward with the liability.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is right. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is why it is like a cosmetic dressing when you say that the reserves are X amount and the return on net assets is another one.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, I have to go by what the auditors have certified. If you want, I can make available a copy of that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But, this answer is not given by the auditors; it is done by the Ministry of Finance and Planning.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, the answer is based on the Auditor's Report. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My next question, Hon. Minister, is with regard to high provision of bad debts. The auditors have qualified this by saying that 88 per cent of it is non-recoverable. This is a bank that was started for development purposes. But, now it has ended up, for instance, by giving loans

worth Rs. 50 million for a shoe-making factory which is not a development-oriented institution. - [Interruption.]

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, I agree with you. This bank was set up by me as the Minister of Finance and Planning. As you said, we consolidated that and our objective at that time was to build a bank for small and medium scale enterprises. . . , . , - - . . .

, ACTION RELATING TO LAND IN NORTH AND EAST AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RESOLUTION OF HRC [1.50 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I move:

"Whereas two statements were made on the Floor of the House on 09th April, 2013, by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and by the Hon. Minister of External Affairs, pertaining to the Resolution No. A/HRC/22/L.1 on 'Promoting Reconciliation and Accountability in Sri Lanka' adopted by the Human Rights Council.

And whereas the Hon. Minister of External Affairs in the course of his Statement made specific reference to certain matters which need to be further clarified.

And whereas such clarity is necessary in the interests of the country and its people, and to ensure that the people know the truth. And whereas, the constructive recommendations contained in the Report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission and embodied in the said resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council, included the need to credibly investigate widespread allegations of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances, demilitarize the North of Sri Lanka, implement impartial land dispute resolution mechanisms, re-evaluate detention policies, strengthen formally independent civil institutions, reach a political settlement on the devolution of power to the provinces, promote and protect the right of freedom of expression for all, and enact rule of law reforms. And whereas the said resolution also expressed concerns regarding the threats to judicial independence and the rule of law, and discrimination on the basis of religion or belief.

And whereas no credible efforts are being made to adequately address serious allegations of violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law referred to in the said resolution. And whereas the actions of the Government are resulting in further deterioration generally, particularly relating to land issues in all districts of the North and East and desecration of places of religious and cultural importance.

39 40

2013 21

And whereas neither Reconciliation nor Accountability can be promoted by the continuance of the present actions of the Government, and whereas the said actions of the Government are only promoting disharmony and ill-will amongst peoples and impunity amongst those engaged in such actions.

This Motion therefore urges the Government in the interests of the country and all its peoples (1) To take immediate action to reverse its current actions relating to land in the districts of the North and East. (2) To take meaningful and effective steps to genuinely implement the said resolution of the Human Rights Council."

Mr. Deputy Speaker, having read my Motion, may I state that the country is at a very critical and crucial stage in its post-conflict era. The question before the country is whether in the post-LTTE era, the country is to get back to the practices and processes that were the root causes for the conflict or whether the country is to chart a new course.

If the country was to chart a new course, in order to achieve genuine reconciliation based on accountability and justice, we have much to learn from the various processes that have taken place during the period of the conflict and we should all approach the issue with a sense of inclusiveness and magnanimity. We have always endeavoured to move forward, not backwards. It is in that spirit that this Debate takes place. It is not intended to inflict any harm on Sri Lanka or the Sri Lankan people. It is to enable all - its peoples - to endeavour to live together in a peaceful and prosperous Sri Lanka.

There were two statements made on 9th April, 2013 by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and the Hon. Minister of External Affairs respectively. It is with the statement of the Hon.Minister of External Affairs that we are primarily concerned. Sri Lanka is a member of the United Nations and the UN Human Rights Council is an institution of the United Nations. Sri Lanka has also served on the Human Rights Council. We are a part of that institutional arrangement. We have not disassociated ourselves from that arrangement. There may be some resolution adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Council which Sri Lanka may not like or agree with.

But, that does not mean that you cease to be a part of that arrangement or that you can deviate from commitments that you have made to the UN system. Some efforts have also been made to make out that security or financial considerations more than the merits of the Resolution are the reasons for the Resolution being adopted. This, in my respectful submission, does not seem quite correct.

From the data available, US foreign aid extended to the 25 Member States that voted for the Resolution totalled less than US Dollar 1 billion for 2012 while US foreign aid extended to the 13 Member States voting against the Resolution, exceeded US Dollars 2 billion for the same year, while US foreign aid extended to the 8 Member States that abstained from the Resolution exceeded US Dollars 1.7 billion for that year.

Yet another interesting feature is that the countries which have a stronger trading relationship with Sri Lanka were those that were most supportive of the Resolution. Within the voting group, those who voted for the Resolution accounted for over 80 per cent of Sri Lankas exports, while the countries that voted against the Resolution or abstained from voting accounted for only one-fifth or 20 per cent of the exports. If trade is a sign of a healthy relationship between countries, it is the countries that have the strongest such relationship with Sri Lanka, that are saying that Sri Lanka should improve its governance. India has not been included in this Equation because by virtue of its size, its economic strength and its closeness to Sri Lanka, it stands quite differently.

In regard to security considerations, many countries that have voted against the Resolution are dependant heavily on the US for security purposes; Kuwait, Maldives, Qatar, UAE and Saudi Arabia being some of them. Some of the other reasons attributed for distancing Sri Lanka from the Resolution are :

1. There is to be an oral update by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in September, 2013

2. There is to be a comprehensive report by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights followed by a discussion in March, 2014.

These, Mr. Deputy Speaker, are inevitable steps in a process that has commenced and are not unusual. If what was required to be done was done in time, this Resolution would, perhaps, never have been passed or would never have come up.

The only way to bring the Resolution and this process to a closure is at least to do now what needs to be done and more than that stop doing things that should not be done.

Yet another reason mentioned is that the Resolution seeks to incorporate the Report of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights which calls for an international investigation. The Hon. Minister states that the High Commissioner for Human Rights called for this international investigation one week after the hostilities ended in May 2009 and wants to know on what evidence she called for an international investigation.

I wish to quote what the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said on 13th March, 2009, two months before the war ended, while the war was still in progress. She said, I quote:

"Certain actions being undertaken by the Sri Lankan military and by the LTTE may constitute violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. We need to know more about what is going on, but we know enough to be sure that the situation is absolutely desperate. The world today is ever sensitive about such acts that could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity."

41 42

She knew what she was talking about because she was following what was going on during the course of the war. So, she talked about what happened during the war, not merely one week after the war. She talked about it when the war was going on.

The High Commissioner for Human Rights had been even more specific recently when she answered a direct question on this issue. That is quite recently and I would like to quote that question and answer.

This is what the question was and I quote:

You keep calling for an international war crimes investigation, particularly, into what happened during the final stages of the war. Why is this still so important?

and the answer that she gave was this and I quote:

Because tens of thousands of civilians were reportedly killed. Because there are very credible allegations and some strong pictorial evidence and witness accounts indicating that war crimes and other serious international crimes, including summary executions, use of child soldiers and the use of civilians as human shields took place on a large scale.

These are crimes that are viewed with the utmost seriousness under international human rights and humanitarian law, and there is plenty of evidence to suggest both sides committed them. Unfortunately, none of the steps taken domestically in Sri Lanka, to investigate any of this, inspire confidence. There is a long history of national inquiries in Sri Lanka that have led nowhere, but to impunity. This makes such an international investigation essential. Crimes like these cannot simply be ignored or pushed aside. If there has been exaggeration or distortions, or unjust allegations, then such an inquiry should also expose those. There has to be justice, if there is to be lasting peace.

That was the statement Sir, she made more recently on 24th of February, 2013.

It must be said in fairness to the High Commissioner that she seems to have at all times, before the war ended, when the war ended and after the war ended, known quite clearly what she is saying.

Another reason mentioned is that the Resolution seeks to incorporate the Report of the Panel of Experts appointed by the Secretary-General of the UN which the Hon. Minister likes to call the Darusman Report. Two grounds are alleged for this position that the Hon. Minister outlined for not being able to even look at that Report. One is that the persons that the Panel spoke to asked for an assurance that their identity would not be disclosed for 20 years. Given the nature of the testimony these persons were giving and the persons against whom they were testifying - I cannot see what was wrong in that but what is really the correct position This is referred to Sir, on page six of the Report of the Secretary-Generals Panel of Experts on Accountability under the caption Confidentiality of the Panels records. I would like to quote what it states:

E Confidentiality of Panels records.

'23. In some instances, the Panel received written and oral material on the condition of an assurance of absolute confidentiality in the subsequent use of the information. The Office of Legal Affairs confirmed through formal legal advice that the provisions set out in the Secretary-Generals Bulletin on 'Information sensitivity, classification and handling' could be applied to its records. This Bulletin provides for classification of a document as 'strictly confidential' with correspondingly strict limits on any access for a period of 20 years,..

This was not something sinister or something unusual. It was the practice being adopted by the Secretary-General in terms of a bulletin which covered such issues that there would be confidentiality for a period of 20 years.

What is your own position in regard to confidentiality? There was a Bill called Assistance and Protection to Victims of Crime and Witnesses Bill, Bill No. 1306 which was tabled in Parliament on the 6th of June 2008. The judgment of the Supreme Court in regard to that Bill was tabled in Parliament on the 5th of June. The Second Reading commenced on the 17th of June. It continued on the 19th of June. I have with me here a copy of the Bill and copies of the relevant Hansards. What happened after the 19th of June? You abandoned the Bill. The Bill was not proceeded with. Why did you abandon the Bill? The Bill was brought to this House to enact legislation to ensure the safety of victims and witnesses, to ensure the protection of victims and witnesses. The Bill was brought to this House under pressure from the International Independent Eminent Group of Persons who had been invited to this country and appointed by the Government to overlook the work of the Commission that was inquiring into very serious human rights violations like the massacre of the five students in Trincomalee and 17 aid workers in Mutur. Of course, they eventually withdrew from the country. Having endeavoured to make their best contribution, they stated in a public interview that they gave before they left the country that there was no commitment on the part of the Sri Lankan Government, no will on the part of the Sri Lankan Government to investigate grave violations of human rights in keeping with international norms and standards. What happened in the course of that inquiry that was conducted by the Commission appointed by the Government? The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons wanted evidence to be led before the Commission by an independent counsel. Persons who were representing the Sri Lankan Government in regard to human rights violations before the Human Rights Council in Geneva were the same persons who were leading evidence on behalf of the victims before the Commission of Inquiry. The International Independent Eminent Group of Persons stated the view that there was a clear conflict of interest when the same lawyers handled both these contradictory positions leading evidence on behalf of the victims on the one hand and defending the Government and its armed forces on the other hand by the same people before the Human Rights Council in

43 44

2013 21

Geneva. The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons wanted a law enacted for the protection of victims and witnesses. That was how you brought the law, but you abandoned the law. Some of the witnesses left the country. They were afraid to stay in the country. The Commission commenced calling evidence through teleconferencing. That was stopped. Two persons appearing on behalf of those who were accused of the crimes before the Commission protested against evidence being recorded through teleconferencing and directives went out to the Commission that such evidence should not be recorded and the recording of such evidence was stopped.

This cannot be denied. It is all a matter of record, it can be proved. Why did you do that? You say that it was wrong on the part of the Panel of Experts to have adopted a normal rule that is applicable in the UN system, where persons who gave information or evidence in regard to sensitive matters, had a right to keep those matters confidential for a period of 20 years. Is this fair? When this is your own record, how can you complain about the adoption of what has been a regular procedure, a regular process in the UN?

What is the position today in regard to the inquiry pertaining to the massacre of the five students in Trincomalee and the 17 aid workers in Mutur? The Commission itself submitted a report. Where is that report? Why has that report not been made public? Why are they being concealed? More than that, let us see what the Governments position is in recent times. The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, the President's Special Envoy on Human Rights, goes to Geneva on the 27th of February, 2013. What did he state in Geneva in regard to these two matters? He said, I quote:

"'The government of Sri Lankas efforts continue, through the relevant agencies, to bring finality to the crimes involved in these two cases. I am able to announce that in the case of the five students, the Attorney General has instructed the Police to commence a non-summary inquiry before judicial authorities. Thus this matter may be brought to a conclusion and is concrete evidence of our commitment to accountability,'... "

Five students who were standing on the beach in Trincomalee, who were in the university or had passed their GCE (Advanced Level) and awaiting admission to the university, were slaughtered on the beach. They were shot and killed. Seven years later, on 13th February, 2013 a Minister of this Government has the temerity, the impudence to go before the Human Rights Council and say that a non-summary inquiry is going to be started and very soon things will be brought to a conclusion. I do not think the non-summary inquiry has started even now. A non-summary inquiry, Sir, as you know, probably starts in 10 days time. The trial would take place in the High Court or in the Assize Court in three months time or six months time. Here, seven years have passed and you have the impudence and impertinence to go before the Human Rights Council and say that a non-summary

inquiry was started and that you are confident that things will be brought to a conclusion and that that is concrete evidence of your commitment to accountability. That is your history and with this history, you question confidentiality being given to persons who testified in regard to very sensitive questions for a period of 20 years by the UN Panel of Experts.

The other ground of objection against the Report of the Secretary-Generals Panel of Experts on Accountability has been that the report had been prepared entirely outside the intergovernmental process.

I wish to deal with this matter because it is a fairly important question. This entire process on the question of accountability, this entire issue on accountability commences with a Joint Communiqu issued by the President of Sri Lanka and the Secretary-General of the UN when the Secretary-General visited the country on 23rd May 2009, some days after the war came to an end.

I will read from that Joint Communiqu. It states, I quote:

Following is the joint statement by the Government of Sri Lanka and the United Nations at the conclusion of the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moons visit to Sri Lanka on 23rd May.

"The Government expressed its commitment to ensure the economic and political empowerment of the people of the North through its programmes".

Then, we come to the issue of accountability. It says, I quote:

Sri Lanka reiterated its strongest commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, in keeping with international human rights standards and Sri Lankas international obligations. The Secretary-General underlined the importance of an accountability process for addressing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. The Government will take measures to address these grievances.

You accepted your international obligations. You said that you will fulfil your obligations in keeping with what was required to ensure the protection of human rights and you agreed, committed yourself to undertake measures that will address the question of accountability.

There was a specific commitment on the part of the Sri Lankan Government made in this Communiqu to address the question of accountability.

I would next refer to the "Terms of Reference" under which the Secretary-General appointed the Panel of Experts. This is what the Terms of Reference says. I quote:

"In the Joint Statement of the Secretary-General and the President of Sri Lanka issued at the conclusion of the Secretary-Generals visit in the country on 23 May 2009, the Secretary-General underlined the importance of an accountability process to address allegations of violations of international humanitarian and human rights law committed during military operations between the Government of Sri

45 46

Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The President of Sri Lanka undertook to take measures to address these grievances. At this time and against this background:

1. The Secretary-General has decided to establish a panel of experts to advise him on the implementation of the said commitment with respect to the final stages of the war.

2. 2. The purpose of the panel shall be to advise the Secretary-General on the modalities, applicable international standards and comparative experience relevant to the fulfillment of the joint commitment to an accountability process,

having regard to the nature and scope of alleged violations.

This was the Terms of Reference on the basis of which the Secretary-General appointed his Panel of Experts. It is at Annex 2.8 on page 145 of the Report of the Panel of Experts under the Terms of Reference.

The Secretary-General appointed the Panel of Experts to advise him in regard to the implementation of the commitment made by the Government of Sri Lanka and in regard to the fulfilment of the joint commitment to an accountability process. That was the reason why the Secretary-General appointed the Panel of Experts. What have you to complain about? What was the need for an inter-governmental process in this situation when the Government concerned is a consenting party to the achievement of the given objective, and on the basis of that commitment made by the Government concerned the Secretary-General of the UN appoints a Panel of Experts to advise him, and they have come up with a report on the basis of the Terms of Reference under which they were appointed. What is the need, I ask you, for an inter-governmental process when you have given a commitment to the Secretary-General who has told you that accountability must be addressed, and you make a commitment to him and that is contained in a Joint Communiqu where you have agreed to address that commitment, to deal with that commitment, and on the basis of that undertaking that you give the Secretary-General of UN, he appoints a Panel of Experts to advise him.

I do not see in this situation what need there is for an inter-governmental process because the Government of Sri Lanka which is the Government concerned has already given its consent to the accountability process being carried out and to that question being addressed. There is no need for an inter-governmental process thereafter. The Secretary-General of UN has sent the Report of the Panel of Experts to the Government of Sri Lanka and also to the UN Human Rights Council. The Government of Sri Lanka had involved itself with the Panel of Experts; it has interacted with the Panel of Experts. Though a visit by the Panel of Experts to Sri Lanka as wished by the Panel did not materialize the Government of Sri Lanka has interacted with the Panel of Experts. Of course the visit by the Panel did not

materialize because that is not an unusual thing in Sri Lanka. Recently, I think when the Chief Justice was impeached there was an international investigating group appointed by the International Bar Association headed by the former Chief Justice of India, Justice Sharma, to visit this country and make an inquiry in regard to the impeachment process but they were not able to come here.

They conducted their investigations from abroad and came up with their report. So, the Panel of Experts or independent international investigators being denied a visit to this country is nothing new. But, the fact of the matter is that, here in this instance, as far as the Panel of Experts appointed by the Secretary-General of the UN is concerned, you have clearly given your consent to that process being undertaken and you cannot now say that there must be an intergovernmental process and that your consent has no relevance.

This Panel, Sir, has been quite frank. They have stated that its mandate did not extend to fact-finding or investigation. The Panel states in Page i of its Report, I quote:

The Panel determined an allegation to be credible if there was a reasonable basis to believe that the underlying act or event occurred.

The Report further states, I quote:

Allegations are considered as credible in this report only when based on primary sources that the Panel deemed relevant and trustworthy.

So, the Panel, Sir, has been quite responsible in regard to what they did because they have come to certain conclusions. I would briefly read this for the purpose of record. Page ii of this Report states, I quote:

Allegations found credible by the Panel

The Panels determination of credible allegations reveals a very different version of the final stages of the war than that maintained to this day by the Government of Sri Lanka. The Government says it pursued a humanitarian rescue operation with a policy of zero civilian casualties. In stark contrast, the Panel found credible allegations, which if proven, indicate that a wide range of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law was committed both by the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE, some of which would amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. Indeed, the conduct of the war represented a grave assault on the entire regime of international law designed to protect individual dignity during both war and peace.

This is contained in Page ii of the Panels Report and in conclusion, the Panel states, I quote:

Thus, in conclusion, the Panel found credible allegations that comprise five core categories of potential serious violations committed by the Government of Sri Lanka: (i) killing of civilians through widespread shelling; (ii) shelling of hospitals and humanitarian objects; (iii) denial of humanitarian assistance; (iv) human rights violations suffered by victims and survivors of the conflict, including both IDPs and suspected LTTE cadre; and (v)

47 48

[ . ]

2013 21

human rights violations outside the conflict zone, including against the media and other critics of the Government.

Those were the conclusions that the Panel came to in regard to the Government. The Commission also found six core categories of potential serial violations against the LTTE. I do not think, Sir, there is a need for me to read that out here.

Before I finish with the Panels Report, I would also like to state what the Panel had to say on accountability which is important. In regard to accountability, the Panel of Experts states on Page iv of their Report, I quote:

... accountability goes beyond the investigation and prosecution of serious crimes that have been committed; rather it is a broad process that addresses the political, legal and moral responsibility of individuals and institutions for past violations of human rights and dignity. Consistent with the international standards mentioned above, accountability necessarily includes the achievement of truth, justice and reparations for victims.

That was in regard to the report of the panel of expert, Sir. Now, before I conclude, I would also like to say a few words about certain other issues. As one who has been closely observing the conduct of the war and its various dimensions from within the country and also as one who has been fully involved in the various efforts to evolve an acceptable political solution and as one concerned about the relationship between the conduct of the war, its end and a political solution which seems quite illusive, I wish to express my views on these issues, Sir, because they are very important as far as the country is concerned.

The official estimate of the Sri Lankan State was that there were around 70,000 Tamil civilians confined in the area, in the Vanni where the war took place. Eventually around 300,000 Tamil civilians came alive out of this area. Most of the estimates cautiously put the figure at around 250,000. Our own inquiries revealed that the total number of Tamil civilians trapped in this area was closer to 400,000. This was the view of the affected Tamil civilians. There is without question, a sharp discrepancy between the figure stated by the Government and the true figure. No explanation has been offered in regard to this sharp discrepancy. Is this indicative of the culture of impunity reaching its zenith, totally disregarding and distorting the truth?

Essentials such as food, medicine, shelter and other requisites would have been and were officially made available only on the basis of the Governments official estimate of 70,000 which inevitably must mean that a large number of Tamil civilian citizens would have been without food, medicine and shelter for weeks and months, such essentials being largely made available only by the Government.

All Non-governmental Organizations both domestic and international were ordered by the State to leave this

area in the Vanni in September, 2008. These NGOs were rendering immense service in vital areas inclusive of shelter, food and medicine to these Tamil civilian citizens. These Tamil civilian citizens were thereafter deprived of such services. These NGO personnel were surely not fighting along with the LTTE against the Sri Lankan security forces. No reasonable explanation has been offered as to why these NGO personnel were en-masse directed to leave the area, when the displaced Tamil civilians were in dire need of their services and assistance particularly in the context of the Governments clear underestimation of the total number of displaced Tamil civilian population in this area at that critical time.

Even UN personnel and ICRC personnel did not have free access to these areas. Has any reasonable explanation been offered as to why liberal access was not provided to these personnel? If liberal access was provided to these UN and ICRC personnel given their mandate, they could have made a significant contribution to alleviating the suffering of these people.

No one had access to this area. All media personnel were kept out. Media Personnel were sometimes taken on conducted tours; they had no free access to find out things or collect information by themselves. Has any reasonable explanation been offered in regard to the need to maintain such a high degree of secrecy? Does not this total lack of transparency, suggest that the truth was sought to be concealed.

The persons who came out of the conflict area were confined by the State under compulsion in camps, enclosed with barbed wires. There was no access to these camps. Tamil Members of Parliament were not able to visit these camps. They were denied entry. Relations and friends of these Tamil civilians were not able to visit these camps and meet these people, or be of assistance to them. These displaced Tamil civilians could not take up residence in host homes with relations or friends. This restriction which cannot be justified under the laws of the land was relaxed several months later. Was there a justifiable need to prevent contact between these affected Tamil civilians and others? Is this not again indicative of the culture of impunity that had become all pervasive. There seems to have been an assumption, that in regard to these Tamil civilians, persons in authority could act according to their whims, regardless of domestic or international law. These rules applied to all persons in the camps; men, women, youth and children. It was not confined to only persons who needed to be investigated.

Genuine reconciliation is not a purchasable commodity. It cannot be achieved by giving them false promises or by conferring on them partly benefits. To think that this can be done would be an insult to their self-respect and dignity.

I have raised in Parliament several times, the issue of the manner of the conduct of the war. I have done this

49 50

while the war was being conducted. I have stated that the war was being conducted with wanton disregard for the safety and well-being of Tamil civilian citizens. There is a widely held view that the war was conducted with the view of also subduing, subjugating and suppressing the Tamil people. This view holds the position that while the war was conducted so as to destroy the LTTE, which was waging an armed struggle against the Sri Lankan State in the name of the Tamil people, at the same time, yet another objective of the war was suppressing and subjugating the Tamil people and thereby negating the need for a political solution. This is a question to which an answer should be forthcoming, and it can come only from the Government. The answer should be in the form of credible and tangible action that demonstrates the Governments commitment to a just and acceptable political solution.

I must say with much regret Sir, that we still do not see these happening and we do not know whether it will happen going by things that are presently being said and being done in this country. Sir, the Tamil People have complained from after independence that they were subjected to discrimination, deprivation, inequality, injustice and exclusion; that the democratic verdicts of the Tamil people for a change in the structure of governance was not duly recognized, that governance was not with their free will and consent and that the Fundamental and Human rights of the Tamil people were being violated with impunity.

This commenced shortly after independence and has continued.

The Tamil people have lived in this country for as long as any other people. They have preponderantly lived in the Northern and the Eastern Parts of the country. They have their own civilization, culture, customs, language, and by religion are largely Hindus or Christians. They have thus lived together as a people. While being willing wholeheartedly to be a part of the Sri Lankan polity, they treasure their rich Tamil identity and wish to preserve it. The Sinhala people themselves have their own rich identity and wish to preserve it. Since Independence, the Tamil people have begun to realize that they were not treated as equal citizens, the Tamil people were driven to feel that they were second-class citizens, who would not be treated as equal citizens by the State or even given necessary protection by the State when they were victims of wanton violence by those who wanted to subjugate them. They were discriminated against in the fields of education, employment, economic opportunity, utilization of resources in the districts which they historically inhabited, and denied their basic fundamental human rights such as even the right to life. They were denied equal protection under the law.

Sir, since the 1956 Elections, the Federal Party was overwhelmingly returned in the North and the East at

every General Election; in March 1960, July 1960, 1965 and 1970. The Tamil people voted overwhelmingly for sharing of powers of governance and for regional autonomy in the North and the East. The Federal Party in its Election Manifesto in 1970 renounced a separate state, and called upon the Tamil people to vote against any candidate who contested on a separatist ticket. All such candidates were defeated. But, the democratic verdicts of the Tamil people were not recognized in any effective way. The Sinhala people were able to decide on their governance, they were able to exercise their sovereignty. The Tamil people by reason of their being numerically a minority in the whole country, were not able to have a say in their governance, in keeping with their democratic wish, even in the areas in which they were a majority, they were denied their sovereignty. They were being governed without their consent and against their will. Tamil political leadership made every effort through peaceful and non-violent means to bring about a change in the structure of governance.

The Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact of 1957, the Satyagraha, peaceful non-violent civil disobedience campaign in 1961 by which civil administration in the North and the East was crippled for some months, and in which tens of thousands of Tamil civilians, men, women, youth and children, participated; the Dudley Senanayake - Chelvanayakam Pact in 1965, the National Government between 1965 and 1970 when the Federal Party was a partner in the National Government and the contribution of the Federal Party at the Constituent Assembly proceedings between 1970 and 1972 for reasonable accommodation of Tamil aspirations which was denied, when it was sought to replace the Constitution under which the country attained independence, and which had provided certain fundamental safeguards, for the minority people, with a new Republican Constitution and the consequent walkout by the Federal Party from Constituent Assembly, are amongst the milestones along that path.

The enactment of the 1972 Constitution and the provisions contained therein, relating particularly to the structure of Governance, Religion and Language, breached the compact under which the country was granted independence in terms of the Soulbury Constitution. It was the enactment of the 1972 Constitution and the entrenchment of the unitary character of the State, which was not contained in the Soulbury Constitution and which was in direct contravention of the Tamil proposition for a Federal System of government, wherein powers of governance would be shared, the removal of the safeguards provided for in the earlier Constitution for the protection of the rights of minority people, the language and religion of the majority community being accorded primacy, and the various other acts of discrimination and deprivation and the violence unleashed against the Tamils as a People consistently and persistently in 1956, in 1958, in 1961, in 1977, in 1981 and in 1983 that led to the demand for a

51 52

[ . ]

2013 21

separate state and total sovereignty in 1976. The 1977 General Election was contested by the TULF on the basis of this demand. All Tamil Members of Parliament elected from the North and the East, barring one, were from the TULF.

The TULF, under international advice was willing to make a compromise on the demand for a separate state. Mr. A. Amirthalingam, the leader of the TULF and the leader of the Opposition in Parliament stated this both in Parliament and outside, shortly after the inauguration of 1977 Parliament. Sir, if the LTTE was regarded as an impediment on the Tamil side, to the evolution of an honourable political solution, the LTTE is not there any longer. It is absolutely fundamental that the forces of nationalist brinkmanship should no longer influence the political agenda on the other side. We are strongly of the view, that this is a continuing phenomenon and that this must be quickly arrested and contained, and that it is only the Government which has the power and authority to do so. I have not the slightest doubt that the vast majority of the people in this country, Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims are amenable to an acceptable, honourable and peaceful political solution within the framework of a united, undivided country.

Sri Lanka achieved its Independence without a shot being fired. None of the peoples in Sri Lanka opposed Independence. All peoples extended their co-oporation to achieve Independence. Why did the country, over the course of sixty years, have to degenerate to its present position? We did not achieve Independence by militarily vanquishing our colonial rulers. We did not achieve Independence through a non-violent civil disobedience campaign, such as the Sathyagraha campaign waged under the leadership of the great Mahatma Gandhi in India.

We achieved independence because we the peoples who inhabited Sri Lanka, though diverse and with different historical backgrounds, were united and because the international system and international laws would no longer condone colonial rule. Peoples under colonial rule were entitled under international law to the right to external self-determination. The United Nations was the guardian of the international system and international law under which we became entitled to receive independence. The United Nations is the guardian of the international system, of international laws, of international conventions and practices. Such a custodian is necessary to preserve the international system and ensure compliance with international laws and international conventions and practices.

Today, this country misuses the strength of its independence to exclude a section of the people based on ethnicity from the benefits of that independence and to reduce them to the level of inferior citizens. These are people who did not oppose independence. They supported independence.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

, [ ] .

, , [ ] . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Sampanthan, please continue with your speech. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees.

We call high officials of the UN terrorists and we threaten to arrest them. We vilify the Secretary-General of the UN because the Secretary-General of the UN asks that we comply with the commitments that we have made. Not complying with commitments that we have made is a part of the culture of impunity that has become so deeply ingrained in our pattern of behaviour and system of governance in this country.

Sir, with due respect, the term democracy has no meaning as far as the Tamil people are concerned. The democratic verdicts of the Tamil people since 1956 clearly mandated substantial self-rule and autonomy in the North and the East within a unified country. The democratic verdicts of the Tamil people were not accommodated within the framework of a united, undivided country. The resulting position was that while the Sinhala people had an effective say in their governance, the Tamil people did not have any say in their governance in keeping with their democratic verdicts. In fact, it could be said that the anti-Tamil pogroms over the decades, were related to the political demands of the Tamil people. For about three decades since independence, the political struggle of the Tamil people was non-violent and peaceful. During this period there was every opportunity for the conflict to be amicably and peacefully resolved. Despite Tamil political leadership strengthened by democratic mandates from the Tamil people extending its hand of friendship and cooperation, this was not achieved. During this period of around three decades only the Tamil people were victims of violence. The next three decades with the emergence of the LTTE saw substantial parts of the country, particularly the North and the East engulfed in extreme violence. All people were victims of this violence. All communities in the North and the East were also victims.

53 54

The Tamil people in particular were the most severe victims in every way. The armed struggle of the LTTE has now come to an end.

The position now is much worse than before the war came to an end. In addition to all the deprivation they suffered earlier, they have now lost everything they had owned and possessed earlier.

They never had before and do not have now a sense of economic or political empowerment. To put it in simple language, the Tamil people do not have the ability to take control of their lives. This is because their democratic verdict is not respected. They have to deal with masters and rulers. They cannot deal with persons whom they have elected as their representatives to attend to their needs and to exercise political power on their behalf; to whom they can talk freely; whom they can question and who are answerable to them. They can only deal with masters and rulers who can be merciful as they wish to be, can be rude and arrogant if they wish to be. Are not the Tamil people being treated grossly differently from the Sinhala people? Is it not the true position that the Tamil people have a price to pay because they are Tamils? Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committee, this cannot continue.

A lesson that needs to be learnt Sir, from this countrys history since independence is that Sri Lanka has not been able to evolve a Constitution based upon the consensus of its people, its multiethnic polity. Both the 1972 and 1978 Constitutions framed after independence, lacked a Tamil consensus and were instrumental in character being enacted by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the United National Party respectively to further their political ambitions. Such a Constitution based on consensus is basic to the progress and prosperity of a country and its people. Countries with such Constitutions despite difficulties, have acquired respectability, stability, progress and prosperity. Sri Lanka during their major part of its post independence history had been embroiled in internecine conflict, which in the past three decades have been violent, and has inflicted immense harm on the country. Our experiences in the past several decades, should make us all realize that in order to ensure that there is no repetition of the bitter and acrimonious experiences of the past, we resolve to put this era behind us and commence a new era based on hope and justice. The evolution of an acceptable Constitutional arrangement based upon consensus which is inclusive in character and accommodates the legitimate political aspirations of all its peoples, its multiethnic polity, is fundamental to the achievement of an honourable peace with dignity and justice. Democratic rights, Fundamental rights and Powers of Governance, need to be restructured in such a manner that would be acceptable to and find substantial consensus amongst Sri Lankas multiethnic, multicultural, multilingual and pluralist society that constitutes Sri Lanka.

Democracy is perhaps the most important and most precious of all tenets that needs to be properly understood. It is the fulcrum on which fundamental rights and good governance moves. Most unfortunately the tenet Democracy in Sri Lanka is not understood. It is understood in the crudest possible perspective in Sri Lanka. Most people think that democracy is a vehicle to win an election by hook or by crook, thereby capture power, wield and enjoy such power. It may be said that this malady to a fair degree, has afflicted the body politic, who are beneficiaries of the abuse of the power so achieved.

It must be understood that inclusiveness, tolerance, pluralism, egalitarianism and justice are the hallmarks of a truly democratic society. This is not to state that the wishes of the majority of the people are irrelevant, but it certainly means that the wishes of the majority of the people must be guided by these fundamental elements, and that the political leadership should have the wisdom to guide the people in this regard. Great democracies the world over have acquired unity in diversity, respectability, stability and prosperity by adopting this spirit. A State, which does not accept these principles, cannot be regarded as a truly democratic State. In todays context, Sri Lankas democratic credentials do not stand the test of scrutiny. The Sri Lankan State regrettably stands out as a majoritarian State, which does not uphold the rule of law, particularly in regard to the minority peoples, that excludes legitimate minority rights and concerns, disregards the democratic verdicts of the Tamil people, and is strongly influenced in its governance, by sectarian nationalist thinking. This must change, and this is yet another lesson that must be learnt, if there is to be voluntary and genuine reconciliation, peace and harmony. A State, which claims to be democratic, but which distorts democracy, and practises majoritarian authoritarianism, will inexorably traverse the path of self destruction. To be truly democratic, is a lesson that a Sri Lankan State needs to learn early.

Sir, I do not wish to take anymore time, but I do want to say that as far the Tamil people in this country are concerned, they are for an honourable peace. They want a reasonable, workable and durable political solution to the conflict that has affected the country. I think such a solution is needed not merely by the Tamil people, but by the whole country.

As my Motion would indicate, Sir, I was also due to speak on a number of other matters incorporated to the UN Human Rights Council Resolution, particularly on land issues and even on issues where places of religious and cultural importance to the Tamil people have been vandalized and desecrated. Sir, lack of time prevents me from speaking on some of these matters. I am hoping to deal with these matters in a different way and I do hope that those matters need not be once again raised in Parliament. I would appeal to the Government to reverse

55 56

[ . ]

2013 21

its present line of thinking and action and think in terms of dealing with the problem, the issue, in an honourable way while evolving as I said before, a just and a reasonable political solution.

I thank you, Sir. [3.12 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, first of all, I would like to second the Motion moved by the Hon. R. Sampanthan.

Sir, in Latin, there is a saying, Metus est Plenus Tyrannis, which I am sure, our learned Minister of External Affairs, whom some say is a man of many tongues, is aware that fear is plentiful for the tyrant and that a tyrants fate is to sit daily under the sword; or perhaps, as Shakespeare said, "Heavy is the head that wears the crown".

But, of course, in the Sri Lankan context, perhaps the head in question is more thick than heavy. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Damocles sword hanging over the uncrowned but heavy and thick heads of the Rajapaksa tyranny has come in the form of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, CHOGM, scheduled to be held in Colombo in November. For many years the Rajapaksa regime continue to fool a gullible public and a blue-eyed international community continue to believe in them, in their lies and in their duplicity.

But, Tisaranee Gunasekara whom I feel is one of the most courageous columnists daring to write under this regime wrote in a blog early this week. She says, Lies and dissembling false promises and mendacious declarations, illusions and delusions form the bedrock of Rajapaksa Governance. The siblings are master-illusionists. They excel at using words to create a totally unreal counter-reality. It is beautifully written. She further says, "They did that when they called the Fourth Eelam War, a humanitarian operation with zero-civilian casualties and open prison camps, welfare centres. They did it that when they called the Eighteenth Amendment, 'a democratic measure', the impeachment travesty, 'a legal recourse' and the arrest of General Fonseka, 'a patriotic act.' "

However, the Sri Lankan public who were walking around in a somnambulist slumber for a while after the defeat of the Tigers in 2009, four years ago, are now waking up rapidly to the reality of this evil regime. Like a delinquent child put on probation to gauge whether he deserves a gift for Christmas, the Rajapaksa regime is also now under probation. This is a Government under probation now in view of the pending meeting in

November and the human rights review in March next year.

The fact that the Sri Lankan Government has been subject to intense international scrutiny is confirmed by the statement made by the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, in the British House of Commons on the 15th of May. What does he say in the Hansard.? He says that the British Government condemns the violations; the way in which political trials, regular assaults on legal professionals and suppression of press freedom continue and the fact that too many recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission have not been implemented and - this is the important part - if such violations continue and if the Sri Lankan Government continue to ignore their international commitments in the lead up to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, of course, there will be consequences.

The Deputy Prime Minister says that there will be consequences.

In fact, I will also like to quote what Bob Carr, speaking on behalf of the Australian Government, said at the Press Conference held immediately after the CMAG Meeting at Marlborough House in London on the 26th of April this year. He also says that the progress of the Sri Lankan Government will be monitored. In fact, if I may quote Bob Carr:

I think it is a view that many of us hold that in the lead-up to CHOGM, this Commonwealth, with its adherence to democratic values and that charter, is in a good position to engage with the government of Sri Lanka and monitor progress.

Monitor progress is the defining phrase. The Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Kamalesh Sharma, in his enthusiasm to hold CHOGM in Sri Lanka at any cost, of course, seems to be very blue-eyed - if I may say - about the prospects of making the Rajapaksa regime adhere to the Commonwealth values and principles that are dear to us. These are not my words, his words.

At the CMAG Press Conference on the 26th April, asked by a journalist when he would feel appropriate to stop using his good offices to engage Sri Lanka, Sharma in his reply says, I quote:

My present experience is that I do not anticipate that that point is likely to be reached because of all the cooperation which I am getting

Very good! He goes on to say, I quote:

and all the fields that we are engaged in. These fields are in human rights institutions, which we are trying to upgrade to grade A, the Elections Commission to make it more independent, the media policy, the independence of the Judiciary, the LLRC that I mentioned... The menu for working with them is emerging in a way that I expect, that there will be progress, going forward, rather than a sense of disappointment.

57 58

In fact, Sir, Secretary-General, Sharma also goes on to say that he is sure that it will yield good results in all the areas of human rights, and the LLRC Report, he is sure, will be implemented.

Sir, at this stage, I would like to say - of course I am very sincere when I say - that I also would love to be blue-eyed as the Secretary-General of Commonwealth and share his optimism of yielding good results from this Government, because over the years we have had first-hand experiences of the duplicitous nature of this regime. But, again I sincerely hope that we are proven wrong and that the Secretary-General is able to stop this drift towards dictatorship in Asias oldest democracy.

In fact, Sir, the United National Party has consistently supported holding of CHOGM in Colombo, provided that the outstanding issues relating to the Commonwealth Charter, UNHCR Resolution regarding Sri Lanka, and the President's own LLRC Report are resolved before CHOGM 2013 commences. This was emphasized by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe when he met the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth in September 2012, as well as in February of this year. In fact, with less than six months away, the UNP wish to bring to the notice of the Secretary-General and the Commonwealth that no broad engagement as far as we know has taken placed at ground level, and in fact, the situation is going from bad to worse. The deteriorating ground situation belies the statement made by the Secretary-General and Dr. Moni at the press briefing after the CMAG meeting.

Sir, the Commonwealth Charter, as you are aware, was adopted and launched by all Commonwealth member states during the Commonwealth Week, I believe, in March, this year. The full text of the Charter was discussed and agreed by all Commonwealth Heads of State including President Mahinda Rajapaksa on the 14th of December 2012. In fact, this Charter is a milestone for the Commonwealth and for the first time in 64 years, the Commonwealth has a single document setting out the core values of the organization and the aspirations of its members. In fact, I think it is important that I table* a copy of the Commonwealth Charter, as I said, the first formal Charter in 64 years, on the Floor of this House. I would like to table that document. In this document, all the core values of the organization as well as the aspirations of its members have been set down in a brief and easy to read manner.

However, the crisis the Secretary-General now has to overcome is, what I would call, the discrepancy between the core values of the Commonwealth and the aspirations

of the incoming Chairperson of the Commonwealth. There is a huge discrepancy between these two. The core values as said down in the Charter of the Commonwealth are very different to the vision and the agenda of the incoming Chairperson.

In the pursuit of absolute power, the Rajapaksa regime has been systematically dismantling and weakening democratic institutions for the last few years and despite the Secretary-Generals optimism there is nothing - and I say, "absolutely nothing" - to show that the regime is willing to change its autocratic agenda. In fact, - the regime continues to violate, if I may say so, - all 16 of these core values have been violated by the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government to one degree on another over the years and they still continue to do so with six months to go for the CHOGM, Heads of State Meeting. Due to the constraint of time, I will not list all the violations of the 26 core values but I will highlight some urgent areas of concern.

In fact, core value No. 1 is, of course, "DEMOCRACY" and I am not going to read that whole section, but as we all know, independent and accountable institutions are the cornerstone of any democracy. But, the Government so far, has not taken any action to repeal the Eighteenth Amendment, which was a power grab by the Executive, undermining the Independent Police, Judicial and Election Commissions. As we remember well, this Bill was rushed through Parliament as an Urgent Bill in 24 hours. Therefore, I am asking the Hon. Minister; I am asking the Government, if the Government is sincere about the assurances you seem to have given the Secretary-General and the Commonwealth, you could now display the same amount of enthusiasm as you did when you brought that horrendous, notorious Amendment to Parliament on the 18th of September, 2010. You brought it without any debate as an Urgent Bill in 24 hours. It was not presented for discussion. But now, if you are serious about having an Independent Election Commission, an Independent Judicial Commission, an Independent Government Service Commission et cetera, you can do it again within 24 hours. You do not need time for that. In fact, I would say, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, that the restoration of Independent Commissions prior to the Northern Provincial Council polls should be a sine qua non for CHOGM to be held in Colombo. I repeat. The repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment before the elections in the North are held should be a sine qua non if CHOGM is to be held in Colombo in November, this year. That is very important. They cannot run away from it.

And, of course, talking about the Provincial Councils, the Government must also ensure that the Thirteenth Amendment is not diluted because already we are hearing all kinds of stories that various powers given under the Thirteenth Amendment are to be taken away and certain branches of the Government are now going to the court - controlled by this very Government, by their own Chief

Justice - to try and get an injunction order against the holding of the Provincial Council Elections. So, this insidious form of governance must stop at least at this moment.

Due to constraints on time, I cannot go through all 16 core values, but under "HUMAN RIGHTS" at the end of the Charter of the Commonwealth it states:

We are implacably opposed to all forms of discrimination, whether rooted in gender, race, colour, creed, political belief or other grounds.

But, as we know, the situation is actually very bad.

The human rights of even referees at rugger matches are now violated with impunity on the sports field, in the rugger field. We heard only last week that a member of the Rajapaksa brood actually assaulted a referee because he lost the match and there is no inquiry up to now, absolutely no inquiry. Not only that, from what I hear from people who were present there, even the small phones of some of the people who had filmed this incident of this brat hitting this referee was confiscated by the police when they left the place. So, this is the state of human rights in this country.

Not only that, look at the plight of the Muslims today. I am not going to talk about the plight of the long-suffering Tamil people of this country because it was explained very lucidly in an erudite manner by the Hon. R. Sampanthan. Today, the Muslims have also become a target; they are at the receiving end of this Government. In fact, as far as I know, there have been 33 attacks on Muslim mosques, Christian churches and Hindu temples between April 2012 and January of this year and it tends to go on and on. These are carried by various extremist so-called Buddhist groups. I say so-called because being a Buddhist, I do not believe that real Buddhist could ever condone or do such acts. We know this "so-called" Buddhist group is working - it is not a secret - with the blessings of the Defence Secretary. They are allowed to go on a rampage and when the Muslim mosques are destroyed, the police actually fold their hands and arms and just watched the whole thing.

We all know that one of the Muslim leaders, Mr. Azath Salley, who was courageous enough to talk about this problem, was arrested two weeks ago under the PTA. He was harassed for a few days before being released. In fact, we believe that this harassment also began after Mr. Azath Salley wrote to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the 5th of March, 2013 about the witch-hunt against the Muslim community in this country. He was taken into custody. I would actually like to table* this letter written by Mr. Azath Salley to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. I think Parliament should have it.

This matter was brought to the attention of this Government and His Excellency the President himself by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Mr. Heiner Bielefeldt and the Independent Expert on Minority Issues, Ms. Izsak Rita. In this letter dated 7th May, 2012, it is stated, I quote:

Excellency,...

In this connection, we would like to draw the attention of your Excellencys Government to information we have received regarding the attack against and relocation of a mosque in Dambulla and rising incidents of religious intolerance.

This was sent exactly one year ago. Instead of the situation getting better, actually as I told you earlier, the situation is actually going from bad to worse. However, no action has been taken so far and reports of religious violence are on the rise.

I would like to table* now that letter dated 7th May, 2012, sent by the Rapporteur to the President.

Then, if we go to the fourth core value of the Charter, that also talks about "Tolerance, Respect and Understanding". In fact, this again is something that we can go on for a long time. But, today intolerance seems to have become the order of the day. The fifth core value of the Charter - Freedom of Expression. What does it say? I quote:

We are committed to peaceful, open dialogue and the free flow of information, including through a free and responsible media, and to enhancing democratic traditions and strengthening democratic processes.

Unfortunately, again, since the blue-eyed Mr. Kamalesh Sharma spoke to the Government and gave the whole world an assurance that things will start getting better, the attacks have been increasing even in the free media.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for example, just last week, the CID raided the newspaper office of a tabloid - this is the first time I have seen it - apparently the Janarala newspaper. Why did they raid it? It is because they carried a lead story on the 12th of May, 2013 about laundering LTTE gold. They actually talked about an incident where they claimed that gold belonging to the LTTE has been laundered. " ". That is the headline. We do not know who it is. But because of that, the place was raided; they had to give a statement to the police and they did not stop there; they actually closed down some of the websites who had picked up the story from this newspaper.

In fact, the situation is so bad that the New York based Committee to Protect Journalists in its Impunity Index has listed Sri Lanka as the fourth worst country for journalists to live in. That is their latest index. Not only that, in fact, this has also been documented. But, I think we must remember how just prior to the Sinhala/Tamil New Year, the Uthayan newspaper office in Jaffna was attacked. There have been four attacks in this year alone, the last being on the 13th of April, 2013. A few days before the CMAG Meeting, armed men entered the office and printing press of "Uthayan", a daily Tamil-language newspaper published from Jaffna in northern Sri Lanka and burnt the printing press and the newspapers that were about to be dispatched for sale. In fact, the US State Departments Acting Deputy Spokesperson, Patrick Ventrell referring to the "Uthayan" on 30th April, 2013 in Daily Press Briefing stated, I quote:

Uthayan has seen its personnel beaten, its newspaper shipments burned, its equipment destroyed, and its offices set ablaze in this last month alone.

In fact, Mr. Ventrell described further, I quote:

The assault on a free press in Sri Lanka extends beyond Uthayan...

Actually, as I said earlier, this is not confined to the North. It is happening everywhere. He further stated, I quote:

The BBC Tamil language service has had its programs about Sri Lanka and the Human Rights Council censored. Reporters have been physically assaulted and murdered in years past, and a prominent political cartoonist has been missing for three years.

Pradeep Ekneligodas wife is still going from door to door three years after her husband disappeared.

It also states, I quote:

The necessity of upholding this fundamental right was not only a component of the UN Human Rights Council resolution in Geneva this March, but it was a central recommendation of the Sri Lankan Governments own Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission.

Then, No. V of the Charter of the Commonwealth is, "Freedom of Expression". No. VII is the "Rule of Law". Of course, there is nothing we can talk about it in this short possible period of time but all I would like to say is, it is again a well-known secret that most of the judicial transfers are now done, not by the Judicial Service Commission, but are actually carried out at Temple Trees. In the last few weeks, many judges were transferred and those who were targeted for transfers were the judges and magistrates who were against the illegal impeachment of the Chief Justice, Shirani Bandaranayake.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Managala Samaraweera, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Give me five more minutes, Sir. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I cannot give you five minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Okay. I will give you five minutes from the time allotted to the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, I think I have five minutes more. I was told that.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That had already been added to your time. So, I will give you five minutes from the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella's time.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Finally, let me move on to No. XVI, the last item of the Charter of the Commonwealth: The Role of Civil Society. Sir, even as we are speaking, Sagarika Delgoda, who is the Resident Representative of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, has been dragged to the notorious "Fourth Floor" of the CID to be questioned. Today, the civil society, the people, are under attack. When they do their work on behalf of the country, they are being labelled as "terrorists" and called all sorts of other names by the Government media. So, as I said, Sir, -

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Lalith Dissanayake, what is the point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) , . .

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I am sorry. That is not a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Finally, Sir, all I want to say is, it is a moment of reckoning, not only for the Government of Sri Lanka, but also for the Commonwealth. As far as the Government is concerned, I hope even at this late stage, His Excellency the President would put the country first instead of his own personal political agenda. As for the Commonwealth, the Secretary-General, Kamalesh Sharma, must not insist on giving the Commonwealth Seal of Approval for the propaganda interest of this regime, if they persist in continuing their dictatorial ways.

Anyway, Sir, may I begin my speech performing a pleasant task? That is to offer my warmest greetings to our Leader of the House, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva on his completion of 30 years in politics. It was yesterday that we attended a grand ceremony at the BMICH to felicitate him, and I should say that it is one of most impressive felicitation ceremonies I was privileged to have attended. The keynote address made by former Higher Education Minister, Prof. W.A. Wiswa Warnapala. There was also an erudite scholar himself, Minister of External Affairs, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris who made a gem of a speech, I should say in this House.

"" - ! .

I am just surprised as to what was the validity of this Debate. The Mover - I feel sorry for him - the elderly Hon. Sampanthan, is silently sitting across after making his - I should say - a bit of an unimpressive speech today, which did not capture the imagination of anybody or whom he intends the speech should reach abroad - the YouTube and the other tubes - I do not know what are the tubes that they employ to inflate.

Is the TNA speaking on behalf of the TNA? Is it speaking on behalf of the TULF or PLOTE or TELO or EPDP? I do not know for whose benefit he is expressing these sentiments. So, like the United National Party, the JVP, the Federal Party, which was a strong party earlier founded by that great man, the exponent of Satyagraha in this Island, Thanthai S.J.V. Chelvanayakam, today stands shattered. It is torn into pieces. How many voices have they now?

Today, the most amazing thing that I want to tell the international diaspora and the Tamil community is, although the TNA represents many parties, he only chose himself to speak, denying the right of other Members of the Alliance to speak, as far as the Tamil community is concerned. He has brought in this Motion in order to spotlight the grievances of the Tamil community. Therefore, Sir, I must tell him that he should take leave of politics and give to a younger man from his Alliance to carry forward his message because we must have a strong Tamil political party in this country inasmuch as that we try to do our duty towards the Muslim community through the national parties like the Sri Lanka Freedom Party today.

Only three days before, I was in Eravur and I was reminded of the horrendous, barbaric crimes that the LTTE committed against the people of Eravur. They went into all the houses, pulled the people out, cut them, chopped them and brutally murdered them. When we rushed there at that time, an achchi, an old lady came crying, bringing a small panpettiya. We thought it as palappam because in the Eastern Province, early morning, they give palappam. The achchi opened that - - panpetti. What did we find in it? A small child who was born the previous night and his mother was chopped into pieces by the heartless Tigers. But, you have not decried them. That is what my worry is about, my grudge against you is. Up to this day, you do not say a single word condemning this brutality.

Now, several accusations were made against you by our good Friend and Trincomalee District MP, the Hon. Susantha Punchinilame. It is you who introduced communal politics in the Trincomalee District. He related that story. I feel very sorry that you acted so.

Therefore, Sir, I must also say that after attending the Hon. Hafiz Ahamed's brother Azzam's daughters wedding in Eravur, I had the opportunity of visiting Mr. Prince Casinader, who was a very distinguished Member in this House. Now, Sir, there is a comparison here - Mr. Prince Casinader, while reminiscing about those incidents, shuddered to think, he did not want to think about those appalling and horrendous incidents.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, have I used the 10 minutes allotted to me? ( ) (The Presiding Member) Yes. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Give me five more minutes because the two other speakers are not here.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Time is running out fast. So, five minutes is too much. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Then, I will finish in two minutes. Sir, Mr. Prince Casinader is 87 years old. He is happily retired. He is an exponent of the art of English speaking; a very, very impressive speaker and to listen to him speaking in English is like pouring honey into our ears. Now, the Hon. Sampanthan is 77 years - only 10 years underaged. Now, today, when he was speaking, he spoke about the Sinhala culture. He said, We must help the Sinhala culture to develop, the Tamil culture to develop. He, very conveniently forgot that there is a Muslim community living in this Island. He never mentioned a word about the Muslim culture that must also be developed, fostered and promoted. Sir, that is what I say that you deny Muslims their rights.

On the Ranaviru Day, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa said how they were rehabilitating the

youths in the North, they are being given even in marriages. The roads are being built and rehabilitated. He further said that he feels much for the Tamil people as much as he feels for the Sinhalese people. That is the reason why the Sri Lanka Freedom Party looked after the interests of the Tamils so well that even the Jaffna farmer voted for Mr. Kobbekaduwa as against Mr. Ponnambalam.

Therefore, Sir, we have to have talks. The Hon. Sampanthan says, "You must change your thinking power and come for a reasonable settlement". That is what our President is asking you to do: "Come to the table, discuss locally and we will find solutions to your problem, our problem and to the countrys problems as a whole."

Thank you. [.. 5.15] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Felix Perera - Minister of Social Services) , .

2013 21

[5.26 p.m.] () .. ( ) ( () .. - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Presiding Member, I am happy to respond to the different arguments that were adduced, particularly by Hon. Members of the Opposition, on the matters that were the subject matter of this Debate.

The Hon. R. Sampanthan, moving this Motion, very early in his speech stated that the ideas contained in the Resolution adopted in Geneva and his own initiative in proposing this Motion were not intended to inflict any harm on the country or its people. Those were the words that he used. That, Sir, is the fundamental disagreement. I do not agree with the Hon. Sampanthan that what he is doing is not intended to inflict any harm on the country or its people. I believe that the contrary is very much the case. The whole thrust of the speech by the Hon. R. Sampanthan is that this Resolution passed in Geneva is a good and proper Resolution; it embodies the truth; it is something that should be accepted without question and the principles contained in that Resolution should govern our conduct in the future. That was the pith and substance of what he said on that point. In other words, he wants us to believe that the Resolution is founded upon objective premises. That is certainly not the case.

There was one very significant circumstance which my Friend omitted to mention. It is this; I am sure he knows that. This Resolution was not proposed for the first time by the United States of America. That was not the case. It was originally brought by another country. It was brought by Canada. Canada actually submitted a draft Resolution in Geneva. So, the initiative came, not from the United States of America, but from Canada. This happened in September, 2011 when His Excellency the President and I were in New York attending the Sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. When we were in New York, we were informed by our Permanent Representative in Geneva that this Resolution had been submitted to the Human Rights Council by Canada and a text of the Resolution was sent to us. Canada made a strong effort to garner support for this Resolution. That ended in dismal failure. What happened next was that the Foreign Minister of Canada, the Hon. John Baird, sought a meeting with me in New York and we had a bilateral meeting. We discussed issues. At that meeting, the Canadian Foreign Minister informed me that Canada was not proceeding with this Resolution on that occasion and he was sufficiently candid and forthright to give me the reason for that decision by the Government of Canada. The reason was that they did not have support. The Hon. Sampanthan would have us believe that the outcome of that Resolution has nothing to do with the mover. The influence, the clout of the mover is totally irrelevant, according to the Hon. Sampanthan.

I would then like to ask, how did it then come about that when Canada proposed this Resolution against Sri Lanka, it was dead in the water, it was still born? Canada proposed it and told me that they did not have the support for it. So, Mr. Presiding Member, what made the difference was the mover; who is it that was moving the Resolution? What Canada could not do, the United States took over. The United States then took over the burden. It is quite idle and entirely disingenuous to suggest that the attitudes of countries had nothing to do with the economic, military and strategic influence of the United States. I myself travelled very extensively, not this year but last year, in March 2012, I visited a large number of African countries and I met, in some cases, the Presidents of those countries; in other cases, the Prime Ministers or at least the Foreign Ministers of those countries. They spoke to me. I know what was happening in those Capitals. I go there, I have a meeting, I present my point of view and then I come home. The United States has an Embassy in each of those Capitals and I am aware of the intensity of the pressure that was exerted on those governments. They have shared that with us that they are under this pressure.

The Hon. Sampanthan gave some figures, which I think related to direct aid. I do not know about those figures, I have not seen them. But, on the assumption that those figures are correct - I accept the Hon. Sampanthan's figures, I am not disputing them - I would say that is totally a misleading picture. I mean, you cannot gauge the influence of the United States on those countries by simply looking at the bare figures relating to direct aid. Influence takes a variety of forms as my Friend is very well aware. So, many countries did have a very substantial difficulty in saying, No to the United States. They have said so specifically to me. It would be totally improper on my part, on the Floor of this House, to name countries but in the course of a candid dialogue they have told me that this was their problem. Surely, that is not surprising. The Hon. R. Sampanthan is well aware that international relations are not founded upon unlimited altruism. These are not the responses or the perspectives of Arhats. Foreign policy is all about enlightened self-interests. These countries are trying to protect and nurture their own interests understandably. It is not their job to make a very clinical, objective and dispassionate appraisal of the situation. That is not how decisions are made with regard to the patterns of voting in Geneva. So, that is the reality of the situation and I do not think we should try to dress it up and give it a complexion that it simply does not have. Also, what happened in Geneva has many unusual features. I do not know whether the Hon. Sampanthan is aware - I think he probably is - that the United States came into the Human Rights Council in 2009 and this was the first occasion on which they proposed or even supported a country-specific resolution of this kind. As he is well aware, the United States previously was one of the harshest critics of the Human Rights Council. But, they did not, prior to the Resolution with regard to Sri Lanka, bring country-specific resolutions and many other countries which voted for the US Resolution are on record as saying that they are, in principle, opposed to country-specific resolutions. That is on record. Countries have said that that is their policy.

101 102

They deviated from that policy not because of highfalutin moral and ethical considerations; that is to live in a dream world.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is the very reason.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Presiding Member, it was the practical dynamics of the situation and issues involved in the bilateral relationship between the country bringing the Resolution and the countries whose votes were canvassed that accounted for the result. The Hon. Sampanthan made great play with trade relations and he said that many of the countries supporting the United States' Resolutions were countries which had significant trade links with our country. But then, he does not again mention another obvious fact and it is this: that any given time there would be more than 10 countries belonging to the European Union that would be members of the Human Rights Council. Those countries, as he is well aware, cannot make an independent decision on how they are going to vote. They cannot because that is a subject that is delegated to the Commission in Brussels. So, once the hierarchy in Brussels makes a decision, all the countries of the European Union, 27 of them, are bound by that.

Now, again, Hon. Sampanthan, I was there in March, 2012 and we met these countries and some of them, - again, I will not mention the names because that would be invidious, - they told us, We think that this is premature. We do not in our own conscience support this. But, it is not for us to decide, the decision has been made for us. The Permanent Representative of one country told me, - he actually told me - You will notice that in the dialogue that takes place I am saying nothing. I am remaining silent. That is because, in my own conscience, I know that this does not deserve support. But, when it comes to voting I have to vote according to the instructions which I receive from Brussels. So, that is the truth, that is a reality of the situation and to try to distort it by appealing to high moral principles is unworthy of a Member of the stature and seniority of the Hon. R. Sampanthan.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) We must go by the vote in the UN. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Presiding Member, it is a fact that the Human Rights Council today is the most politicized among all the

organs of the United Nations system and that has very considerable consequences, not only for Sri Lanka but the implications of that situation far transcend the specifics of the Sri Lankan situation and are of far wider interest to the world community and, in particular, to developing nations. The Hon. R. Sampanthan in a speech which took about 75 minutes said that we are part of an institutional arrangement. That was his phrase, part of an institutional arrangement. That is very much the case and that is why there is an acute reason for concern about the implications of the unfolding situation.

The Hon. R. Sampanthan was fiercely defensive of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. But, there are some aspects of the manner in which he has dealt with the Sri Lankan situation, which we have reason to be unhappy with. The Report that the Commissioner submitted to the Human Rights Council seeks to incorporate into the formal documentation of the Human Rights Council, certain other documents and the whole purpose of that exercise is to sanctify those documents by being brought into the mainstream of the documentation of the Human Rights Council. In particular, there were two documents that were incorporated in that manner. One is, what I call the Darusman Report and the other is what I call the Petrie Report. The Darusman Report again won handsome praise from the Hon. R. Sampanthan but I am sure he knows -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Why do you call it "Darusman"? () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) It does not matter what you call it but we both know what we mean.

Sir, the Darusman Report characterizes the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam as the most disciplined and nationalist organization. I wonder - [Interruption.] Hon. Sampanthan, I sat through your speech for 75 minutes and did not say a word although there was a lot that I felt like saying and I ask for that reciprocal courtesy from you. Sir, I wonder whether the Hon. R. Sampanthan agrees with that characterization of the LTTE; the most nationalist and the most disciplined organization. We are talking about an organization that killed a member of his party who sat there as the Leader of the Opposition. The Hon. R. Sampanthan, towards the end of his speech -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

103 104

[ () .. ]

2013 21

.. , .

, .. , . Whereupon MR. V.S. RADHAKRISHNAN left the Chair and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES took the Chair.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I was referring to the fact that the Darusman Report, whose virtues the Hon. R. Sampanthan extolled eloquently, describes the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam as the most disciplined and nationalist organization and I was saying that it is this same organization that liquidated a member of his party who graced the Chair of the Leader of the Opposition in this august Assembly. The Hon. R. Sampanthan, towards the end of his speech, gave us a rsum of the constitutional ideals which he would like to see applied in the public law of this country. Somebody who did that with even greater persuasive power was my Friend, the late Hon. (Dr.) Neelan Thiruchelvam. We were fellow undergraduates in the University of Peradeniya before I went to Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship and he proceeded to Harvard University on a Fulbright Scholarship and our paths crossed again when we entered Parliament together in 1994.

The Hon. R. Sampanthan knows, as well as I do, the capability of the late Hon. (Dr.) Neelan Thiruchelvam. He was killed brutally by the LTTE and this is the organization that is described as the most disciplined and nationalist organization and that is the report which the Hon. R. Sampanthan finds eminently acceptable. The Report further goes on to analyse the entire conflict in this country which raged for such a long period as essentially a conflict between the Sinhala and the Tamil people. How come the LTTE liquidated most of the leadership of the Hon. R. Sampanthans party, not to mention many other distinguished Tamil citizens of this country - professionals, academics, industrialists and business people? How does that act become reconcilable with this bizarre analysis of the character of the conflict? So, that is the kind of Report for the Hon. R. Sampanthan stands up in this House and defends today.

Now, there are other equally strange features of the Darusman Report. The Darusman Report, as the Hon. R. Sampanthan himself conceded, says that they did not have the power to investigate. It was not a fact-finding body. Actually, they say that in four different places in their Report. They say that they did not have the authority to investigate, and in fact, they did not investigate. Yet, they come to conclusions which have significant repercussions on the rights of a sovereign State. How is it conceivable that they can come to conclusions which carry, as I say, very significant consequences without carrying out an investigation? They say, we did not investigate nor did we have the power to investigate. That is a travesty of

the basic norms of justice. That is why we say that a body which relies on evidence gathered in this clandestine and furtive manner cannot possibly be held to be doing justice. Lurking in the shadows and motivated by unworthy considerations, one can present any kind of purported evidence and if that is the basis on which this crucial findings are based, then those findings are certainly not acceptable in keeping with rudimentary values relating to procedural fairness and natural justice. These are among the reasons why we reject the Darusman Report.

There is also one other absolutely incredible feature of that Report. If the Hon. R. Sampanthan would care to refresh his memory and read some of those passages, they describe in the most horrendous terms events which are supposed to have occurred and then, believe it or not, they say that these should not be accepted as facts. They are not prepared to vouch for the accuracy of what they are putting into that Report.

Is that a responsible course of action? Is that something that can be condoned or justified? Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it is not only we who have unequivocally rejected this Report. The Hon. R. Sampanthan is well aware that the African Union and the Organization of Islamic Countries have unequivocally rejected the Darusman Report because it is incurably flawed and yet that is the Report which the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights is incorporating into the formal documentation of the Human Rights Council and therefore of the United Nations system. That is something which we vigorously and vehemently object to.

The other document which the Commissioner, in that same unacceptable way, seeks to bring into the documentation of the UN system is the Petrie Report. The Petrie Report was not intended to be a critique of Sri Lankan Government policy at all. On the contrary, it was merely an examination of the manner in which the United Nations system had operated in this country and it was supposed to provide a basis for the Secretary-General of the United Nations to make decisions as to improving and streamlining his own internal procedures and systems. That was the objective of the Petrie Report. Now, it is being established that the Petrie Report was prepared in a very unacceptable way. They have redacted; they have blacked out portions of documents which they used. They have blacked out portions of documents which they used which did not support the conclusions that they wish to arrive at.

Then, what they say with regard to certain matters, for example, the quantities of food that were sent to the Northern Province, are flatly contradicted by the evidence of the United Nations officials who were present in the country at the relevant time, like Neil Buhne who was heading the operation here and also Western

105 106

Ambassadors who were members of the CCHA - the Consultative Committee on Humanitarian Assistance. My Friend is aware that the then US Ambassador in Sri Lanka, His Excellency Robert Blake, was a Member of that body. Japan was there; other Western nations were members of the CCHA. The CCHA was personally aware of the quantities of food that were sent to the North. In fact, this was a Government that was feeding the people of the North and sending them essential medicines knowing full well that a considerable quantity of this was being used by the LTTE. Nevertheless, the food and the medicines were sent there and the CCHA was very much a part of that operation and were personally privy to decisions that were taken with regard to quantities of food and drugs that were required for use by the people of the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. The material contained in the Petrie Report flies in the face of all this incontrovertible material which was contemporaneously produced by people having first-hand knowledge of the matters in question.

Then, the numbers that are referred to in the Petrie Report - 40,000 - is just plucked out of the ether. Sir John Holmes when asked about it at that time said, No, this is not based on any factual information. So, that is the quality of the Petrie Report, which the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights brings formally into the documentation of the system. This is why we say that this modus operandi spells disaster for the system as a whole, because it strikes at the very root of credibility and confidence. We all know that the international legal system, unlike domestic legal systems, is not backed up by the cohesive power of the State. Its only foundation is its moral and ethical acceptability; its moral credentials. So, if you have the system functioning in this manner, it cannot possibly command the confidence of countries which have dealings with the system.

Now, look at the behaviour of some of the people concerned. In the case of the Darusman Report, take the behaviour of Yasmin Sooka, who was one of the people on the Panel. After submission of the Report she has taken it upon herself to market the Report, holding seminars and trying to persuade people to accept the Report. That was not her function at all. Her function was to examine certain facts and make a report to the Secretary-General. Another Member of the Panel was Steven Ratner, an American Professor, who in published work had come to conclusions on the matters that he was called upon to decide before he was appointed to the Panel. How could he possibly bring an open mind to bear on the matters which he is required to report on? How can anyone in his senses accept conclusions arrived at in that manner as impartial and objective?

The Hon. Sampanthan used another phrase. He said that there is a need for an international system. Of course, there is a need for an international system. That is why we

say that credibility of the system is of such vital significance. We wrote to the Commissioner 11 months before the Resolution was adopted in Geneva, inviting her to come to this country to rely on the evidence of her own eyes and to see for herself the progress that was being achieved on the ground. She said she will come but that she would like her visit to be preceded by a visit by a technical team from her office. I readily agreed to that. In fact, that is normal practice. So, that is how we received in this country Hanny Megally, one of her officers who was accompanied by two or three other officials of the Commissioner. We have in our Ministry, a letter from the Commissioner expressing appreciation of the assistance which we gave her officer at every point.

She expressed appreciation of it. What happened when Mr. Hanny Megally went back to Geneva? The first thing that happened was that he went to the residence of the United States Permanent Representative to brief selected invitees. The Permanent Representative of the United States invited representatives of selected countries to a luncheon at her home and Hanny Megally went there to brief them. We do not think that even at the basic level that that is at all compatible with the objectivity and the detachment that one would expect from an officer of the United Nations system. The Hon. R. Sampanthan said that we have been a member of the United Nations system, in fact, from 1952. That is why we have every reason to expect integrity and impartiality of treatment. Countries big and small, powerful and not so powerful are all equal in the eyes of the United Nations and we reject this kind of behaviour as thoroughly unacceptable. So, these are the reasons why we think that the system is going wrong. Can anyone defend these actions?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) There is nothing wrong. - [Interruption.] () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, with regard to the Darusman Report - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) With the TNA, there is something wrong inside. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) No. Everything is perfect with the TNA, we will not - [Interruption.] Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, on this subject of the intergovernmental process, the fact is, the Darusman Report did not emerge from an intergovernmental process. That is a fact.

107 108

[ () .. ]

2013 21

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) But, the contents - [Interruption.]

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Now, if that is so, Sir, that carries consequences. We were repeatedly assured by the Secretary-General of the UN system, he said this personally to His Excellency the President and to me: I am appointing a panel to make myself familiar with the facts, people whom I have confidence in. I want them to examine these facts and advise me". That is, to advise him. Of course, he has a right to do that and nobody can object to that. All of us in positions of executive authority rely on advice and we appoint people in whose competence and experience we have confidence. So, he did that. But, that does not make it an official document of the UN system. There is very clearly a distinction between consequences that flow from official documents and from documents that are prepared in the manner and according to the procedures that were applicable to the Darusman Report.

Now, I want to say, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, as far as Sri Lankas relationship with the United States is concerned, it is a multifaceted relationship and there is so much that is positive in that relationship, which I want to specifically mention in this House today, for example, cooperation in the field of higher education. The United States is actually expanding the contours of their cooperation with regard to the Fulbright Scholarship Programme and many Sri Lankans of ability are benefiting from that because they have the opportunity to read for Postgraduate Degrees in Ivy League Universities in the United States of America. We also have excellent cooperation in the defence field. The United States has sent people, for example, to participate in the Galle Dialogue which I have addressed on many occasions. It is quite wrong to think that the United States is cutting down on aid to this country. That is not the case at all. I wonder whether the Hon. R. Sampanthan is aware that at the moment we are working on a major water project - the Hali-Ela Project - which is worth approximately US Dollars 70 million. That is public investment by the United States of America. So, there is much that is positive and encouraging about the relationship and nobody must think that there is great rancour or acrimony between the United States of America and Sri Lanka. Just the other day, less than one month ago, when I was invited to a function of the American Chamber of Commerce, I was happy to accept that and Her Excellency Michele J. Sison, the Ambassador of the United States and I, addressed the American Chamber together.

American business is vigorous and active in this country. They have close linkages with entrepreneurs in our own country and we must not forget the overall

dimensions of this relationship. We must, however, also remember that the Hon. R. Sampanthan said that the LTTE is no more. They are no more; they are militarily defeated. That does not mean that the international challenge is over. That is something that we must constantly bear in mind.

Now, let us take for example, matters pertaining to Canada. I have given this some thought and I have decided to say on the Floor of the House what I am about to say. This is because we have the extraordinary situation, certainly unprecedented in my own experience, of one friendly country describing another friendly country as Evil. That is a strong word to use and this comes from none other than the Foreign Minister of Canada, the Hon. John Baird. The Hon. John Baird, Foreign Minister of Canada used this word with regard to my country; he described my country as Evil. Now, I want to tell this House, Sir, about the motivation underpinning this extraordinary behaviour. International relations are not conducted with rancour. Vituperative, abusive and aggressive language is not part of international parlance. Why then, this extraordinary phenomenon?

We have here, reports from "The Globe and Mail"; that is a Canadian newspaper. There was a situation in which a Cabinet Minister of the Government of Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, had some very harsh criticisms to make of the relationship between the Canadian Government and a gentleman called Mr. Paranjothy, who had very close connections with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. That is a matter of record; it is verifiable, it is capable of proof. The Hon. Peter Kent, a Member of the Cabinet of Stephen Harper strongly protested. He used the word outrageous; this is not a Minister of the Government of Sri Lanka; this is a Canadian Minister; he described as "outrageous", a television programme that Mr. Paranjothy played host to, which honoured Tamil Tiger heroes and freedom fighters. So, you have a Canadian Minister going public and saying this is "outrageous. The Minister is criticizing his own Government. This is what Minister Peter Kent said in Canada, "It was a tribute, and it is unacceptable even if he did not write it, even if he did not believe it". It is a tribute to the Tamil Tigers. So, you have this strong condemnation from a Member of the Canadian Cabinet. What happened next? The Prime Minister forced him to retract that statement. He had to eat humble pie; he had to eat his own words and he had to do it publicly. So, these are facts that must be known by people. Why is it that Canada adopting this attitude? The Canadian newspaper went on to say that Mr. Paranjothy shortened his first name to Gavan from Ragavan just for the election and removed all mention of his Tamil background.

So, those are the true explanations of what is happening and why this country is being pursued relentlessly and castigated in this totally inappropriate

109 110

way in statements which are made about my country by representatives of the Government of Canada. That is why I want to tell the Hon. Sampanthan that the mere fact the LTTE is physically no longer present here is no reason for complacency. There are forces that work against which the Government of this country is duty-bound to protect this land and its people.

Sir, what did Canada do next? In Perth, Western Australia, at the meeting of Foreign Ministers which I attended in October 2011, under "Any Other Business" - the final item on the agenda - the Hon John Baird raised a question of Sri Lanka and objected to CHOGM 2013 being held in Sri Lanka. I strongly protested. At that time, Kevin Rudd, the Foreign Minister of Australia was presiding. So, addressing the Chair, I said, If any Foreign Minister here present wishes to have any conversation with me about Sri Lankan situations, they will find me totally forthcoming; with total candour I will respond to them. I have nothing to hide but I vehemently object to my country being put on the Agenda in this Forum because that is not at all consistent with the spirit and the character of the Commonwealth. What happened next is a truly humbling and inspiring experience which I will never forget as long as I live. Fifteen countries, one after the other, unsolicited, took the floor. Countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America took the floor, one by one, to declare their emphatic support for my position saying that they would under no circumstances countenance the inclusion of Sri Lanka in that Agenda. I then asked the Hon. Kevin Rudd what he proposed to do. He said, What is there for me to decide? The consensus around this table is so clear. That is the end of the matter". It was simply taken off the table. But, Canada did not give up; Canada did not give up, not by any means.

The next attempt was made on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September, 2012. Again, at the meeting of Commonwealth Foreign Ministers, they made the same attempt to be firmly rebuffed in the same manner. The final attempt was made at the meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group which was held in London on the 26th of April, this year. Canada had asked for an extraordinary meeting on Sri Lanka. Nobody supported it. Canada made that demand in the course of a teleconference. Then, they brought up the subject again at the meeting of CMAG - the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group - on the 26th of April and did not have any support at all. So, that again was rejected and that is the situation in which Sri Lanka is making meticulous preparations to host a very positive and successful event in the middle of November this year.

In fact, I would like to tell the Hon. Sampanthan, that some countries from the developing world, African countries in particular, said, This will not do at all. Kindly remember that there are 54 countries in the Commonwealth and leadership of the Commonwealth

must sometimes come to the developing world. It cannot be monopolized by others. Strong voices were raised in support of Sri Lanka and Sri Lankas leadership of the Commonwealth for the next two years. This is not simply a matter of a physical event that will take place within the shores of the Island. It has far greater significance because this country will lead the Commonwealth for two years commencing November 2013 and His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa will be heading that organization during that period. So, this is what some people cannot stomach and that is the stark reality of the matter.

Now, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - I am not running away from the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella. I will come to his questions in due course - said some interesting things about the Commonwealth Charter and the values underpinning the Commonwealth. Now, among these values - the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera is not here; I made a note all what he said - he referred to certain principles which were axiomatic in the context of the Commonwealth.

What he did not mention was two things. One is that the Commonwealth is a celebration of diversity; it is not one culture. That was so when the white dominions constituted the sole representatives of the Commonwealth in the time of the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster of 1931. But, we have now moved a long way. It accommodates within its ambit a whole diversity of cultures and cultural traditions. That is the strength of the Commonwealth.

The other very important principle is that no country in the Commonwealth can sit in judgement over another country. That condescending attitude is totally inconsistent with the basic values of the Commonwealth. That is demonstrated by events which took place during the last year. In Perth, Western Australia, when Heads of Government of the Commonwealth and Foreign Ministers met, there was a strong attempt made by three or four countries to introduce the office of Commonwealth Commissioner for Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law. Some countries wanted to establish such an office of Commissioner. It was totally shot down by the Commonwealth. Only four or five countries supported that proposal. Everybody else was firmly and implacably against it. The Foreign Minister of one African country raised his voice and said, We do not want an international policeman looking over our shoulder. Other countries asked, Who is going to pay for this? Are you proposing to cut back on schemes that are intended to support rural populations, gender equality, access to health and education and cataract operations? Are you going to cut back on these schemes in order to support the office of a Commissioner for Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law? That kind of executive authority is alien to the ethos of the Commonwealth. That proposal was shot down even before it was presented; nobody wanted it.

So, these are some of the guiding principles of the Commonwealth. People who say that the Commonwealth must become relevant to contemporary needs must remember that, of course, the Commonwealth, like all other organizations, must move with the times, but its character cannot be fundamentally distorted. If that is done, far from the Commonwealth being invigorated and re-energized, it will disintegrate and its whole future will be in jeopardy if we embark on that course of action. And that is why the overwhelming majority of Members of the Commonwealth strongly rejected any initiatives directed towards that end.

It is a matter for deep regret that the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera chose to insult the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth. We, in politics, are used to the rough and tumble of it. Politics is not a tea party. Abuse, brickbats are very much a part of it. Any practising politician must be prepared to accept bouquets as well as brickbats. Nobody who is disinclined to accept the most flagrant abuse founded upon no basis whatsoever can possibly stay in politics. This does not, however, apply to an international civil servant of the highest integrity and stature and His Excellency Kamalesh Sharma belongs to that category. That is not a partisan statement; it is the proper attitude to the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth of Nations. Therefore, to use phrases like blue-eyed boy, I think, is unworthy, not only of the Member but of this Parliament and that is the thing that I regret most about this Debate.

That is a matter about which I feel deeply and profoundly sorry. What else has His Excellency Kamalesh Sharma done wrong?

Sir, you are aware that at their Meeting in Perth, Western Australia in October, 2011, the Commonwealth Heads of Government decided to expand the role of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group. Their scope was earlier confined only to situations where there had been an unlawful overthrow of a constitutionally established government. But, the Commonwealth Heads of Government expanded that to cover situations involving what they described as "serious and persistent violations of Commonwealth Principles". However, they spelt out in great detail Rules of Procedure which have to be observed in exercising that authority. One of those Rules of Procedure has to do with the good offices role of the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth. If any problem arises, the first thing to be done is that the Secretary-General must engage with the country in question and as long as that good offices role is going forward, there is no role that is ascribed to the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group. His Excellency Kamalesh Sharma visited this country on two occasions in the recent past. He came here in September, 2012 and in March, 2013. In an annex to his report, he set out five different areas in which, in his judgement, substantial progress had been achieved on the ground in

this country during the period intervening between his visits. Therefore, to insult the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth in that manner is most regrettable and lamentable.

Sir, I have just a couple of other points to make before I conclude. But, of course, I will respond to my Friend, the Hon. Kiriella. I also want to make a brief comment on what the Hon. Sampanthan said about the war. If he examines his own conscience, I would like to ask him this. Unlike the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, I am not taking the liberty of putting questions to somebody as senior as you, Hon. Sampanthan, and asking you to get up and answer. I think that is totally unacceptable and I will not do it. But, I am just posing this for your own consideration. Had it not been for the war and the outcome of it, would you be able to behave in this way, to speak and act in the way that you are acting now? - [Interruption] No, I am not saying this in a confrontational way. Hon. Member, can you canvass freely? Can you go to people of the North, move around freely, have meetings, engage in political activity without -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) We did that. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) How many of you got killed? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) But, we did that. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Hon. Sampanthan, if we are honest with ourselves, we all want to remain alive and that includes you, with all respect. We, all of us, have a fundamental instinct to live. If we think that we are going to be blown to pieces tomorrow morning, surely, that affects our pattern of behaviour unless we belong to a very exceptional category of human beings, which a very few - [Interruption.]

Sir, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera said that this Government is on probation. It certainly is not on probation at the hands of the international community. - [Interruption.] This, I want to say, Sir - [Interruption.]

With all emphasis, Sir, I want to say this. - [Interruption.] This Government will submit only to the judgement of our own people. It is our people who can determine the destiny of this country. It is our people and nobody else who will be arbiters of the future of this Government. -

113 114

[Interruption.] I totally reject the contention that this Government is on probation in any manner, in any sense, as suggested by the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera.

I will not comment on the historical aspects that were dealt with very extensively by the Hon. R. Sampanthan. I remember, when he did this on a previous occasion on the Floor of this House, I made this response. Yes, history is important. It is very difficult to understand the present without considering the past. But, it is also a mistake to dwell on the past and it is necessary to move on in life. I think the focus at this critical juncture in the history of our country should be on the present and on the future.

I now come to the much-awaited moment when I respond to my Friend, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella.

The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella asked me about the Northern Provincial Council Election. There is no mystery about it at all. We have said that it will be held. It is a situation where you will not take yes for an answer. So, this has been repeatedly stated; the Government has categorically announced that there will be an election held there.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) When? () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) The date has been mentioned. It is in September. Hon. Member, that has been stated so many times by the President of the country. So, why do you not -

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) That was said even in 2011.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) It has been categorically stated that there will be an election in the Northern Province in September this year.

The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella asked about the Thirteenth Amendment. He said that there is a variety of views. Sir, that is a sign of health, vigour and vitality. In a coalition administration, there will be a diversity of views. It is not a straitjacket to which everybody must conform. The constituent parties of the Alliance have their own perceptions, perspectives and their priorities. I would regard that as something entirely beneficial and positive about the political culture to which this Government subscribes. So, there are several views.

The view at one end of the spectrum is that the Thirteenth Amendment should be abolished. There are Members of the Government who have expressed that view. At the other end of the spectrum, there are Members of the Government who have expressed the view that the Thirteenth Amendment far from being abolished should be strengthened. That view has been expressed by Cabinet Ministers. Then, there is a third view which is the via media and that is the middle view.

Some other people have said, "No, it should not be abolished but it should be changed" because it was hastily drafted it has many deficiencies and shortcomings, and those should be addressed in earnest. So, that is the third view. You cannot object sensibly and reasonably to a dialogue on these issues. So, that is where we are. That is a candid answer to your question. Why should you think that your questions are so difficult to answer? I find them exceedingly easy to answer.

The last question that you put to me was about my conversation with the Hon. Salman Khurshid, the Minister of External Affairs of the Republic of India. Yes, of course, there is no mystery about it. He asked to speak to me; I readily agreed and we had a very pleasant telephone conversation. It was nothing like what it was represented to be. It was an exceedingly friendly conversation. The Hon. Salman Khurshid is a very genial personality; there were no threats. His tone was not at all aggressive, and much of what has appeared in media is wholly fictitious. That is not the tenor and the substance of the conversation that took place. Hon. Kiriella, the whole point of a conversation between two Foreign Ministers is that Ministers must be able to speak to each other in confidence and spontaneously. This is not the first conversation that took place between me and the External Affairs Minister of India. I have had several telephone conversations even with his predecessor in office, His Excellency S.M. Krishna, at the height of the problem connected with the fishermen when there was a great deal of tension. The subject matter was so inflammatory, but we had useful conversations on that subject - Hon. Krishna and myself. So, one does not react to media reports about purported conversations between Foreign Ministers. If you do that and if you get into controversies in the media about what you discussed with a colleague from another government, then communication will no longer be effective. But, those channels of communications are vital for the solution of problems. So, that is my answer to the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella. I assure him that what has appeared in the media does not in any way do justice to the substance of the conversation that took place between His Excellency Salman Khurshid and myself.

Sir, I have taken a long time but that is out of respect for Members of the Opposition in particular who expressed their views on this matter. I think the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella did me an injustice when he demanded an answer immediately because of the fear that I would run away. I have not run away; I have answered his questions candidly and in a forthright manner. So, it only remains for me to thank Members on both sides of the House who contributed their insights and their wisdom to enrich this Debate, and I would like to conclude my remarks with one passionately, in particular to the Hon. R. Sampanthan, who I think has a unique opportunity in the history of this country.

Let us shake ourselves free of this notion that it is the international community that is going to frighten us, intimidate us and impose a solution on us. I tell the Hon. R. Sampanthan on the Floor of this House that that will never happen. The international community is neither disposed nor able to impose a substantive solution on the Government and the people of Sri Lanka. That is a futile illusion. Let us resolve these problems within our shores. There is no other way and in that spirit, taking into account all the views that were expressed in the course of a lengthy and fruitful Debate, I urge my Friend to adopt a

constructive attitude and to engage with us in a dialogue which will hopefully throw up solutions to this problem.

I thank you, Sir. , . . Question put, and agreed to. . . 6.35, 2013 22 . . 1.00 .
