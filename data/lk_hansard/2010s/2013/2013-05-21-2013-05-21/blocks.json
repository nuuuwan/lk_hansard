The judgment of the Supreme Court in regard to that Bill was tabled in Parliament on the 5th of June. The Second Reading commenced on the 17th of June. It continued on the 19th of June. I have with me here a copy of the Bill and copies of the relevant Hansards. What happened after the 19th of June? You abandoned the Bill. The Bill was not proceeded with. Why did you abandon the Bill? The Bill was brought to this House to enact legislation to ensure the safety of victims and witnesses, to ensure the protection of victims and witnesses. The Bill was brought to this House under pressure from the International Independent Eminent Group of Persons who had been invited to this country and appointed by the Government to overlook the work of the Commission that was inquiring into very serious human rights violations like the massacre of the five students in Trincomalee and 17 aid workers in Mutur. Of course, they eventually withdrew from the country. Having endeavoured to make their best contribution, they stated in a public interview that they gave before they left the country that there was no commitment on the part of the Sri Lankan Government, no will on the part of the Sri Lankan Government to investigate grave violations of human rights in keeping with international norms and standards. What happened in the course of that inquiry that was conducted by the Commission appointed by the Government? The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons wanted evidence to be led before the Commission by an independent counsel. Persons who were representing the Sri Lankan Government in regard to human rights violations before the Human Rights Council in Geneva were the same persons who were leading evidence on behalf of the victims before the Commission of Inquiry. The International Independent Eminent Group of Persons stated the view that there was a clear conflict of interest when the same lawyers handled both these contradictory positions leading evidence on behalf of the victims on the one hand and defending the Government and its armed forces on the other hand by the same people before the Human Rights Council in",

This view holds the position that while the war was conducted so as to destroy the LTTE, which was waging an armed struggle against the Sri Lankan State in the name of the Tamil people, at the same time, yet another objective of the war was suppressing and subjugating the Tamil people and thereby negating the need for a political solution. This is a question to which an answer should be forthcoming, and it can come only from the Government. The answer should be in the form of credible and tangible action that demonstrates the Governments commitment to a just and acceptable political solution.",

The resulting position was that while the Sinhala people had an effective say in their governance, the Tamil people did not have any say in their governance in keeping with their democratic verdicts. In fact, it could be said that the anti-Tamil pogroms over the decades, were related to the political demands of the Tamil people. For about three decades since independence, the political struggle of the Tamil people was non-violent and peaceful. During this period there was every opportunity for the conflict to be amicably and peacefully resolved. Despite Tamil political leadership strengthened by democratic mandates from the Tamil people extending its hand of friendship and cooperation, this was not achieved. During this period of around three decades only the Tamil people were victims of violence.

Both the 1972 and 1978 Constitutions framed after independence, lacked a Tamil consensus and were instrumental in character being enacted by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the United National Party respectively to further their political ambitions. Such a Constitution based on consensus is basic to the progress and prosperity of a country and its people. Countries with such Constitutions despite difficulties, have acquired respectability, stability, progress and prosperity. Sri Lanka during their major part of its post independence history had been embroiled in internecine conflict, which in the past three decades have been violent, and has inflicted immense harm on the country. Our experiences in the past several decades, should make us all realize that in order to ensure that there is no repetition of the bitter and acrimonious experiences of the past, we resolve to put this era behind us and commence a new era based on hope and justice. The evolution of an acceptable Constitutional arrangement based upon consensus which is inclusive in character and accommodates the legitimate political aspirations of all its peoples, its multiethnic polity, is fundamental to the achievement of an honourable peace with dignity and justice. Democratic rights, Fundamental rights and Powers of Governance, need to be restructured in such a manner that would be acceptable to and find substantial consensus amongst Sri Lankas multiethnic, multicultural, multilingual and pluralist society that constitutes Sri Lanka.",

    "text": "It must be understood that inclusiveness, tolerance, pluralism, egalitarianism and justice are the hallmarks of a truly democratic society. This is not to state that the wishes of the majority of the people are irrelevant, but it certainly means that the wishes of the majority of the people must be guided by these fundamental elements, and that the political leadership should have the wisdom to guide the people in this regard. Great democracies the world over have acquired unity in diversity, respectability, stability and prosperity by adopting this spirit. A State, which does not accept these principles, cannot be regarded as a truly democratic State. In todays context, Sri Lankas democratic credentials do not stand the test of scrutiny. The Sri Lankan State regrettably stands out as a majoritarian State, which does not uphold the rule of law, particularly in regard to the minority peoples, that excludes legitimate minority rights and concerns, disregards the democratic verdicts of the Tamil people, and is strongly influenced in its governance, by sectarian nationalist thinking. This must change, and this is yet another lesson that must be learnt, if there is to be voluntary and genuine reconciliation, peace and harmony. A State, which claims to be democratic, but which distorts democracy, and practises majoritarian authoritarianism, will inexorably traverse the path of self destruction. To be truly democratic, is a lesson that a Sri Lankan State needs to learn early.",

Minister; I am asking the Government, if the Government is sincere about the assurances you seem to have given the Secretary-General and the Commonwealth, you could now display the same amount of enthusiasm as you did when you brought that horrendous, notorious Amendment to Parliament on the 18th of September, 2010. You brought it without any debate as an Urgent Bill in 24 hours. It was not presented for discussion. But now, if you are serious about having an Independent Election Commission, an Independent Judicial Commission, an Independent Government Service Commission et cetera, you can do it again within 24 hours. You do not need time for that. In fact, I would say, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, that the restoration of Independent Commissions prior to the Northern Provincial Council polls should be a sine qua non for CHOGM to be held in Colombo. I repeat. The repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment before the elections in the North are held should be a sine qua non if CHOGM is to be held in Colombo in November, this year. That is very important. They cannot run away from it.",

Sampanthan is that this Resolution passed in Geneva is a good and proper Resolution; it embodies the truth; it is something that should be accepted without question and the principles contained in that Resolution should govern our conduct in the future.

This Resolution was not proposed for the first time by the United States of America. That was not the case. It was originally brought by another country. It was brought by Canada. Canada actually submitted a draft Resolution in Geneva. So, the initiative came, not from the United States of America, but from Canada. This happened in September, 2011 when His Excellency the President and I were in New York attending the Sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. When we were in New York, we were informed by our Permanent Representative in Geneva that this Resolution had been submitted to the Human Rights Council by Canada and a text of the Resolution was sent to us. Canada made a strong effort to garner support for this Resolution. That ended in dismal failure. What happened next was that the Foreign Minister of Canada, the Hon. John Baird, sought a meeting with me in New York and we had a bilateral meeting. We discussed issues. At that meeting, the Canadian Foreign Minister informed me that Canada was not proceeding with this Resolution on that occasion and he was sufficiently candid and forthright to give me the reason for that decision by the Government of Canada. The reason was that they did not have support. The Hon. Sampanthan would have us believe that the outcome of that Resolution has nothing to do with the mover. The influence, the clout of the mover is totally irrelevant, according to the Hon. Sampanthan.",

Canada proposed it and told me that they did not have the support for it. So, Mr. Presiding Member, what made the difference was the mover; who is it that was moving the Resolution? What Canada could not do, the United States took over. The United States then took over the burden. It is quite idle and entirely disingenuous to suggest that the attitudes of countries had nothing to do with the economic, military and strategic influence of the United States. I myself travelled very extensively, not this year but last year, in March 2012, I visited a large number of African countries and I met, in some cases, the Presidents of those countries; in other cases, the Prime Ministers or at least the Foreign Ministers of those countries. They spoke to me. I know what was happening in those Capitals. I go there, I have a meeting, I present my point of view and then I come home. The United States has an Embassy in each of those Capitals and I am aware of the intensity of the pressure that was exerted on those governments. They have shared that with us that they are under this pressure.",

    "text": "The Hon. Sampanthan gave some figures, which I think related to direct aid. I do not know about those figures, I have not seen them. But, on the assumption that those figures are correct - I accept the Hon. Sampanthan's figures, I am not disputing them - I would say that is totally a misleading picture. I mean, you cannot gauge the influence of the United States on those countries by simply looking at the bare figures relating to direct aid. Influence takes a variety of forms as my Friend is very well aware. So, many countries did have a very substantial difficulty in saying, No to the United States. They have said so specifically to me. It would be totally improper on my part, on the Floor of this House, to name countries but in the course of a candid dialogue they have told me that this was their problem. Surely, that is not surprising. The Hon. R. Sampanthan is well aware that international relations are not founded upon unlimited altruism. These are not the responses or the perspectives of Arhats. Foreign policy is all about enlightened self-interests. These countries are trying to protect and nurture their own interests understandably. It is not their job to make a very clinical, objective and dispassionate appraisal of the situation. That is not how decisions are made with regard to the patterns of voting in Geneva. So, that is the reality of the situation and I do not think we should try to dress it up and give it a complexion that it simply does not have. Also, what happened in Geneva has many unusual features. I do not know whether the Hon. Sampanthan is aware - I think he probably is - that the United States came into the Human Rights Council in 2009 and this was the first occasion on which they proposed or even supported a country-specific resolution of this kind. As he is well aware, the United States previously was one of the harshest critics of the Human Rights Council. But, they did not, prior to the Resolution with regard to Sri Lanka, bring country-specific resolutions and many other countries which voted for the US Resolution are on record as saying that they are, in principle, opposed to country-specific resolutions. That is on record. Countries have said that that is their policy.",

The Hon. Sampanthan made great play with trade relations and he said that many of the countries supporting the United States' Resolutions were countries which had significant trade links with our country. But then, he does not again mention another obvious fact and it is this: that any given time there would be more than 10 countries belonging to the European Union that would be members of the Human Rights Council. Those countries, as he is well aware, cannot make an independent decision on how they are going to vote. They cannot because that is a subject that is delegated to the Commission in Brussels. So, once the hierarchy in Brussels makes a decision, all the countries of the European Union, 27 of them, are bound by that.",

We wrote to the Commissioner 11 months before the Resolution was adopted in Geneva, inviting her to come to this country to rely on the evidence of her own eyes and to see for herself the progress that was being achieved on the ground. She said she will come but that she would like her visit to be preceded by a visit by a technical team from her office. I readily agreed to that. In fact, that is normal practice. So, that is how we received in this country Hanny Megally, one of her officers who was accompanied by two or three other officials of the Commissioner. We have in our Ministry, a letter from the Commissioner expressing appreciation of the assistance which we gave her officer at every point.",

The first thing that happened was that he went to the residence of the United States Permanent Representative to brief selected invitees. The Permanent Representative of the United States invited representatives of selected countries to a luncheon at her home and Hanny Megally went there to brief them. We do not think that even at the basic level that that is at all compatible with the objectivity and the detachment that one would expect from an officer of the United Nations system. The Hon. R. Sampanthan said that we have been a member of the United Nations system, in fact, from 1952. That is why we have every reason to expect integrity and impartiality of treatment. Countries big and small, powerful and not so powerful are all equal in the eyes of the United Nations and we reject this kind of behaviour as thoroughly unacceptable. So, these are the reasons why we think that the system is going wrong. Can anyone defend these actions?",

The United States is actually expanding the contours of their cooperation with regard to the Fulbright Scholarship Programme and many Sri Lankans of ability are benefiting from that because they have the opportunity to read for Postgraduate Degrees in Ivy League Universities in the United States of America. We also have excellent cooperation in the defence field. The United States has sent people, for example, to participate in the Galle Dialogue which I have addressed on many occasions. It is quite wrong to think that the United States is cutting down on aid to this country. That is not the case at all. I wonder whether the Hon. R. Sampanthan is aware that at the moment we are working on a major water project - the Hali-Ela Project - which is worth approximately US Dollars 70 million. That is public investment by the United States of America. So, there is much that is positive and encouraging about the relationship and nobody must think that there is great rancour or acrimony between the United States of America and Sri Lanka. Just the other day, less than one month ago, when I was invited to a function of the American Chamber of Commerce, I was happy to accept that and Her Excellency Michele J.

There was a situation in which a Cabinet Minister of the Government of Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, had some very harsh criticisms to make of the relationship between the Canadian Government and a gentleman called Mr. Paranjothy, who had very close connections with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. That is a matter of record; it is verifiable, it is capable of proof. The Hon. Peter Kent, a Member of the Cabinet of Stephen Harper strongly protested. He used the word outrageous; this is not a Minister of the Government of Sri Lanka; this is a Canadian Minister; he described as \"outrageous\", a television programme that Mr. Paranjothy played host to, which honoured Tamil Tiger heroes and freedom fighters. So, you have a Canadian Minister going public and saying this is \"outrageous. The Minister is criticizing his own Government. This is what Minister Peter Kent said in Canada, \"It was a tribute, and it is unacceptable even if he did not write it, even if he did not believe it\". It is a tribute to the Tamil Tigers. So, you have this strong condemnation from a Member of the Canadian Cabinet. What happened next? The Prime Minister forced him to retract that statement. He had to eat humble pie; he had to eat his own words and he had to do it publicly. So, these are facts that must be known by people. Why is it that Canada adopting this attitude? The Canadian newspaper went on to say that Mr. Paranjothy shortened his first name to Gavan from Ragavan just for the election and removed all mention of his Tamil background.",

I strongly protested. At that time, Kevin Rudd, the Foreign Minister of Australia was presiding. So, addressing the Chair, I said, If any Foreign Minister here present wishes to have any conversation with me about Sri Lankan situations, they will find me totally forthcoming; with total candour I will respond to them. I have nothing to hide but I vehemently object to my country being put on the Agenda in this Forum because that is not at all consistent with the spirit and the character of the Commonwealth. What happened next is a truly humbling and inspiring experience which I will never forget as long as I live. Fifteen countries, one after the other, unsolicited, took the floor. Countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America took the floor, one by one, to declare their emphatic support for my position saying that they would under no circumstances countenance the inclusion of Sri Lanka in that Agenda. I then asked the Hon. Kevin Rudd what he proposed to do. He said, What is there for me to decide? The consensus around this table is so clear. That is the end of the matter\".

Everybody else was firmly and implacably against it. The Foreign Minister of one African country raised his voice and said, We do not want an international policeman looking over our shoulder. Other countries asked, Who is going to pay for this?

If that is done, far from the Commonwealth being invigorated and re-energized, it will disintegrate and its whole future will be in jeopardy if we embark on that course of action.

Nobody who is disinclined to accept the most flagrant abuse founded upon no basis whatsoever can possibly stay in politics. This does not, however, apply to an international civil servant of the highest integrity and stature and His Excellency Kamalesh Sharma belongs to that category. That is not a partisan statement; it is the proper attitude to the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth of Nations.

Their scope was earlier confined only to situations where there had been an unlawful overthrow of a constitutionally established government. But, the Commonwealth Heads of Government expanded that to cover situations involving what they described as \"serious and persistent violations of Commonwealth Principles\". However, they spelt out in great detail Rules of Procedure which have to be observed in exercising that authority. One of those Rules of Procedure has to do with the good offices role of the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth. If any problem arises, the first thing to be done is that the Secretary-General must engage with the country in question and as long as that good offices role is going forward, there is no role that is ascribed to the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group. His Excellency Kamalesh Sharma visited this country on two occasions in the recent past. He came here in September, 2012 and in March, 2013. In an annex to his report, he set out five different areas in which, in his judgement, substantial progress had been achieved on the ground in",

So, that is the third view. You cannot object sensibly and reasonably to a dialogue on these issues. So, that is where we are. That is a candid answer to your question. Why should you think that your questions are so difficult to answer? I find them exceedingly easy to answer.",

    "text": "The last question that you put to me was about my conversation with the Hon. Salman Khurshid, the Minister of External Affairs of the Republic of India. Yes, of course, there is no mystery about it. He asked to speak to me; I readily agreed and we had a very pleasant telephone conversation. It was nothing like what it was represented to be. It was an exceedingly friendly conversation. The Hon. Salman Khurshid is a very genial personality; there were no threats. His tone was not at all aggressive, and much of what has appeared in media is wholly fictitious. That is not the tenor and the substance of the conversation that took place. Hon. Kiriella, the whole point of a conversation between two Foreign Ministers is that Ministers must be able to speak to each other in confidence and spontaneously. This is not the first conversation that took place between me and the External Affairs Minister of India. I have had several telephone conversations even with his predecessor in office, His Excellency S.M. Krishna, at the height of the problem connected with the fishermen when there was a great deal of tension. The subject matter was so inflammatory, but we had useful conversations on that subject - Hon. Krishna and myself. So, one does not react to media reports about purported conversations between Foreign Ministers. If you do that and if you get into controversies in the media about what you discussed with a colleague from another government, then communication will no longer be effective. But, those channels of communications are vital for the solution of problems. So, that is my answer to the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella. I assure him that what has appeared in the media does not in any way do justice to the substance of the conversation that took place between His Excellency Salman Khurshid and myself.",

Lakshman Kiriella did me an injustice when he demanded an answer immediately because of the fear that I would run away. I have not run away; I have answered his questions candidly and in a forthright manner. So, it only remains for me to thank Members on both sides of the House who contributed their insights and their wisdom to enrich this Debate, and I would like to conclude my remarks with one passionately, in particular to the Hon. R. Sampanthan, who I think has a unique opportunity in the history of this country.",
