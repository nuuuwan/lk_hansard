2013 20

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition? ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, the Hon. Minister mentioned about the plan of the then UNP Government and what I had done as the Leader of the Opposition. I would just clarify the facts. We had a plan to expand the Katunayake Airport. Therefore, the Sri Lanka Air Force had to be shifted out from there. They chose Kuda Oya, which was about 11 miles away. Certainly, an airstrip was to be built for the Sri Lanka Air Force along with a second airstrip. Then, we were going to have the control tower. But, the rest of it were going to be big aircraft-hanger type buildings. . , hundreds of millions of rupees - - had been spent on terminals and all that. It is Rs. 40 billion.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) So, what? ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) That was never there in our plan. - [Interruption.] , . - [ ] Wait, wait. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) . , - Can you account for that Rs. 40 billion? What happened to it? You did not require Rs. 40 billion for the terminals. Someone had played it out. - [Interruption.] . Certainly, building the airstrip was okay. You have taken it to Mattala and I do not have a problem with that.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Good. Now, you have admitted that. Please tell that to your golayas.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) You have built the airstrip. We have no issue on that. - [Interruption.] Wait.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You all can have an Adjournment Debate on this. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes, they can have an Adjournment Debate on this, Sir.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The question has been answered. Thank you very much. We are running out of time.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) But, we cannot agree on spending Rs. 40 billion for the terminal buildings. That is what the Hon. Member has been saying.

( ) (The Hon. Piyankara Jayaratne) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Piyankara Jayaratne) , . , .

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is the point of Order, Hon. Member? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I have a question: where is the oil tank?

: : PRIVILEGE : HARASSMENT AND INTIMIDATION

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, as a Member of Parliament I consider it my bounden duty to take up issues that concern the people, especially my constituents in the Colombo District which I represent. I have had occasion to take such matters up both in and out of Parliament. I have also in my capacity as an Attorney-at-Law appeared for my constituents in various courts.

In the recent past, I have become the subject of various forms of harassment and intimidation and false complaints which, I believe, are done with a view to preventing me from taking these matters up and defaming me.

One such incident is an attempt of harassment on my way to Kandy. On this occasion, when I was proceeding after Parliament Sessions to Kandy in my vehicle, a police officer stopped me for no reason whatsoever. After inquiring for my name, he left. I then proceeded on my way and that police officer again came and crossed my vehicle and questioned me and my security officer from the MSD and sought to confiscate his identity card. I told the officer that he had no right to confiscate my security officers identity card and that if I had committed a traffic offence, he could take my driving licence. Simultaneously I phoned the Inspector-General of Police and then this police officer hastily retreated.

Another such incident was the false complaint made by one Shamlan Mohammed Sainoor (Shamras Yehiyah) who is a party to one of the cases for which I am appearing, namely, SC (FR) 496/2012. On the basis of this false complaint, the police are seeking to obtain my call dialogue details.

These are subtle means of preventing me from performing my duties as a Member of Parliament and, to that extent, would be a breach of my Privileges.

In the circumstances, I request you to inquire into these matters and take such action as you deem appropriate.

Thank you. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) This matter will be referred to the Hon. Speaker and an appropriate decision will be taken.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I am sorry, Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, that is not a point of Order. Hon. Minister, you may carry on.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Sir, it is very clear that this is Government Business. It maybe that after discussions, we have reduced a certain part of it which we have to do really in the Committee Stage. If we abandon this now, we cannot even remove that. So, I would like to place this before the House; we will take up the amendments in the Committee Stage. I want to emphasize that this Bill is not under challenge at all. The fact that it is not under challenge means that we can discuss it in this House. If somebody else felt that the provisions of this Bill would impinge on the provisions of something else, then they would have gone to courts and pointed that out. So, it is clear as that.

So, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would like to rest the case there. This is Government Business. We want this Bill passed. We do not anticipate any subsequent difficulties. At present, there is only a challenge. We do not know what the findings or what the determination of the courts would be. How can some Members of the House anticipate the findings or the determination of the court and tell us that we should desist from proceeding on this matter? We are supreme. So, we can take that decision. If an adverse decision is made about the other matter - we do not even know whether it is being challenged on that particular ground - then, we can take measures at that time.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) , . . , . . ? , , . .

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, the Judiciary is not going to follow the Parliament's decision. It is independent.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Sir, I think these are very amateurish arguments. Firstly, there is no challenge to this Bill. Do you agree on that? There is no challenge to this Bill in the Supreme Court. [Interruption.] Of course, it is not.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) Why not? The decision of this Bill is connected to the other Bill.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) So, we do not know under what it is being challenged. The fact that that particular Bill - [Interruption.] No, no. In that case, somebody would have gone to the Supreme Court and said that this is impinging on the other Bill. There is no such thing. Now, it is up to us to decide whether we have to proceed on it. Sir, you have given a Ruling. If we are to discuss on legal matters, I think we can get better lawyers from the Opposition. We should try to get some better lawyers if that is the question. - [Interruption.] So, we are submitting - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) You are kind of a doctor - [Interruption.]

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Who mentioned about you? You are getting excited. ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) You are a so-called local - [Interruption.] () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Do not get excited. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, do not disturb the Hon. Ministers speech. The next speech is yours. So, you can raise any matter at that time.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) He can answer these things. - [Interruption.] Sir, I am moving the Second Reading of this Bill and then anybody can make his observations regarding the legal aspects and so on. As far as we are concerned, there is no challenge to this. We do not know the particulars under which the other matter has been challenged; we do not know what the final determination will be in respect of that. And, I have great doubts whether the challenge there will have any implications on this. That is a matter that only time will tell. So, as far as the Government is concerned, we want this Bill passed with the amendments. Subsequently, if there are any difficulties, then, we can deal with that matter. There is no law - because we do not have entrenched clauses in our Constitution - to say that it cannot be re-discussed by this House, Sir. That is up to us. There are no entrenched clauses; there is nothing in our Constitution which says that once a law is passed, it cannot be recanvassed. This House is supreme. So, let us work on that basis. The decision whether we should present this or not is left to us because this is Government Business. You can oppose. You can have your point of view. But, finally, it is up to the Government to decide whether they are going to proceed with this Legislation or not.

Thank you. . . Question proposed.

The vessel was leased on Bareboat Charter Agreement for US Dollars 1,000 a day. But, shipping sources say that a vessel of this capacity could be given for at least US Dollars 3,500 - 4,000 a day. Lease was effective from 2011 September".

"...The vessel was detained in Durban, South Africa. Through a trade union intervention, salaries were paid. Still one month's salary has to be paid. Now, the vessel is in Mombasa and if the salaries are not paid by 19th March, the Port will take Control of the vessel and the trade union will take a court order and detain the vessel. If the owner does not settle, the due ship will be auctioned".

Hon. Presiding Member, before I conclude, I want to say this because my name was mentioned by an Hon. Minister yesterday. He said, Krrish Ten, Krrish Five, Krrish 10 per cent or something. I know "10 per cent" was used regarding one Member about a year ago, but that talk is not there anymore and now it maybe 20 or 30 per cent.

I just wanted to find out what Krrish is. Krrish is an investment company which has agreed to set up a project. The total cost is actually US Dollars 500 million. Even US Dollars 1,000 can be brought in without any taxes. Now, this is a vital point. This is supposed to be owned by Mr. Chidambaram. Sir, Krrish is nothing in India; it is a small company, not even known and they have brought in US Dollars 500 million. Mr. Chidambarams son, Karti, is the person who brought that money and we want to know, is this foreign policy?

This is like giving a bribe to Chidambaram to vote for us at the US Resolution. Now, what has happened? Two Sri Lankan priests and so many other people were harassed in India. Now, if you all are objecting to this, why do you not send back all these investors like Tata Group, Krrish Group to India? You are giving them bare lands in Colombo; you are giving them all the facilities including tax concessions for 25 years - no taxes for 10

years and half taxes for another 15 years, a huge amount of money. Yesterday, they mentioned my name and I do not know how my name came into Krrish. I am not the person who brought in Krrish; I know who brought in them. A huge amount of money - US Dollars 500 million - and so many other deals are involved in this project.

Now, this is black money sent through Switzerland by Mr. Chidambaram. Yesterday, even the Hon. Duminda Dissanayake spoke to me and asked what this Krrish issue is and I too wanted to find out. Then, I found out that US Dollars 500 million black money of Mr. Chidambaram, the Finance Minister of India, had been sent to Switzerland and from Switzerland, it had again been sent. This has actually been revealed by the Embassy and they have stated that they would reveal the names. So, if you go into this deal you can see that there are no taxes for them. How can this happen? Do not involve our names into these deals. This is the way that you are going to get India to vote for us. But, make sure that they vote for us. You give a land to set up a project of US Dollars 500 million to Krrish Group, you give a land to Tata Group et cetera and we are objecting to these things. If our priests are harassed in India, send all these people back. Mrs. Sonia Gandhi also made a statement yesterday; they are going to vote against us.

, business ; ; ; . . ; . 20, 30 ; ; ; ; . , I am bringing it to your notice, Sir, that especially Krrish Group and all these Indian companies that the Government was trying to bring in have no taxes but taxes are levied for all the others. If I bring money, the Government will tax me. But, we ask the Government to find out the way they have made these money. Like in Sri Lanka, these investors are also supposed to be politicians in India. They have made a huge amount of money and you have to find out the way they have made these money.

Finally, if they vote against us, you have to make sure that all these Indian companies will be thrown out of Sri Lanka.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. J. Sri Ranga. You have five minutes.
