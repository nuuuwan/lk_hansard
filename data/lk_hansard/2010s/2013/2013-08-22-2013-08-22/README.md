( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I want to draw your attention to Standing Order No. 27(1) which states, I quote:

When an oral answer to a question is required, Mr. Speaker, when the question is reached on the Order Paper, shall call upon the member in whose name the question stands and the member so called shall rise in his place and ask the question by reference to its number on the Order Paper and the reply will then be given by the Prime Minister or the Minister to whom the question is addressed.

The other is about a written answer to a question, which is not relevant here.

Then, Standing Order No. 28(1) states, I quote:

Any Member may put a supplementary question

So, according to Standing Order No. 27(1), it is the Member concerned who can ask the question and Standing Order No. 28(1) gives any Member the right to ask a supplementary question. The asking of questions when a Member is not present is an agreement by parties whereby the Chief Whip or another Member from the party asks the question. [Interruption] Hon. Deputy Speaker, all I am suggesting to you is, if you want to change that procedure, is it not best that the Party Leaders talk about it and then come to an agreement? One or two individual Members of the Government or the Opposition cannot come to an agreement. They quoted the Standing Orders but when I went through the Standing Orders, there is no such Standing Order which states that when a Member is not present, someone else can ask the question. It is not so. We have also established a precedent - [Interruption.] Hon. Azwer, can you sit down? You can reply to me later. We have also established a precedent whereby if the Minister is not present, we allow the Chief Whip to answer. So, all these are precedents and if you want to change it, all I am suggesting is that you talk it over at the Party Leaders' Meeting which will take place in a while and give your Ruling after that. All I am suggesting is that you discuss it at the Party Leaders' Meeting. Then, if you feel that any Member can ask on behalf of a Member not present, at that stage you can give a Ruling and have the answer tabled; otherwise, you need not. All I am suggesting is, Hon. Deputy Speaker, that we take a decision after the Party Leaders' Meeting which will be held in half an hour's time. That is all I am saying. ( ) (The Hon.

Sir, when a question is printed in the Order Paper, it is the property of the House. This has been followed from the time the British Parliamentary system came into being of which only the Hon. Leader of the Opposition is ignorant.

Sir, there is some reason for him to grind against the Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake. That is a different matter. 3 Everyday, we have been asking questions on behalf of others. Nobody has challenged that. Therefore, I would request, Sir -

3 3 3 3 3 333 3 we refer to him as the most lovable Member of Parliament.

He was always smiling. He never had an inkling of anger, dissatisfaction against any Member of this House or his constituency. Like a shadow, the Hon. Ariyapala Walpitagama followed his footsteps. That is why I appreciate him. If you want to become a leader, follow the leader. At once, you cannot jump into the arena and lead the masses. This is one of the best lessons that we learnt from the life of my good Friend, the Hon. Ariyapala Walpitagama. Everybody said, Look here, you are working harder than the Minister himself. He would straightaway reply, No, I am only following the footsteps of the Minister". All the projects through the decentralized budgets and other projects that were implemented by the Hon. M.E.H. Mahroof when he was the Minister of State for Ports and Shipping, were very cleverly executed so that the people of the area were greatly benefited.

He was born on 17th July, 1948 in Kanda Udarata, Gampola. His father was the late W.G. Wilson and his mother was G.M. Wimalawathie. He studied at Dharmasoka College in down South. There is also something significant that comes to my mind. Sir, it is from the Dharmasoka College in Ambalangoda that we got one of the best Deputy Principals, Mr. Wijeratne, to Zahira College. We will be going there in a short while. They are going to commemorate the Founders' Day. He brought about a tremendous amount of influence from the Sinhalese culture to the Muslim culture and helped Zahira College to grow into what it is today, a fully blossomed metropolitan school embracing all communities and giving equal opportunities for educational upliftment. Sir, that is a lesson that we have to learn.

Then, his dear wife was Rani Sudharma Kalupahanage. She was a very successful lady. As pointed out by the Hon. Susantha Punchinilame, Thambalagamuwa area is a very tricky area, where a Sinhalese or a Muslim or a Tamil could become the Chairman. The Hon. Ariyapala Walpitagama stood above all those and won. He was elected the first Chairman of the Thambalagamuwa Village Council and he was also elected to the District Development Council of the Trincomalee District. In 1994, he contested through the United National Party, but could not succeed. He came second in the poll to the Hon. M.E.H. Mahroof. When, the Hon. M.E.H. Mahroof, our great, good soul breathed his last on 28th July, 1997, the Hon. Ariyapala Walpitagama came to this House.

I would like to bring to your notice one more important matter. As I told you, he was always very helpful to us in this House. He held the torch of national mindedness.

He would not waver. He was extremely loyal to his country. That is why, Sir, -

Sir, at this moment, I wish to convey my deepest condolences to the family members and also to the people of the Trincomalee District, particularly, the Mutur Electorate.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is your point of Order, Hon. John Amaratunga?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, it is a very serious allegation that the Hon. Member is making. The document that was produced by the Hon. Member is a forged document alleged to have been signed by his wife. So, let him explain it.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, the Chair can consider it if he is raising it as a Question of Privilege.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, there are two issues.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Let him submit it in the proper way because this is not the proper time to raise it. If he considers that there is a breach of privilege, let him submit it in the proper way.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) There is something more, Sir. Please give me one minute. He produced a false document. That is very serious matter. Misleading the House by producing a forged document is one matter. The other matter is that document should be referred to the CID.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) If you consider so, raise it in the proper way.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes, I know that, Sir. I only request that the document be referred for investigation.
