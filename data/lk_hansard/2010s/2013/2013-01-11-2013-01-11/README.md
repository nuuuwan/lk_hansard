Bandaranayake Wasala Mudiyanse Ralahamilage Shirani Anshumala Bandaranayake being the Chief Justice and thereby being the Chairperson of the Judicial Service Commission, in terms of Article 111D (2) of the Constitution, has abused her powers by ordering the Magistrate (Mrs.) Rangani Gamage to obtain permission of the Judicial Service Commission prior to seeking police protection thereby preventing her from exercising her legal right to obtain legal protection;

By acting in the aforesaid manner,-

(i) whereas it amounts to improper conduct or conduct unbecoming of a person holding the office of the Chief Justice;

(ii) whereas she had been involved in matters that could amount to causes of action or controversial matters,

[2.49 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Mr. Speaker, when we debate this historic Motion today, I venture to say that we have reached the culmination of restless weeks that have convulsed not only the Legislature and the Judiciary but the whole country.

The Supreme Law of the country - the Constitution - has been under severe stress and strain and it will be counter-intuitive if we allow this convulsion, long after

551 552

the dust has settled on the arena, to keep festering and eviscerate the basic structures that have to bolster a healthy democracy.

As one who attempted to broker peace in order to bring to an end the sad spectacle of a constitutional conflict, I speak today disillusioned and forlorn having lost the ability to sanitize the intransigence displayed by the subject matter of this Motion. There was a culpable failure to come to terms with realities of a compromise that I undertook to avert this crisis. Having failed in that bid to balance the divergence to an equilibrium, which I thought it was my duty, to discharge lest I be accused of failure on my part to prevent the polarization, I speak today with objectivity devoid of any bias towards anyone and malice towards none.

Let me be objective in my analysis of the mechanics of the process and how the whole process has played out so far much to our discomfiture. The whole chaos was let loose, in my view, when the Court of Appeal sent up a question for interpretation to the Supreme Court. In November last year, seven writ applications were filed in the Court of Appeal. In all those seven writ applications, the main relief sought by the petitioners was writs of prohibition, prohibiting the Members of the Parliamentary Select Committee from investigating into the allegations of misbehaviour or incapacity alleged against the Chief Justice. In all the seven applications there was a threshold question that loomed large and had to be answered by the Court of Appeal, namely, whether the Court of Appeal could issue a writ of prohibition against the Parliamentary Select Committee.

Instead of serving the notice on the Attorney-General and finding an answer on the jurisdictional issue, a different question was framed by the Court of Appeal for interpretation by the Supreme Court. The question for interpretation never arose in the course of the proceedings nor did any of the parties raise this question for interpretation. The Court of Appeal instead of answering the jurisdictional question whether the Court had jurisdiction to issue writ against the Parliamentary Select Committee played Pontius Pilate by shifting the buck to the Supreme Court.

What happened in the Supreme Court? We all know what happened in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court answered the question posed by the Court of Appeal and communicated that determination to the Court of Appeal which was read out in the Court of Appeal on the 3rd of this month.

Mr. Speaker, I have my problems in coming to grips with the interpretation of the Supreme Court. I would summarize the Determination of the Supreme Court in a couple of sentences. Firstly, the Supreme Court held that

the Parliamentary Select Committee exercises judicial power when it investigates the allegations of misbehaviour or incapacity of the particular judge. Secondly, this judicial power has to be vested by law and law alone. It cannot be conferred by a Standing Order. Both conclusions are erroneous and cannot be supported in any manner.

I read in the papers that the Honourable Attorney-General cited the case of Walter Nixon Vs. United States of America, a case decided by the US Supreme Court in 1993 and reported in their reports. Mr. Speaker, this is a case where a judge of the Federal Supreme Court judge in the United States challenged his impeachment in the US Supreme Court. We have borrowed some features of the US Constitution into ours and you will see that the United States is a country where judicial power is vested exclusively in the judiciary. Walter Nixon, the impeached judge, argued the same question that the Attorneys of Dr. (Mrs.) Shirani Bandaranayake argued in our Supreme Court, namely, the impeachment process is an exercise of judicial power and it should be decided by the Judiciary and not by the PSC as happens in that country. There, the Senate conducts the impeachment proceedings.

The Supreme Court of the United States categorically rejected the argument. The Supreme Court of the US was emphatic that when the Senate holds sittings in an impeachment proceedings there, it is not a trial nor is it an exercise of judicial power.

As I said before, Mr. Speaker, the United States is a country where judicial power is jealously guarded by the Judiciary but still, the Supreme Court held in the Nixon case that though the impeachment proceedings had the trappings of a trial, it is not a trial at all. It is not an exercise of judicial power either. It is just a legislative check on the Judiciary by the Legislature. It is just a constitutional process of disciplining a judge. Even in Australia, this power of disciplining a judge has not been held to be an exercise of judicial power.

But, this principle was lost on our Supreme Court. They conveniently omitted any reference to this case though it was cited to them and it was a willful blindness on the part of the Supreme Court exhibited to this principle when they held that under Article 107(3) or Standing Order 78A, the PSC, was exercising judicial power.

I would like to quote an excerpt from the US Judgment of Walter Nixon, but for brevity of time I am not going to quote that passage and table* that together with my speech.

I find a particular statement of the US Supreme Court quite compelling at page 234 of the Judgment. I quote:

Judicial review would be inconsistent with the Framers insistence that our system be one of checks and balances. In our constitutional system, impeachment was designed to be the only check on the Judicial Branch by the Legislature. Judicial involvement in the impeachment proceedings would eviscerate the 'important constitutional check' placed on the Judiciary by the Framers. Nixons argument would place the final reviewing authority with respect to impeachments in the hands of the same body that the impeachment process he's meant to regulate.

Unlike in the US, where the Congress and the Senate conduct the impeachment process, in Sri Lanka the impeachment process involves both the legislative and the executive arms. Yet, just as in the US, both the President and the Members of Parliament are representatives of the people and, therefore, are legitimately permitted to impeach a judicial officer. But, the Supreme Court erroneously holds that the impeachment hearing is a judicial hearing. That is where they go wrong. It is not. It is anything but judicial. Even in the US, it is a Select Committee of Senators who hear evidence. But, the entire Senate votes on it.

So, the Supreme Court interpretation is not in conformity with the judicial attitudes of other countries. The strange part of the determination is that not a single word is spoken of this comparative jurisprudence by the three-member Supreme Court Cench which delivered this erroneous determination.

Mr. Speaker, I find that the Nixons case has been followed in another case in the United States, namely, Alcee L. Hastings Vs. United States of America, decided on 21st October, 1993. Since then, there has been no ambiguity about the nature of this power and it is axiomatic that about 11 judges who have been impeached so far in the United States did not choose to challenge their impeachment proceedings and the Judiciary has not interfered with the impeachment process. But, it is regrettable that the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka should turn a blind eye to this constitutional jurisprudence which is taking place outside Sri Lanka.

The second issue that I mentioned is that of law and law alone. The Supreme Court says that Parliament must enact a law in order to confer the imaginary judicial power they are talking of. When the Supreme Court spoke of a legal enactment to confer the so-called judicial power, they conveniently omitted a reference to the Standing Orders that are specifically referred to in Article 107(3). Since the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris referred to this yesterday, I am not going to go into that.

In any event, the Court of Appeal could not have sent a question for interpretation without having answered the jurisdictional question. They failed to address the preliminary question whether they had jurisdiction in the first place to issue a writ against Parliament or the

Parliamentary Select Committee. The only occasion they have addressed this issue is when the Chief Justice herself filed a writ application in the Court of Appeal recently to challenge the Report of the PSC and prohibit Parliament from debating this Report.

What happened in the Court of Appeal in the case filed by the Chief Justice? When the Attorney General raised this issue, the Court of Appeal after a marathon session of submissions on the 7th of January, last week, had delivered a judgment quashing the Report of the PSC on the same day, a practice which has never been adopted by the Court of Appeal in the past.

I would refer you to the article written by other Judges of the Court of Appeal yesterday which is on page 3 of the "Daily News". The Judges have called it "a hurried justice" which they allege has resulted in disrepute being brought to the Court of Appeal. But, I approach the judgment, the hurried judgment, with objectivity. The Chief Justice had asked for two reliefs, namely, the prohibition to stop Parliament from debating the Report and certiorari to quash the Report of the PSC. The argument is made that by quashing the Report, the findings of the PSC had been nullified and that there is no Report. But, is that the legal position?

Mr. Speaker, it is Parliament that assigns judicial power of the people to the Judiciary, but when judiciary delivers judgments which have no foundation, certainly we should have the freedom of proceedings to critique those erroneous judgments and condemn them out of hand. The binding nature or stare decisis, as they call it, cannot attach itself to a judgment which amounts to a nullity.

As the Attorney-General rightly argued, a survey of the writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal demonstrates that the Court of Appeal does not possess the writ jurisdiction extending to Parliament or Parliamentary Select Committee. I say this because the answer is found in the Constitution itself. Before I come to that, I want to mention a few words about some vital provisions of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act. When the Select Committee sat, it sat as Parliament itself. We have to bear in mind that a Select Committee is an extension of Parliament. I draw your attention to Section 2 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, which categorically declares that Parliament includes a Committee of Parliament. So, when the PSC had its proceedings, it amounted to Parliamentary proceedings. Can any court impugn these proceedings? This is what the Court of Appeal fails to answer in its judgments. The answer to this question is found in Section 3 of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act. Let me quote Section 3:

There shall be freedom of speech, debate and proceeding in Parliament and such freedom of speech, debate or proceedings shall not be liable to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament.

555 556

This statutory ouster of jurisdiction of courts applies not only to the Court of Appeal but also to the Supreme Court. Sir, this statutory ouster in Section 3 has got incorporated in Article 67 of the Constitution. That is one fact that the Court of Appeal has conveniently omitted to mention in its Judgment. Article 67 says, I quote:

The privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament and of its Members may be determined and regulated by Parliament by law, and until so determined and regulated, the provisions of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, shall, mutatis mutandis, apply. By incorporating the provisions of the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act in Article 67 of the Constitution, today the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act has been elevated to a constitutional status and the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to issue a writ against Parliament or PSC is taken away by Article 67.

This is made clear by Article 140 of the Constitution that empowers the Court of Appeal to issue writs. This power is not wide as the Court of Appeal claims. It is circumscribed by two phrases appearing in Article 140, namely, Subject to the provisions of the Constitution and according to law.

The Court of Appeal can issue writs Subject to the provisions of the Constitution and according to law. If there are constitutional provisions that take away the jurisdiction, the Court of Appeal cannot issue a writ.

Mr. Speaker, how did the Court of Appeal lose sight of Article 67 which ousts the jurisdiction of writ against Parliament?

The Court of Appeal dodges this issue, and are we bound by a judgment which lacks legitimacy? As Parliamentarians, are we to permit this aberration?

Thus, the PSC proceedings that culminated in the Report are immune to any challenge by certiorari. In the same breath, prohibition of any proceedings in Parliament in furtherance of the recommendations of the PSC is barred by Article 67 read with Article 140 of the Constitution.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Hon. Minister, please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Speaker, I will wind up by leaving some of those references to cases but I have a very important point to make here about the English Common Law and writs. That too I will table*.

There are other cogent grounds on which, I say, the Judgment of the Court of Appeal extending its jurisdiction to Parliament falls like a pack of cards.

Look at the proviso to Article 140. This proviso makes it clear that Parliament can enact a law by which we can transfer the writ jurisdiction to the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeal can be denuded of its writ jurisdiction by Parliament. It is Parliament that sets the limits of the writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. It is Parliament that delegates the judicial power to the Court of Appeal. I see a "master and servant" relationship but I would classify it rather as a "principal and agent" relationship. In that background, how can an agent supervise its principal? Did the Court of Appeal consider this all-important distinction? No. This is why this judgment is anomalous and aberrant.

So, I have demonstrated to you that the determinations of both the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal have today sounded the death knell of Parliamentary sovereignty and stand as judicial anomalies. They can never be supported having regard to precedent. Nowhere in the world has a writ been issued against Parliament.

Where have we now come? This latest jurisprudence raises an all-important issue. Every time a Select Committee sits and makes a decision such as what the COPE or Public Accounts Committee would do, we face the prospect of a writ overtaking us and nullifying all that happens in this august forum.

Does this sit comfortably with Parliamentary sovereignty? If Select Committees are going to be hampered in this manner, can we operate and carry on our Parliamentary proceedings?

Mr. Speaker, our system of checks and balances are likely to crumble and grind to a halt. We have to divorce ourselves from emotions and we are duty-bound to look at those two judgments dispassionately to see the extent of their pernicious effect.

I have also referred to the Geneva Declarations and how it does not affect because we are a dualist nation and that decision by Justice Sarath N. Silva is also referred to in my speech that I table.

Mr. Speaker, both the Legislature and Judiciary must operate themselves in their respective spheres of competence and the concept of separation of powers with its checks and balances built into the Constitution, have to be respected and advanced without any qualifications and any unwarranted intrusion on each others territory except as permitted by the Constitution, has to be averted by a conscious effort to maintain the equilibrium that the Constitution seeks to achieve.

This convulsion which have plagued us has to be arrested for the greater good of the people who placed this public trust of governance in each of us.

Mr. Speaker, as one who initiated a compromise at the beginning of the process, I am personally in a moral dilemma on this issue; still in view of these judgments that I have critiqued, I have no option but to vote for this Motion to preserve the legitimacy of the powers of Parliament, which we are all duty-bound to protect, preserve and promote.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

[4.00 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Mr. Deputy Speaker, this is the first time in Parliamentary history that we are debating an impeachment against a Judge of the superior court, namely the Chief Justice of the Republic of Sri Lanka. Whether it will be left as a grey patch or as a purple patch in our Parliamentary history, I leave it to posterity to decide.

Article 3 of our Constitution precisely and categorically states that in the Republic of Sri Lanka, sovereignty is in the people and is inalienable. Sovereignty includes powers of government, fundamental rights and the franchise. These have become much-debated topics since the impeachment against the Chief Justice was moved in Parliament.

While the incumbent coalition Government is vociferous in taking up the position that the Legislature is supreme to the Judiciary, those who are learned in political science and fair-minded people strongly demonstrate that the three pillars on which the temple of justice rests are equal within their scope and power. In the absence of evenness of the three pillars, namely, the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary, the golden shrine that rests upon them would collapse. The golden shrine denotes democracy.

There is no debate that people, while exercising their franchise, repose their sovereignty in the hands of the Representatives in Parliament on a contract basis for a limited period. Therefore, Members of Parliament are

only the custodians of the people and they are obliged to exercise legislative powers within the parameters of the Constitution. In the absence of checks and balances, objectives of democracy would be rendered nugatory and absurd. That is the reason why in the 18th Century French political philosopher, Charles-Baron de Montesquieu, introduced the concept of separation of powers based especially on the system of Westminster Parliamentary democracy in the United Kingdom.

During the period of British colonial domination in this country, they had introduced a system based upon that concept, and it is well enshrined in the Soulbury Constitution as well. Even at present, Article 4 of our Constitution has given due recognition to the concept of separation of powers without any ambiguity, which is regarded as a rule by jurists all over the world. Concentration of powers in one or in a few, always tempts to dismantle democratic structure and take a lead role towards a dictatorship. That is the reason why Lord Acton said, I quote:

Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

The independence of the judiciary is the greatest achievement of people in the annals of human civilization. It was not bestowed upon people as a sovereign gift but it is the outcome of longstanding struggles launched and sacrifices made at the expense of a multitude of lives. It was 24 centuries ago that the greatest Greek philosopher Aristotle said, Every fool in this world thinks that he is born to rule the others. That is the reason why the great leaders of the world explored the possibility of creating an alternative rule to dictatorship and found the system of democratic governance after tremendous efforts.

The historical proclamation of Magna Carta by King James as far back in 1215 is considered the cornerstone in English government, in which it is enshrined, I quote:

"To no one will we sell, to no one will we deny or delay, right or justice." It is in our time that one of the most respected British jurists, Lord Denning said, I quote:

"The greatest constitutional document of all times - the foundation of freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot.

It has immensely motivated people to fight against vulnerable rulers.

At a time when judicial independence was at stake in the United Kingdom in 1688, people staged a revolution and King James II was ousted from the Crown and people had accepted his successors William and Mary, on the condition, among other things, that they shall guarantee the tenure of judges essential for their true independence

579 580

of mind and action. That revolution achieved the goal to ensure that in England brutal intimidation of the Judiciary would not occur again, by passing the Act of Settlement in 1701. Thereby, the most essential and cardinal duties of all representatives of the Legislature as well as of the members of the Judiciary are to protect and safeguard the independence of the Judiciary above all.

In the midst of the great civil war to preserve the United States as a country, speaking at a dedication of a national cemetery at Gettysburg in 1863, the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, addressed the nation and stated, I quote:

"Democracy is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people",

which is considered perhaps the best definition for democracy in the modern world.

It is an inherent and embedded attitude of human beings that they refuse to be slaves of others and abhor to be subjects of any dictatorship. Article 1 of the UN Charter on Human Rights as well as Article 12 of our Constitution has guaranteed that all persons are equal before the law. The Rule of Law is a precious right the people in democracies all over the world enjoy and that is considered the most vital and predominant concept in law. Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States said:, "No man is above the law and no man is below it; nor do we ask any man's permission when we ask to obey it. Obedience to the law is demanded as a right; not asked as a favour". From time immemorial Greek philosophy has held that: "Nobody has a more sacred obligation to obey the law than who makes the law".

Former Chief Justice, Bhagwati of India has once said that: "The judge infuses the life and blood into the dry skeleton provided by the Legislature and creates a living organism appropriate and adequate to meet the needs of the society". It is within such parameters that the rulers are obliged to perform their respective duties and obligations. Notwithstanding all these inimical consequences of the British rulers, we have inherited an illustrious judicial structure which had been operative even under the British domination. It was in the 1930s, the Chief Justice Abraham, Justice Martinez and Justice Sooertz of the Supreme Court, who were appointed by the British rulers, ordered that the British Governor's order to extradite Mark Anthony Bracegirdle, a British planter in Sri Lanka, was illegal and quashed the decision concerned. It is all the more significant to note that the said extradition order was given at a time when it was said that the sun never sets on the British Empire.

In the case of Queen Vs. Liyanage in the 1960s, Justice T.S. Fernando, Justice L.B. de Silva and Justice Sri Skandarajah, who were appointed as Members of the

Trial-at-Bar to try the coup-d'etat, held that the amendment of Section 440A of the Criminal Procedure Code to empower the Minister to appoint judges to the Trial-at-Bar was illegal, and held that their own appointments were bad in law. The Legislature accepted that judgment without any challenge and with much respect to the Rule of Law.

In an election petition filed by Wijayananda Dahanayake against Albert Silva, Neville Samarakoon, Q.C., the Chief Justice of the Republic decided that while having powers to make laws on a particular matter under the Constitution, if the Parliament has failed to do so, Parliamentarians should not be given the benefit of their own folly, omissions and negligence. It was in that spirit that Justice Asoka de Silva and Justice Hector Yapa as then Justices of the Court of Appeal, issued a writ of quo warranto nullifying the membership of Parliament of the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, in which the Hon. Dilan Perera was the petitioner. There is no doubt that this Government is overwhelmed by triumph and raptures of war victory.

It is our duty to remind the rulers that the great leaders in the world, while knowing the dire consequences of such conduct, never rejoiced and were not under a spell of illusions and hallucinations

One of the greatest leaders in the world, Winston Churchill who was guided by the maxim - the then Prime Minister of Great Britain - after winning the World War II said, Magnanimity in victory, defiance in defeat.

... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. A.R.M. Abdul Cader - Deputy Minister of Environment) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Abdul Cader, what is your point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.R.M. Abdul Cader) . ? . ? [ ] .

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) We are also aware that Nelson Mandela after languishing in prison over 29 years, achieved the freedom for his nation in South Africa. When his advisers suggested celebrating the victory, he scoffed at them and said, Don't celebrate revenge. That demonstrates the humble approach of great leaders in their efforts to effect reconciliation of all communities in their countries. But, if they were not prudent enough, they also would have divided their countries by labelling people as patriots and traitors which would have culminated in catastrophes and devastations. But, we have seen that there had been rulers in the recent past like President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia, President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and President Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, who thought that they were invincible. Therefore, they had resorted to their own whims and fancies with no regard to repercussions and dire consequences.

It is appropriate to admire the conduct of Nelson Mandela. In 1995, the Constitutional Court of South Africa struck down the proclamation made by President Mandela in an Electoral Boundary Delineation matter. On the same day, President Mandela appeared in the media and said that he honestly believed that Parliament had given him power for such a proclamation. Since the Constitutional Court found otherwise, he said that he respected the decision of the Court and added: This decision clearly demonstrates that in the Republic of South Africa, even the President is subject to the law.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

, [ ] .

, , [ ] .

Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it was in 2004, when the British Government headed by Prime Minister, Tony Blair presented the Asylum and Immigration Bill with an ouster clause that no court shall question the validity of the decision arrived at by the Immigration Tribunal, the Chief Justice Lord Woolf in the United Kingdom cautioned the government that it would be a blot on its reputation and in any event, court will not be

bound by such a restriction in the exercise of its judicial functions. That Government was humble enough to avoid any confrontation among the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary in a most prudent manner. At present, we have a problem on the Rule of Law. It is relevant to note what Michael Tamplet said, I quote:

We have a problem when the same people who make the law get to decide whether or not they themselves have broken the law.

In the present scenario, the country has almost come to a state of anarchy. We are not concerned about the individual who is holding the office of Chief Justice in this country, but we are seriously concerned about the institution. Anybody who holds that post shall be given due recognition and respect, as Roman Emperor, Justinian the Great said, I quote:

Justice is the constant and perpetual wish to render to everyone his due.

The present Chief Justice, Dr. (Mrs.) Shirani Bandaranayake has every right as any other citizen of this country, as guaranteed by our Constitution. At present, this coalition Government which is led by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party was formed by the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, in which his wife as well as his daughter became the Head of State, several times after winning elections. But, under the present regime, all Bandaranaikes have been receded to the background for reasons best known to everybody.

It is the opinion of the greater majority of this country, as well as of the international community that the Chief Justice has not been given a fair trial. On the other hand, as we understand, the Chief Justice has poised herself with the firm belief that she should not compromise with this issue as she is innocent. It reminds us that the former Prime Minister and the founder of the SLFP who sacrificed his life for it, the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike said, If you go in search of the Holy Grail, why should you settle for a silver tankard.

The Holy Grail means the plate used by Jesus Christ at his Last Supper. It may well be that Chief Justice, Shirani Bandaranayake wishes to see that justice is meted out at the end.

There had been exemplary characters in the world, who were victims of concocted charges and denied of fair trials. It was in the 4th Century BC, the great Greek philosopher, Socrates, was charged for corrupting the youth and for his blasphemy. With the majority decision of the jury, he was convicted and killed by giving him hemlock, the poison. His associate, Plato was ready to take him out of the country secretively to save his life. But, Socrates firmly said that it was important to obey the law of the State than saving his life. As a citizen, he considered the existence of the State with law and order was essential and that every person was bound to be a law-abiding citizen.

583 584

Thereafter, in the 17th Century, Italian astronomer and philosopher, Galileo Galilei, the father of Modern Science, was convicted for discovering the Heliocentric Theory. Although, the teaching in that era was that the sun was rotating around the earth, he discovered that it was otherwise. Such a discovery in astronomy was considered an offence deserving capital punishment.

In human history, the most aggrieved victim was nobody else other than Jesus Christ, who was denied a fair trial. The only offence allegedly committed by him was that he has said at the Last Supper that he was above the King. Judas who was one among the 13 at the Last Supper betrayed Jesus Christ and King Herod wanted to kill him on those charges alone.

Although Pontius Pilate found that Jesus Christ was not guilty, but due to the influence of the King and the priests, he was crucified while saving the thief Barabbas, who had been, in fact, convicted for crimes. This amply demonstrates that throughout in human history, those who deserved to have fair trials were given it very rarely. That shows politics of those in the highest echelons, could, at times be stupid.

We do not know, in this drama, who the Judas is behind the Chief Justice. But, the fact remains that what has happened today will be written as history tomorrow. Knowing as we are of those happenings, the fate that might befall the Chief Justice, Dr. (Mrs.) Bandaranayake, cannot spring a surprise to us.

There is a saying: Advice is least heeded when it is most needed. Especially, people with power are tempted not to heed any good advice, as they are excessively intoxicated with power. At this juncture, let us not forget what Abraham Lincoln said. I quote:

Let every man remember that to violate the law is to trample on the blood of his father and to tear that charter of his own and his childrens liberty.

At last, please do not forget what Mahatma Ghandi, in his wisdom, referring to justice said. I quote:

There is a higher court than courts of justice and that is the court of conscience. It supersedes all other courts.

We are shocked and dismayed by the disastrous consequences that would befall our people by this array of events. However, viewed from a political dimension, the Opposition is not that bewildered, because we are certain that this coalition Government is now expediting its inevitable downfall by this ludicrous tendency to debilitate the Judiciary.

Thank you.

The document tabled in the Select Committee on 4th December, 2012 states, I quote:

"As was discussed, the Committee must determine how to proceed. The Chief Justice or her lawyers must be provided an opportunity to cross-examine witness and the documents collected." You will remember that we gave it in writing. It further states, I quote:

Furthermore, what is the standard of proof that is required.

. Then, it goes on to state, I quote:

"The Select Committee in Neville Samarakoon's case held that the standard of proof required is very high."

2013 11

All these things were brought to your notice. "In addition the Committee must adhere to the definition of 'misbehaviour' as specified in the Neville Samarakoon's Second Select Committee Report." So, this was one of the documents that we initially tabled in the Committee for the information of the Chairman and the Members. But, there was no reasonable response for any of it.

Then, subsequently, on the 7th of December, 2012, we addressed another letter to the Select Committee signed by the Hon. R. Sampanthan, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, the Hon. Vijitha Herath and myself. There, we very clearly enunciated the stand the four of us were going to take in regard to participating in the Committee in the future. Sir, I am quoting extracts from that letter.

In the course of the delibrations of the Committee, the following matters had been raised by us:

* The absence of a clear direction regarding the procedure to be followed by the Select Committee.

Those are very cardinal, important matters. The letter goes on to state, I quote: "* Whether documents were to be made available to the Chief Justice and her lawyers.

*The standard of proof which would be required.

*The need to arrive at a definition of 'misbehavior'.

*Whether sufficient time would be made available to the Chief Justice and her lawyers to study the documents.

We have also requested a direction whether the Chief Justice and her lawyers would be given an opportunity to cross-examine the several complainants who had made the charges against her.

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Lalith Dissanayake, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) . .

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That is not a point of Order. - [Interruption.] Hon. John Amaratunga, you carry on. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, the letter further states, I quote:

"It was also our position that if and only if a prima facie case had first been made out against the Chief Justice that she can be asked to respond. None of these matters have been addressed by your Committee.

No serious notice was taken of these matters that we had raised. Then, it goes on to state, I quote:

We also find that we are groping in the dark and proceeding on an ad hoc basis.

In addition we wish to note that over 300 documents were received by the Committee and handed over to the Members only on 5th December, 2012 and those were handed over to the Chief Justice only at 4.30 p.m. on 6th December, 2012.

We understand that there are several more documents to be produced."

They were mentioned by the Chairman of the Committee in the course of its deliberations. The letter also states the following, I quote:

The lawyers appearing for the Chief Justice asked for time to study the documents. This was refused. Now, where is natural justice? Where is fair play? This is the whole problem. - [Interruption.] Today, you have brought about a situation in the country where you are going - [Interruption.] Sir, the letter goes on to state, I quote:

Apart from the Chief Justice, we the Members of the Select Committee ourselves will need sufficient time to study these documents."

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) What is the point of Order, Hon. Azwer? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I would like to adduce a good point of Order in the House today. If the UNP had accepted the membership of the Select Committee, they are duty-bound by Parliament - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That is not a point of Order.

607 608

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Azwer, you are wasting my time.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. John Amaratunga, you carry on. - [Interruption.] This is the everyday practice of both sides. - [Interruption.] You also raise points of Order. If Hon. Members raise points of Order, my duty is to allow those. - [Interruption.] So, that is my Order, that it is not a point of Order. So, Hon. Member, you carry on. - [Interruption.] Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, your side is also the same. Both sides are the same. Not only one side but both sides disturb.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, our letter goes on to state:

"Furthermore the Chief Justice had not been provided with either a List of Documents or a List of Witnesses. The sequence of events can be set down as follows: When the motion was filed, there were no documents provided with it."

The Members who signed the Motion did no know what they were signing. They never saw any documents; they blindly signed it. That is our position. Sir, it further states, I quote:

"The inquiry started on 14th November 2012 without either a list of witnesses or a list of documents.

After three sittings, the Secretary-General was instructed to call for the documents from the Banks and other institutions."

For the first time, the Committee was to receive those documents. Even the Members who had filed this Motion had never seen those and that was the first time the documents were seeing the light of day. - [Interruption.] Sir, the letter goes on to state, I quote:

"What is obvious here is that when the Impeachment Motion was filed none of the signatories could have seen any of the documents", as I mentioned earlier.

"It is regrettable that the Committee is ignoring the salient provisions of the law and requirements of Natural Justice in the conduct of this Inquiry." The cardinal principles of natural justice were violated. Sir, the letter further states, I quote:

" Article 12 (1) of the Constitution which guarantees equality and equal protection of the law and Article 13 (5) the presumption of innocence. Article 7 of the Human Rights Declaration guaranteeing equality before the law. Item 17 and 20 of the United Nations Basic Principles of the Independence of the Judiciary which guarantees to every judge the right to a fair hearing and an independent review of removal proceedings.

Those are some of the internationally accepted cardinal principles, which the Chairman and the rest of the Members of the Committee did not adhere to. The letter then states, I quote:

"It is also a matter of note that the Chief Justice has not been afforded the courtesies and privileges due to her office." There were a number of such incidents, but I do not want to waste your time by referring to those. It further states, I quote:

"We have made our position clear regarding these matters. It is the duty of the Select Committee to maintain the highest standards of fairness in conducting this inquiry. We also regrettably note that during these proceedings, the treatment meted out to the Chief Justice was insulting and intimidatory......"

That is borne out by the Report. "......and the remarks made were clearly indicative of preconceived findings of guilt." That is why I said that they came with a preconceived mind in order to find her guilty.

"We are therefore of the view that the Committee should, before proceeding any further, lay down the procedures that the Committee intends to follow in this inquiry. Give adequate time to both the Members of the Committee and the Chief Justice and her lawyers to study and review the documents that had been tabled."

That is very important. The letter also states the following, I quote: "Afford the Chief Justice privileges necessary to uphold the dignity of the Office of the Chief Justice while attending proceedings of the Committee. If these matters are attended to, we feel that the Chief Justice should be invited to continue her participation in the proceedings."

That is after she left. The letter ends stating, I quote: "However if the Committee is not agreeable to these proposals of ours we will be compelled to withdraw from the Committee." So, we made it very clear that those are some of the conditions we lay down; that if we are to continue in that Committee, those should be followed.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you have only one more minute.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The Hon. Chairman of the Select Committee wanted to be fair; he wanted to give a reasonable hearing, but very unfortunately, the pressure was too much on him. The night before the day the Report was presented, pressure came on him and the following day, he had to give it. - [Interruption.]

609 610

2013 11

Sir, on the allegation that the Chief Justice and her lawyers left, it was not because they wanted to leave but they were forced to leave. They were forced to leave! The Members of the Committe made it so uncomfortable for them to proceed with the inquiry investigating into the allegations.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) He is going to wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) After they had left, what is the point in our waiting there in the Committee? - [Interruption.] When we had made the conditions very clear, none of those were accepted and adhered to.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, your time is over. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Therefore, Sir, it must be very clear. We have no intention of safeguarding the Chief Justice. If proper procedure was followed and proper evidence was brought before the Committee, we also would have voted if we found that she was guilty of corruption and misbehaviour. But, very unfortunately, that opportunity was not given to us. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, there is a point of Order being raised.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Time is limited. Please do not disturb him. Hon. Member, please wind up now. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The whole world is watching what Sri Lanka is doing to the Chief Justice. It is very unreasonable. - [Interruption.] The people of the country are so angry. I

saw in todays newspapers that there is a requiem for the independence of the Judiciary. Therefore, we are very sorry, Sir, that Sri Lanka has fallen into this predicament.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you are taking more time. I will have to reduce it from the time allotted to the Hon. Sajith Premadasa.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) We find it very uncomfortable to answer in the international arena about what has taken place. - [Interruption.] Sir, we will be strongly voting against this Motion.

( ) (An Hon. Member) Sir, there is a point of Order being raised.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala. [Interruption.] Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala, the time allotted to you is very limited. Why do you not speak?

Thus, from an historical perspective the question of what conduct by a Federal judge constitutes an impeachable offense has evolved to the position where the focus is now on public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. When a judges conduct calls into questions his or her integrity or impartiality, Congress must consider whether impeachment and removal of the judge from office is necessary to protect the integrity of the judicial branch and uphold the public trust. n . n , . ? ? .

This Report further states, I quote:

.high crimes and misdemeanors refers to misconduct that damages the state and the operations of governmental institutions, and is not limited to criminal misconduct. That Report stressed that impeachment is non-criminal, designed not to impose criminal penalties, but instead simply to remove the offender from office, and that it is 'the ultimate means of preserving our constitutional form of government from the depredations of the those in high office who abuse or violate the public trust. The fact that the individual who is impeached and removed from office shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law, makes it further clear that impeachment is a remedial provision, not a punitive one.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) , . .

"In connection with the impeachment of Federal Judge George W. English in 1926, the House Committee on the Judiciary noted: 'Each case of impeachment must necessarily stand upon its own facts. It cannot, therefore, become a precedent or be on all fours with every other case.' "

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Speaker, this Motion has been debated for two days and the Hon. Member is now stating that it is not placed in the Order Paper. How can you take up that position when you have participated in the Debate for two days? How can you take up the position that it is not placed in the Order Paper? You should have taken that up before it was debated. How can you do that now? Why did you participate? Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Member raised the point of Order on the basis that it is not placed in the Order Paper. This was debated for two days. If so, it should have been taken up prior to it being debated. After participating in the Debate, they cannot state that it is not placed in the Order Paper. I do not see any logic in it and this objection cannot be taken.

If we take what is in the Order Paper today for a vote and in case it is passed, we will have to appoint another Select Committee because the Resolution there is to appoint a Select Committee. - [Interruption.] The only operative part is to appoint another Select Committee. If this is passed, you will have to appoint another Select Committee to inquire into it. That is the only operative part. Though it is in order to address a Resolution to the President, that is not the operative part. The only operative part is that we are resolving that a Select Committee of Parliament be appointed. If you put it to vote, you will have to appoint another Select Committee today. Thank you.
