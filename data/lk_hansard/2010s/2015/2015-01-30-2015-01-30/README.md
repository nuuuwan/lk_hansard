( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You are willing, but you are depriving us. Your willingness is always a big question. You want us to wait for one week. For what? - [Interruption.] You did not wait for one week. Give us a debate and we will show that you all did not wait for so many years. You listened to the Hon. Prime Ministers speech; read it if you do not understand it. We respect the Hon. Prime Minister in relation to certain matters, which he admitted were correct. That is what you all are trying to suppress now. So, give us a chance to start the debate. You must, at least, give the Hon. Leader of the Opposition a chance to start the debate.

Hon. Prime Minister, what I am trying to say is that a retirement is different to a resignation. I am telling you with responsibility. I will present this case with responsibility. That is why we want time. We do not want to get involved personally with the Hon. Prime Minister on any matter. He has tried his best, perhaps in a way to resolve it, but the Bar Association came and forced him to accept their conditions. - [Interruption.] You said that the Bar Association forced the Government to accept these conditions of forcibly removing Mohan Peiris. What you said is recorded. You said it just two hours ago. What you said is true. That is what happened. You were trying to resolve, but the Bar Association took the matter into their hands and forced you all to act like thugs and throw out Chief Justice, Mohan Peiris and install a lady in that chair. That is the fact.
