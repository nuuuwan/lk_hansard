The context was one in which a very large number of civilians, approximately 300,000 people, found themselves trapped on a narrow strip of land. They were 300,000 civilians being held hostage. That is, without question, the largest hostage situation in contemporary military history. The Sri Lankan Government told them, Facilities are waiting for you: medical facilities, food, and shelter; you come over and we will look after you. These are citizens of Sri Lanka; civilians of the country. Then, they were shot at; some of them were killed. The LTTE wanted to use them as human shields. So, the LTTE would not allow them to leave the LTTE-controlled areas. In that situation, what is the responsibility of the Government of the country? Obviously, there has to be intervention. You cannot leave 300,000 civilians to their own devices, abandon them to their fate and do nothing. No government worthy of its name will adopt such a passive course of action. So, there had to be intervention.",

Otherwise, there would have been an unpardonable dereliction of public duty on the part of the Sri Lankan State. So, the overriding factor there is the context in which the problem arises - this unique, unsurpassed, hostage situation - which the Government of Sri Lanka had to deal with at that time. So, the first principle is the principle of legitimacy pertaining to the military objective.",

    "text": "The second Principle is that of Identification. That again is regulated in detail by the principles of International Law. But, in those circumstances, it was very difficult to distinguish a civilian from a combatant, because the LTTE was forcibly recruiting people, compelling them to go from place to place with the LTTE and they were being made to carry out the orders of the LTTE, not willingly, not spontaneously but under duress and compulsion. Nevertheless, that was the practicality of the situation. So, in those circumstances, there does arise a genuine problem relating to identification and distinguishing between the combatant and the civilian. That was one of the complicating factors characterizing the situation, which the Government of Sri Lanka had to deal with in the closing stages of the war.",

Just as much as your objective has to be a legitimate objective, the degree of force used must be compatible with the accomplishment of that objective. Excessive force is not permitted. But, when you are dealing with the lives of 300,000 people, who are being held hostage by the LTTE, then, the question is, could the army have done anything else and was the action taken by the army in excess of the force that they should have used in order to achieve an entirely legitimate and indeed essential objective?",

    "text": "[4.45 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you, Sir. Before I comment on the Motion, I must say that this country got into a right old mess on the international front particularly after the completion of the war, and particularly on account of the manner in which they prosecuted the war, because this country failed to keep the commitments made to the Secretary-General of the UN, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, when he came to this country almost immediately after the war was completed. There was a commitment on the part of this country to the Secretary-General of the UN, that there will be an accountability process which this country will undertake and accomplish, so as you deal with grave violations of International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law, which had come to the forefront. That commitment was made in May 2009, but that commitment was not honoured and this Member who had moved this Motion today, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, a National List Member of Parliament, was the Foreign Minister at that time. He must undertake responsibility for that lapse on behalf of his Government and it was in consequence of the failure on the part of the Government that this country was treated with the utmost disrespect by the entire international community. You are trying to distinguish between Africa, Asia and the role that India played here and there. Well, these are countries that are sympathetic to Sri Lanka; these are countries that are sympathetic to the Sri Lankan people. That is because we are also an Asian country; we are an independent country and they do not like to do anything against us. But, the fact of the matter is, and you must admit it in the national interest, that you and your Government were responsible for the utter disrespect that the international community had for Sri Lanka during your period in Government.",

There is nothing new and the Country Report says that they are engaged in certain activities, which we do not deny. Everybody knows that they are engaged in certain activities. But, what has been the democratic verdict of the people in Sri Lanka, particularly the Tamil people in the North and the East, in the Parliamentary Election of 2010, in the Provincial Council Elections in the Eastern Province in 2012 and the Northern Province in 2013 and in all the Local Authority Elections that have been held over a period of years since the war came to an end? Has the verdict of the people not been that they want a solution within the framework of a united, undivided country to the Tamil question? What have you done about it? Can you honestly say that during your period of Government you did anything towards the resolution of the problem in an amicable way - honestly? We talked to",

Did you make any endeavour to convince the international community that you were sincerely engaged in an honest process to find a solution to the problem? No. On the contrary, you were engaged in a sham. You wanted to deceive us. You wanted to ram down our throats some unacceptable solution. That was the game you were playing.

But, between 2005 and 2015, until the Presidential Election took place in January 2015, the position has deteriorated as never before, has become much worse. When you were the Foreign Minister, were you not responsible for all that happened in the UN Human Rights Council? I am sorry to say that when you were the Foreign Minister, there were three resolutions adopted by the UN in 2012, 2013, and 2014 and when the resolution was adopted in 2012 and 2013, they only wanted a domestic investigation. If you had set up a domestic investigation at that point of time, the question of an international investigation would never have come up. It came up only for the reason that you defaulted in setting up a local domestic investigation. I was ashamed when I saw you seated on a back seat being the Foreign Minister, when the Minister of Plantation Industries was presenting the case of Sri Lanka before the UN the Human Rights Council. That was your position in the UN Human Rights Council. On that day, I felt ashamed that the Foreign Minister of my country was made to sit on a back bench when the Plantation Industries Minister was presenting Sri Lankas position in the UN Human Rights Council in regard to the Resolution before the Council. That was the position. So, we do not support the remnants of the LTTE activities that maybe taking place in different parts of the world.",

They want to take over the SLFP and some of you are trying to assist them to take over the SLFP. This is what we are worried about. The SLFP must not go into the wrong hands. The SLFP should remain with persons who are genuinely SLFP. The SLFP should not be in the hands of people who merely want to come to Parliament on the National List.

That is not something to which we can agree.",

The present Government is acting in such a way as to win back the international support, as to win back the international respect and to ensure that their view of this country is completely reversed and that the world will support this Government not merely in the resolution of the Tamil question, but will support this country in its march towards progress in the future.

We know perfectly well that the UNP burnt that Agreement on the Floor of this House and the former President who was under the impression that she had secured the support of both the UNP and the LTTE for the proposal she put forward in 2010, found herself caught in a pincer movement by what seemed extremist Sinhala and extremist Tamil opinion and had to abandon that and I do not think it is correct of the Hon.

It produced a very good report which was welcomed by everybody, except three public commentaries, one of which was the TNA.

But, despite that, the LLRC Report developed into an Action Plan.

In February, when I was a Member of the Government Parliamentary Group, I said,Publish the findings of the Udalagama Commission because there are complaints that our Commissions are not to be trusted. The Udalagama Commission Report, as far as I know, is a very clear document that addresses issues in a way that everyone can accept; it was agreed at the Government Parliamentary Group. The following month, when I went back it was not even minuted. All that was in the minute was how to get cars for MPs and how to find jobs. The Hon. Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs had raised the question publicly, because he said all his supporters wanted jobs and it was minuted. But, the important things were not minuted. The decisions made with regard to promoting good governance and the subcommittee established under the Minister, who has unfortunately now forgotten his responsibilities in that regard for reasons he has explained, but it is a pity. The decision to publish it was not done and when I asked the Hon. Prime Minister he told the Chief Government Whip, Please incorporate this in the minutes and he said he had not had time to look into this, but he would. Nothing has happened and the internationals we talk to said, \"This is the type of thing you should be doing. It shows the bona fides\". As I said, I can understand, though I regret why the last Government did not publish that, because I believe it is very clear about the need for prosecution in particular of those who killed the \"Trinco five\". But, as we know, that was an appalling action. It was not done by the armed forces and one of the reasons I was very angry with the last Government for not pursuing that, was by allowing such things to happen they allowed blanket accusations against the army, which as we know, did its best and we also know perfectly well that in the whole campaign in the Eastern Province before the LTTE perfected in its technique of hostage taking, there was only one allegation of civilians being killed and that was well explained by the army. So, these are areas in which we have things that can be answered and it is a great pity that the Government has spent five months doing nothing in this regard. I am very happy that the Minister of Foreign Affairs has now taken upon himself to work on these. I hope he will succeed, but I think the lack of action so far makes me fear the worst.",

We know perfectly well that in 1981, when the LTTE wanted the District Development Council elections boycotted, the TULF was able to stand up against it and because of what happened a few months later, in 1982 the TULF had to give in to the LTTE with regard to elections - the burning of the Jaffna Public Library - but, nothing compared with what happened in 1983. And, when the Hon. R. Sampanthan talks about the people fleeing, I can understand why they left.",

And, to condemn Ms. Kunanayakam as an LTTE activist for her outlining of information with regard to that incident is an incredibly shabby behaviour and, I believe, it shows that the Minister of Foreign Affairs is subject to manipulation by the same individuals, who failed when they were entrusted with developing an Action Plan from the LLRC Report. He knows perfectly well that this had been entrusted to the Ministry of External Affairs mistakenly in 2012, and that nothing was done about it.

I know that new allies may forget all that, but I know that the Tamil people are well aware of what was done then and, while I believe, that there is a very strong component of the UNP, I hope all those Members in the Front Bench are those whom I could say have no racism in them, but I think we have to recognize that there was a strong racist streak.

You cannot go around asking in a vague way as the Minister does, Can I have some money to resettle people? You must have a plan.

There is another situation where the Foreign Ministrys spokesperson, my old friend and a very good Service Officer, Maheshini Colonne, has to do damage control all the time. The \"Daily Mirror\" had approached Tamara Kunanayakam as had the TNL, to ask why the Foreign Minister had said that they could not get hold of you. Later, when it was explained that she was in the country and was easily accessible, the Foreign Minister had to say, No, we have never said anything of the sort. Now, the real tragedy about all this is that we find personal vendettas are destroying the interests of this country. Tamara Kunanayakam had been appointed Chair of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Right to Development and instructions were sent by this Government to stop her being re-appointed. Even the last Government which was very annoyed with her - rather some people in the Foreign Ministry - did not try to stop her. This time those instructions were sent and when I asked the Foreign Minister, he said that he did not know about this. But, the Finance Minister let the cat out of the bag by saying, \"Why should he appoint her because she is trying to sue the Foreign Minister.\" Now, we find that this lady who did so much for the Non-Aligned Movement and was highly regarded has been removed and the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, which the West did not particularly want to take forward is now stymied. Now, we are not here to actually follow a myopic foreign policy as happened in the '80s. I think what we want to do is, omnidirectional. \"Omnidirectional\" does not mean hitting out on all sides as seems to have been the case occasionally, in particular, for instance, the attack on Australia. But, I think what it means is, following the principles of Non-Alignment. If you look at the Presidents Manifesto, this is what he said in the Manifesto, \"To develop relations with Asian countries: India, China et cetera\". This does not preclude improving relations with the West, which I think is very important. But, to imagine that this can be exclusive is extremely myopic. And, if you study history, - I am glad",

This only gave the international community an opening to interfere with the domestic affairs of our country. In fact, failures of the previous Government investigations to achieve credibility and plausibility, prompted the creation of the OHCHR investigation on Sri Lanka in a Resolution adopted in March, 2014. So, it is actually the previous Governments failures to establish legitimacy that is responsible. It is the timely entrance of a new Government in January this year, with a firm commitment to a credible domestic mechanism, that has enabled us to taper the call for an international investigation imposed on Sri Lanka by the international community.",
