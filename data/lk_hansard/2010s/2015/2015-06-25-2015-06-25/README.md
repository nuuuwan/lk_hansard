. , . . Question put, and agreed to. ADJOURNMENT ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I move,

That the Parliament do now adjourn.

. . Question proposed. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Now, the Adjournment Motion is to be moved by the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris. , 2014 , 2014 US COUNTRY REPORT ON TERRORISM, 2014 [3.20 p.m.] () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Presiding Member, I move the following Adjournment Motion:

The United States State Department, in its Country Report on Terrorism, 2014 has stated that the LTTE is using its international contacts and the large Tamil Diaspora in North America, Europe and Asia to procure weapons, communications, funding and other needed supplies. According to the report, the LTTE is using charities as fronts to collect and divert funds for these criminal activities.

The report specifically observes that the LTTE is active in Sri Lanka and India'.

Meanwhile, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Prince Zeid Raad Al-Hussein, has declared at the Human Rights Council in Geneva earlier this month that he expects the mechanism for accountability, promised by the Government of Sri Lanka, to be in place before the next session of the Council in September.

In repeated statements, the Government has insisted that it rejects an international investigation of alleged human rights abuses during the closing stages of the war, and that it is committed to a local mechanism.

However, in remarks delivered on 9th June on the floor of the Senate of the United States by Senator Patrick Leahy, one of the most influential voices in American foreign policy, the Senator strongly advocated for Sri Lanka a hybrid mechanism containing provision for participation by foreign experts at the prosecutorial and judicial levels. He recommended that foreign personnel should a play role in evidence gathering and in judicial decision making.

This House is of opinion that these are issues which require the fullest discussion and appropriate action in the national interest. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair. .. , [ ] .

Whereupon THE HON. H.R. MITHRAPALA left the Chair and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) , 2014 . , " , . ' , , ' ." . - charitable organizations -

that we have to make compromises, concessions. That is not at all a necessary or a desirable point of view. It is very much our view that the established principles of Public

405 406

International Law and International Humanitarian Law enable us to defend very convincingly the actions of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces.

In particular, I would like to direct the attention of the House to three specific Principles of International Law about which there is no doubt at all. Those are firmly entrenched in the system. The first of these is the Principle of Legitimacy. We must always remember that these problems were arising in a particular context during the last stages of the war. The context was one in which a very large number of civilians, approximately 300,000 people, found themselves trapped on a narrow strip of land. They were 300,000 civilians being held hostage. That is, without question, the largest hostage situation in contemporary military history. The Sri Lankan Government told them, Facilities are waiting for you: medical facilities, food, and shelter; you come over and we will look after you. These are citizens of Sri Lanka; civilians of the country. Then, they were shot at; some of them were killed. The LTTE wanted to use them as human shields. So, the LTTE would not allow them to leave the LTTE-controlled areas. In that situation, what is the responsibility of the Government of the country? Obviously, there has to be intervention. You cannot leave 300,000 civilians to their own devices, abandon them to their fate and do nothing. No government worthy of its name will adopt such a passive course of action. So, there had to be intervention.

Therefore, in terms of the International Law, the objective of the military exercise is a legitimate objective. Indeed, it is an essential objective. Otherwise, there would have been an unpardonable dereliction of public duty on the part of the Sri Lankan State. So, the overriding factor there is the context in which the problem arises - this unique, unsurpassed, hostage situation - which the Government of Sri Lanka had to deal with at that time. So, the first principle is the principle of legitimacy pertaining to the military objective.

The second Principle is that of Identification. That again is regulated in detail by the principles of International Law. But, in those circumstances, it was very difficult to distinguish a civilian from a combatant, because the LTTE was forcibly recruiting people, compelling them to go from place to place with the LTTE and they were being made to carry out the orders of the LTTE, not willingly, not spontaneously but under duress and compulsion. Nevertheless, that was the practicality of the situation. So, in those circumstances, there does arise a genuine problem relating to identification and distinguishing between the combatant and the civilian. That was one of the complicating factors characterizing the situation, which the Government of Sri Lanka had to deal with in the closing stages of the war.

The third and final Principle, which can certainly be invoked with great persuasive power in defence of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces is the Principle of Proportionality. Just as much as your objective has to be a legitimate objective, the degree of force used must be compatible with the accomplishment of that objective. Excessive force is not permitted. But, when you are dealing with the lives of 300,000 people, who are being held hostage by the LTTE, then, the question is, could the army have done anything else and was the action taken by the army in excess of the force that they should have used in order to achieve an entirely legitimate and indeed essential objective?

So, these are some of the principles of International Law which will be of great assistance to the Sri Lankan Armed Forces as these matters arise in the months ahead. I think there is a definite need to examine these issues in depth and to prepare our case thoroughly and meticulously.

[4.45 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you, Sir. Before I comment on the Motion, I must say that this country got into a right old mess on the international front particularly after the completion of the war, and particularly on account of the manner in which they prosecuted the war, because this country failed to keep the commitments made to the Secretary-General of the UN, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, when he came to this country almost immediately after the war was completed. There was a commitment on the part of this country to the Secretary-General of the UN, that there will be an accountability process which this country will undertake and accomplish, so as you deal with grave violations of International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law, which had come to the forefront. That commitment was made in May 2009, but that commitment was not honoured and this Member who had moved this Motion today, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, a National List Member of Parliament, was the Foreign Minister at that time. He must undertake responsibility for that lapse on behalf of his Government and it was in consequence of the failure on the part of the Government that this country was treated with the utmost disrespect by the entire international community. You are trying to distinguish between Africa, Asia and the role that India played here and there. Well, these are countries that are sympathetic to Sri Lanka; these are countries that are sympathetic to the Sri Lankan people. That is because we are also an Asian country; we are an independent country and they do not like to do anything against us. But, the fact of the matter is, and you must admit it in the national interest, that you and your Government were responsible for the utter disrespect that the international community had for Sri Lanka during your period in Government.

I think the objective of this Motion, Sir, is to draw a red herring across the trail and make a big issue of something. The Country Report of the US State Department talks about the LTTE. We all know that there are remnants of the LTTE in different parts of the world. There is nothing new and the Country Report says that they are engaged in certain activities, which we do not deny. Everybody knows that they are engaged in certain activities. But, what has been the democratic verdict of the people in Sri Lanka, particularly the Tamil people in the North and the East, in the Parliamentary Election of 2010, in the Provincial Council Elections in the Eastern Province in 2012 and the Northern Province in 2013 and in all the Local Authority Elections that have been held over a period of years since the war came to an end? Has the verdict of the people not been that they want a solution within the framework of a united, undivided country to the Tamil question? What have you done about it? Can you honestly say that during your period of Government you did anything towards the resolution of the problem in an amicable way - honestly? We talked to

you and the present Leader of the Opposition in 2011, commencing in January and we had 18 rounds of talks. What progress did you make? Did we make any progress? Did you not as the Government delegation fail to come up with any proposal to bring about a solution to the problem? We gave you our proposals in writing. You assured us that you will respond in writing. For several months you did not respond and did only when I told you that we would not agree to a date being fixed and we adjourned without a date being fixed; that the President had a discussion with me, and we recommenced the process. After we recommenced the process, what happened? You walked away from the process in January, 2012. Did you behave like a responsible Government? Did you make any endeavour to convince the international community that you were sincerely engaged in an honest process to find a solution to the problem? No. On the contrary, you were engaged in a sham. You wanted to deceive us. You wanted to ram down our throats some unacceptable solution. That was the game you were playing. What right do you have to complain?

The country's problem has remained for a long time. But, between 2005 and 2015, until the Presidential Election took place in January 2015, the position has deteriorated as never before, has become much worse. When you were the Foreign Minister, were you not responsible for all that happened in the UN Human Rights Council? I am sorry to say that when you were the Foreign Minister, there were three resolutions adopted by the UN in 2012, 2013, and 2014 and when the resolution was adopted in 2012 and 2013, they only wanted a domestic investigation. If you had set up a domestic investigation at that point of time, the question of an international investigation would never have come up. It came up only for the reason that you defaulted in setting up a local domestic investigation. I was ashamed when I saw you seated on a back seat being the Foreign Minister, when the Minister of Plantation Industries was presenting the case of Sri Lanka before the UN the Human Rights Council. That was your position in the UN Human Rights Council. On that day, I felt ashamed that the Foreign Minister of my country was made to sit on a back bench when the Plantation Industries Minister was presenting Sri Lankas position in the UN Human Rights Council in regard to the Resolution before the Council. That was the position. So, we do not support the remnants of the LTTE activities that maybe taking place in different parts of the world.

Our people have delivered their democratic verdicts. The diaspora is responsible. As you conceded, they comprise of highly educated, highly professional, highly qualified persons in all parts of the world: in the medical field, in the field of science, in the legal field, in the engineering field and in the research field. This country has lost them. You drove them out of the country. You prevented them from coming back. They wanted to come here and invest.

425 426

In October 2010, I met the President alone for one hour. Thereafter, the President summoned you and we offered to work with you. We said, We want to work with you on the matter of resettlement of our people, on the matter of rehabilitation, on the matter of livelihood and that we will get the diaspora to invest largely in Sri Lanka to achieve those objectives. Did you co-operate? Did you agree? Did you implement any programme? You did nothing. You did not want that to happen. You did not want our people to be resettled properly. You did not want our people to be rehabilitated; you did not want our people to get livelihood and now you have become the strongest advocate of anything racist advocated in this country. It is very unfortunate that this type of role is being played by people like you.

At one point of time, during the presidency of Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, we thought you were engaged very seriously in a role to bring about a peaceful resolution to the conflict. You drafted excellent proposals which would termed in this country the "G.L. Peiris-Neelan Tiruchelvam Proposals". Did you stand by them? Did you support them? During the last regime, did you tell President Mahinda Rajapaksa, These are very good proposals which we can implement. Did you ever make any effort honestly and truly to find a solution to the problem? You did nothing of the sort. And, today, the Country Report of the US has come up with certain positions. We will not contradict them. You will contradict anything if that is not acceptable to you. But, we will not do that. That is a matter which needs to be addressed but do not think that all sections of the diaspora are irresponsible; that they do not have an interest for this country at heart. They are persons who are educated; they are persons who would like to return to this country; they are persons who would like to invest their knowledge, their expertise, their experience and their finances in this country. They would like this country to progress. They would not merely invest in the North and the East, they will invest in all parts of the country. So, do not stand in the way of the diaspora returning to the country.

What happened to the Dual Citizenship? You terminated it. You did not give it to a single Tamil person. But, you gave it to everybody else you wanted; not one Tamil person. Why did you do that? Why did you prevent Tamils getting dual citizenship during your time? What is your answer? Not one person was given citizenship. Why did you prevent them? And, you talk about the LTTE. There is a strong belief in this country that President Mahinda Rajapaksa became President in 2005, on account of the LTTE. Can you deny that? Is there not a case pending now where there is a severe fraud, several tens of millions of rupees that was spirited away meant for a housing project, with not one house constructed? Is it not the belief in this country that that money was given to the LTTE and that was how you won

the Election in 2005, by preventing the Tamil people in the North and the East exercising their franchise? And, you want to now talk about the diaspora and talk about safeguarding the interests of the country. You were responsible for jeopardizing the interests of this country. You were responsible for promoting hostility; you were responsible for promoting enmity. At least now, please stop doing that.

There is a new Government; there is a new President; there is a new Prime Minister. We might have a different Prime Minster after the Elections. We are not against the SLFP. We consider the Sri Lanka Freedom Party as a democratic party. We supported President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga in 1994 against Gamini Dissanayake. Again, we supported President Chandrika Kumaratunga in 2000 against Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe. Our people in Jaffna voted for Kobbekaduwa against J.R. Jayewardene. We are not against the SLFP. We look upon the SLFP as a responsible democratic party. But, today some of you have become advocates of persons who want to take over the SLFP, people who have been in alliance with you are having just one Member of Parliament or two Members of Parliament. They want to take over the SLFP and some of you are trying to assist them to take over the SLFP. This is what we are worried about. The SLFP must not go into the wrong hands. The SLFP should remain with persons who are genuinely SLFP. The SLFP should not be in the hands of people who merely want to come to Parliament on the National List. That is not good for this country and the SLFP must not move into the hands of extreme elements who are racists, who are communal, who advocate racism and communalism and who are backbiters for certain persons because they want to remain in politics; they want to remain in Parliament. That is not something to which we can agree.

You talked about 300,000 people being held hostage by the LTTE. Why did you estimate the population in the Vanni at 60,000? Your Government figured out the number of people in the Vanni as 60,000. . ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) They said 70,000. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Right, 70,000 people. You sent food for 70,000; you sent medicine for 70,000 and you sent drinking water for 70,000. People died of starvation; people died due to lack of medicine and people died due to lack of drinking water. People did not have shelter; people lived under trees. Today, you are shedding crocodile tears for them. How dare you do that? Do you not know what you did? And, when the people came out of the war zone, you confined them in camps. Why? Because you had dealt

427 428

[ . ]

2015 25

with them so badly, you did not want them to tell their stories or make their complaints to the world. That is why you confined them to camps and that is how you treated them.

Today, you are complaining about Justice Vigneswaran passing a resolution in Jaffna. He is a democrat. He is entitled to have a resolution passed. That does not make him a terrorist. If you do not accept his resolution, do not do so. As the Chief Minister of the Northern Provincial Council, he is entitled to say, My people are embarrassed and inconvenienced by the presence of the army in such large numbers in Jaffna, kindly remove them. He is entitled to say that. What is wrong about that? Does the fact that Justice Vigneswaran saying that make him a terrorist or make the Tamil people terrorists? People like the Mover of this Motion wants to paint Tamil people as dangerous people. You do not distinguish between any Tamil. You think all Tamils are dangerous people. You want such an impression to be created because you want to justify all the harsh actions that you were engaged in, which you were disappointed and the present Government has reversed. The present Government is acting more sensibly. The present Government is acting in such a way as to win back the international support, as to win back the international respect and to ensure that their view of this country is completely reversed and that the world will support this Government not merely in the resolution of the Tamil question, but will support this country in its march towards progress in the future. That is the reality. So, I think you must stop these games. You must stop trying to stir the pot in the hope that you can create some trouble.

We want our country to be sovereign; we want our people in this country to be sovereign; we want all the people in this country to be sovereign. We are not prepared to sacrifice the sovereignty of this country to anybody, to any other country. But, sovereignty also means that you must treat all the people of this country as equals. All of them have a sovereign right to live as equals in this country. That is their fundamental basic right which you cannot deny and when you deny that sovereignty to a section of the people in this country and when you have consistently done that, how can you talk about sovereignty? Who will take you seriously? Will anybody ever take you seriously? Have I finished my time, Sir? ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, your time is over, Hon. Sampanthan. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Very well, Sir. I will not take anymore time because others also have got to speak.

We would earnestly endeavour to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and those who belong to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, who genuinely belong to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party who are not tagging on to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party for their own objectives, and persons who want the Sri Lanka Freedom Party to remain as a moderate, reasonable, sensible party in this country to adopt a judicious approach, an approach that is guided by reason, that is guided by justice, by equality, by equity and enable this country to move forward under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena, who has been elected as President of this country by the people of this country. I thank you, Sir.

() . [5.18 p.m.] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Madam Chair, I am glad that this topic is being discussed through an Adjournment Motion since I really fear that the antics of this Government are taking us into grave danger. I feel the more worried about this because I was one of those who wanted a "change" at the last Presidential Election. As I made clear at the time, I felt that this was necessary if all of us - by "all of us", I mean

433 434

also the Tamil and Muslim communities that had suffered so much from terrorism - were to benefit fully from the victory over the LTTE that we achieved in 2009.

I wonder, sometimes, if I should feel guilty about having, in a small way, promoted change, but on balance, I think it was clear that the last Government had begun to lose its way in the last few years and was no longer capable of fulfilling the pledges in its Election Manifesto of 2010. And, no one could have anticipated the contempt with which decision-makers in this Government treated their election pledges and the need for full reintegration of those who suffered in the war.

However, I think there is now a silver lining of sorts in that His Excellency the President, whose own commitment to his pledges seems absolute, as well as to the vision of this country that led to the victory of 2009, has begun to realize that some changes in the structure of authority are essential if we are not to collapse again, as we did so spectacularly under some of our previous leaders. In particular, I believe he understands that blind emulation of the foreign policy of J.R. Jayewardene will lead to similar disasters as occurred in the '80s and I am very pleased that the Front Bench of the Government is now full of former Members of the SLFP or people like the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, who supported the victory against the LTTE because they understand what the root causes of that were and I will speak more about that.

However, it seems that the present Minister, despite his background, believes in putting all his eggs into a western basket. This was done by President Jayewardene in the '80s, only to find them taken out again and collectively smashed. In those days, his predilections included hostility to India, which he thought would be fulfilled by cosying up to the West in those Cold War days. But, for obvious reasons, the West did not save him and indeed, I believe he had been advised as such, but ignored the advice and that is why he sent off his Foreign Minister, the Hon. A.C.S. Hameed, to invoke the 1940s Defence Treaty with Britain, only to be politely told that that was not possible.

I do not think this Government will be contemptuous of India for philosophical reasons, but it seems that personal animosities could contribute to similar results. The decision to recall our current High Commissioner in India, one of the most imaginative and knowledgeable to serve there, simply because he was appointed by the last Government, is deeply depressing. There seems absolutely no regard for influential opinion in India which has queried whether a friend of India is being withdrawn. But, let us hope that intentions at least are sound with regard to India even though the blundering continues.

The same cannot be said of what has happened with regard to China, where the blunderbuss approach of the Government may well lead to problems. Only last week we had a report on what the Foreign Minister had said, after which a clarification had to be made, which turned

that Statement upside down. We have already had the Prime Minister attacking Australian policies simply because Australia did not do as he wanted with regard to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. Now, to attack, or create the impression of attacking, a country that has stood by us consistently seems midsummer madness.

Underlying this is a basic simplicity, and I saw as much in the speech of the very able Deputy Foreign Minister, that does not recognize the realities of foreign policy development in other countries. It is for this reason that I welcome the mention in this Motion of the Statement by Senator Patrick Leahy. Such a Statement could well be a precursor to a very hard line, and in particular we have to remember that next year is an election year in the United States when the funding capacity of the TGTE is massive and I fear very much that a harder and harder line will be pressed unless we move very swiftly towards a sensible resolution.

Meanwhile, the Foreign Minister dances with the GTF, which I do not think is bad in itself, but that is not where he should concentrate. Way back in 2009, on the last occasion when I had an executive position as the Head of the Sri Lanka Peace Secretariat, I was told by the Foreign Ministry in London that we should be talking to the Tamils and I said, "Of course, we should be talking to the Tamils. We won this war as much on behalf of the Tamils as the rest of this country" and they said, Yes, you must talk to the TNA and the GTF. I said, How dare you come out with such statements!". I think we should talk to the TNA, the TNA listens perfectly well, this is the stance I have always stood by, but I said that I do not believe we should be told to talk to people who were supporters of terrorism actively. It is the people of Sri Lanka we should be talking to and I do not think that we should dance to the tune of the international community that itself sometimes has to dance to the tune of a diaspora that still has very bitter memories. I can understand why they have bitter memories and I would like to come to that as well, but we cannot run a country on the basis of bitterness.

So, work with the diaspora is essential, more essential is working with those who have suffered in Sri Lanka. I know that reconciliation has been entrusted to the Foreign Minister's former leader and new best friend of the Prime Minister. But, there has been so little done in five months that I can understand why dissatisfaction is growing, and why perhaps the LTTE will find it easier and easier to renew its efforts at terrorism and separation.

Now, I believe, listening to the speeches that have gone before, it is necessary as they have indicated, to look a little bit of the history. I think, in particular, we have to recognize that following the victory of 2009, the last Government did not do many things that it should have done. Although, I was in the forefront of those who kept pressing it and it was all very clearly put forward: the need for an internal inquiry, rapid need, the need for better resettlement, the need for more consultation, I can also understand though I criticized it, the failure of the

435 436

[ () ]

2015 25

Government to move and that had to do with the deep suspicions that have become endemic in this country and for which there is good reason even though I believe we should overcome them. For instance, the distinguished Leader of the TNA is perfectly correct in saying that we should have done more during the negotiations. But, I also think he cannot forget his own admittedly enforced allegiance to the LTTE in the past. I remember, he referred to the discussions that led to what he termed the G.L.Peiris-Neelan Tiruchelvam Agreement and he should not forget the way that Agreement was betrayed and I always was very critical of him. But, he revealed to me three years ago that he had wanted to stand by that commitment, but he had been pushed out of his position by other Members of his party who were in turn under pressure from the LTTE. We know perfectly well that the UNP burnt that Agreement on the Floor of this House and the former President who was under the impression that she had secured the support of both the UNP and the LTTE for the proposal she put forward in 2010, found herself caught in a pincer movement by what seemed extremist Sinhala and extremist Tamil opinion and had to abandon that and I do not think it is correct of the Hon. Sampanthan to only criticize some of those who supported that Agreement then - but, do not mention it now - because his own role was also rather sad.

Similarly, I think we have to remember the claims of the TNA that the LTTE was the sole representative of the people and that is why we missed so much a man of courage like Neelan Tiruchelvam, who stood up against the LTTE. I do not condemn the Hon. Sampanthan because obviously he did not want to face the fate that Neelan Tiruchelvam faced. You know we are sad of Neelan's loss, but we have to remember the domination of the Tamil polity by the LTTE during those years and the way the perfectly-reasonable efforts that were moving forward were stymied.

Similarly, although I do not think it is correct of the last Government not to have done more, I also understand some of its diffidence and, in particular, the way in which the LLRC was treated has been very worrying. I know that when the Government appointed its own LLRC, later than it should have, there was much assumption that it would produce a partisan report. It produced a very good report which was welcomed by everybody, except three public commentaries, one of which was the TNA. The TNAs statement at the time, similar to one by the CPA and another one by the US State Department - not the then Ambassador here - was so critical of the LLRC Report. That, I can understand though I think it was wrong, for the Government also which had tabled that Report to have not implemented it fully, because once you start pulling on to one side, then people on the other side start pulling as well. But, despite that, the LLRC Report developed into an Action Plan. That Action Plan was entrusted to some people who did nothing about it, who are now in positions of great authority, but the Secretary to the President took charge, produced an excellent Action Plan. It had some shortcomings but, at

least, some things went forward. Now, that has been completely forgotten. I was in touch with those who were implementing the Action Plan and I had to speak regularly to the UN and the international community. They were surprised that there is no mention whatsoever of the LLRC and the work it has done in whatever the proposals are, that the committees under the chairmanship of the former President are doing. I think we cannot keep reinventing the wheel. The LLRC, the people who worked on it - the very distinguished Deputy Head was sent into the pool, but I think he is now being rescued - cannot be just cast aside because they worked for the last Government. And, it seems to me tragic that we took so very long to move on reconciliation. It was so, too, with the diaspora. In January or February, there was a continuation of an initiative that I had started many years back to work with young members of the diaspora. They were very positive. But, they felt that they were treated with contempt because all that they were told was investment. They are not cash cows.

I had actually put forward a paper in my brief tenure as a State Minister about using the services of the diaspora that has been completely forgotten. Young people also want to get involved; they do not want to be treated as people who just bring in money. They can help us with education. Many of them did so in small initiatives that I had started as adviser on reconciliation. We should build on those. I sent the former President a copy of the National Reconciliation Policy that was drafted with the support of, I think, the finest minds in the TNA and the UNP. I was very sorry the last Government did not adopt that. And, I got a reply which said, Yes there are some good ideas here; we will think about them and I am astonished that you thought the former President was interested. I mean, scoring debating points on such serious issues is not what we should be doing. That reconciliation policy has a lot to recommend it but by all means, amend it as you wish. But, for God's sake draft and put in place a reconciliation policy soon.

Similarly, we talked about an internal inquiry. I said I was one of those who kept wanting an internal inquiry for many years, I kept recommending it. But, I could understand, though I disagreed, with the philosophy of the last Government who felt beleaguered and threatened and felt that whatever they did would be used against it. I still remember, when I first mentioned the number of casualties, I was attacked by the then Attorney-General who said that the Defence Secretary was very angry with me for giving the figure and he said, Why did you do this? I said, Because it was true. There were a number of figures and that is what we finally think is correct". Then he said, They will use it. And, I realized that this was the case because when I said this on Hard Talk, the answer was, So, you admit. Unfortunately, there are not many people who know how to deal with that. They either say, Yes or No. But, the answer is very clear. Saying that there were civilian casualties is not saying

437 438

that they were inflicted deliberately, and all the evidence we have is during the conduct of the war, we did our best to fight it decently.

I, myself, have written about the need for inquiries as the LLRC had about what happened after the war and I think there is a prima facie case to be looked at and that is what our internal inquiry should be about. But, why has this not happened for five months? In February, when I was a Member of the Government Parliamentary Group, I said,Publish the findings of the Udalagama Commission because there are complaints that our Commissions are not to be trusted. The Udalagama Commission Report, as far as I know, is a very clear document that addresses issues in a way that everyone can accept; it was agreed at the Government Parliamentary Group. The following month, when I went back it was not even minuted. All that was in the minute was how to get cars for MPs and how to find jobs. The Hon. Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs had raised the question publicly, because he said all his supporters wanted jobs and it was minuted. But, the important things were not minuted. The decisions made with regard to promoting good governance and the subcommittee established under the Minister, who has unfortunately now forgotten his responsibilities in that regard for reasons he has explained, but it is a pity. The decision to publish it was not done and when I asked the Hon. Prime Minister he told the Chief Government Whip, Please incorporate this in the minutes and he said he had not had time to look into this, but he would. Nothing has happened and the internationals we talk to said, "This is the type of thing you should be doing. It shows the bona fides". As I said, I can understand, though I regret why the last Government did not publish that, because I believe it is very clear about the need for prosecution in particular of those who killed the "Trinco five". But, as we know, that was an appalling action. It was not done by the armed forces and one of the reasons I was very angry with the last Government for not pursuing that, was by allowing such things to happen they allowed blanket accusations against the army, which as we know, did its best and we also know perfectly well that in the whole campaign in the Eastern Province before the LTTE perfected in its technique of hostage taking, there was only one allegation of civilians being killed and that was well explained by the army. So, these are areas in which we have things that can be answered and it is a great pity that the Government has spent five months doing nothing in this regard. I am very happy that the Minister of Foreign Affairs has now taken upon himself to work on these. I hope he will succeed, but I think the lack of action so far makes me fear the worst.

Finally, Madam Chair, I think we also need to look at what I can only describe as "a mixing of issues", which I hope the Leader of the TNA will also take seriously. I am

sorry that two times my Question was not answered, perhaps because I was present and the Foreign Minister was not; a couple of weeks were asked for that. But, my Question with regard to Ms. Tamara Kunanayakam was answered two Fridays ago when I was away. I am sorry I was not here. But, I was horrified by the answer because that answer is precisely what the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella condemned, this whole idea of LTTE-ising, and what the Minister of Foreign Affairs omitted to say, which I found very shabby, is that the representations made by Ms. Kunanayakam on behalf of a group that was led at the time by Kumar Rupesinghe, was with regard to the events of July 1983, and I hope that you will not believe that people who criticized what happened in 1983 are wrong because we know there were appalling things that happened. We know that the LTTE developed because of what the then Government unleashed in 1983. We know perfectly well that in 1981, when the LTTE wanted the District Development Council elections boycotted, the TULF was able to stand up against it and because of what happened a few months later, in 1982 the TULF had to give in to the LTTE with regard to elections - the burning of the Jaffna Public Library - but, nothing compared with what happened in 1983. And, when the Hon. R. Sampanthan talks about the people fleeing, I can understand why they left.

Yesterday, there was a speech in which it was claimed, I think, by the Hon. Minister of Justice that the Sixth Amendment was introduced in order to stop separatism. He forgot that the reaction of the UNP Government in 1983 to the appalling attacks on Tamils was to introduce this Sixth Amendment on the claim that the government needed to appease the feeling of the Sinhalese who had attacked the Tamils.

That was a credibly shabby behaviour and I believe the Minister of Foreign Affairs - I do not know whether he was involved in politics at that time, we knew each other under different circumstances - knows that what happened in 1983 was appalling; I believe that the Leader of the House knows what happened in 1983 was appalling. And, to condemn Ms. Kunanayakam as an LTTE activist for her outlining of information with regard to that incident is an incredibly shabby behaviour and, I believe, it shows that the Minister of Foreign Affairs is subject to manipulation by the same individuals, who failed when they were entrusted with developing an Action Plan from the LLRC Report. He knows perfectly well that this had been entrusted to the Ministry of External Affairs mistakenly in 2012, and that nothing was done about it. It took Mr. Weeratunga, as I said, to produce an Action Plan.

So, I believe it is important, Madam Chair, if we are going to go back into history - and perhaps we need to go into history as a whole - to look at those people now on the Government side of the House who were responsible for what happened in July, 1983. All of you will recall

439 440

[ () ]

2015 25

that the Prime Minister, at that stage, mitigated what had been done by saying that what Tamils had suffered in the pogrom of 1983 was nothing like what Sinhala entrepreneurs had suffered because of the nationalization policies of the Bandaranaike regime and he claimed, he shed tears on behalf of ship chandlers, sand collectors et cetera, who he said, had suffered an economic deprivation because of the policies of nationalization and he tried to defend what had happened in July, 1983, which was appalling. I know that new allies may forget all that, but I know that the Tamil people are well aware of what was done then and, while I believe, that there is a very strong component of the UNP, I hope all those Members in the Front Bench are those whom I could say have no racism in them, but I think we have to recognize that there was a strong racist streak. I still remember that that particular wing was even talking then of Cyril Mathew being the next leader of the Government, and in such a context, I think we have to remember what happened and how the LTTE managed to emerge.

Now, we have an opportunity because we have a President, who is not racist, but stood firm with the last Government in its struggle against terrorism, did not belittle the achievements of the army like so many Members on that side of the House did, and he did not even try to stop the victorious march of the forces against terrorists. Now that we have a President who can balance the different requirements of this country, I do not see why we are not moving forward; I do not see why we are not setting in place the mechanism for good governance that would ensure proper consultation.

I have said previously that it is the people in the deprived areas who need to be consulted. I think part of the problem is that in Colombo, we either talk to the moderate Colombo Tamils - and there is good reason for that and I have the highest regard for people like the Hon. Sumanthiran as I did for Neelan Tiruchelvam - or we listen to what I call the "ideological extremists" in the North. There is a strong lobby there that has very, very strong feelings. But, what we are missing out on is the ordinary people, the people of the Vanni, the people in the pradeshiya sabhas and the people in the divisional secretariats. When I was the Adviser on Reconciliation, I helped to set up consultation mechanisms, which were working extremely well and, I am happy to say, what the people then told me is that I was the only person who came there. We were talked to about settlement in the North. I was the person who raised that question in the Ministry of Resettlement and I upgraded the present Minister who did not even bother to come and find out. I told him - I never imagined that he would soon be Minister himself because he knew nothing - Mr. Swaminathan, you have to be here. You have to find out what is happening.

It was because of me that the mice who are now roaring about electoral reform actually raised the issue of

settlement in the Northern Province. But, having said that, I think that the process of returning land in the North has been far too slow but even worse, there is no planning. When you are going to do resettlement, you have not only to resettle but you have to work on livelihoods. You cannot go around asking in a vague way as the Minister does, Can I have some money to resettle people? You must have a plan. You must think about employment opportunities, in particular, for women. All that is in our national reconciliation policy, just as it is hinted at in the very good Report of the UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Guarantees of Non-recurrence, Mr. Pablo de Greiff, who was here. We had not even replied to that document. I gather that the Head of the Reconciliation outfit, former President Kumaratunga, was not here to meet him and he was not able to meet the task force. He did meet the Chairman but the Chairman has now resigned. I believe, my old friend Mr. Maliyadda, is now Chairman. Much can be done, but if you start from scratch, you will not get very far.

Sir, it is absolutely essential to look at all the documentation: we have a Human Rights Action Plan, we have an LLRC Action Plan, we have a draft National Policy on Reconciliation done with full consultation. These should be the basis on future action. We cannot depend on ad hoc meetings in London with people from the GTF, who had a very different agenda in the past. I do not see any reason not to try to reclaim them, but why do we not actually work with those who were willing to work with us three years ago - the young people, the people in the North ? Why do we not actually set in place a consultative process instead of hugging things?

When I told the former President, You should really be doing more, he said , . Now, we have even more s on the part of the Government. Indeed most of the happens on the part of the Prime Minister, who will not allow capable people to move forward. So, Sir, this is a very timely motion. We have to remember that reconciliation must begin at home. We have recommendations in the LLRC that can easily be implemented. These should be taken forward with full consultation of those officials who have been involved in such matters in the past, and then in arranging our foreign policy, we have to engage in much deeper thinking. When I was helping to draft the manifesto, which has now been, I think, totally violated, we talked about a Professional Foreign Service. This was interpreted to me into as to call back everyone who was not a member of the Foreign Service except a few retired people and Mr. Gamini Rajapakse, former Member of Parliament in Jordan. But, now it has turned into call back everyone the last government appointed and not what should be the case, which I suggested in the papers I fleshed out and which I sent to the Minister of Public Administration, Local Government and Democratic Governance, how you

441 442

actually have some clear criteria on making appointments, how you develop policy and how you improve your think tanks.

I just saw recently that the last Head of the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute for International Relations and Strategic Studies has delivered a stalling account of the new favourite of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ms. Kshenuka Seneviratne, who had actually tried to stop him from interacting internationally and pushing a course of reconciliation when he delivered some papers and she had basically tried to get rid of him by trying to limit his freedom of expression.

There was an admirable reply that he sent, but this is the person who is now the flavour of the month of the Foreign Minister and has contributed to this outrageous attack on Tamara Kunanayakam. There is another situation where the Foreign Ministrys spokesperson, my old friend and a very good Service Officer, Maheshini Colonne, has to do damage control all the time. The "Daily Mirror" had approached Tamara Kunanayakam as had the TNL, to ask why the Foreign Minister had said that they could not get hold of you. Later, when it was explained that she was in the country and was easily accessible, the Foreign Minister had to say, No, we have never said anything of the sort. Now, the real tragedy about all this is that we find personal vendettas are destroying the interests of this country. Tamara Kunanayakam had been appointed Chair of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Right to Development and instructions were sent by this Government to stop her being re-appointed. Even the last Government which was very annoyed with her - rather some people in the Foreign Ministry - did not try to stop her. This time those instructions were sent and when I asked the Foreign Minister, he said that he did not know about this. But, the Finance Minister let the cat out of the bag by saying, "Why should he appoint her because she is trying to sue the Foreign Minister." Now, we find that this lady who did so much for the Non-Aligned Movement and was highly regarded has been removed and the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, which the West did not particularly want to take forward is now stymied. Now, we are not here to actually follow a myopic foreign policy as happened in the '80s. I think what we want to do is, omnidirectional. "Omnidirectional" does not mean hitting out on all sides as seems to have been the case occasionally, in particular, for instance, the attack on Australia. But, I think what it means is, following the principles of Non-Alignment. If you look at the Presidents Manifesto, this is what he said in the Manifesto, "To develop relations with Asian countries: India, China et cetera". This does not preclude improving relations with the West, which I think is very important. But, to imagine that this can be exclusive is extremely myopic. And, if you study history, - I am glad

so many people did talk about history - you will realize that in the last resort the West had its own predilections, the West had interest groups. People like Senator Leahy are going to be very, very important and that is why putting all your eggs into one basket will lead you having them smashed as happened to President Jayewardene and the Foreign Minister, Hameed, way back in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987.

Now, I have here with me a news item that appeared on the "dailymirror.lk" website on 15th August, 2012 captioned Tamil Diaspora delegation meets Gota, which states, I quote:

Former LTTE Chief Arms procurer Kumaran Pathmanathan (KP) said a group of 22 members of the Tamil diaspora from Canada, Australia and five European Countries had visited Sri Lanka last week and held talks with Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa in Colombo.

, . The LankaTruth website published a news item titled Heres the relationship between Mahinda & Tamil diaspora on 17th December, 2014, which states, I quote:

It is revealed that Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, who has again started saying there is an international conspiracy to take him to the electric chair, has very close relationships with the Tamil diaspora.

It is revealed through internet that there had been a meeting between Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa and a group including Dharmalingam Lokeshwaran, a former activist of the LTTE and a person who has had special knowledge regarding collecting money for the LTTE.

There is not only the news item, but here are the pictures. There are pictures of the former President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, basically embracing the Tamil diaspora. I am not complaining about it. Here, are also pictures of the former President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, posing with very pretty girls from the Tamil diaspora and their family members.

It amounts to high treason. One day even you might have to be tried for high treason, God forbid! This is negligence on the part of the Foreign Ministry. I am just expressing an idea, but it was a very, very serious flaw or a serious mishap as far as our foreign policy is concerned.

Madam, I explained to the House yesterday, in response to a Questions raised by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, that the US State Department Report titled, Country Reports on Terrorism and Patterns of Global Terrorism that was released this month is not something new. It has followed other Reports of this nature, which the US State Department is bound by law to submit annually, and has been submitting since 2004. I also explained that the Report that was issued recently was the

Report covering activity in 2014, which fell under the purview of the previous administration.

This statement, Madam, was part of a general description of where the LTTE would receive its external funding in the past, and is not an indicator of current activity. But, I must also say that our Government is not sufficiently "blue-eyed" to claim that such funding activities have ceased completely since our Government has come into power. What the Report does say about current activities, however, is that there are still some LTTE supporters, strength unknown, 13 of who were arrested last year, and that their financial networks continued to operate throughout the year 2014.

This information is well known to most Sri Lankans. Further, it is very well known to my predecessor, the Hon. Prof. G.L. Peiris who has called for this Debate today. He knows very well that the Report pertains to the period under his purview. He also knows very well, having held the post of Foreign Minister of the previous Government, the concerns that the international community had at the time regarding Sri Lanka: the drifting of this nation towards authoritarianism, the disregard for the grievances of the Tamil population in the North, the breakdown of law and order, the clamping down on any expressions of concern or dissent, the narrowing of space for civil society, the tendency to brand as terrorists even those who merely expressed concerns regarding the welfare of the people. He also knows of the increase of terror and fear of Sri Lankan people under the activities of the State, including the terror created by radical groups like the BBS, who, as I claimed even then, were funded by the Ministry of Defence of Sri Lanka.

He knows all this very well. He also knew that these concerns had given rise to serious concerns among the international community and the local public as well regarding the real possibilities of the LTTE regrouping; not only the LTTE, but even the possibility of sensible, rational and responsible citizens of this country being pushed to contemplate violence as a means of having their concerns addressed. In fact, I sincerely believe that had your Government continued, had the Presidency not been rescued in January, the LTTE would have regrouped and resurfaced much earlier because of your short-sighted triumphant policies which may have created many more young Prabhakarans for the future.

Madam, while creating fear and paranoia among our citizens, and giving the impression of an effective strong-man approach to defeating terrorism, the previous Government gave pardon to the very man who took control of the LTTE after Prabhakarans death - KP. Not only that, but KP was allowed to live in Kilinochchi and take charge of an NGO handling refugees and victims and, as I just mentioned, even the coordination of the diaspora.

This is a man who is believed to possess information on the LTTEs vast international assets. So, why was the Government protecting him? Moreover, why was the Government protecting him when previous US State Department reports noted that the LTTE financial networks continued to function?

In fact, the same Report in 2013 actually said that these were functioning very effectively even in that year and instead of questioning or taking action against KP, you actually made him a close buddy of the First Family. Our Government, on the other hand, banned KP from leaving the country in February and is investigating his activities. So, we may freeze once and for all, the financial networks of the LTTE.

Madam, our Government is continuing to intensify relations with our intelligence networks abroad and has increased access to real time information from these sources about the activities of the LTTE. In fact, the Statement issued by the State Minister of Defence, the Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana has very rightly rejected the statements made by some Opposition politicians and former Defence Secretary, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, on the countrys national security. He notes that not only are previous security measures being sustained, but that under the present Leadership, the Tri-forces and Intelligence Services are active and effective as never before.

Today, the Government is renewing its relations with the international community. Today, we are engaging with our bilateral partners as opposed to just lecturing to them and talking with them, which the previous Government used to do. We engage in conversations with them in a rational manner on what our real concerns are and we are able to take steps to build confidence, so that we can share information, share intelligence and work together to combat terrorism.

The Opposition is now keen to benefit from public US intelligence reports about the LTTE, but we are disappointed then that they continue to talk along the lines of international conspiracies. This Government has always taken the line that we will not allow - as I have said several times before here - an international investigation..

However, we have always maintained that we will use a credible, local mechanism with international technical assistance in keeping with the mandate His Excellency President Maithipala Sirisena received on the 8th of January. If you actually look at the 100-Day Manifesto, Item 93 clearly states that we will establish a domestic mechanism in order to meet the allegations of human rights violations and even perhaps allegations of war crimes.

Establishing a credible mechanism to deal with the allegation of serious human rights violations during the latter part of the conflict, is something that the previous Government failed to do, which opened the doors to international scrutiny, and has prevented the Sri Lankan people from being able to achieve closure and move on from its violent past. This only gave the international community an opening to interfere with the domestic affairs of our country. In fact, failures of the previous Government investigations to achieve credibility and plausibility, prompted the creation of the OHCHR investigation on Sri Lanka in a Resolution adopted in March, 2014. So, it is actually the previous Governments failures to establish legitimacy that is responsible. It is the timely entrance of a new Government in January this year, with a firm commitment to a credible domestic mechanism, that has enabled us to taper the call for an international investigation imposed on Sri Lanka by the international community.

Madam Chair, defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country is essential to the foreign policy of our nation. As this House is aware, sovereignty carries with it great responsibility, which involves duties towards the countrys citizens. When a Government fails to discharge such duties, external intervention of an unwelcome nature is difficult to prevent.

The previous Government, regrettably, failed to pursue the path of domestic peace-building and by refusing to address issues of concern locally, the Government alienated communities within the country as well as Sri Lankas international partners. This is what led to our nation becoming the subject of successive Resolutions in Geneva.

Madam, it is the previous Government, by opening up this nation to international ignominy through its failures in fulfilling duties it owed to its people, that Sri Lanka was made vulnerable to intrusive external intervention, placing the nations sovereignty and territorial integrity at risk.

Let me also respond to the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris next allegation that by our domestic mechanism benefitting from international expertise, it effectively becomes an international investigation. Let me remind this House that accepting and using international expertise is something even the Rajapaksa Government loved to do at great expense at that time to our country . Under the Rajapaksa regime, the Central Bank - () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) I did not say that. I did not object to international expertise. That is wrong. I asked in what - [Interruption.].

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) When you read between the lines, you were basically saying that by having international expertise, it may become an international investigation. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) I wanted to ask what are the limits - [Interruption.] I did not object to international investigation. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I would also like to remind this House that under the last regime - I know that you were usually unaware of the fact that many of these funds came from the Central Bank and not from the Foreign Ministry - the Central Bank and other Government institutions spent Rs. 2 billion on international PR firms to enhance the poor reputation they created for themselves. This included firms such as Thompson Advisory Group, Beltway Government Strategies and Liberty International Group, all of which, I believe, were hired on the whims and fancies of - I do not know what you call him - the Member of Parliament, who monitored even your activities. In fact, I know that sometimes even your conversations were taped and sent to his room for him to listen. Further, on 17th July, 2014, President Rajapaksa announced that the panel of international legal experts, who were to advise his Commission on Disappearances, would also investigate abuses committed during the final stages of Sri Lankas civil war. He, therefore, publicly noted that international experts would be advising him on violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law.

International legal advisers and a former international judge were appointed by President Rajapaksa for the purpose of soliciting international expertise. Documents note that just for seven months, more than Rs.135 million of tax-payers' money had been paid out to them as well as others who were connected with this exercise. In fact, some of these experts were paid nearly Sterling Pounds 55,000 a month for their activities.

Madam Chair, the Rajapaksa Government hired international expertise at the expense of the tax-payer instead of receiving it out of goodwill of our friends. Our close partners and friends in the international community who helped us fight the LTTE, drifted away from us after May, 2009. It is important to ask the previous Government why this was allowed to happen.

Why is it that these very countries that helped us fight the LTTE, later initiated action against Sri Lanka in the Human Rights Council in Geneva? Why did the previous Government allow such a situation to develop and allow

the countrys image to sink to the lowest depths imaginable? I hope, Madam Chair, even if my predecessor cannot answer these questions now, he should, for his own benefit, search his conscience as to why he allowed some of these things to happen.

In my earlier incarnation as Foreign Minister, I expended great effort to list the LTTE - as I mentioned earlier - as a terrorist organization by the EU in 2006. That, Madam Chair, was not achieved alone. The unanimity needed to arrive at such a decision was achieved with some help from our friends in the US State Department then. Friendly and responsible foreign governments who stood with us to combat terrorism assisted us. They investigated the LTTE and shared that information with the members of the EU.

We must, in the interest of national security, raise the question as to why the previous Government allowed that listing, which was achieved with such effort with the support of the international community, to be annulled last year on the 16th of October by the General Court of the European Union. It is pertinent to have an inquiry on why such an important matter with serious implications for national security was not taken seriously. Why was there no timely intervention by the Government at the time to prevent the delisting? Also, there were remarks relating to the High Commissioner for Human Rights at the opening of the currently ongoing 29th Session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. The High Commissioner did something on the 15th of June this year, which the Council had not seen done in a long time with reference to Sri Lanka.

Madam Chair, he reflected in his remarks the opportunity that has opened up in Sri Lanka - the renewed hope for democracy and the rule of law - with the passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. This is something which this House can take pride in collectively, because we all voted for it collectively, and work together to give effect to the provisions of that Amendment.

Madam, having informed the Human Rights Council of the renewed hope for democracy and the rule of law in Sri Lanka, what the High Commissioner for Human Rights went on to say is that his office will remain engaged in discussions with Sri Lankan authorities on the need for transparent and inclusive processes to develop credible processes to develop credible mechanisms for accountability and reconciliation ahead of my report to the September Session. The High Commissioner is merely reflecting on our consensual approach for broad consultations with all political parities, civil society and above all, victims and their families to take place in the lead up to September before establishing a domestic mechanism. We will conduct consultations to ensure full national support and ownership of processes. This Government fully recognizes the importance of consultations and transparency.

Madam Chair, I wish to point out here that it was the complete lack of any form of consultations with civil society groups or political parties or victims by the previous regime that resulted in the setting up of flawed processes and programmes that contributed in large measure to the loss of credibility in whatever the previous Government undertook to do, both in the eyes of the local public as well as the international community. Not even were the views of public officials given any consideration at the time, except for the views of those who said that all that the previous Government was doing was well and good, and wise. Not only that, even the wise counsel given by the Commission of Inquiry on Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation, a Commission appointed by President Rajapaksa , itself was ignored.

All this contributed to Sri Lanka losing the best opportunities it had after the end of 30 years of conflict to rebuild its institutions, restore democracy, rule of law and good governance practices, heal hearts and minds, enhance the capacities and skills of its human resources - the administrative and other services including the foreign and judicial services.

The Hon. (Prof.) Peiris has selectively singled out the remarks of Senator Leahy pertaining to the establishment of a domestic mechanism. I would like to ask the Hon. Member of Parliament, whether he recalls the nature of statements that were made with reference to Sri Lanka by foreign policy experts during the time he was the Minister of External Affairs and ask whether there was anything complimentary being said? Senator Leahy compliments Sri Lanka for its recent achievements , some of which are: the passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the inclusion of the Right to Information in the Constitution as a fundamental right, the revival of relations with the United Nations, the decision to revive accountability for human rights violations, the decision to pursue the twin agenda of reconciliation and development, the return of land to its original owners, reaffirmation of media freedom, re-establishment of judicial independence, and commitment to fighting corruption.

In the recent 2015 Elections, which had the highest-ever turnout and was an overwhelming victory, the President made very clear, the need to establish a national independent judicial mechanism. This is expressed clearly in his 100-Day Manifesto, under Item 93, which states, I quote:

"Since Sri Lanka is not a signatory to the Rome Statute regarding international jurisdiction with regard to war crimes, ensuring justice with regard to such matters will be the business of national independent judicial mechanisms."

Thus, it has been mandated by this Government and the people of Sri Lanka also.

In conclusion, I would like to say, Madam Chair, that Sri Lanka has had a long tradition of respect for the rule of law and accountability at all levels and in relation to all matters of public life, including administrative and financial matters. We saw a general deterioration of these practices in the years of conflict. It is in our countrys long-term interest and in the interest of future generations that we must restore these practices of accountability and not take cover behind imagined threats to national security. If we continue the practice of the last Government of conjuring up threats to national security and clamping down on civil liberties for short-term electoral gain without actually engaging with the public and our international partners to address real threats as opposed to imagined threats, then we will surely jeopardize national security and place this countrys future in peril.

Thank you. . . 6.30 . , 2015 26 . . 1.30 . , . . 6.30 , . , 2015 26, . . 1.30
