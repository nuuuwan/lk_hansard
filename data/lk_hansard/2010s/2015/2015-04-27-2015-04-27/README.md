Speaker has received a copy of it. None of us have received it and I do not think even the Hon. Leader of the Opposition has received it because if he had, he would have circulated it to all other Party Leaders. This Bill, which has been referred to the Supreme Court, has also not been tabled before Parliament. So, how can it be referred to the Supreme Court?

... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Disaster Management) Sir, on the incident of the severe earthquake that occurred on the 25th of April, 2015 in Nepal, the following actions have been taken by the relevant organizations: the Sri Lanka Army has taken immediate action to send a Special Emergency Response Team consisting of 48 personnel, including four doctors to the affected area for response activities along with the following items. The items are: water, tents, communication equipment, ration packs, medical items, travellers kits and passenger baggages. In addition to that, today and tomorrow we are making arrangements to send 25 more doctors. Initiatives are also being taken to bring 83 Sri Lankans back to Sri Lanka as early as possible.

Representatives from the following organizations have been deployed at the Disaster Management Centre to follow up action and coordinate appropriate activities in respect of the incident. They are: the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defence, the three Armed Forces and the Department of Police. Action has been taken to collect relief items from the public and donor agencies by the Disaster Management Centre and the Disaster Relief Centre in order to distribute them among the affected people. We have opened a Nepal Earthquake Victims' Fund under the Ministry of Disaster Management . The account number will be given later.

In addition to that, we have opened a 24-hour Centre to get information and also to give information to the families that are related. The telephone numbers are: 2136136 and 2136255.

Thank you.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Speaker, I associate myself with the sentiments expressed by the Members of this House with regard to the disaster that has taken place in Nepal, and on behalf of our Party, I wish to thank the Government for all the steps that have been taken.

I also wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by the Opposition benches with regard to the Urgent Bill procedure. It is an undesirable practice. Nevertheless, as the Opposition Members say, if the Nineteenth Amendment is taken up without any further delay and it is passed tomorrow, then it will not be possible to take up the Bill that has been referred to the Supreme Court as an Urgent Bill thereafter. So, if the Members of Parliament are keen that the Urgent Bill procedure should not be proceeded with hereafter, all that

we have to do is to quickly pass the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) .

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) copy . Urgent Bill . ? . . . , you have rushed in a Bill to the Supreme Court. We are unaware of it as Members of Parliament. You must give us a copy and you must also give a copy to the Hon. Speaker. Otherwise, it has no validity. We will have to oppose it from the very beginning.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Can I finish off? We will send you copies of it. . . All right; we are willing to do that.

Now, you have agreed that we should not bring this in as an Urgent Bill. Then, the second matter is, there will not be urgent bills. So, we would not bring in any urgent bills as you are going to oppose it. Okay, you have the majority. - [Interruption.] Yes. "Procedure" means there should not be urgent bills. So, that is what we have said.

. [11.27 a.m.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I am happy, Sir, that the environment in the House indicates that we are moving towards a consensus on this question, which is a matter of great national importance. As His Excellency the President mentioned, in the course of his speech in the morning, the institution of the Executive Presidency in this country had been under criticism from the time it came about in 1978.

I propose, in the course of my brief speech, Sir, to only make reference to some of the positive features in this Nineteenth Amendment, which in my view, will restore the sovereignty of the people, restore democracy and ensure good governance. One of the biggest problems we had with the Executive Presidency was that this Parliament, this institution of the Legislature, lost its independence. The Legislature was in the precarious position of being possibly dissolved by the President at his wish at the end of one year. It was the sword of Damocles dangling over the head of Legislature all the time. That was, in my respectful view, thoroughly unwarranted and was a great deterrent to the independence, the integrity and the efficacy of the Legislature. This Legislature lost its decorum; it lost its dignity, because the Legislature was at the mercy of the President. I am happy that under this Amendment, that provision is being done away with.

531 532

Sir, the Members of Parliament crossed freely the Floor of this House abandoning the political parties through which they were elected to this House, and thereby the sovereignty of the people was being violated. The franchise of the people was being disrespected, was being disregarded. Franchise is part of the sovereignty of the people. But, that was disregarded because Members of Parliament crossed over to become Ministers, Deputy Ministers or whatever. There is a provision in the Nineteenth Amendment, which prevents the courts from interfering with the disciplinary action that a party can take against a Member of Parliament who behaves in that way. That, in my respectful submission, is a very welcome provision, which will again ensure that the dignity and the decorum of the Legislature is preserved.

The re-establishment of the Constitutional Council which is going to be entrusted with the task of accepting the recommendation of the President in regard to appointments to the higher judiciary: the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, is a very welcome provision. We observed in this country a situation in the past several years where nobody in this country had any faith in the independence or the integrity of the judiciary. The judiciary was highly suspected of being partisan, suspected of being functional in accordance with the whim of the Executive. But, with the restoration of the independent appointments to the higher judiciary, one can expect that the independence of the judiciary will be maintained and thereby the respect, the decorum and the dignity of the judiciary will be sustained.

Thereafter, Sir, we have the independent institutions: the Election Commission, the Public Service Commission, the National Police Commission, the Human Rights Commission, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, the Delimitation Commission, the Finance Commission and, included now, are the Audit Service Commission and the National Procurement Commission. It is absolutely fundamental that these institutions must, in the interest of good governance, function independently and that the Chairman and the Members of these Commissions must be appointed by an independent body like the Constitutional Council to ensure that the rights of the people, that the good interests of this country are at all times protected and that is the primary criterion on the basis of which these institutions make judgments. If that position is not there, these institutions will become subservient to and tools in the hands of the Executive. That should not be permitted. I am happy, Sir, that the provisions in the Nineteenth Amendment will ensure the independence and thereby the impartial functioning of these institutions, so as to ensure good governance.

These are, Sir, the welcome features in the Nineteenth Amendment which will enable the people of this country

to feel strong, to feel that they are sovereign and that when the Legislature or the Executive or the Judiciary exercises power in their respective fields, they do so in keeping with the Constitution in the best interests of the people and the country and not to serve the interests of an Executive who might have his own agenda.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair.

, [ ] .

, , [ ] . Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. CHANDIMA WEERAKKODY] took the Chair.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you can continue with your speech.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Of course, there is the question of the powers of the President in relationto the position of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers. We have a President who does not want to be the President again. We have a President who says, "I do not want too much power. I want to share power with others"., That seems to be the approach of our present President. That is a very healthy sign. It is not merely a healthy sign for him, it is a very healthy sign for this country. It is something we should all appreciate. But there is a provision in the Constitution, which gives the President executive power and the Supreme Court has held that you cannot violate that provision of the Constitution that unless the President permits someone else to whom he delegates the executive power to exercise the executive power, the executive power must be exercised by the President. Of course, he will have to act on the advice of the Prime Minister in certain situations. This is the matter that the Prime Minister, the President and we, the Members of Parliament, should discuss and resolve in an amicable way. We need to ensure that the executive power of the President does not become such a monstrous power that can lead to totalitarianism and dictatorship.

Under the Eighteenth Amendment, the limitation of the office of President of two terms had been done away with. That is very unfortunate. In many countries the world over, presidents do not function for more than two terms. But, here, that provision was done away with so as to enable the President to carry on for any number of terms. Such a provision must inevitably lead to

533 534

[ . ]

2015 27

dictatorship. It must lead to authoritarianism; it must lead to totalitarianism and that is what was happening in this country before the 8th of January. On the 8th of January, the people delivered a very clear verdict. The verdict of the people must be respected. Candidate Maithripala Sirisena went before the country and wanted the powers of the executive presidency curbed in such a way that this country will not become the victim of a dictatorship, of authoritarianism and the people voted for that. The people supported him in regard to that. The people wanted that to be achieved. So, this Amendment is being brought to Parliament in those circumstances, in keeping with the verdict of the people, who are sovereign and who are entitled to ask this Parliament to enforce their wish. Therefore, Sir, I hope Parliament enacts this Nineteenth Amendment tomorrow. By that, this Parliament will be acting strictly in keeping with the wishes of the people and the verdict they delivered on the 8th of January.

I do not wish to say anything more, Sir, but I do think quite firmly that the enactment of the Nineteenth Amendment and adequate necessary provisions in regard to the relationship between the President, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers, as contained in this Nineteenth Amendment, will eventually lead to democracy being restored in this country, to ensure that the people in the country will be sovereign and be the real repositories of legislative, executive and judicial power with certain institutions exercising that power on their behalf and that the dignity and the independence of the several institutions which exercise sovereign power on behalf of the people will be restored and sustained.

In most of the petitions, the Petitioners argued that the Bill alters the basic structure of the Constitution by diminishing the final discretionary authority of the President to make decisions concerning executive governance and thereby violates the basic structure of the Constitution.

. . . I quote:

"(a) The legislative power of the People shall be exercised by Parliament.

555 556

.

"(b) The executive power of the People, including the defence of Sri Lanka, shall be exercised by the President....

. the judicial power of the people . ? . .

, . I quote:

The first two Articles in Chapter VIII of the Constitution are of crucial importance in describing the structure in which executive power was sought to be distributed.

42 43 . 1978 43 . .

. VII - The Executive, The President of the Republic; - VIII - The Executive, The Cabinet of Ministers - IX - The Executive, The Public Service - "" . ; . .. . ,

"Therefore, executive power should not be identified with the President and personalized and should be identified at all times as the power of the People.

. , his executive functions must be retained by the President " .

, Clause 11 42(3) - "The Prime Minister shall be the head of the Cabinet of Ministers" - , . 43(1) - The Prime Minister shall determine the number of Ministers of the Cabinet of Ministers, and the Ministries and the assignment of subjects and functions to such Ministers - . , Referendum . 43 (3) - The Prime Minister may at any time change the assignment of subjects and functions and recommend to the President changes in the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers. ...... - . 44(2) - "The Prime

Minister shall determine the subjects and functions which are to be assigned to Ministers appointed under paragraph (1) of this Article,..... - . 44(3) - "The Prime Minister may at any time change any assignment made under paragraph (2)" - . 44(5) , "At the request of the Prime Minister, any Minister of the Cabinet of Ministers may by Notification published in the Gazette, delegate to any Minister who is not a member of the Cabinet of Ministers, any power or duty pertaining to any subject or function assigned to such Cabinet Minister, or any power or duty conferred or imposed on him or her by any written law, and it shall be lawful for such other Minister to exercise and perform any power or duty delegated notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the written law......... . , .

, Clause 5, "33 (1) The President shall be the symbol of National unity.

. . , ? I quote:

Respect the National Flag and it will inspire you...

, . . . . It goes on, I further quote:

This is the basic message of the National Flag. It is a message which should reach every Sri Lankan because the National Flag is a symbol of our motherland, our Independence and the unity of our People. It is a symbol of our hopes and aspirations in the Nations future.

. ( ) (An Hon. Member) Then, what about the National Anthem?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) National Anthem , National Flag . , symbol .

. I again quote:

"National Flag is the symbol of the unity of our People. Considering the above, we are of the view that paragraph 33(1) in Clause 5 is incorrect and be deleted.

Regarding Right of access to information, Clause 2(d) states, I quote:

(d) any other person,

being information that is required for the exercise or protection of the citizens rights.

Then, Clause 2(3) states, I quote:

(3) In this Article, citizen includes a body whether incorporated or unincorporated, if not less than three-fourths of the members of such body are citizens..

. , ? . . .

, . 33 . - - .

You have included this under Clause 5, which states; "(1) The President shall be the symbol of National unity. It violates another Article of the Constitution. This was included deliberately. But, luckily it was challenged. Today, you have come back and agreed to delete it.

Then, the Clause 5 (b) which reads as ensure and facilitate the preservation of religious and ethnic harmony; is regarding Article 9 of the Constitution. It is an entrenched provision of the Constitution. And, knowing very well that there is a provision like this, you all entered this into the Draft.

. . He said that we are ending a dictatorship. But, it took 30 years for him to utter these words. He was waiting till a new President came to utter these words. For 30 years, the LTTE and its fascism ruled the North and the East but the Hon. Sampanthan did not get up a single day in this Parliament and say, democracy in our areas have been lost to us. We restored democracy in the North and the East. It was President Mahinda Rajapaksa who restored democracy and brought about victory to the Tamil people against fascism. Sir, I would like to remind that to this House because it should go on record so that the younger generation will remember when they read this constitutional debate in future that utterances like this are very unreasonable.

Sir, let me take this opportunity to speak a few words on the Nineteenth Amendment, which I think is a very important piece of legislation. It has come at a time when it is more appropriate to have the Executive Presidency abolished rather than to have it amended, but let it be so.

Sir, you know that Sri Lanka gained Independence in 1948. The Donoughmore Commission was established in order to bring the Rule of Law in this country. The Executive System that was introduced then still stands the test of time today. Unfortunately, arrogating powers of such executive committees have been found to be detrimental to the efficacy of the system that is prevailing today. Now, from today we are getting back to those days when there was a much more harmonious relationship rather than the acrimonious situation that prevails today.

Sir, what basically is being discussed today is the necessity of the Constitution, which is required to ensure that the elected Members discharge their obligations for the good of the people. It is generally known that a democratic government is: of the people, by the people and for the people. But, does it happen? It is certainly by the people. But, is it for the people? No, the temporary powers that have been bestowed on the Members of Parliament are being used to the detriment of the people. That is why it is being looked at so scornfully and people are saying that anything is better than what we have today.

In 1931, when the Donoughmore Constitution was put in place, it basically helped to bring in our own type of leadership in the country that was governed by foreigners. Then, in 1948, owing to the ambitious struggle of people like the Hon. D.S. Senanayake, Dr. T.B. Jayah and Sir Baron Jayatilaka, we managed to gain Independence. From 1948, we had the system being put to test and certainly we were able to move forward.

Then, in the late 1940s, the Donoughmore Constitution was replaced by the Soulbury Constitution and from there onwards, it went on until the First Republican Constitution was adopted in 1972. It was the first tailor-made Constitution for our country. But, certainly, it was a time when the country was divided, polarized and for the first time, there was a feeling that there would be a breach of trust among the Sinhalese, the Tamils and the Muslims in the country. So, while trying to adopt our own homegrown type of system in the Constitution, what finally happened was, it only divided the country that was so much together earlier.

Before 1972, the Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims, the Burghers and the Malays, all felt that they were Sri Lankans. But, unfortunately, the adoption of the Republican Constitution departed from the Ceylonese concept and brought about in the hearts and the minds of the people that there was a division: you are in this camp and we are in that camp and that broke into the spirit of the Ceylonese concept that was there. And, to date, I do

not think that we have been able to repair that. That led to many divisions and distrust among the people.

Even today, Sir, you, in the Chair, talk of affirmative action simply because you do not trust the system and it is quite right. After all, affirmative action is not something strange to Sri Lanka. It stems from the United States of America; it is in the British System and that is where you can basically cherish and bring in your contribution to the country, but there is a dent that is yet to be corrected.

Then, in 1978, with the strength and power of the United National Party, the late Hon. J.R. Jayewardene decided that there should be a change and the Second Constitution was enacted. That has stood good up to this moment. It has been amended 18 times and it is to be amended for the 19th time and, maybe, for the 20th time as well. But, are we heading towards where we have got to go? I am a great believer that the Executive Presidency should be abolished and it should not be a half-baked system, which we should keep in its present form.

After the Presidential Election, there were minor divisions in the heterogeneous Alliance that His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena put together and we did not want to deter or upset them getting together. As a result, the abolition was reduced to an eradication of certain draconian powers that were there. Certainly, it is a step in the right direction but it is not in the real direction that we need to go. That is why we are talking of the Nineteenth Amendment, which is being debated from all sides. If you abolish it, it will be one system; if you keep it, it will be another system and if you try to merge or to reduce powers of one and give it to another, it will basically be another system with a different approach which we may have to go ahead with.

So, today we are trying to move amendments to the existing Constitution and I hope, before too long, that we will able to bring in completely a new Constitution which will be, by the people, for the people, through the hearts and the minds of the people and that is what we have got to look at. But, in the interim, let us see how we have got to move forward. As I said before, the Donoughmore Constitution was put in place in 1931 and the Soulbury Constitution was brought into existence in 1944.

Sir, with regard to the abolition of the Executive Presidency, this is something which we felt is very inimical. The late President J.R. Jayewardene, the very architect of this system, brought in this with the view to have a strong leadership at the centre, divided and delegated among the Cabinet of Ministers and to ensure that that benefit percolates down to the entire country from a central point to a decentralized point and then to a district system. As you know, if the head is clean it goes down the line but if there is a problem at the top, the very aspect of that flows down and the entire system gets corrupted.

Sir, what started in 1978 is not what ended up in 2015. We had Mr. J.R. Jayewardene who contested twice and managed to ensure that it was kept afloat, and in 1988, we had Mr. R. Premadasa elected. Certainly, there was a different style of action and today we still have the repulsive feeling that certain powers were arrogated and a one-man show was established in a very autocratic style; this went on. Then, in the interim, we had Mr. D.B. Wijetunga stepping in after the untimely demise of the then President Premadasa. As Mr. D.B. Wijetunga was not elected, his style was much more calm and collected. In 1994, we had Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga taking over and that style was completely new to the system. She was elected twice and even though there was a promise to abolish the Executive Presidency, it was never done.

Then, we had the election again in 2005. With a slender majority, Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa got elected defeating the present Prime Minister and what a change it was! That was the beginning of the end of the fast-eroding democracy, which had the last light of flame and that was also flicked off. So, this is where it started. In 2005, he was elected and in 2010, he won with a steamrolling majority once again and that was what devastated the democratic rights of the people of this country. You had everything brought into one man and that was a suicidal approach.

As my Colleague, the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, the Minister of Justice mentioned, you had a person at the helm of all operations, the President, basically utilizing his powers to give money to the then terrorist group, the LTTE. Rupees 760 million was offered officially and it was routed through the Ministry of Finance and Planning to the RADA and they had given it for a non-existent project. Who was the carrier? It was Hon. Tiran Allas

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

from this august Assembly. So, all what I am saying is that we have to ensure that the new Constitution which comes into place assures that such mockery does not go on. We had a President who used to pay the LTTE for non-voting, thus winning by receiving 152,000 more votes and defeating our Prime Minister. If he, the Prime Minister, had 70,000 more votes from the other areas, there would have been a second count and the fate of this country would have been completely different. But, after time elapsed, there is no point in saying what had happened. It was to the detriment of people.

What happened then was a heinous crime and we managed to save the situation with President Maithripala Sirisena being at the helm. He took up a challenge on behalf of the country and on his magnanimous approach, people placed their confidence at the election. Today, we can see the benefits trickling or percolating down and the flame of democracy, which had been put off is now lighting up again. That is why we basically say that it is necessary for every Member in this House to ensure that he gives his fullest support to the passing of this Nineteenth Amendment.

I am disappointed to say that this is only tinkering instead of abolishing the Executive Presidency. I am sure that it is not only I who say this. Even the President of this country would have been much happier to say, I want to abolish this. I hope that with the effluxion of time, with His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena being the President, with the election coming to an end and the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe getting elected as the Prime Minister, we will be able come back to power to ensure that the people get what they really deserve.

So, these are the areas that we need to correct, in particular.

This is the reason why we need to abolish this Executive Presidency and its concomitant features that have been embedded in the Constitution. So, all what we basically ask is a complete restoration of democracy. The first step is the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment and we must ensure that such things are done before too long.

Justice Minister, I hope that you will be able to ensure that sanity prevails where the Hon. Members will also have their rights. It is not only the President, it is not only the Prime Minister, a Minister, even an Opposition Member should have the right to be able to defend himself honourably in this House. We have the strength and the courage to go through, but that may not be there with others. You can see that it is non-existent in Mahinda Rajapaksa, in Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

Financial aspect of this Constitution should really be gone into because that is where I feel there is a serious erosion. , .

The financial safeguards must be embedded so that the people have the right to refuse such criminal acts or heinous corruptions that take place behind the backs of those people because ultimately the people have to carry that particular burden.

I can still vividly remember, when the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena was bestowing the Cabinet Ministries on us, he said, You all are being bestowed this temporary right to ensure that you discharge your duties to the best of your ability and ensure that people of this country get the benefit and they will be served". It echoes in our minds and we remember that we hold this temporary right on behalf of the people until the effluxion of time when they believe that a change has to take place. So, Sir, this is why I say the Constitution needs to have an all-inclusive process and not an all-exclusive process. That inclusive process brings in all checks and balances that are required, especially when it comes to financial aspects.

I remember New Zealand was in the doldrums in the early 1980s. They decided there was no way forward that they could go. So, they brought in the Fiscal Responsibility Act. The Prime Minister had no option: either he had to go bankrupt or come up with a system that was able to change the Finance Act by the Constitution. By doing that, if you increase the recurrent expenditure of that country, you must ensure that the capital expenditure is so increased that the recurrent expenditure has revenue earned through the capital expenditure. That is the way you can increase recurrent expenditure. It is a tortuous process. The New Zealanders, at that particular moment, were wondering whether it was a situation fait accompli. But, today they can be proud. Today, New Zealand is ranked as number one or two at the Ease of Doing Business Index; corruption is zero in that country; inflation is 0.1 to 0.2 per cent and the country has a growth rate that is phenomenal in developed countries; the per capita income is about 35,00 to 40,000 US Dollars and it is an agriculture-related developed country. Therefore, Sir, if there is a will, there is a way. That is what I basically want to ensure.

Being an Accountant with experience and bringing that experience into this House to the best of my ability, all I could basically say is, ensure that we bring this financial safeguards. We have too many lawyers meddling around with the Constitution. They only look at the legal aspect, but they completely forget that Article 148 of the Constitution states that the entire financial responsibility lies in the House. There are hundreds of lawyers in our system, but who is able to take command of the financial situation? It is a fait accompli situation. You basically do it and let it befall on the people and come what may. So, this is the reason why I say that there is a necessity to include the financial protective measures. If recurrent expenditure goes above "X" percentage, then the capital expenditure must be so increased to compensate for the additional costs that come in.

You know Sir, we were compelled - with the election of the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena as the President of this country and the mixed-Government or the National Government that came into being - to discharge in 100 days, the promises that we made. You would know that even without the constitutional mandate, we reduced the budget deficit, decreased expenditure, increased revenue and did not put the burden on the people. Thereby, we were able to discharge our professional ability through the weak system that existed, and were able to tell the world that financial discipline was at the foremost. Now, imagine if these could be enshrined into the new Constitution, what a difference would it make? That is why I call upon my Colleagues from both sides of the House, together let us ensure that we give something to the people - which may be existing in a very few countries in the world - so that they will always be thankful to us for being able to protect their interests without any fear or favour.

Budgets have been presented from 1948 on a cash basis. That is a system where you basically say, I want Rs. 100 and the Ministry of Finance says, No, I will give you Rs. 50 and finally Rs. 50 will do what Rs. 100 had to do. But, at the end of the day, you will not deliver anything, and the capital assets that are there diminish to such an extent that there is no improvement at all. So, you have the capital expenditure diminishing and no new capital expenditure put on, because you are more interested in satisfying the temporary gain rather than the long-term benefits. So, you basically increase the recurrent expenditure and at the end of the day, you lose out that on behalf of the people.

Therefore, this cash basis needs to be supported by a zero-based accounting system. Some lawyers ask, How can you include everything in the Constitution? But, you put in things that unbelievably go into the Constitution. So, why can you not put such things as safety measures? In a company, if you are going into a financial transaction, you say that the board of directors can act in such a manner. So, why can you not get the Hon. Members of this Parliament to work on the same basis when they are dealing with peoples tax money? That is the difference. So, I am only echoing this fact, because I thought it was incumbent on me - being the only Accountant representing Parliament for the last 25 years - to ensure that at least the accounting fraternity would say that we have done what we had to do.

Today, we do not have an Auditor-General in our country. He is on an acting basis and he is performing better than what the original person could do. But, why is he not appointed? Because there is a battle in the fraternity. A particular person does not get it because the senior person who is above him has not got the opportunity. So, they think, why should the junior person get it. This shows that merit does not get its place. That is the problem in this society. Therefore, we need to

683 684

ensure that the financial aspect gets the deserved attention under this system. So, I would urge the legislators, even in this last minute, to ensure that the financial aspect is very thinly protected and it needs a much more vociferous approach than what is there at this moment.

Then, Sir, look at the electoral system. The system that has been inherited is something which is the best of the worst. But, that does not mean that something better cannot take place. Now, there are many systems that have been proposed, but it has only become a talk shop. We have not been able to give what the people deserve. The system of First-Past-the-Post, basically affects the minorities and the smaller parties and there is no way that you could keep those out because there are some talented and useful people who have to be elected. But, that does not mean that you have got to have a Constitution that fits the minorities and the smaller parties at the expense of the bigger parties. When there are national parties, I frankly feel that there is no necessity for religiously and racially- oriented parties in this country. In the United States of America, where there are 250 million people but they do not have 50 - 60 different political parties. They have only two. But, in Sri Lanka with 15 million voting out of the 20 million population, you have 54 registered political parties and each of them create a bigger mess. So, if democracy works through that system in big countries like the United States of America, from the doorstep right up to the Capitol Hill, why can that particular system not be adopted in this country? Everything that happens in America, in St. Petersburg, in Tokyo, in Delhi or in Downing Street, does not have to happen here in Sri Jayewardenepura. But, all I want to say is, if big countries can have a democratic system with two political parties, why on earth have we got to have 54 political parties and another 15 applications at the Election Commissioners office? This is a hilarious situation.

Everyone wants to be the President in this country. They must know what their limitations are. This is the problem. This is the Asian culture which is inculcated, that when you give a little power to somebody he thinks he is the cats whiskers. Sometimes, a person who basically knows it all is sidetracked because either he does not belong to a particular caste, a particular religion or he does not belong to a particular society. The majority feel that they should be protected. This is the problem - the bane of our society - and that is why we need an electoral system that represents everybody.

Look at India. Two years ago, they had a Sikh Prime Minister; a Catholic leader who led from outside, a Buddhist President, an Army Commander who was a Hindu and the Indian system flourished under them. Today, India is regarded as the biggest economy that is on the move. Even China, today has its machinery giving in to the Indian value addition system. Why? Because they

have a system that is in place. They basically know where value is. That type of system helps to ensure that the country moves forward not at the expense of chauvinistic elements that basically steal the show for a limited time.

Then,Sir, you look at the way the countrys economy is being handled today. I am referring to an article in the "Ceylon Today" newspaper of 19th April, 2015. It states that If Chinas Colombo Port City Project terminates.... Government compelled to pay Rs. 40B damages.
