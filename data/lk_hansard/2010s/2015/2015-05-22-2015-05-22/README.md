, , . , , , . .. . [3.22 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am happy that I am able to say a few words on the Vote of Condolence on the passing away of Mr. S.D. Bandaranaike, a very senior politician in this country who was known very well throughout this country. He was a much-respected politician, respected for his integrity, for his sense of fairness and justice. He was a person who had very broad-minded views. He was not a person who excluded anybody from his thinking. His thinking was always inclusive. He was one who loved this country. He also loved all the people in this country. He wanted all the people in this country to live together united as one people. He was a politician respected by all the people in this country. I had come to know him reasonably well. I always found him to be a very warm person, a person who was extremely friendly, very kind and whose company was something that gave one a lot of encouragement and hope.

I remember, shortly after the signing of the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact in 1957, - a Pact signed between the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka and the undisputed acknowledged leader of the Tamil people, Mr. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam - which was the first step taken in this country to resolve the national question, Mr. J.R. Jayewardene who was then an Opposition politician in Parliament, started a march from Colombo to Kandy protesting against the Pact and at Imbulgoda, Mr. S.D. Bandaranaike interrupted that march and prevented the continuance of that march by performing, if I might say so, a Sathyagraha movement. He obstructed that march and the march could not continue; the march was abandoned. Mr. S.D. Bandaranaike, thereafter, came to be known as the "Imbulgoda Weeraya". I was a young lawyer in practice at that point of time and that is how we remembered Mr. S.D. Bandaranaike; we remembered him as the "Imbulgoda Weeraya".

329 330

Many years later, Sir, after I came to Parliament in 1977, and when I had come to know Mr. J.R. Jayewardene very well, - in the course of one my leisured conversations with him at the Navy House in Trincomalee, where President Jayewardene used to stay whenever he came on a holiday to Trincomalee - I asked him why he opposed the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact. I said that was the first step taken by a political leader to resolve the conflict in this country, that would have brought about a great change in the future of this country. I asked him, "Why did you oppose the Pact?". He said, I opposed the Pact only for one reason. That is because the Pact permitted the amalgamation of regions beyond provincial boundaries. But, as history would record, later on, when the conflict grew worse and became unmanageable, Mr. Jayewardene went much further and was prepared to amalgamate the Northern and Eastern Provinces as one unit of devolution, as one unit of power sharing under the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the Provincial Councils Act. This is indicative, Sir, of the mistakes that political leaders make for which they repent later. In fact, they endeavour at a later point of time to correct the mistakes they made earlier, but they are not always successful; sometimes they are and sometimes they are not.

I remember, Sir, meeting recently, a very senior educated monk in this country. I do not want to mention his name because I do not have his permission to mention his name in this context. He is a very educated monk, a monk who presides at various conferences attended by religious, high-standing dignitaries from various religions. I have been attending some of these conferences and interacting with the members of the clergy who attended these conferences. This monk wanted me to come and see him at his temple and I went and met him. He had a long conversation with me and in the course of the conversation, he mentioned one thing. He said, When the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact was signed in 1957, as a young monk, I was one of the people who sat on the road at Rosmead Place in front of Mr. Bandaranaikes House and demanded that the Pact be abrogated. I was partly responsible for the abrogation of that Pact because I was one of the persons who protested. I have realized since then what a big mistake I made. That Pact should have never been abrogated. That Pact should have been implemented and if that had been implemented, this country would not have been in this position today.

Sir, in this country, when we make mistakes we have to pay a very heavy price. We made Sinhala Only the official language. We had riots in this country consequently. We had conflicts; we had violence. Today, we have given equal status to both Tamil and Sinhala. It may not be fully implemented, but the fact of the matter is that we have done so.

We denied citizenship to the plantation Tamils. Today, we have granted citizenship to a large number of plantation Tamils and now they are represented in Parliament. At one point of time, there was no representation on behalf of the plantation Tamils in Parliament. Some Members did come as appointed Members until the Mr. Savumyamoorthy Thondaman was elected for the first time in 1977 as the Third Member for Nuwara Eliya-Maskeliya.

Sir, Mr. S.D. Bandaranaike was a politician who had clarity of thinking and he prevented the Mr. J.R. Jayewardene from continuing that march to Kandy because he felt that the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact would bring good to this country, would do good to this country and that, therefore, he should prevent that march. It is unfortunate that we have lost a very senior leader at this point of time in our history. True enough, for some years he was not keeping too well and he was not playing an active role, but his counsel and advice was always available to anybody who sought it. He was a person who realized that everybody in this country had to be contented through feeling that there was justice prevailing in this country, that they would not be the victims of injustice or inequality, that they could be equal, honourable citizens with all the people in this country. That is how the Hon. S.D. Bandaranaike always felt.

I am personally very sorry, Sir, that we have lost a very senior politician. Indeed, I am extremely sorry that, very unfortunately, I was not in the country when he passed away and I was not able to pay my respects to him personally. His son, the Hon. Pandu Bandaranaike is with us in Parliament. He is also a much-respected politician, a person who conducts himself with great dignity and has always been very moderate and very positive in his outlook.

Sir, I join my Colleagues in expressing our deep condolences to the family of the late Hon. S.D. Bandaranaike, particularly to our Colleague, the Hon. Pandu Bandaranaike, and I have not the slightest doubt that the Hon. S.D. Bandaranaike will be given all the salvation he deserves.

Thank you, Sir. [.. 3.35] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka - Minister of Mass Media and Chief Government Whip) , ..
