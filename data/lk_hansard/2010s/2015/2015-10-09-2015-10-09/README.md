. . , , . [2.03p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity to second this Adjournment Motion presented by the Hon. Vijitha Herath on poaching into our sea by Indian fishermen.

This issue has two dimensions as the Mover said: firstly, the issue of foreign fishermen and foreign fishing boats entering into our territorial waters and secondly, more importantly, the issue of bottom trawling method of fishing that is resorted to by these fishermen, which destroys the entire marine resources including the seabed, because weights are attached to nets from these trawlers that enable the nets to go right to the bottom and then it trawls everything it its path. Eventually, they throw away 80 to 90 per cent of what is caught and only a little of the catch is made use of. But, in the end, the resulting position is that the marine environment gets destroyed very fast. It has been said that due to this particular method of fishing, the marine resources on the Indian side have been totally destroyed - there is nothing more - and that is the reason why these fishermen are now coming into the territorial waters of Sri Lanka.

This has caused an immense hardship to our fishermen, particularly to the fishermen in the Northern Province, part of the Eastern Province and some parts of the North -Western Province also. But the fishermen in the Northern Province are worst affected and we, as the Tamil National Alliance, has taken this up with the Government. There have been meetings with His Excellency the President, but sadly to no avail, because no decisive action has been taken and that is why I think it is timely that this Adjournment Motion has been moved and I am glad to second it.

The Government of Sri Lanka must take decisive action with regard to bottom trawling. Presently there is a Regulation under the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act where this method of fishing is regulated. But, that will not do. It must be totally banned, because now it is clear to everyone that this method of fishing only destroys the marine resources and long-term sustainability is not possible. The fishermen will not be able to continue to

engage in that vocation and therefore, it must be banned. We urge the Sri Lankan Government to do that. But the failure to do that has resulted in the presentation of a Private Members' Motion by myself during the last Parliament to amend the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act. Of course, now that has lapsed. So, we urge that the Government must do this. The Government must bring necessary legislation to ban this method of fishing, not only used by the Indian fisherman, even by our fishermen too. Some people think that this was not done because some powerful ministers in the last Parliament themselves owned some trawlers that used this bottom trawling method. Therefore, the Government must take note of this very serious issue and act decisively.

Before I sit down, Mr. Speaker, you would also permit me to say that the Northern fishermen and the fishermen from Mullaitivu upwards, on the Eastern side of the Northern Province, are facing another issue. That is, poaching into their area by fishermen from the Southern and the Western parts of the Island. It has been a practice that during a particular season people from the Western side do go to Mullaitivu and further up North and engage in fishing. But it is not that seasonal fishing that is happening now. Now people go with supposed permits from the Ministry of Defence. We have raised this issue previously also and it is happening even now in places like Kattaikadu and Vettilaikerny. I have myself personally gone last month and seen with my own eyes this kind of activity taking place. This is not good; this must be regulated and this must be stopped.

I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for permitting me to second this Motion. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. Niroshan Perera. You have ten minutes. [.. 2.09] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Niroshan Perera - State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) , . . , , . . . , .

[2.44 p.m.] ( ) ( - (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am grateful to the JVP for having brought this Adjournment Motion in the House today. It is a matter of importance. This dispute had been persisting for some period of time. One might say, Sir, that the war - the conflict that prevailed in Sri Lanka - was the primary cause of the present issue, because our fishermen, particularly in the North and also in the East, did not engage in fishing when the war was being fought. They were not able to do so. In fact, they were prevented from doing so. During this time, the Indian fishermen virtually had a free run and they came into the Northern waters in particular and carried on their fishing activity in whatever way they pleased.

The war came to an end in 2009. After the war came to an end, naturally there was a desire on the part of the Sri Lankan Northern fishermen to commence their fishing activity, because that has been their only livelihood and without this livelihood they have been suffering

immensely. In fact, I have received reports from persons who are very much in touch with them. I have met with some of them who have told me that they are greatly indebted and continue to live by getting further indebted because they are unable to carry on with their livelihood and they are most anxious to recommence their livelihood. The Indian fishermen, Sir, are crossing the international boundary and they are coming into Sri Lankan waters and fishing as they please. That itself is a violation of the law. What is much worse is that they do their fishing activity through a process which causes damage to our fishing gear, to the nets which our fishermen cast in the sea. They not merely cause damage to our fishing gear, but cause immense destruction to the continued production of fish because this method of fishing called, bottom trawling virtually means that it scrapes the seabed. When you scrape the seabed, you destroy the potential for the production of fish in the future. Consequently, immense damage is caused to the environment that needs to be protected to ensure that fish continues to be produced.

As a matter of fact, Sir, some months ago when we had regular meetings with His Excellency the President, I raised this matter with the President and at my request he summoned a delegation of Northern fishermen for a meeting and at that meeting certain decisions were made and the Navy who were present were instructed to prevent Indian fishing trawlers coming into Sri Lankan waters. That was enforced and in fact immediately after the meeting, the Navy acted very sternly and prevented the Indian fishermen coming into the Northern waters. But unfortunately, as you know, in such situations, stern action is not a continuing phenomenon and there had been some relaxation consequent to which the Indian fishermen continue to come. We need, Sir, to take some action that will bring about a change and we need to consider what needs to be done.

It is a matter that is also promoting hostility between the people in both countries, raising unnecessary questions and it is not in anybodys interest for this situation to continue. Therefore, I would urge the Government to take in concert with the Indian Government and also with the Tamil Nadu Government some action that will bring about a change. One course of action I might suggest is, that apart from the Sri Lankan Navy patrolling the international boundary, the Indian Navy or the Indian Coast Guard should also join the Sri Lankan Navy and there should be a joint patrol by both the Sri Lankan Navy and the Indian Navy or the Indian Coast Guard so as to ensure that this is prevented; that Indian fishermen with their trawlers in particular, coming into Sri Lankan waters is stopped by a joint exercise in which both Governments are engaged, their Navies are engaged or the Coast Guard personnel are engaged.

I would also urge the Minister of Foreign Affairs to have talks not merely with Delhi but also with Tamil

565 566

Nadu. Because, after all, this is a matter that is happening in Tamil Nadu. The fishermen involved are persons of Tamil Nadu. Therefore, I think the Minister of Foreign Affairs must engage in talks not merely with the Foreign Minister in Delhi but also with the Chief Minister in Tamil Nadu and have tripartite talks. Maybe, at those talks, there can be representatives of both Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu present and there must be some arrangement worked out to ensure that they all comply with the law and that the patrolling by the Sri Lankan Navy and the Indian Navy or the Indian Coast Guard is successful.

Sometime ago, Sir, when I was in Delhi, I had the opportunity of discussing this matter with some of the senior officials in Delhi. When I explained the position to them, particularly the damage being caused by trawlers being used and the manner of fishing with trawlers, they had a proposal and they said that it had even been considered favourably by the Government in Delhi, that was to help the fishermen to go and fish in the deep sea by giving them the necessary assistance, diverting them from the Palk Strait into the deep sea. They were prepared to extend such assistance not merely to the Indian fishermen but even to the Sri Lankan fishermen. They said, We are prepared to even help your fishermen to go into the deep sea and carry on their fishing.

So, I think, Sir, there is the need for the Minister of Foreign Affairs to seriously engage in this question, to have serious discussions with both Delhi and Tamil Nadu with the presence of the fishermen from both sides and bring an end to this current situation, because the current situation is causing immense harm to our citizens who are deprived of their livelihood and are not able to survive because of the fact that they are continuing to incur debts even to live.

So, I would urge, Sir, that this matter be taken seriously. After all, the President issued very firm instructions when he met the fishermen from the North that the Sri Lankan Navy must prevent the Indian fishermen coming into Sri Lankan waters.

I think the Sri Lankan Navy must perform that duty and prevent the Indian fishermen coming in. As I said, Sir, if the Minister of Foreign Affairs can engage in joint consultations with both the Central Government in Delhi and the Government in Tamil Nadu, we should be able to find a resolution to this conflict, but it must be done quickly; it must be done urgently because it is causing immense harm to the livelihood of our people.

Thank you, Sir. [.. 2.54] ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) ,

. . [4.28p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, first of all I thank you for giving me this opportunity to make my Maiden Speech in this august Assembly. I represent Puttalam Electorate in the Puttalam District. The people of Puttalam gave me a large number of votes. Unfortunately, I was short of a few hundred votes to be elected as a Member of Parliament, and I thank my leader, the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, for nominating me from the National List. I must also thank the Hon. Prime Minister for accommodating me in the National List of the UNP.

Sir, regarding the Motion brought in by the Hon. Vijitha Herath, all the Hon. Members have been speaking about the problems faced by the fishermen in the whole Island. Very unfortunately, my Electorate in the Puttalam District is also suffering. The week before last, seven Indian fishermen were caught off Kalpitiya, at Baththalangunduwa village, and I think they were remanded till the 19th of this month. This problem has started moving from Jaffna to Mannar and from there to Puttalam and it will definitely come towards Negombo also.

Sir, these fishermen are using very large boats and they consist of massive instruments which damage all the small nets and small boats used by our fisherfolk. They are catching mainly a popular variety of fish known as Gal Malu. Our small boats are unable even to exist. Our fishermen come back empty-handed daily whereas all the big boats coming from India take away all the catch.

Also, I would like to point out that the nets they use in the bottom trawling method reach the bottom of the sea and this affects all the sea plants which feed the fish. In addition, all the breeding areas are also destroyed and as a result, the fish is unable to breed. So, if this continues for another few years, probably there may not be enough breeding areas and even sea plants for fish to feed on.

My Electorate has about 150 kilometres of sea area and it is one of the biggest fishing areas. Unfortunately, we have been suffering for the last so many years. I would like to give you some information about the Kalpitiya Division which is being affected due to poaching. Palakuda village has 15 registered multi-day boats, 666 outboard boats and 1,916 fishing families. In Kalpitiya land area, there are six multi-day boats, 640 registered outboard boats and 1,380 families. In Kalpitiya

Island, they have 3 multi-day boats, 350 registered outboard boats and 950 families. Kandakuliya village has 25 multi-day boats, 413 registered outboard boats and 1,447 families.

Altogether there are 49 multi-day boats, 2,069 registered outboard boats and 5,343 families living there. Very unfortunately, in a few years to come, definitely, all these fishermen will be unemployed and will be facing problems.

So, I think it is a very serious matter and we have to find a solution to this problem. During the earlier Governments, we had problems with the Indian Government and were unable to solve this problem. But now, with the present situation - our Prime Minister had already visited India - I think, we are in a better position because our Government is friendly with the Indian Government. If we coordinate and compromise with them we will be able to solve this problem.

Further, I would like to say, in addition to these problems that we face today, our farmers are already facing a massive problem in Puttalam. We are made to understand that all garbage from Colombo is to be sent to Aruwakkadu, that is the Cement Corporation quarry, by train. They are going to dump all those garbage in that area. Once this is done, the dirt can ooze into the lagoon and into the sea and in future, this will definitely affect our fishing industry. Already, we are facing a problem with the Coal Power Plant. In addition, there is an electricity line which is going across the lagoon. Our lagoon is affected by this also. In every direction our fisherfolk of Puttalam are affected very badly.

Therefore, considering all these facts, I would like to request the Hon. Prime Minister to have a cordial discussion with the Indian Government. I am sure, we are in a better position, unlike the earlier Governments, where we can cordially discuss with them and solve this problem because we cannot fight with the Indian fisherfolk. However much we say for the Navy to interfere or for the Navy to go and catch them, they may catch five or six fisherfolk but there are 200 to 300 Indian fisherfolk who are daily catching fish. Therefore, I suggest that we have a cordial discussion with the Indian Government and solve this problem.

Thank you.
