The other matter I would like to bring to the notice of the Hon. Minister is that there is a recent judgment in India - I do not know whether you are going to follow that or not - on the retrospective legislation in respect of tax collection. -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Now that this question was raised by you, it is my bounden duty to answer it. Retrospective laws are not what we want to impose. But, in 2011, you brought in laws with retrospective effect and managed to expropriate 22 companies. We are basically taking on an economy that you have run down, which was run by two or three for the want of one or two. We are only rectifying that. We have an obligation for 21 million people of the country, not for two or three family members.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Hon. Minister, it is not an excuse to say, You did this and, therefore, we are doing this. . .

( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana. You have 10 minutes.

[4.15 p.m.] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, firstly I would like to commend the Maithripala Sirisena Government for honouring its election pledge to bring down the cost of

living, and I am particularly happy that a proposal which we have been submitting every year, over the last few years, has been implemented. That is, to identify essential food items and we requested that all taxes on those items be removed. But, the fact that even a proportion of those taxes have been removed is a good development and, that I think is welcome from the point of view of bringing the cost of living down to the poorer sections of our people. But, let me say, at the same time, that mechanisms must be set in place to ensure that these prices are kept down. There must be a proper price control mechanism. That is not there and it will need some mechanism to see that the traders actually pass on the benefits of what you are proposing to the consumer. The only point I would like to mention is that some of the items like dhal, which are commonly consumed and need to be reduced, have not been brought down. That is something that should have been looked into.

At the same time, the main objective of bringing down the cost of living - it is very evident by looking at this Budget - is a short-term objective of winning the next election. The measures that have been instituted to effect this, to find the money required, to make up for the loss of revenue clearly indicate that this is a short-term objective. It is not going to be sustained and if the UNP comes back into power in some way, there is absolutely no guarantee from the way this whole Budget has been prepared, that this will be sustained. If we are to really have a sustainable economic development, then there has to be an investment in infrastructure development as well as in industrial development. If you look at this Budget, it is very clear that that is not there. It is evident that the reduction in capital expenditure, which has been used to make-up for the shortfall of revenue has been by cutting down on infrastructure expenditure.

Now, if you look from the angle of industrialization, the Ministry of Technology and Research no longer exists, so that the place that science, technology and innovation was given by our government earlier has not been sustained.

This will clearly indicate that the type of sustained economic development that is essential for a country to emerge from the middle-income trap, which is one of the biggest dangers confronting our country, has not been addressed by this Budget. If it is really a sustained budgeting process, that would have been addressed. So, I am extremely unhappy to see that there is no effort being made to meet the danger of the middle-income trap in this whole Budget and it is clear that even in the future, there is no attempt to do that.

Now, trying to beat the loss of revenue through these budgetary measures, we welcome on behalf of the people, but, it is also very short-sighted. You have targeted specific industries which really have taxes of a punitive nature, and directed against enterprises believed to be

493 494

associated with the last Government, and this very act has already been producing negative effects. This type of taxation, which is based on earnings acquired in the past, is a poor system of taxation and especially when it is targeted against certain sections of the capitalist class, who had ties with the last Government, immediately leads to a fear among the capitalist class as a whole, that for political reasons they will also be targeted at some future date. This has had its impact already.

As the previous speakers have mentioned, there has been a reduction, a marked drop in the stock exchange. There has also been a drop in the value of the rupee, which means that the capitalist class itself has been shaken by what has happened. To meet this loss of revenue, for instance, at all the previous Budgets I have suggested to increase direct taxation. Sri Lanka has one of the lowest levels of direct taxation in the world; the upper limit of taxation has been brought down to 24 per cent. If in a country like Britain, it is 40 per cent and if in other countries in Europe, it is 50 per cent, why should we not have at least something like 45 per cent? We are down at 24 per cent. If there is a general measure like that, then people can put the surplus wealth into productive use. If people voluntarily invest in some productive enterprise, those particular investments can be given some tax concessions. But, what has been done now is, you have maintained the 24 per cent low direct taxation and, in that context, the income that could have been obtained without this type of punitive and targeted taxation, has been avoided. The consequences are that even from the point of view of capitalist development of our economy, it is going to have a bad effect.

Then, how is this Government going to sustain this in the future? It will mean that the Government will have to get into an increased debt. That is the type of policy that the World Bank and the IMF have always been trying to thrust upon the governments in Sri Lanka. I have a deep fear that that is going to happen. When, Mr. Shah of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce raised this very issue, the Deputy Minister who is concerned with Economic Affairs defended by saying that the Government is going to go into the "Regaining Sri Lanka" Policy; the policy which was rejected by the people from 2002 to 2004, because our assets were sold to foreign investors, to multinational corporations and the economic burden fell on the people.

Therefore, I warn the people of Sri Lanka that this Budget is undoubtedly a short-term Budget, which is aimed purely at getting your vote at the elections. Thereafter, what is going to be followed is the "Regaining Sri Lanka" type of policies and budgets, which will place increasing burdens on the ordinary people and give concessions not even to our local capitalist class, but to the foreign capitalist class to the detriment of our economy. Thank you.

[5.45 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today I am speaking after three Leftist Veterans. I really do not envy speaking after the three veterans, whom I always respect. But, I see today the Leftist Members of Parliament talking about the Super Gain Tax and the Mansion Tax. You are the people who should be promoting it, not denouncing it. You may feel that these are cosmetic -

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) We are very happy about it. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Okay. Yes, you said so. I am sorry.

You are saying that these are cosmetic proposals to show that we are against these so-called "super-rich" people. Actually, these taxes have been brought because during the last nine years, a certain group of people who were close to the then administration were allowed to make exorbitant profits. People, who were ordinary professionals and those with a small capital have become billionaires in a short period of time only because they were allowed to exploit the system to make exorbitant profits. So, these people have to be taxed. Many of these taxes are one-time taxes.

Also, we have taxed casinos, we have taxed betting and gaming and also liquor manufacturers. These are three areas in which the then Government supported those few capitalists to become multi-billionaires in this country and they have exploited the system without paying the dues to the Government.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) They were subsidized by the Government. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) They were subsidized by the then Government to become rich quickly. They have robbed from the EPF. There are people who manipulated the share market, who started with, maybe, Rs. 10 million and who are billionaires today. So, these people have to pay up for what they stole from the system. Therefore, these are the proposals that we have made so that those dues can be collected to the Government.

As the Hon. Vasuveda Nanayakkara said, the difference between the rich and the poor has to be narrowed. He also said that we always wanted the indirect taxes to be reduced and the direct taxes to be increased. I am one person who has always been saying in this House that the direct taxes should be increased and indirect taxes should be reduced. As he said, the poor people also buy sugar and use two spoons in their cup of tea. The rich man cannot take sugar because he has diabetes and he does not use sugar at all. So, who is paying the taxes? We, in our Manifesto said that we would reduce the duties and the taxes and pass on the benefits to the people, so that they would have a better life. To some extent, through the reduction of prices of 13 food items, we have done that. We have done that on sugar, flour and so many other items, especially on milk powder . These are essentials of the people. The Hon. Minister mentioned specifically that the reduction of the price of flour would benefit the plantation people in a big way. Similarly, we are people who use black gram or ulundu to make thosai or dli for our day-to-day meal. The tax on black gram was Rs. 110 per kilo and it has been reduced by Rs. 60. It gives us, the people of Indian origin or the Tamil people in general, the opportunity to enjoy more of these food that we like. So, these are things that have been thought out and proposed.

I heard the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana talking about the price of parippu. The tax levied on a kilo of parippu is only Rs. 2. Reducing that Rs. 2 is not going to have an impact. If it was Rs. 20, we could have reduced it to Rs. 10 and given a concession to the people. - [Interruption.] No, we do not want to subsidize red lentil, which is imported. Why should we subsidize a foreign farmer? It is better to subsidize a local farmer.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) You can subsidize the local consumer.

521 522

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) We are prepared to give it to the consumer, but not at the expense of supporting a foreign farmer. The better method is to subsidize a local alternative rather than a foreign farmer. This is why we did not touch parippu. There has always been consideration for parippu and that is the reason why the duty on parippu had remained low. So, there is no way for us to give further concessions.

As far as fuel is concerned, when a barrel of crude oil was only US Dollars 110 in the world market, prices were fixed. When it came down to US Dollars 45 also, the previous Government was exploiting it; they were making profit. But, now we have a price formula and we are going to apply that formula in the future. The people are not getting any subsidy and we are also not going to subsidize the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. They have to meet the needs of the people of the country, producing fuel at a fair price based on the crude oil prices, so that the Government does not lose money. They might have to subsidize, maybe, kerosene and diesel to keep the transport cost low, but not necessarily petrol. So, we are trying to address this in a very prudent manner.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena) Your price reduction is temporary.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is not temporary. We have reduced prices with the idea of introducing a formula so that - [Interruption.] No, we do not say that this is going to be fixed, but we are not going to exploit it.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena) Tell the people that you have reduced the price of kerosene temporarily.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, I am a person who respects you a lot. In those days, you were a UNPer, I am told. I have not known you as a UNPer. Yet, I want to tell you that this is not to cheat the people. What we are saying is, in the past when the price of a barrel of crude oil was fixed at US Dollars 110 and it came down to US Dollars 45, the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government, which you supported and made representations to - as you said here - did not listen. At least, today, you are making representations in the hope that we would listen. That is a good thing because you gave up hope on them, but you supported him trying to bring him back to power and you

failed. At least, now you think that your rational thinking would have an impact on our thinking to act in a rational way.

The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana and I sat on the All-Party Representative Committee. We produced a Report. The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana went and presented it to the former President. All of your leftist parties are willing for devolution of power to the regions so that we all can live together. But, what happened to that Committee Report? It was shelved; it was hidden as if it never came to him. - [Interruption.] Yes. So, that happened to the Hon. Tissa Vitarana. Just now, the Hon. DEW Gunasekara spoke about the Report of the Taxation Commission. You work on a committee, put all your effort and bring out a report that you think is prudent, rational and necessary for this country. Then, what happens? Some so-called " " puts it into the waste paper basket; all your efforts are wasted.

Then, the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, just now mentioned about another document. I did not hear him properly.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Hate Speech Legislation draft.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes, the Hate Speech Legislation. Then, you brought proposals about the National Anthem. All those were not regarded. Still, you regret that that regime, which did not listen to you has been washed out.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) It was regretted because there was a perspective.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, there was no perspective; he had no perspective. He had perspective only for his family, not for this country.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) No. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) We have, today, a situation where the people feel free and that they can reconcile among the communities. That message was given yesterday by His Excellency the

523 524

2015 05

President or the Honourable President, because he does not want to be addressed as His Excellency. The Honourable President made a speech yesterday, a beautiful speech, a speech that did not come from somebody writing it out where he brought and read it. Somebody else did into write it for him; he spoke from his heart. That, we appreciate. We feel equal in this country today, which I did not feel one month ago.

The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana will bear witness that in the APRC, I never asked or demanded that we be given anything special. We only wanted to be treated equally. That sense of equal treatment we feel today, because of yesterday's speech. Todays newspapers carry a news item stating that after 42 years, the Northern political representatives attended the Independence Day Celebrations. Maybe there are a few extremists there also who are pulling up the Leader, Hon. R. Sampanthan, for participating in yesterday's programme. But, generally the people in the North and the East want to live as one.

We were talking about giving more powers under APRC. I am getting diverted but it does not matter because these are matters that we have to speak. It is very relevant in todays circumstances. But, the previous Government refused to give powers. They had an election to show the whole world, but they did not allow the Chief Minister to function. They had one man above him, the Governor, who would not allow the Chief Minister to function. And, then, even if the Chief Minister gave orders, there was nobody to carry it out because the Chief Secretary will not function according to the requests of the Chief Minister. So, the first thing we did was, we removed the Governor and we appointed a new Chief Secretary. But, we did not send that Chief Secretary out. We brought her to Colombo, made her a Secretary to another Ministry that is relevant to our up-country people. Now, she is the Secretary to the State Minister of Plantation Industries. And, today we have three Secretaries functioning in Colombo with Ministers for servicing our people. We feel very good.

A former President, Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, created the Ministry of Livestock Development and Estate Infrastructure to service the plantation people. She appointed a committee under Mr. Gunapala to assess the needs of the plantation people. Following that committee report, she created the Ministry of Livestock Development and Estate Infrastructure and appointed my late Leader, the Hon. Savumyamoorthy Thondaman as the Minister. That Ministry was functioning for about one year. After one year, she said, if this Ministry is to function properly, the Secretary should be a person who empathizes with those people. She removed that Secretary, Mr. Gunapala, who was the architect of that committee and replaced him with Dr. Prathap Ramanujam, because she thought that if the Hon. Thondaman has Dr. Prathap Ramanujam, another person of Indian origin, whose father was a Member of

Parliament in the First Parliament, that would give a team that can work for those people in a proper manner. So, that is sincerity of purpose. She was sincere and thought that that Ministry that was created should really serve those people. So, because of that she brought in a Secretary to work with him.

Today, we have restored the Ministry of Plantation Infrastructure Development, which Mahinda Rajapaksa thought is not necessary. He thought parallel development is enough and vertical development is not necessary. For people who are backward, vertical development is also necessary. Affirmative action has been accepted all over the world as not distorting fundamental rights; where a different group of people who maybe deprived of or given certain facilities or assistance for their development is affirmative action. So that, which she thought was necessary, Mahinda Rajapaksa thought was not necessary.

Finally, what happened at the last Presidential Election? Ninety per cent of the Muslims voted against Mahinda Rajapaksa; 80 per cent of the Tamils voted against Mahinda Rajapaksa - [Interruption.] Right. They only highlighted the thinking of that regime and today, they are out. But, you are pleading that we should do some of the things that you proposed to Mahinda Rajapaksa and which were not done. Anyway, we will take it in good spirits. We have already started implementing many of those proposals. - [Interruption.] So, we will see.

Sir, during the previous regime, the Members of Parliament were treated unequally. We, the Members of Parliament of the Opposition got Rs. 5 million for DCB but the Members of the Government Parliamentary Group got Rs. 30 million.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena) No, no. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It happened. Do not say, No, They got that money.- [Interruption.] Yes, I do agree. It came through the Ministry of Economic Development but it went through certain Members of Parliament of the Government.

( ) (The Hon. DEW Gunasekara) I did not get. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Maybe you were not considered worthwhile giving that money because you would only gain for yourself or

525 526

your party, whereas the SLFPers were given because they were organizers of electorates, so that they could build their political base more effectively. This is unfair. But, today we have increased the DCB funds from Rs. 5 million to Rs. 10 million for all Members of Parliament. That is a very fair way of doing things. Giving these monies for Gama Neguma, Maga Neguma, and Divi Neguma programmes through their Members of Parliament alone is biased politics. - [Interruption.] No, that is biased politics of your former Government and we are trying to correct that by, at least, multiplying the DCB and giving it through all Members of Parliament, whether Government or Opposition.

This Government has introduced a 50 per cent waiver on agricultural loans because during the bad seasons, the agriculturalists have suffered. So, we have thought it necessary to revive the agriculturer by supporting the agriculturalists.

Similarly, the biggest industry in this country became pawning. Those days, I know, there were licensed pawnbrokers and only they were doing pawning. Then, banks started fighting each other and to compete with them, the finance companies came in between. When the price of gold was Rs. 52,000, they were offering advances of Rs. 55,000. This whole thing crashed when the gold prices crashed. Many banks almost got into financial difficulties. The Peoples Bank had an exposure of 40 per cent and they had to reduce. Today, we have the ETI Finance Limited, which is having a negative balance sheet. All this is because of that situation. Why was there a boom in pawning? As the Hon. Minister said, when people had to buy medicines, they pawned their jewellery. So, for people to live, they had to pawn their jewellery. Now, we have given some relief to those who still have some gold left in the bank by renewing their pawned tickets, an opportunity to redeem the gold left without paying any interest. This is a very positive move.

Similarly, the elderly people who live on interest from deposits have been given a concession, an interest of 15 per cent. That subsidy is going to be paid by the Government. So, these are all very positive moves.

We have understood many of the issues and problems that the people are facing and we have tried to address them. There are many more which I could mention but due to lack of time, I will conclude now. We have done something positive and do not worry about our going for an election in a hundred days. Generally, soon after a Presidential Election, any political party will try to reap the benefits through a Parliamentary Election. Give us also that privilege. Do not deny us that.

Thank you.
