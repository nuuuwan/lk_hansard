We want to create a more business-friendly atmosphere. So, this is the reason why we are giving this option to the banks. This is only related to the banks because they can create it ten times over. So, instead of paying Rupees one billion, we ask them, Okay, you create it nine times over and lend it to the Government for our Capital Expenditure at 6.5 to 7 per cent - which we are now borrowing at 9 to 10 per cent." So, we are giving them an opportunity -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) One of the complaints is that they were not consulted and their self-respect was infringed by this sudden imposition. I agree that you had only less than a month to do these things, but, it would have been better if there was consultation, so they would have felt that they were not being penalized.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Member, being an experienced former Minister you know that it is sometimes difficult to discuss certain matters, because only the Cabinet is privy to certain decisions. Coming from the business sector, I certainly will not do anything that is injurious to the business sector. But, it is our duty to ensure that there is revenue before the expenditure is made and it is done in a financially disciplined manner. We are basically-

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I am not criticizing, what I am saying is that we should now have a rapprochement, have a dialogue, and whatever misunderstandings that had been there in the past must be cleared up.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) There is no misunderstanding at all. They very well understand where we come from. We inherited an economy that is virtually impossible to go forward.

I guess everybody was expecting a crash at any moment. I mean, you saw people walking out of the debt market. They walked away the moment they saw that the Government was in a little bit of a vulnerable situation. The stock market is not the barometer of the economy, but certainly it is a reflection of the general perception that is there. So, it is our duty to ensure that everybody invests in these institutions and they are guided and protected and there is no way to bandage the economy anymore. We must build the economy in a wholesale manner and you would see it in a full-term basis in the Budget that will be presented on the 20th of November.

So, at this particular moment, I am telling the banks that this is a sense of creation. Instead of you paying - roughly we expect Rs. 35 - 40 billion coming from the banks - we are giving the opportunity back to them. You can create it nine or ten times over and give it back to the Government at six to seven per cent. This is a fact we will negotiate, so that they will not lose out. This came from one of the bankers and I appreciate their suggestion. We, as a Government, are committed to certain costs that have been put on us, which are not wanted by us and we can use this source of funding for that purpose.

But, certainly, there are some other big companies that do not have money creation opportunities like the banks. So, we call upon them also to ensure that this is not written off from this years accounts, but it is written off as a note to the previous year's accounts, because there is no way you have a sensational accounting system, and if required, we will ensure that this is an accepted practice and instruct the Standard Accounting Practice that it be complied with. We do not want in anyway adjustments made to this years accounts because that has no reflection at all. It is a note to the previous year's accounts, so that you basically have no major problems.

Now there are suggestions that are coming in and we are open for suggestions. We are keeping this area very open. If it is helpful to them and they say, Okay, we will invest three times over, let us take that option, because all we want is to ensure that we develop the economy. As regards the creation of jobs, ensure that you basically take on the lagging areas. Those are the areas that we want to address. All we want is to re-cycle the fund. So, if they basically take it on to the areas that we like the investments taking place - lagging areas that we have proposed - like the North and the East, areas that are having under-employment problems, that is exactly what we want.

So, let me very categorically mention again that this is a statement for interpretation, which ensures that an opportunity is given for them to use it in the best way they feel for the economy. If they feel employment generation is possible with the tax we have imposed, they can go ahead and do that. You create jobs, we will set the

677 678

standards; but ensure that is done in a good spirit because we are extending you our hands. But, once again, I was disappointed with some of the companies that pretended to be paying this and stopped certain payments. We will look into those companies. There is no right to deprive hardworking employees of any money due to them. There are two or three corporate companies that said, "Sorry, we are not going to pay your bonus this year because of this impact." We will be looking into those companies and see how the decision-makers of those companies have done. If they have got bonuses and deprived their employees of that saying this happens due to a Government imposition, I think that is very unfair. We call upon them, if they had a wrong interpretation to correct it now. Our intention is to develop the economy and through that growth the benefits will percolate to the people.

This is the reason why we brought in this Super Gain Tax. So, we are basically looking at collecting Rs. 70 - 90 billion. Now, the reason I am being so nebulous is that there is no exact calculation methodology in the Inland Revenue Department. The files that have been there are in a very poor state. I do not understand as to how the system has been functioning there. It seems that information was not maintained deliberately. That is the reason why the total revenue to GDP is going down so drastically. But, I would say with all happiness, that by the 1st of January 2016, we will be modernizing the entire accounting system. It will be more electronic-oriented. Your National Identity Card will be used as a base where everything will stem from that. That will be a focal point. From the time you are born, you will be having this designated number and all transactions that will be made in the country would be done through that. So, that revolutionary approach will certainly help us to collect more revenue, reduce cost, as well as target areas where subsidies are needed.

Then, the next levy we intend to bring in is the Betting and Gaming Levy. It was our concerted effort to target Rs. 1,000 million - Rs.1 billion - from casinos that are operating. Now, these are being practiced in the breach. Unfortunately, there are no laws governing that. As a result, they practice it and when the question comes about, Why is official approval not given?" then, there is dichotomy that prevails. I guess that owing to the seriousness of the political ramifications, the approach to this has to be looked at from a completely different point of view. So, we will spell this out in the Budget as to how this industry has got to go, because it is unfair for the Government to collect money and put the people who are paying it into jeopardy as well. Either we collect it or we do not collect it. I guess that needs to be clearly spelt out. So, that would be a decision of the Government and I do not want to make a singular approach to that. So, we will give a very clear statement on that.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Minister, your approach is right, because this contribution is not going to help anybody.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, nobody. So, I guess we need to have a discussion with all religious leaders and all parties and then come to a conclusion as to what has got to be done, because that is the way forward. Then, you will know what the Government policy would be for this. So, until such time, we charge Rs. 1,000 million - Rs. 1 billion - per casino. This is effective from April onwards. It is payable with immediate effect for this year.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Minister, do you think that is a practical thing? Are you confident that you will get this money?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Well, we looked at past practices, Hon. Member. When it was an increase from Rs. 5 million to Rs. 200 million, nothing happened - they paid it. And, at that time, the economy was in a very low level. So, that increase was a dramatic 500 times over. We are only making it five times over. So, on the scale of how it happened. -[Interruption.] Magnitude is there. But, the economy has also grown in the same proportion. When the per capita income was US Dollars 800, it was increased to Rs. 200 million. Now, it is US Dollars 3,600. So we increased it proportionately. Hon. Member, if you ask my honest opinion, I would say, Yes, it is payable, but whether it is doable is a different question". But it has to be paid. There is no question about it. Either they do it or they close it. I would say that there is a huge opportunity that is there. So, let us get the Government policy coming in, because I do not want to stand in that and after that is known, we will ensure that it is effective. So, I call upon all of them not to practice in the breach. The Government institutions are there to ensure that you comply with this. This money is not going anywhere, not to anybodys pockets. . , , , , . .

[5.41 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Hon. Presiding Member, it is my privilege to come before this august House to represent the people of Kegalle. So, at the outset, let me take this opportunity to thank the voters of Kegalle for bestowing upon me this honour, which I will exercise to the best of my ability. I am also humble that the people of Kegalle have shown faith in me, just as they had done in electing my father and my grandfather to this House before me. Therefore, I will remain true to the intent of the people who voted for me and will continue to function as a Member of the UPFA that will remain in the Opposition.

In addition, I take this opportunity to thank you, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to present my Maiden Speech on the very important subject matter of "taxation".

I believe, the Hon. Members who spoke before me have stated what wonderful things that the new Government has set about in bringing structural changes to the economy. And we also know, Sir, that no democratic government in history has functioned or will be able to function without taxes. Benjamin Franklin

equates death and taxes as the only inevitabilities in life. But other critics have stated "taxation is nothing more than legalized robbery". Wherever the truth may lie, we cannot disregard the importance of taxes. Sir, history has also shown us great repercussions that have taken place when unjust taxes or taxes without consent are applied. Taxes have not only been instrumental in bringing down governments, which we often see in the Western hemisphere, history has also shown us that unjust taxes have brought down Empires as in the case of the Salt Tax of India. In the creation of the United States, it is fair to say that taxes brought its independence due to the British Empire's policy of taxation without representation.

I do not wish to speak at length on all the six Bills taken up today, but I wish to speak only on the Finance Bill. However, it is with regret I state that I see neither good economic reasoning nor a convincing moral ground for the increase in proposed taxes in this Bill. When one-time retrospective taxes are introduced, we must look at the short-term benefits versus the long-term message which we send out. A retrospective tax on companies or for that matter the introduction of any retrospective tax, except under extraordinary circumstances, such as war, has to be viewed as an attempt to deprive the fundamental economic freedoms of citizens of this nation. A retrospective tax has no moral authority. It takes away the fundamental requirement in law - predictability. From an investor perspective, it is a nightmare. And what is further surprising is that this country, having endured a 30- year brutal war, had not imposed retrospective or the Super Gain Tax during the course of the war, but the new Government imposes such a law, five years later after the completion of the war and during a period of relative economic prosperity in its maiden Interim Budget.

What is more disturbing is the fact that these taxes have been proposed by a Government which promised "Yahapalanaya" or good governance. Such a Government must then, of course, impose higher standards and work on a higher moral authority. Other than frightening away the investors, the proposed Super Gain Tax will also result in altering the level playing field. It will also contribute in taking away the future earnings and make planning and future investments extremely difficult.

The argument that goes around in some circles, particularly by the Minister of Finance, is that the Super Gain Tax is a mechanism to iron out "ill-gotten" gains by certain companies also do not hold ground. Sir, if such is the case, would it not be wise for the Government to follow with criminal proceeding against the accused companies rather than arbitrarily penalizing all the large companies? In any case, how many large corporates quoted in the Colombo Stock Exchange, for instance, can be accused of "ill-gotten" gains?

The Casino Industry Levy, Direct-to-Home Satellite Services Levy and the Dedicated Sports Channel Levy

are viewed by the public as more sinister in nature. Jean-Baptiste Colbert, a highly-respected Minister of Finance during the reign of King Louis XIV, describes the art of taxation as plucking the goose as to obtain the largest amount of feathers with the least possible amount of hissing. However, with the above-mentioned taxes, the Government is not interested in increasing the hissing of the bird, but wants to kill the goose altogether.

As with the flow of certain political events in the rest of the country, the Casino Industry Levy, Direct-to-Home Satellite Services Levy and the Dedicated Sports Channel Levy can only be described as nothing more than revenge taxes, particularly targeting enterprises which this Government feels favoured the previous Government. I must also warn, Sir, if the Government continues in implementing such a short-sighted policy, it will not only have great negative economic implications but it can also create precedence for future governments to carry out similar sinister taxation methodology targeting what they believe are enterprises that favour a rival regime.

Taxes are also supposed to be fair. I would also like to ask the Government, what good rational have they used in imposing a tax of Rs. 1 billion on a sports channel? For instance, at a future date, if an investor opens a teledrama channel, a leisure channel or a lifestyle channel, would it also warrant a Rs. 1 billion tax? Is it the policy of this Government to view sports as so adverse to the society and only a sports channel will require a Rs.1 billion tax? There is no logic in this. In any event, Sir, the general perception of the Direct-to- Home Satellite Services Levy and the Dedicated Sports Channel Levy is not far from the truth that these two taxes are targeted for the sole purpose of sending two companies out of business.

The Mobile Telephone Operator Levy, although a "one-time tax", also sends out a wrong signal. We should be mindful that the telecommunication sector has seen a remarkable growth during the last ten to fifteen years. It can also be noted for the continuing growth of this sector, companies engaged in this sector need to make large capital investments every few years. There are also a multitude of other industries such as IT industry, logistics et cetera which depend on the growth of the telecommunication sector. Retrospective taxes of this nature will be detrimental not only to this sector, but also to the general socio-economic development which will result as a by-product of growth in this sector.

The Mansion Tax and the Migrating Tax have both merits and demerits. Many countries with land restrictions such as Singapore have imposed Mansion Tax and such a tax can benefit in restricting conspicuous consumption. However, Sri Lanka does not have a land issue. Furthermore, I feel that this tax too will be unjust, particularly, in terms of collecting the tax revenue. Sir, what will set forth as a result of this tax is that, all houses which fall into the "mansion" category built between the

years of 2000 and 2015 will end up paying the tax and future house owners who would fall into the "mansion" category, will simply revert to obtaining two assessment numbers and avoid the tax altogether. This tax will also increase the already heavy administrative burden on the Inland Revenue Department, when, in principle, we should be looking at simplifying the tax structure.

When we look at the merits of the Migrating Tax, it can be argued that most people who migrate are professionals. And most professionals in Sri Lanka have enjoyed the benefits of this country such as free school education and university education. Therefore, one can argue that a citizen who has enjoyed the countrys benefits and who is leaving the country for his or her personal benefit can be justified in paying a one-time tax" for the country. But, here again, I believe, we end up asking a wrong question. Perhaps, the better question to ask is, "why are these professionals leaving the country in the first place?"

As a Government what measures can we take to address this issue other than imposing a tax? I feel that the primary reason for migration in Sri Lanka is the lack of opportunity and recognition, and perhaps it will be better for this House and the relevant Ministers to take appropriate action to address the fundamental reasons of migration rather than tax the migrants and make their chances of success in a foreign land all the more difficult. This tax will only result in migrants resorting to dispersing their monies through the black market.

Sir, in my humble opinion, we do need a revision on our tax structure, and most certainly a more simplified version. More importantly, I believe that we also need to bring a larger percentage of the population into the tax web. I feel that this can only be achieved by changing the attitude and the perception that the public have towards taxes. It is easy to see why many evade taxes when most who pay feel that their tax rupee is not going for good use. Furthermore, we need to bring in a technological solution to capture and monitor citizens falling under the tax brackets and to reduce the administrative burden on the Department of Inland Revenue. But, what we do not need is one-time policies of this nature where the long-term message will far outweigh the short-term benefits.
