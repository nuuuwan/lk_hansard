( , ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage) Mr. Deputy Speaker, the Hon. Member gave notice of this Question yesterday and the reply is as follows: ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) ; , ! ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Well, I know. I have the questions; the first question is regarding the waste oil. The Answer is: 1) I. Yes, for the details, refer to the attached Report, which I table* as Annex 1, but I will read the synopsis of it. Pattern of oil spreading showed towards northern side up to 2 kilometres from Power Station area. Based on the following analyses done by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board: * Totally, 150 wells were analysed.

* 109 (73 per cent) wells have shown the higher oil level than the standard while 07 (4 per cent) wells were under the limit and 34 wells (23 per cent) were not contaminated with oil and grease. * The oil and grease contamination was observed within 1.5 kilometres of the surrounding of the power station.

* As per the map which I table* as Annex 2 (contamination in the area as at 13th August, 2014), the high oil and grease concentration layers were observed in the surroundings of the Chunnakam Power Station area.

* Oil spreading pattern was observed towards the North, up to 1.50 to 2.0 kilometres. Oil

contaminants were spread further in the North compared to the other direction which have a spread of less than 1.5 kilometres.

The second question is regarding the Cabinet Appointed Committee. II. Yes. But the report is still in the process of final preparation by the Cabinet Appointed Committee. III. Continuous water supply is provided to the affected areas. There are six bowsers provided for this area to supply 225,000 litres per day by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board and the Pradeshiya Sabha since the Cabinet Decisions made on 17th December, 2014 and 11th February, 2015. So, the people are getting water for their drinking purposes free of charge, which is delivered to Chunnakam and Tellippalai areas. If the affected people have made a request, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board we will provide the necessary water. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board is planning for a major water scheme and funds are to be allocated. Groundwater of Chunnakam area is subjected to pollution due to agricultural activities, fertilizer used, over extraction of water and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board had to shut down the scheme in June 2012 due to the oil contamination. Then, Question No. 2 is about the Task Force appointed by the Northern Provincial Council. 2. (i) Yes, a Task Force for clean water was formed by the Northern Provincial Council in order to mitigate the problem with several objectives. The first and foremost is to ensure that the people from affected area get drinking water, which is being carried out effectively. The Regional Manager of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Jaffna, is one of the active members of the Task Force. During the formation of the Task Force by the Northern Provincial Council in January 2015, it was Regional Manager, National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Jaffna, who got involved with them and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board allowed him to work as per the Cabinet Decisions made on 17th December, 2014 and 11th February, 2015. The Cabinet Decision clearly informed that they should work with the local authority. The second one is to find out the extent of the oil polluted area and the toxic substances in the affected wells. In order to achieve this, an expert committee was formed with the local experts by the Provincial Council, without the participation of the National Water Supply

and Drainage Board. The appointment of the expert committee was not communicated to the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage or the National Water Supply and Drainage Board regarding the appointed Task Force meeting. But, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board and other water-related Government institutions were not included in the expert committee. (ii) It was officially not communicated to the National Water Supply and Drainage Board or the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage. However, as it was published in the local media, we were aware through the preliminary information of the expert committee. (iii) The National Water Supply and Drainage Board did a study from November 2013 to October 2014 and the expert committees study was carried out in the recent past. Until the final report released by B.M.U.D. Basnayaka-headed committee and NPC-appointed committee are published, we are not in a position to comment about it. (iv) Through the Media Regional Manager of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board of Jaffna. (v) Once both reports are released, a detailed study is needed for the confirmation. Our regional laboratory is closely engaged in discussing with the public. In addition to this, I would like say that there was a meeting summoned by the Hon. Prime Minister at 11 oclock in Parliament today. This morning, there was a meeting. I was also not aware that it was related to this matter. There, we pointed out that the ADB-funded Desalination Project presently does not cover the Chunnakam area, and if we are to extend the scope of that project to the Chunnakam area, since contamination of water is now observed - ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) Desalination ? ?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, it is near the - ! I do not know the place exactly.

( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) -

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No. They will draw seawater -

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) !

- There are two methods that have been applied. The methodology adopted by this expert committee appointed by the Provincial Council is called BTEX methodology. Our measurement is based on the hydrocarbon method. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board has found clear traces of oil and grease. [Interruption.] Yes, that is right. Our Report - ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) ? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Our position is that there is contamination. People cannot drink this water. ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) They cannot drink? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Yes. Therefore, -
