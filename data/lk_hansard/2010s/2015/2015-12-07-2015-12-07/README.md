asked the Minister of Industry and Commerce: (a) Will he state - (i) separately, the annual consumption of incense sticks and incense powder in Sri Lanka; and (ii) out of this amount, the amounts produced in Sri Lanka and imported from abroad, separately? (b) Will he also state - (i) the raw-material used to produce incense sticks and incense powder, separately; (ii) whether there is an institution in Sri Lanka that checks whether these raw-material are harmful or not to the human body; (iii) if so, the name of that institution; and (iv) whether that institution, by so checking, identified institutions that produce incense sticks or incense powder using those harmful raw-material? (c) Will he further state - (i) whether steps will be taken to prevent the use of raw-material that are harmful to the human body in the production of incense sticks and incense powder; and (ii) if so, what those steps are? (d) If not, why? ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Sir, the Answer to Question No. 6 is as follows:

(a) (i) It is estimated that approximately 550 to 600 million incense sticks are consumed annually. No statistics are available regarding daily/annual consumption of incense powder. (ii) 60 per cent of this produced locally and the balance amount depends on imports.

683 684

2015 07

Quantities and values of imports:-

Quantities and values of exports:-

No statistics are available regarding incense powder.

(b) (i) Incense sticks -

Charcoal powder, powder of barks, wood powder, bamboo splinters, water, perfumes, baby oil colours (not compulsory), bomibarks, Ethyl Phthalate, fragrant powder mixture

Incense powder -

Agil, Dewadara, fragrant almonds, joss powder

(ii) Yes.

(iii) Institute of Sri Lanka Standards (It is not compulsory to check the quality when exporting incense sticks. It must be legalized)

(iv) Since checking the standards of incense sticks is not legalized, the incense sticks and incense powder manufacturers have not obtained necessary testing facilities from the Institute of Sri Lanka Standards.

(c) (i) Yes.

(ii) The incense sticks are manufactured under the supervision of the National Enterprise

Development Authority and Industrial Development Board, in consultation with the Institute of Industrial Technology and therefore, ingredients which are cancerous are not included.

A Control regarding import and export of incense sticks and incense powder is not done as per the schedule shown in the Gazette No. 1844/49 dated 08th January, 2014. It must be legalized. I table* the Gazette as Annex 1.

Yet, there is an opinion among the researchers and businessmen that some imported incense sticks contain cancerous ingredients namely, musk, musk ambrette, musk xylol, hence it is necessary to prepare a law to obtain a certificate of standardization from the Institute of Sri Lanka Standards for these incense sticks.

(d) Does not arise.

The headline news of the Sunday Times of 6th December, 2015 states, I quote:

President withdraws Rajapaksas 500-strong Army security

NSC must gauge threat assessment to decide on additional staff

President Maithripala Sirisena has ordered the immediate withdrawal of an Army security contingent of some 500 personnel assigned to his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa. The move came after ministers, at their weekly meeting on Wednesday night, discussed a report by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.. ( ) (The Hon. Chandima Gamage) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Order, please! A point of Order is being raised. ( ) (The Hon. Chandima Gamage) , ? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , . -[Interruption.] Sir, will you just allow me to conclude by reading this? ( ) (The Hon. Chandima Gamage) ? , . . ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I further quote:

.In terms of the report, former President Rajapaksa had been assigned 130 police officers besides 500 army officers and personnel. It came to light that there was documentation to confirm that Police Headquarters had given approval for its contingent.. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I am winding up. I will take two, three more minutes from our Group. I again quote:

703 704

2015 07

However, a Government source said there was no documentation either at Army Headquarters or the Ministry of Defence on how the soldiers and officers had been assigned.

President Sirisena had earlier directed Minister Karunanayake to submit a report to the Cabinet on how much it cost the Government to maintain the former President. This included the strength provided for his security, the number of vehicles allocated and staff paid by the state.

Hon. Presiding Member, I am pleased to participate in the Committee Stage Discussion pertaining to the

2015 07

Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment headed by His Excellency the President as well as the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources Management headed by my Friend, the Hon. Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa.

In dealing with the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources Management, I must here acknowledge the support given by the Hon. Minister to my Ministry, the Ministry of City Planning and Water Supply, in establishing new water supply schemes. It is imperative for us to continuously deal with the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources Management since we share their reservoirs and other water resources in order to supply drinking water to many parts in the country. In that regard, I must thank the Minister that he was present at a meeting summoned by me at the Ministry to resolve some of the outstanding issues pertaining to the Irrigation Department when it came to water supply schemes covering the entire Island. I was pleased that his Colleague from the same District of Moneragala, the Hon. R. M. Ranjith Madduma Bandara, who is the Minister of Public Administration, was also present since we discussed some of the issues pertaining to the Moneragala District and the Ampara District which concern some of the future schemes that are to be implemented.

Particularly, I would like to first deal with the need to have a proper reservoir built over Heda-oya, which flows through the Moneragala and the Ampara Districts and together with that, the Kumbukkan-oya, which the Hon. Minister mentioned, which of course will have a reservoir at Nakkala which will be also very useful in enhancing the existing water supply scheme and to expand drinkable water to many areas both in the Moneragala and the Ampara Districts. In this regard, we believe that the Heda-oya Reservoir is an important irrigation scheme which will capacitate the National Water Supply and Drainage Board to supply drinking water to the Siyambalanduwa area and also to Pottuvil. We had undergone severe difficulties in the Pottuvil area, both in the Pottuvil DS Division and Lahugala DS Division. We have had boreholes and those boreholes have all gone dry and therefore, the drinking water supply to the Pottuvil area and the Lahugala area have been seriously affected. The only option we have is to have the Heda-oya Reservoir built. In this regard, I urge the Hon. Minister to give it priority so that this long-standing problem of drinking water issue in Lahugala, Siyambalanduwa and Pottuvil areas will be resolved through the Heda-oya Reservoir being built.

Together with that, I have already spoken about the Nakkala Reservoir which will help Moneragala, Buttala and Madulla areas, which will certainly be a great boon when it comes to providing proper drinking water facilities. That will at least have the capacity of 15,000 cubic metres per day if that reservoir comes into being. Of course, the construction has now got underway and we will expect it to be very helpful towards these projects.

Then, the Members from the Batticaloa District in the Eastern Province have been very often raising the issue of raising the Unnichchi Tank bund. If we can raise it by about two inches that will help us to draw water and provide to Koralaipattu Central, Koralaipattu West, Koralaipattu South, Eravur and Valaichenai.

But then there is a suspicion by the Hon. Members representing the Tamil National Alliance that the surrounding areas, the other Tamil villages, may not get water if we use the water from the Unnichchi Tank to supply water up to Valaichenai. I must very categorically say that there is no intention by the Water Supply and Drainage Board to deprive the existing villages around the Unnichchi Tank. I will give a very solemn undertaking that we will make sure that all villages surrounding the Unnichchi Tank will also be included in the water supply scheme. No water will go out of the area before we provide water to the outlying villages in and around the Unnichchi Tank if at all we go ahead with the programme to draw water from the Unnichchi Tank by raising the level of the tank by another two inches. We believe that about 40,000 cubic metres of water could be held additionally to supply to the areas which I have already mentioned if we do this. Here of course we need the consent of the Irrigation Department to complete this project.

The other alternative is of course to join both Rugam and Kitul Tanks in Batticaloa. Rugam and Kitul amalgamation is another suggestion that has been made by the Irrigation Department. If that scheme could be put into operation early, that might help us to enhance the water supply to the areas that I have already mentioned - Valaichenai and Kalkudah areas. Particularly, there is a high tourism potential and many tourists are now coming towards Pasikudah and other places. Even those hotels lack proper water facilities. The way the expansion is taking place, if we are to meet the demands, it may be necessary for us to either resort to the Unnichchi Scheme and increase the level of the bund by two inches and then have an additional 40,000 cubic metres of water available for this particular purpose or otherwise the Rugam-Kitul amalgamation needs to take place. The Rugam-Kitul amalgamation has already been designed and it is expected to be completed much later. Because of the dire need to have a quick supply of water, this Unnichchi proposal has been made. Therefore, I hope the Irrigation Department will look into this request and one of these options would be put into operation very soon.

Then, of course there is the Yan-oya Project which I believe is also in the pipeline. This will solve a serious problem in Gomarankadawala, Padavi Sripura, Moraweva and Kuchchaweli DS divisions. These are areas affected by the CKD - the Chronic Kidney Disease - which is affecting the poor residents of Gomarankadawala, Padavi Sripura, Moraweva and Kuchchaweli divisions. This will also help us in

773 774

Kebithigollewa, Kahatagasdigiliya, Horawpatana and Padaviya divisions in the Anuradhapura District. Therefore, the Yan-oya Development Project by the Irrigation Department is a very essential project which has to be prioritized and completed as soon as possible so that this will help the Department of National Community Water Supply to supply clean drinking water to these areas that have been seriously affected with the Chronic Kidney Disease. His Excellency the President, I must say, has been chairing a Task Force aimed at eliminating the Chronic Kidney Disease and under his leadership, some decisions have been taken and I urge once again that Yan-oya Development Project be given high priority by the Irrigation Department.

There are other issues include the North Central Province Canal Project, which I believe is also being given some priority. There is also the Upper Ma-oya Reservoir Project which is also very helpful for us to embark on the balance areas in that sector.

Then, the Uma-oya Project has undergone some difficulties because of the tunnelling and seepage of water. I hope that some action is being taken to stop the leakages because the Ettampitiya Water Supply Scheme, the Hambegamuwa Water Supply Scheme, all depend on proper implementation of the Uma-oya Project. Then, implementing the Bandarawela, Haputale and Diyatalawa Water Supply Schemes by directing water to Dayaraba Reservoir from Uma-oya is a necessity.

Since there is only limited time, I mentioned these few important irrigation projects which will help us enhance the water supply schemes in the area. I must once again thank the Minister, the Hon. Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa, for having given us his time graciously to discuss some of these matters. I must also thank His Excellency the President who has given a very valuable leadership in the environmental and the Mahaweli development sector.

Thank you, very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Thank you. The next speaker is the Hon. Sivasakthi Ananthan.

: The issue of Muslim IDPs who were displaced from five Districts such as Jaffna, Mannar, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Vavuniya due to LTTE threats as far back as October, 1990 remains one of the key post-conflict challenges which also has a significant impact on the process of reconciliation. A large number of representations were made before the Commission on the plight of those IDPs who have been living under dire conditions for more than two decades, 20 years.
