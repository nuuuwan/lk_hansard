whether this is in accordance with the Policy Statement you made on the 5th of November. That is the key issue today. It is very clear that some of the Proposals in the Budget are contrary to what the Prime Minister stated in his Policy Statement. I would like to bring to your notice-

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees-

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Yes, Hon. Prime Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon.Prime Minister, have taken 45 minutes. I do not have time. If you are ready to give me time -

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe) I will make just one clarification. They are not in conflict and we are moving on to the path of a full economy in the next two years. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena)

In the next two years, okay. - [Interruption.] you have signed an MoU for two years. You are asking the investors to come, knowing that the Government is going to last only for two years. That is the first point. Already, the investors know the devaluation of the Rupee against the Dollar. You came to

1629 1630

2015 01

power when it was in the region of one hundred and thirties. Today, it is reaching the devaluation of Rs.150. It will pass Rs.150, I am telling you. In 2016, as you just mentioned indirectly, it will pass Rs.155. What is the effect of devaluation? Devaluation will send up prices of all imported items. You say cost of living will not go up. Hon. Minister, cost of living will skyrocket. Not only that, you are freezing the salary increases of the working people of this country. As a result, there will be a cost of living problem, the real wage will be depreciating. This is the crisis that we are going into. I accept when the Hon. Prime Minister says, We must all sit down with the realities and discuss, but the discussions about the realities have to be that we agree on a way out - not forcibly what you want; not forcibly what the TNA wants; it should be a national consensus if you so seek. Otherwise, you have declared one way and you say, "This is the only way"; like what I quoted earlier, Let the robber barons come.

? ? . ? ? . . [ ] ; . [ ] - [ ] ? 1815 1948 . .. . .. . But, today, the investors have enough countries to go to: Latin America, Africa and East Asia. So, do not expect them to come just because you are offering to do away with all the laws regarding land. We must have the laws in order. - Land Development Ordinance - . .. -

[3.08 p.m.]

. . ( , , ) ( . . - , , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Sir, many speakers from the Opposition have spoken, but I do not think they touched much on the Budget as there was more noise than reference to the Budget.

Basically, this Budget is reviving a crisis-driven economy with a people-friendly development Budget. Sri Lanka should take into account the famous words of the former US President John F. Kennedy: Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country.

We inherited a crisis-ridden economy and it is not an easy task to revive the economy which has been mismanaged for the last ten years. The Budget, 2016 is both a development-oriented and a relief-centred Budget. This implies that the main thrust of the Budget is twofold and it includes reducing the cost of living burden of the people while carrying forward the development agenda.

According to the Fitch Ratings, the Budget Proposals of the Government reiterate an ambitious set of economic reforms aimed at raising foreign investments, boosting private sector participation in the economy, promoting public-private partnerships, reducing the dependency in costly foreign borrowings, upgrading the ease of doing business and ensuring governance standards with the view to achieve inclusive growth, employment generation, shared prosperity and protecting the poor and the vulnerable. That is the theme of the Budget. In the Budget 2016, public investments have focused on infrastructure development, health, education and human capital development. Therefore, the Budget, not only helps to revive the crisis-driven economy, but also includes proposals to achieve people-friendly inclusive development. This is what this Budget entirely has in mind, but the Opposition misinterprets the terms of this Budget.

The past mistakes and mismanagement are challenges to the new Government. Under the previous regime, 60 to

1701 1702

2015 01

70 per cent of the total Budget was at the discretion of a few family members. As a result, the position of the Cabinet of Ministers was also eroded without any authority. Public assets were misused and were given to friends and relatives. The global confidence was eroded resulting in losing of foreign investments and wait and see policy of the private sector.

High unsustainable debt of 72 per cent of the GDP and excessive dependence on foreign commercial borrowings from a few countries on exorbitant interest rates, low growth, tamasha-ridden economy with wasteful expenditure, failure to look into the human rights issues and dignity of minority community had serious adverse implications on the economy.

Unemployment rate of educated youth is more than 20 per cent. The national policies were made on personal discretions and individual opinions of a few family members rather than based on national aspirations through wider consultations. Hence, the policy failures and Government failures resulted in accumulated burdens and had carried forward an impact on the Budget, 2016. This must be really studied by the Opposition. High debt servicing resulted due to exorbitant amounts of expensive foreign debts obtained by the previous regime which has imposed a limitation in managing the budgetary resources of the current year. Funds were mismanaged violating of tender procedures, principles of good governance with lack of transparency and accountability. Unsolicited proposals were also encouraged.

Public enterprises were managed badly with political motives and funds were diverted for other purposes. The total outstanding debt of SriLankan Airlines has amounted to Rs. 157 billion and about 72 per cent of that has been accumulated during the previous regime.

Although infrastructure-related development works were carried out in the past at an accelerated phase, there were very little concerns for value for money and as a result, the country was saddled with large amount of foreign debts and high debt servicing resulting in limitations imposed on spending.

Sri Lanka damaged its foreign relations, lost its international image and also got foreign assistance and the GSP Plus deprived due to poor handling of foreign relations. The country was isolated by the international community. There was a ban on export of our fish to the European Union, which makes up 68 per cent of the total fish exports and the annual loss is about Rs. 23 billion due to this ban. But in the last few months, we received positive responses from the global community as measures were taken by us to reinstate democracy, good governance, transparency and accountability. The Hon. Minister of Finance has formulated an excellent, people-friendly Budget covering all sections of the society, given these limitations.

The Budget, 2016 aims to promote macroeconomic stability, which includes maintaining a single-digit low inflation - that is, between 2 per cent to 3 per cent at end of the year - a high economic growth between 7 to 8 per cent, stability of balance of payment, increasing foreign exchange reserves, generating one million employment opportunities - a brainwave of our Prime Minister - poverty reduction, development of an agriculture-based rural economy and inclusive development that takes care of all vulnerable groups including the senior citizens, women and children.

The budget deficit in 2016 is expected to be Rs. 740 billion, which is 5.9 per cent of the GDP. The Budget expects the GDP growth rate to be between 7 to 8 per cent in 2016. Foreign Direct Investment, the export promotion strategy, the public-private partnership and private sector development are the key pillars of the budgetary framework. This Budget proposes that Sri Lanka should now be graduated from an inward-looking strategy to an outward-looking strategy to reach out to new markets beyond the boundaries of the country. In this Budget, the private sector is recognized as the engine of economic growth. Do not forget that, Hon. Members of the Opposition. Our exports have gradually declined and now stand at 14 per cent of the GDP, whereas imports have increased up to 27 per cent of the GDP.

The Budget Proposals for 2016 include the following very significant features. The land lease taxes on foreigners will be removed to promote investments. Investments are important, if the country has to do well in this economy. Then, the Budget has directed to establish an Export-import Bank - Exim Bank - to facilitate international trade. It will improve international trade in the country.

The Exporters Association of Sri Lanka has expressed their satisfaction over the Budget, 2016, as it proposes to establish an Export Development Council of Ministers chaired by His Excellency the President for the formulation and implementation of the countrys export development strategy.

Also restructuring of the Export Development Board, the Board of Investment and the formulation of an SME policy are considered as important pillars for export growth, SME development and inclusive growth.

The Budget laid down several foreign investment-friendly proposals including the lifting of restriction on foreign ownership of lands. Under the former regime, foreigners' owning of properties was banned in 2012 and the real estates leased to non-nationals were subjected to 100 per cent tax payable upfront for the entire duration of the lease. The Budget Proposals for 2016 remove that tax on non-nationals to promote Foreign Direct Investments. That is an important factor which we have to consider for the purpose of promoting Foreign Direct Investments.

1703 1704

This Budget has focused on the population below the poverty line - the low-income groups, the lower middle-income groups and on regions lagging behind. In Sri Lanka, over 20 per cent of the population earns less than US Dollars 2 per day. The Northern Province, the Eastern Province, the Uva Province and other Provinces are lagging behind due to being ignored when it comes to development.

Sir, agriculture is a cornerstone of our economy. The Government is formulating a new agricultural policy to make the country self-sufficient in maize, soya beans, chilies, onions and potatoes by 2018 through crop diversification, to improve production and to graduate into an agribusiness with access to export market from a subsistence economy. The post-harvest losses are about 30 to 40 per cent. Therefore, the Government proposes to set up warehouses with state-of-the-art technology to address the post-harvest issues. A cash grant of Rs. 25,000 will be provided to a small-scale paddy farmer for a maximum extent of one hectare. This will allow farmers greater flexibility in selecting their farming inputs.

The Budget Proposals also highlight some of the important development interventions to make the life of the masses more comfortable and to uplift the national economy. That is very important. The Sri Lankan harbours are targeted to reach the top twenty harbours in the world by 2025. The Hambantota and Trincomalee Harbours will be revived for ship repairing and bunkering purposes. Then, Rs. 1,500 million has been allocated to develop the Kelani Valley Railway Line. Also the entrance point to Pettah is to be made convenient and the road will be developed from the Kelani Bridge up to Pettah. Rs. 1,000 million has been allocated to set up storage facilities for crops. New domestic airports are to be established in Digana, Badulla and Puttalam. The new access road from Kelaniya to Colombo Fort is to be built at a cost of Rs. 4,000 million.

Then, sweeping reforms will be introduced to streamline the operations of public enterprises and their management will be professionalized, not politicized. The private sector will be encouraged to join the management of the Katunayake and Southern Expressways. Public-Private Partnership in the operation of monorails connecting Negombo-Katunayake-Colombo and Colombo-Kaduwela is proposed in the Budget to strengthen the transport arrangements, which is a very important and a significant factor.

The 2016 Budget has given much emphasis to human capital development and to uplift the quality of human resources, so that we can compete internationally with other countries. In this context, health, education, technical skills and vocational training have been given important focus in the national Budget.

With regard to the health sector, substantial funds have been allocated and this includes Rs. 3,000 million for development of Anuradhapura, Jaffna and Kurunegala Hospitals; Rs. 2,000 million to construct a specialized hospital for kidney diseases in Minneriya; Rs. 6,500 million to construct kidney dialysis centres and Rs. 3,000 million to construct three Cancer Hospitals in Nallur, Kandy and Matara.

Then Sir, with regard to the education sector, a sizeable amount of over Rs. 65,000 million has been allocated for capital development work for 2016. About 5.4 per cent of the GDP has been set aside for development of the education sector. Rs. 3,000 million has been allocated to construct a university named, "Mahapola University" in Malabe which would offer courses in Business Administration, English and Management and all the undergraduates will receive accommodation facilities, which is an important step.

The majority of this country who migrate for employment have been serving as housemaids because the education system in the past has not improved their skills in technical and vocational areas and such focus was absent in the then GCE O/L and A/L curricula. The Budget proposes technical and vocational training for O/L and A/L students which help bridge the gap between education and employment and help them access decent employment on par with their educational qualifications. Every student to complete A/L education or receive vocational training after O/L is to be made compulsory. Then, Rs. 300 million has been allocated to grant interest-free loans to university students to purchase laptops. The number of students in a classroom will be limited to 35. Also, Rs. 30,000 million has been allocated to upgrade and improve facilities of 1,360 neglected schools. Further, Rs. 15,000 million has been allocated to provide libraries and IT centres in schools. Sir, Rs. 250 million has been allocated to develop estate schools. Import taxes on books, journals, magazines and sports goods will be removed completely. Then, Rs. 4,000 million has been allocated to provide sanitation facilities to schools. Many schools do not have proper sanitation facilities. Poor attendance and increased dropouts are partly attributed to lack of sanitation facilities. Then, Rs. 2,000 million has been allocated to provide accommodation and other amenities for school teachers and conduct continuous training programmes, particularly, for Science, Mathematics and English teachers. The education sector will be modernized with the introduction of life skills and independent thinking and exam-centered education system will be replaced by a skills-centered system.

Then, Sir, the Budget also proposes to strengthen and improve the banking and financial sector. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka had failed in its role as an independent regulator in the past due to politicization which led the the finance companies prone to vulnerability. This Budget proposes to change this situation by restructuring

1705 1706

[ . . ]

2015 01

the banking and financial sector and several banks are to be merged to set up a stronger financial institution.

Then, with regard to the housing programme to cover lower and middle-income groups, 100,000 housing units for families living in shanties; 150,000 housing units for middle-income families and 5,000 housing units for senior public sector employees will be constructed. This is a remarkable initiative. Sir, Sri Lanka is going to be an asbestos-free country by 2018 and this is also on a request made by His Excellency the President.

Vocational training will be provided for construction workers and import taxes on construction material will be reduced. In addition, foreign contractors will be encouraged to work with local contractors. The use of solar energy will also be encouraged.

Fisheries harbours will be developed to support off-shore deep sea fishing and Rs. 750 million has been allocated for the development of Chilaw, Mirissa, Kalmunai and Karainagar Harbours.

Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises -MSMEs- will also be strengthened. Strengthening MSMEs is considered as a strategy for poverty reduction, employment generation and inclusive growth. Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises covering sectors such as furniture, IT, dairy products, flowers, fisheries will be supported through loans and an Act governing MSMEs will be introduced with a regulatory body. Banks are to move away from collateral-based lending to business model-based lending in order to promote MSMEs. In the past, the schemes to eradicate poverty were politicized and those in real need were deprived assistance. Venture capital arrangement and incubator assistance to MSMEs are to be provided by the Budget.

Sir, this Budget has reduced prices of 13 essential goods to ease the living conditions of the general public. Market rate vouchers will be issued for students to purchase school uniforms so that they will have a choice to purchase quality uniforms on competitive basis.

The Budget has simplified the tax regime to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of government revenue collection and at the same time, introduces a business-friendly atmosphere creating a win-win situation both for the Government and the private sector with decent economic growth for the country.

The Government proposed Park and Drive facility whereby the vehicles coming to the city will be required to carry a minimum of four passengers and any vehicle that does not comply will be imposed a tax.

The Budget has increased the ceiling of fixed deposits of senior citizens from Rs. 1 million to Rs. 1.5 million with a return of 15 per cent per annum and reduced the

age limit of senior citizens from 60 to 55 years. The rate allows the bank to pay 14.06 per cent on a monthly basis which amounts to Rs. 17,575 per month.

Sir, the Government considers democracy, freedom and respect of rights as key pillars of economic and social development. During the past regime, the oppressed people, communities, media and civil societies could not come out to express their views openly either by protest or by other means. Today, you can see that the Government has provided opportunities to express their views openly and even assemble for protest marches which are considered vital elements for democracy and freedom.

The Budget also proposes to increase the representation of women in elected political institutions to 25 per cent.

As set out in the Budget, grievances of the people in the war-affected areas are to be addressed by the Government. Significant amount of funds will be allocated to implement development projects in the war-affected areas. It proposes to convene a Special Donor Conference in 2016 to generate support from bilateral and multilateral agencies to enhance the rehabilitation of the North and the East.

The Budget also expressed commitment to address the issues of Internally Displaced People -IDPs- immediately and initiate a rapid large-scale resettlement programme and provide basic needs and livelihood opportunities to the already settled families. Sir, 20,000 houses will be built in Mannar and Mullaitivu with proper sanitation facilities, access to clean water and electricity. Improvements in the construction of Delft Jetty, renovation of roads from Velanai to Kayts, establishment of clinical waste management have also been incorporated. A sum of Rs. 14,000 million is allocated for North and East development. A Public-Private Partnership is to be established to strengthen the red clay factory in Oddusuddan to enhance the livelihood of the people. Construction of Mini-Industrial parks in Jaffna, Vanni and Ampara with incubator assistance to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises has also been considered. The Proposal for Agro Livestock and Fish Processing Park in Vavuniya and Kilinochchi is also an important initiative. Fisheries harbours with the state-of-the-art technology in Kalmunai, Valvettithurai and Karainagar will extend support to develop the fisheries sector. An Aquaculture Park in Batticaloa under the Public-Private Partnership arrangement will help develop the coastal aquaculture without causing environmental degradation. A new Rural Economic Zone is to be established in Vavuniya to develop the rural economy. In addition, a Cancer Hospital is also to be established in Nallur.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister your time is over.

1707 1708

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Give me two more minutes to conclude, Sir.

A new Industrial Zone will be established in Trincomalee. Sir, the North-East Expressway will be developed connecting Dambulla, Polonnaruwa, Mullaitivu and Jaffna under Public-Private Partnership.

Mr. Presiding Member, Rome was not built in a day. The Opposition should also not forget that Emperor Nero fiddled while Rome was on fire. I think that is what the Opposition is doing now. With the excellent direction, development-orientation and professional approach, a delicate balance is maintained between the much-needed economic reforms and price reduction of essential goods.

The unexpected cost from the contract signed by the past Government has also restricted the space available to the Government to manage resources in a very prudent and efficient manner. The Government has introduced a Zero-Based Budgeting system which helps to rationalize all public expenditure based on relevance and justification.

The Budget has also covered the business community, development community, general public, low and middle income groups, women and children, the vulnerable, senior citizens, public officers and all concerned stakeholders. It is not easy to cover all parties who have a conflict of interest. Sir, I consider this as a Development-oriented, people-friendly Budget" which covers the aspirations of all Sri Lankans. This Budget will be a major milestone to create an upper middle income economy with inclusive growth and development.

Mr. Presiding Member, let me very specially thank His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena and the Hon. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for the leadership and guidance provided and the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, Minister of Finance, for presenting a people-friendly development Budget that covers all sections of the society.

Thank you. [3.29p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Angajan Ramanathan) Hon. Presiding Member, firstly, let me express my sincere gratitude for the recognition and the inclusion of the voice of people of the North who voted for a national level party.

I would like to take this opportunity firstly to thank all my voters from the Jaffna and Kilinochchi Districts who

worked voluntarily and tirelessly to bring about a change in the Jaffna political landscape. Even though I was short of only two thousand odd votes, His Excellency the President Maithripala Sirisena did not let the efforts of my voters go waste. I thank His Excellency the President Maithripala Sirisena for recognizing my work and appointing me through the National List and letting the voices of the moderate people be heard and setting in motion a new trend for the Sri Lanka Freedom Party to become a new political force in the North.

I was historically elected as a Member of the Northern Provincial Council from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in September, 2013; the first Tamil to be elected from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party ever in the history of the North. Sir, this allocation of National List to Jaffna comes after nearly 40 years at a much-needed time, with this His Excellency the President Maithripala Sirisena having passed a message to the people of Sri Lanka that this Government and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party will function with inclusiveness of all communities representing all parts of Sri Lanka without any prejudice.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank my father greatly for planting the seed in me - the dream of helping the people. He has helped people irrespective of power or political positions. Now, I am making his dream a reality and I have made it my life mission.

I believe that we have now been presented with a historical and golden opportunity to change the future of this country for the betterment of every citizen. In deference to many past opportunities that we missed, this time around, majority of opposing political forces are together and are in harmony. They are ready to make the changes.

I would like to take this opportunity firstly to wish the Hon. R. Sampanthan on being appointed the Leader of the Opposition and secondly, I humbly request and invite the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. R. Sampanthan and the rest of the Opposition to join forces with us to positively transform this country and the nation to a vibrant, peaceful, forward-marching State of victory. Relationships can be mended but missed opportunities are missed opportunities and we will never know the real opportunity cost.

After more than three decades of civil war and millions of unpleasant memories, people of this country are now divided in some shape or form based on the ideologies, causes, beliefs and the Party which they supported and continue to support at present. The war has ended but the fighting has not. It is a fact. If we need to change that, let us look at what happened in a more rational way; let us come to terms with the ground realities and try to formulate a strategy for this country based on facts and learning. There is a victor of the civil war and there is also a loser. Let us make extremism

1709 1710

2015 01

the loser and the people of this country the winners of the war. It was never a fight between the Sinhalese and the Tamils.

After more than six years since the end of the war, we all can agree that people of this country are genuinely enjoying the dividends of peace and their freedom. It is a fact. I do not believe I would be here delivering this speech had the war not ended. So, let us now deliver another victory to the people of this country by arriving at a national solution that we all can agree with.

Mr. Presiding Member, we need a win-win solution and that is the only sustainable way forward. But, that can happen only if we all can agree to make compromises. Once again, we all are divided and we all have aspirations. But, we cannot build a new nation if we are not ready to make compromises. The ground realities and the history has taught us enough and more lessons to know well that if one party becomes the sole winner, there will always be a loser at the other end working on their next move, a viscous cycle and a never-ending conflict that will never solve.

As a junior Member delivering my maiden speech, I would like to take this opportunity to call upon all the people of this country and their elected Representatives to join forces to create a nation of winners. His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena and the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Prime Minister, have jointly proposed and created a platform for all the Representatives of the Parties to take part in formulating a solution through the All Party Conference. Let us utilize that opportunity to discuss the problems, make concessions and agree on the way forward and let us create history; let us build a new country.

Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to appreciate the Budget, 2016 presented by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, the Minister of Finance.

I was happy to hear the announcement of creating one million jobs in the Budget. As a young Parliamentarian coming from the North, the heart of a previously war-torn area, where majority of our youths were once misled, had lost direction and even lost lives, I appreciate this effort as a new lease of life for our new generation. I humbly request to give special consideration to the youth in the North and the East as this would strongly change the mindset and give hope to our youth who have lost a lot in the past. I firmly believe this consideration would involve former rehabilitated LTTE cadres and war widows.

The government institutions in Jaffna and Kilinochchi which are non-functioning from the time of war, such as the Cement Factory, Paranthan Chemicals, Glass Factory in Kopay and the salterns, when re-started, will ensure direct and indirect employment to the region. This could solve some of our employment problems.

If an Export Processing Zone is established in the Northern Province, it would assist in providing business opportunities and especially employment and develop the economy of the people of Northern Province.

This Budget also includes allocation for repairing of the Jaffna Railway Line and the upgrading of the Jaffna Hospital which is appreciated. There is a huge human resource requirement in all the departments of the Jaffna Hospital and to mention especially is the shortage of nurses. The available number of nurses is 633 and the required number is 1,184. The reason for this is the shortage of people who have passed the GCE Advanced Level from the Bio-Science stream. This being the requirement to enter into nursing, an exception has to be made to take nurses from any stream of Advanced Level. This would immensely help not only in the employment of the youth, but also in the quality of our healthcare.

With the war for around three decades, some of the people of Northern Province have been displaced and living in welfare centres and rented houses. As an internally displaced person myself, I can understand the plight of their situation. These people were not displaced six years back at the height of war, but nearly 33 years back. Nearly around 1,300 families are still living in these welfare camps with no proper housing, sanitary facilities and livelihood. Most of them from the welfare camps belong to the coastal area and hence their livelihood was fishing. They have been staying in these welfare camps since the last 30 odd years without any livelihood and slowly the communities are deteriorating in quality and standard of life. The recent floods affected these welfare camps the most.

To ensure that the resettlement is fulfilled in accordance with the satisfaction of these displaced families with all requirements and to be expedited, I invite all Members of Parliament, especially from the Northern Province, to jointly request His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena to head the resettlement programme. The relief that was earlier paid to these displaced families in welfare camps has now been stopped. I humbly request it to be continued until resettlement is fully completed and to allow these displaced families to do their fishing activity as a livelihood in their village fisheries harbour in Myliddy, which is in the High Security Zone.

Chavakachcheri and Kopay are the two Divisional Secretary's Divisions with the largest land area in the Jaffna District and the people of the respective areas have voiced the need to part these and this is in line with the mindset of the respective administrative officers.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have one more minute.

1711 1712

( ) (The Hon. Angajan Ramanathan) Sir, please give me two more minutes.

With the end of the war, suffering of the people who were in the middle of the conflict is no more and they can feel the difference. But there are still some people who are emotionally suffering and seeking a closure. They are political detainees taken in during the war and their families. Some have been detained for over a decade.

I take this opportunity to thank His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena for showing genuine and special attention to the plight of the political prisoners and their families and having assured that a step by step initiative will be taken to free them. However, I humbly request to consider the following when expediting the process for their release: grant amnesty on humanitarian grounds for the Tamil political prisoners who have been detained for a long period; have plans to absorb the released people into the society; create sustainable livelihoods for these released people; create economic opportunities to these people who have been released and empower these people in their mid-lives to re-start their journeys with knowledge, skills and opportunities.

However, as a young politician, it is indeed with great sadness I heard of the suicide of Senthuran, an Advanced Level student, a young boy of around 18 years, which could have been avoided with proper guidance. We should not politicize this or encourage this. It is not only the school management but also the duty of parents and the society to guide the younger generation to become good citizens. As citizens, we should be law-abiding and respect whichever government is in power. This should be taught from young age to avoid terror psychosis. Therefore, I am confident that this Parliament will ensure that the Pearl of the Indian Ocean is a paradise to the future generations. Thank you.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you for giving me this opportunity. On the 29th of January this year, the Hon. Minister of Finance in his statement issued on this Floor on the 100-day Revolution declared that the 8th of January 2015 would be remembered as the day the nation Regained Freedom. The second freedom would not have been possible if not for the courage and determined decision taken by the minorities to join force, participate and play a significant role in liberating this country from the previous regime. This is despite all the crimes, injustices, discriminations and atrocities continuously poured on by them during their tenure and all other consecutive governments after Independence in 1948.

On 5th November, 2015, the Hon. Prime Minister delivered a Policy Statement to this Assembly that enumerated the platform for the Budget, 2016. The medium-term strategies proposed consisted of the following:

(a) Generating of one million employment opportunities

(b) Enhancing income levels

(c) Development of rural economies

(d) Ensuring land ownership to rural and estate sectors, the middle-class and Government employees

(e) Creating a wide and a strong middle-class.

In that Policy Statement, the Hon. Prime Minister also announced that Tokyo would be requested to convene a donor coordination meeting for the development of the North-East in 2016. We view this vision and economic strategy for development as a ray of hope and are encouraged and trust this and significantly rely on the donor conference to be held in 2016 to facilitate the real start to address the deep grievances of the devastated communities of the North-East.

The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, the Minister of Finance in his Budget speech announced and I quote:

Honourable Speaker, our government is extremely cognizant of the grievances of the people in the war affected areas. The people of the North East has been requesting the government to provide them with basic facilities during the last several years. While the government has committed to a significant amount of funds for the development of the war affected areas, we also plan to convene a Donor Conference in 2016, to generate support from bilateral and multilateral agencies to enhance the rehabilitation of the North and the East.

The TNA is of the view that despite repeated negative, disheartening and insensitive comments that are constantly being made by many quarters of the South, including many leading politicians from the Government,

1717 1718

[ ]

2015 01

we will engage, explore and be in readiness to receive this opportunity articulated to us by the Hon. Prime Minister and the Hon. Minister of Finance.

My speech, today, should in no way be taken as substitute or a stage in a permanent or lasting negotiated political solution. This is only a pragmatic recognition that there is potentially a win-win paradigm in the offing.

Sir, we welcome some aspects of the Budget, especially the ones that would benefit many in the North-East. Vast majority of the war-affected people of the North-East are entrenched below poverty level and the price reduction of essential items is a welcome relief to these people.

There is a proposal to construct 20,000 houses and immediately address the issues of internally displaced persons under the Resettlement Programme in the North and the East. In this regard, only Rs. 14,000 million has been allocated for different kinds of development work in eight war-affected districts in the North and the East; whereas, you allocate Rs. 12,000 million for the Polonnaruwa District alone for the "Pubudamu Polonnaruwa" as it is the District of His Excellency the President. What a just and balanced regional development priority under good governance! The approximate cost of construction for 20,000 houses alone would be Rs. 10,000 million. The Hon. Minister has proposed to do miracles out of the balance Rs. 4,000 million in the North and the East including a large-scale resettlement programme, improvement of the construction of Delft Jetty, renovation of roads from Velanai to Kayts, establishment of a clinical waste management system and establishment of a red clay factory in Odduchudan. Once again, we hope that all these would be implemented.

The undeniable fact is, our people who were brave enough to play a significant role in the "second freedom" are still anxiously awaiting any meaningful action to commence for their salvation.

The Budget for the year 2016 does not seem to recognize or reflect the ground realities of the North-East from the context of post-conflict development. This is despite what the Hon. Minister of Finance promised in his Budget Speech. He said, "Our Government is extremely cognizant of the grievances of the people in the war-affected areas".

However, this development-oriented Budget does not seem to recognize the fundamental predicament that the people in the North-East are facing, particularly the impeding frame conditions to realize the real benefits of any development effort. Despite all our enthusiasm in wanting the North-East to participate in the national development and to contribute to its progress in a positive and productive manner, there is continuing frustration

because we are not heard, understood or taken in any way seriously. There is a vast difference between Colombo and the North-East realities. National development is not just economic development, it encompasses social, political, environmental, cultural and even moral aspects. Serving more for the same, expecting the answers to be different and then going on blaming the victims will in no way help reconciliation.

Hon. Presiding Member, let me place on record and articulate the kind of impediments that are continuing to face. Resettlement sans community restoration will never succeed. If the current rehabilitation process is not associated with complementary reforms to change the frame conditions, it will not lead to sustainability, reconciliation and social integration of the affected. The problems and challenges faced by every single war-torn district in the North-East are unique in nature and no single prescription fits all. The national policy framework that is uniform in nature for the whole country that does not take into consideration the unique challenges faced by different regions and districts, is a recipe for disaster.

We want to be serious, please let us know if you are too. The current national policies are inadequate to carry out much-needed transition in the North-East and to implement the important programmes included in this Budget. National programmes and policies are designed on the basis of national parameters. The people of the North-East are in a conflict-emerging society. It has its own legacies, problems and needs. When you design the national policies, I could see no change in the frame of mind of the politicians of the South when it comes to accommodating the grievances of the Tamil people. In fact, there is hardly any change in the policy framework or conducive driving concepts in this Budget that reflect the challenges that must be addressed in the North-East.

The first step in any post-conflict development strategy is a holistic and comprehensive post-conflict sustainable development policy framework developed in a participatory manner empowering people and encouraging ownership. This Parliament has still not approved a policy framework for resettlement even after six years since the war ended. The much-discussed reforms recommended by the LLRC too are still to see the daylight.

Budget is an important policy pronouncement of the Government, and we believe, North-East and the country as a whole once again have another missed opportunity. Today, the reality is that the Tamil community has been vanquished, marginalized and pushed below the threshold levels of all aspects of a civilized society. Its innate potentials and capacities to rejuvenate itself as a sustainable community have been eradicated. There is no consideration to the capacity gap in the North-East to participate in any effective way to ensure development programmes produce sustainable outcomes. How can we

1719 1720

expect them to take over development responsibilities at local levels? The issue here is, the benefits of all interventions in the North-East will ultimately leak through as there is inadequate capacities at individual levels, family level and at community at large. All development efforts will be carried out by other actors and the North-East will continue to remain a recipient. If this fundamental fact is not recognized then the North-East will become a bottomless pit. There is no point in expecting any meaningful progress of this society: the dependency and vulnerability will perpetuate.

Disenfranchised community and people will become a handout depended society. People with such historical and proud culture will not require any handouts. We require our rights to freely engage in productive and fulfilling activities exploiting local resources. We strongly think this is not too much to ask for.

It is important to mention here that interventions since 2009 to improve livelihood of the IDPs have failed remarkably in the traditional sectors in the North-East. There is no rural and economic governance or basic framework to sustain the benefits of such interventions. Rural people have lost grip over the rural economy. Without a major institutional development and community restoration process, rural economy in these regions will be a Herculean task.

There is no recognition of all these prerequisites for a sustainable development. This is a clear demonstration in the Budget as to how serious the issues facing the war-affected communities are being taken centrally in Colombo. These frustrations will culminate in believing that reconciliation through economic development is secondary. I think that this will be looked at in due course, so we continue to wait for the Tokyo Donor Conference to even start the preparatory ground work to develop the appropriate frame conditions.

Sri Lanka proudly announced having achieved majority of the Millennium Development Goals and indicators. "Millennium Development Goals Country Report 2014 - Sri Lanka" was prepared by the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka, a joint publication by the Government of Sri Lanka and the United Nations in Sri Lanka. Its findings show that Sri Lanka has performed well against the MDGs overall, having already achieved or being on-track to achieve the majority of the goals and indicators. Speaking at the launch event, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva said: The Government of Sri Lanka understands the need in building bridges, in integrating our society, and in Sri Lanka being a country of Sri Lankans. I hope that we can make further progress in integrating the differences within communities. We have to ensure that in our market framework there is social goodwill and economic justice. That is what we mean by a social market economy.

Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga, Secretary to the Treasury, in his Foreward Message mentioned, I quote:

In the area of poverty, our achievements are noteworthy. Sri Lanka was able to achieve the MDG target of halving poverty, seven years ahead of the 2015 deadline both at the national level and also in the urban, rural and estate sectors. However, despite this strong performance, there remain regional disparities and it is for this reason that the Government has given the highest priority to eradicate poverty in those areas to uplift the living condition of the toiling poor people.

An extract from the Executive Summary of Millennium Development Goals Country Report 2014 - Sri Lanka says, I quote:

All districts, except those in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, for which reliable data are not available for comparison years, and the Monaragala District in Uva Province have already cut poverty in half.

Disparities among regions nevertheless clearly indicate the need for continuous monitoring, and focused attention of regional planners and policy makers if Sri Lanka is to continue to reduce poverty.

Outlandish announcements of the GDP growth of the Northern Province made by the Hon. Prof. G.L. Peiris before meeting Hillary Clinton on 08th May, 2012, on behalf of the previous administration, that the North experienced a 22 per cent GDP growth in 2011 is a fraud committed against the people of the North, to say the least.

Hon. Minister of Finance in his Budget Speech stated, I quote:

In short, the society at large is seriously concerned as to what the true state of the Sri Lankan economy is

This is because of information fraud and Goebbelstic promotions.

How can we rely on the official statistics produced by the previous regime that were used in drafting this Budget? The national growth rate, unemployment and poverty levels mentioned in the Budget have no relevance to our Region.

The Finance Minister also stated, I quote:

the data of Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) indicates that the poverty index had declined to 6.7 per cent. However, a true evaluation and a feature in Sri Lankas poverty indicators is that the number of people who earn less than US Dollars 2 per day, number close to 20 per cent indicating that a large share consists of a near-poor population.

Based on the above statement, the poverty indicators for the North-East bound to be dismal. Data that was provided for the assessment of Millennium Development Goals too emanated from the same source to paint rosy pictures of the war- affected areas. Credible data is critical for any democratic society and we have been denied this and our trust in the public-sector governance is also understandably seriously affected. As a national

1721 1722

[ . ]

2015 01

priority, immediate and focused attention is required to assess the real achievement of the North-East in terms of Millennium Development Goals.

Empowerment of rural communities and creating an enabling environment are fundamental for the current stage of development for sustainable socio-economic development in the North-East. There is a pressing need for the local communities and the Region to embrace indigenous knowledge base in all key sectors to convert all interventions to sustainable development. These communities must have their own enabling and conducive regulatory framework to address key sectorial issues, rural economic infrastructures and access to local resources. Most of this national policy framework require regional reorientation.

An allocation of Rs.1.5 billion has been allowed in the Budget for each village and it is disappointing that no consideration has been given for the conflict-affected villages that are facing unique sets of challenges. Strengthening rural institutions, infrastructure, small enterprise development and small-scale sundry services development, development of women and the vulnerable and rehabilitation and re-integration of ex-combatant by civil authorities are all pressing needs of our villages. We require tailor-made strategies and programmes for empowering our community.

It is the experience in other conflict-emerging countries that adequate space should be created for the people to participate in the decision-making process, lest the conflict is bound to recur in a different form in that society. Let me provide you an example to articulate the outcome of one top-down development programme that did not engage local views. There were untold hardships and sufferings of the people in the North due to the current heavy rainfall caused by expedient project management. In the construction of roads and train tracks, the local community did not have a say in any aspects of its planning. Now they are left to deal with the consequence of the issues caused by expedient and fraudulent project management that disregarded the adverse impacts of blocking the natural water flow in Jaffna. As a result of this Colombo-centric project management, communities of some areas who never experienced such flooding are now suffering for the first time. There are no adequate means to redress the impact of disturbing water flow patterns. The current Members of Parliament are forced to face the consequences and deal with such issues on a day-to-day basis, whereas they never had any involvement in the design of these projects.

Sir, there is an increasing trend in crimes, robberies, rapes, murders and a decline in the cultural values and moral standards. This is mainly due to the inability of the police to gain confidence and support of the community in handling the situation. People do not see the police as people-friendly, rather they see them as mafia-friendly.

The police which viewed the people as potential terrorists and the stations which functioned as anti-terrorist outfits cannot lead a culture and value-based policing required for social engineering in a conflict-emerging society. In the past, links with the underworld and undesirable elements were mainstream methods adopted for policing and intelligent tasks in the North-East. This has bequeathed this Region with a police-antisocial elements nexus network. The police continue to create and maintain fertile grounds to breed, nurture and protect criminals. In post-conflict countries, police and security reforms are considered a must for successful reconciliation. Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka, there is a high level of resistance to these reforms. In the post-war conditions, the current police force has no capacity to understand the value system and the culture of our people, to comprehend the impact of petty crimes that affect the individuals, families and the community as a whole.

Non-state Justice and Security system deals with the majority of the disputes in other developing countries and is an important complementary component of formal State justice. In view of the inability of the police, until we go through a transition, we need a community-based supplementary community policing system by which some of the elementary police functions are transferred to civil authorities. This is very essential to break the invisible dynamics that prevents an orderly social functioning. Therefore a community-based complementary system of justice is necessary until the police win the hearts and minds of the people.

The monstrous PTA that devastated and ripped the hearts of our people spans from inner sanctums of our temples to our bedrooms. This has still not been repealed. People of my Constituency are very nervous to hear that it is being considered in applying to ordinary crimes like murder et cetera. We have heard of a lot of instances of inappropriate application of this during the previous regime. If it is being used even in the era of Good Governance, it does not sound well. It is time to evaluate the performance of this law in respect of matters relating to human rights. Therefore, I request the Government to appoint an impartial commission of inquiry to see the misuse of this sordid Act. This will bring to light the plight of thousands of lives irreparably devastated due to direct consequences of this Act. Then, there are countless of their loved-ones who are traumatized still facing untold sufferings.

Then, resettlement, rehabilitation and redevelopment in this area consist mainly of activities that are local in nature and the subjects mandated to the local government bodies. They operate and maintain a major portion of local assets and service delivery systems. Unfortunately, they are left out from the process as they do not have resources and capacities. In order to revamp the local government bodies and to prepare them to take over

1723 1724

higher order development responsibilities, the previous Government developed a National Policy on Local Government after the war, in 2009, but did not implement it for obvious reasons. This was published in the Gazette Extra Ordinary No. 1632/26 of 18.12.2009. As a Government geared towards developing the rural economy and committed to a greater devolution and power sharing, it should implement the recommendations in this policy document forthwith. Some of the burning issues that affect the livelihood development of the war-affected and issues concerning the local economic governance would have been addressed by the implementation of the National Policy on Local Government which has been gazetted. Why such key reform measures, that have the potential to enormously benefit the war-affected areas, somehow did not get implemented?

Also economic policy planning and strategy development are still being engineered, steered and influenced by the security personnel and their associated institutions. The fear psychosis that is actively promoted is still rampant and is meant to help protect the gravy train of some individuals and to perpetuate and further marginalize this affected community. The Myliddy Harbour, which is one of our key resources has deliberately been omitted from any development. This is an example of the outcome of military designed economic strategy and that does not engender trust.

There is a mounting pressure from the IDPs for the lands for resettlement in the next phase in Vali-North area. The details of families, schools, common buildings, temples and churches in the identified area have already been worked out by the District Secretariat. In line with the Governments promise for resettlement, these lands may be released back to the people. One of the reasons stated for the inability of the security forces to release these lands is the existence of a number of camps and security related establishments within the area. However, similar camps and establishments exist even in the other areas in the Peninsula. Hence the lands could be released, except the areas where they actually locate, as a gesture of reconciliation in the next phase. I request that the entirety of the lands in West of Kadduvan-Myliddy Road and in East of Palali Road be released by the Ministry of Defence for the resettlement of IDPs.

Another reason as to why the Government is unable to win the hearts and minds of the people in our Region is the continuous hardships faced by the people due to poor conditions of roads. The benefits of the huge investments that took place in the North-East, particularly the construction of A Class and B Class roads, bypassed the victims of the conflict.

Sustainable resettlement and durable solutions to the problems of the IDPs are directly related to the status of

road infrastructure in the whole North-East Region, though their identity and location cannot be limited only to the areas where resettlement has taken place. Northern and Eastern Provinces have a road network consisting of C Class and D Class roads, the lengths of which are 1,950 km and 1,098 km respectively whereas the length of local roads in rural areas in Northern and Eastern Provinces are 9,200 km and 7,000 km respectively. These statistics have been taken from the Statistical Information -2014, Northern Provincial Council and Eastern Development Plan 2012 - 2016, Volume II of the Eastern Provincial Council.

In the case of C Class and D Class roads and local roads in rural areas, less investment has taken place when compared to its 30-year long period of non-maintenance, non-development and the damage caused. As a result, high cost of living, inefficiency, low productivity, poverty, unsustainable livelihood and other living conditions continue to remain among IDPs without improvement of roads. Unfortunately, more than 80 per cent of these two categories of roads are in disrepair. Almost all the access roads and rural roads have 60-year old design structure or they have no base structure at all. In some places, even a trace of a road cannot be found. This category of roads are the most affected, but such roads are directly serving the people in their day-to-day lives. So, the people are unable to reap the full benefits of the major road development programmes that have already been done without these roads. Therefore, as a measure of reconciliation and confidence building, larger road projects have to be mobilized as an urgent priority. The details of priority requirements are already available with the authorities concerned.

In view of the bleak prospects for major industries and diminishing role of the agriculture sector in the Northern Region, small enterprise sector has to play a dominant role in the creation of employment opportunities, reducing poverty and contributing to Provincial GDP. Therefore, the small enterprise sector will be the engine of growth in the Northern Province in future. The frame conditions that prevailed during the last 35 years did not permit this sector to develop. The National Policy for Small Enterprise Development was almost inoperative in this Province and the national service delivery systems could not adequately extend its coverage to the North.

As a conflict-emerging society, small enterprise development in the Northern Province has specific problems and legacies which cannot be handled under the generic national policies. Though various conventional services were extended in order for reactivating small enterprises in the Northern Province, due to various impediments they could not have any significant impact. A two-pronged approach is required in this connection - one aimed at addressing the specific issues in small enterprise development in the conflict-affected areas and

1725 1726

[ . ]

2015 01

the other aimed at extending the modified national programmes to suit the North in a well-coordinated manner. For this purpose, I request the Government to establish a special coordinating mechanism with special funds for the Northern Province.

Then Sir, with regard to the issue of groundwater in Jaffna, the serious situation of the groundwater sources in Jaffna was vividly presented by the senior officials of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board at the International Seminar on Groundwater Governance, held in Sri Lanka on 15th August, 2013. Inadequate water sources within Jaffna Peninsula to provide pure and clean drinking water is a major problem. Existing underground water resources are contaminated due to non-availability of sewerage systems. There is bacteriological and chemical contamination and intrusion of seawater. About 30 per cent of Typhoid cases in Sri Lanka are reported from the Jaffna Peninsula while cancer cases are increasing. Due to over-use of fertilizer, high level of Nitrate content and saline paddy-fields, farmers are losing their income. Water supply available in the Peninsula is at a minimum level where people have to spend long hours at stand pipes. Low attention has been paid to the groundwater monitoring, management of aquifers and pumping wells. Attention leading to corrective and preventive action is not taking place. Lack of sufficient knowledge of groundwater dynamics at operation level and over-extraction is causing quality changes finally leading to failure. There are many difficulties in controlling of interfering with aquifer. There is lowering of general groundwater table and decreasing recharge to aquifer. There is lack of proper institutional arrangement to manage groundwater.

There are more and more reports coming on the fast-deteriorating conditions, particularly, after the oil contamination in the Chunnakam aquifer. No agency has the power to take control of the resource management responsibility and a proper regulatory framework has also not been gazetted for this purpose. Since this matter will affect the health and livelihood of the people, consequences of the situation will be disastrous. Hence, this matter has to be taken up at the highest level and solution has to be arrived at in order to prevent large-scale disasters. If not for the conflict, this could have been settled long ago.

It will require a set of regulations for Jaffna Peninsula groundwater management and establishment of a regulatory body responsible for that under any of the water-related Acts. Also, a special comprehensive groundwater project has to be formulated and implemented to prevent any disaster as a reconciliation priority.

Then, the Northern Provincial Council could not recover Stamp Duty prior to 2014 as there was no Statute to recover that and this was collected by the Central

Government on its behalf. However, such revenue was not properly refunded to the Local Authorities in the Northern Province. As you know, the Local Authorities in the Northern Province were suffering due to their inability to generate revenue during the conflict period. For the period from 2011 to 2014, an amount of Rs. 1,202.3 million collected by the Centre has to be refunded to the Local Authorities in the Northern Province. The details of the Local Authorities and the amounts are already available with the Treasury. If this amount is refunded, it will reduce an enormous burden suffered by our Local Authorities. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister of Finance to release this amount immediately.

The Government cannot be ignorant of the serious consequences to the Members of Parliament in trusting the promises of this Government. We have a long history of being victims of broken promises from consecutive governments, but this time, we gave the benefit of the doubt to Good Governance Pronouncements. We also believed the positive commitment made to the international community by the Government to implement the recent UN Resolution.

Sir, I refer to the promise made by His Excellency the President to the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. R. Sampanthan, that all political prisoners would be released before the 7th of November and this promise was blatantly disregarded resulting in enormous damage to his standing to TNA and created a turmoil among the people apart from unnecessary human suffering.

The strategy of unkept promises may displace the current Members of Parliament, but please, understand these behaviours are galvanizing the frustrations of our communities and play into the hands of extreme views.

In conclusion, I would like to mention that a lasting political solution is fundamental for a sustainable economic development and reconciliation in the North and East. It is also equally important that nothing should wait or spared to take immediate actions to extricate our people from the misery suffered for many tens of years, irrespective of the reasons.

We wish to express our goodwill and willingness to take a positive and productive outlook presented in the economic vision statement and strategy by the Hon. Prime Minister and the promise of the Tokyo Donor Conference.

Having articulated our grievances, we are prepared and willing to contribute to extricate the entire nation from an extremely difficult predicament.

Today, I announce to this Chamber, that we recognize the opportunity provided to us. This country has formidable intellectual resources in and out to bring into

1727 1728

economic mainstream those who have been left behind; rectify the targeted historical marginalization and geographical bias; provide an equal playing field to the people of the North-East of Sri Lanka to face the immediate economic challenges; pave the way to create a positive atmosphere that could help to find solutions for the hard and complex subjects faced for a political solution; allow North-East too to play a role in addressing the economic challenges faced by this country to get all the cylinders pumping to take all of us forward and commence a journey on a win-win scenario for the country and to enable the North-East to confidently start taking actions to address the social problems that our proud culture is currently facing.

Sir, we too have challenges. In saying this, we are not underestimating the many challenges and obstacles ahead of us such as: lack of human resource and institutional readiness at all levels within public and private sectors; lack of adequate technological base and infrastructure; adverse and negative reactions from our constituents as they have had many disappointments, false starts, deep and lasting hurt and damages; fear psychosis propagated by the security apparatus in denying scope to play a constructive role.

We will in the near future, respond with a position paper and a high-level action plan that will carefully map out a way forward to provide our best efforts to contribute to the redevelopment of North-East.

We are also anxiously awaiting further details of the Donor Conference promised by the Hon. Prime Minister to participate with utmost goodwill so that not only the North-East but the whole nation can benefit.

It is our sincere hope that a positive and engaging attitude expressed in my speech is not taken for granted. We also believe that any further disappointments could result in perpetuating the perils all of us are suffering based on we win; you lose policies adopted over many years.

Thank you.

[6.57 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) First, I would like to thank the Hon. Member Mylvaganam Thilakarajah for bringing in this Motion. I would like to deal with the background of this issue. Pradeshiya Sabhas Act was brought in in 1987 and Sections 19 and 37 relate to villages. There, the question arose whether you could use the funds of the local bodies for the plantations.

I started my politics as a Vice-President of the CWC. Therefore, I know the hardships which the plantation people of this country face. The Members of the Cabinet representing the plantation sector made several representations to me and the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya started bringing in a Cabinet Paper. But then, after that, the portfolio was changed. So, I pledge to this House, in the near future, hopefully, within a week or two, I will tender a Cabinet Paper for bringing in an amendment to Sections 19 and 37. I think, this is long overdue.

I do not need to go into details. But, with this amendment, the Pradeshiya Sabhas will be able to work towards the plantation sector. It is unfortunate that from 1987 the political leaders representing the plantation sector have been unable to make this simple amendment. I discussed this matter with my Deputy Minister who represents the Ratnapura District where there are lots of plantations. He continuously agitated that we should look at this in a nationalistic way. We are all Sri Lankans and I assure you that we will bring in this amendment, which, I see, is a national need.

Thank you. .. 7.00 .
