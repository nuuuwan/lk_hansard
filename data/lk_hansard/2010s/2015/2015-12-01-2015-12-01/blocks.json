Minister, cost of living will skyrocket. Not only that, you are freezing the salary increases of the working people of this country. As a result, there will be a cost of living problem, the real wage will be depreciating. This is the crisis that we are going into. I accept when the Hon. Prime Minister says, We must all sit down with the realities and discuss, but the discussions about the realities have to be that we agree on a way out - not forcibly what you want; not forcibly what the TNA wants; it should be a national consensus if you so seek.

However, I humbly request to consider the following when expediting the process for their release: grant amnesty on humanitarian grounds for the Tamil political prisoners who have been detained for a long period; have plans to absorb the released people into the society; create sustainable livelihoods for these released people; create economic opportunities to these people who have been released and empower these people in their mid-lives to re-start their journeys with knowledge, skills and opportunities.",

We should not politicize this or encourage this. It is not only the school management but also the duty of parents and the society to guide the younger generation to become good citizens. As citizens, we should be law-abiding and respect whichever government is in power. This should be taught from young age to avoid terror psychosis. Therefore, I am confident that this Parliament will ensure that the Pearl of the Indian Ocean is a paradise to the future generations. Thank you.",

There were untold hardships and sufferings of the people in the North due to the current heavy rainfall caused by expedient project management. In the construction of roads and train tracks, the local community did not have a say in any aspects of its planning. Now they are left to deal with the consequence of the issues caused by expedient and fraudulent project management that disregarded the adverse impacts of blocking the natural water flow in Jaffna. As a result of this Colombo-centric project management, communities of some areas who never experienced such flooding are now suffering for the first time. There are no adequate means to redress the impact of disturbing water flow patterns.

Inadequate water sources within Jaffna Peninsula to provide pure and clean drinking water is a major problem. Existing underground water resources are contaminated due to non-availability of sewerage systems. There is bacteriological and chemical contamination and intrusion of seawater. About 30 per cent of Typhoid cases in Sri Lanka are reported from the Jaffna Peninsula while cancer cases are increasing. Due to over-use of fertilizer, high level of Nitrate content and saline paddy-fields, farmers are losing their income. Water supply available in the Peninsula is at a minimum level where people have to spend long hours at stand pipes. Low attention has been paid to the groundwater monitoring, management of aquifers and pumping wells. Attention leading to corrective and preventive action is not taking place. Lack of sufficient knowledge of groundwater dynamics at operation level and over-extraction is causing quality changes finally leading to failure. There are many difficulties in controlling of interfering with aquifer. There is lowering of general groundwater table and decreasing recharge to aquifer. There is lack of proper institutional arrangement to manage groundwater.",
