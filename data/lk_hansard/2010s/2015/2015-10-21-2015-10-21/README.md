After our meeting, you had the goodwill, I would say, to refer the Bills to the Attorney-General. As a consequence, the Attorney-General has given you a ruling regarding the Bills. We accept that. There is no problem. Yesterday, you gave your Ruling and we proceeded with the Debate. So, as far as Bills are concerned, there is no difficulty. But, we do have a difficulty regarding Regulations.

Parliament shall have full control over public finance. No tax, rate or any other levy shall be imposed by any local authority or any other public authority, except by or under the authority of a law passed by Parliament or of any existing law.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I insist upon the term existing law. The term existing law requires interpretation when you have to have a clear idea about the Regulations already placed before Parliament.
