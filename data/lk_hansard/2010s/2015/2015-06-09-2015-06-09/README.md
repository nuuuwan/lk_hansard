[5.45 p.m.] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the late Hon. Athula Nimalasiri Jayasinghe entered Parliament the same year as I did, way back in 1994. I remember Athula as an exceptional personality for many reasons. I mean to say this because he had a background, as many in this House have testified, having taken part in the insurrection in 1971. His militant qualities were not something that we could see from him when he came to this House. We have a practice of having had many such militants entering the democratic mainstream and taking part in politics including yourself, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees.

So, with this background, he was somebody from whom I could, at many casual discussions, understand the ideology behind the uprising in 1971. He was somebody who was not that inclined to accept the subsequent second uprising in 1989, because by then he had joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party or, moreover, he joined the Sri Lanka Mahajana Party which was formed by the late Vijaya Kumaratunga, the husband of our former President, Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.

We are aware of his contribution to the politics of the Gampaha District and the way in which he functioned within those periods when the Sri Lanka Freedom Party boycotted the 1988 Provincial Council Elections. The late Vijaya Kumaratunga very courageously came forward to contest that Election because it left a big vacuum for left-of-centre politics. The United National Party would not have been sufficiently challenged if not for parties like the Sri Lanka Mahajana Party, which took on the challenge in filling that void, which was left by the

boycott of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party through which they made another big contribution towards devolution in this country, because now, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and many other parties which originally boycotted the Provincial Council system have come a full circle and now accepted the need for devolution in the country. But, people like Athula Nimalasiri Jayasinghe took a big risk in coming forward because his leader, Vijaya Kumaratunga was assassinated, and subsequently Ossie Abeyagunasekera, who stepped into those issues was also assassinated. In spite of all those incidents, he was a very courageous personality along with many of his comrades to have come forward, particularly to give encouragement to pro-devolution forces, to contest in 1988.

Then, in 1993, he was re-elected to the same Provincial Council, but in 1994, under Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, he contested the Parliamentary Election and entered Parliament from the Gampaha District and continued to represent Parliament up to 2004. For 10 long years, he had served this House in two deputy ministerial positions and he was someone who would very rarely display his militant qualities within the Chamber of this House. He was a very calm and soft-spoken personality who had always enriched the debates in this House.

Therefore, it is the duty of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress to pay tribute to someone who had, through his transmogrification in his career, from a militant to a democratic politician, contributed immensely to the political culture of this country. I pay my tribute to him and also would like to extend my condolences to his wife, children, and family members as well as all his comrades on this occasion when we are taking up his Vote of Condolence.

Thank you very much. [.. 5.50 ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Lasantha Alagiyawanna - Deputy Minister of Rural Economic Affairs) . . . . .

I quote: Re: Cardiothoracic unit, TH Karapitiya In response to your request made as instructed by the DGHS regarding cardiothoracic surgeries, I would like to highlight my observations and suggestions:

1. A lot of cardiothoracic units in the world share the same theatres for both cardiac and thoracic surgeries.."

529 530

"2. There is no statistical evidence to state that wound infection rate following cardiac surgeries has increased

following introduction of thoracic surgeries in the same theatre complex.

3. There was no official request to the infection control team for opinion on a recent rise in post-cardiac surgery infection rates.

4. It is recommended for all wards in the CTU to have regular mortality and morbidity meetings with consultant anaesthetist and the consultant microbiologist.

5. It is recommended that audits and active surveillance on post-op infection rates to be carried out with the help of infection control team in order to identify outbreaks and early intervention.

6. Proper and thorough cleaning should be carried out according to the theatre standards especially after surgery on an infected patient.

Further, the department of microbiology and infection control and prevention is willing to provide its best service in order to help CTU to function without any interruption.
