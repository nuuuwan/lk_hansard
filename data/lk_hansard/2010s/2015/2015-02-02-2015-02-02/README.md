, . . . ; . . . , , . , , , , , . , . [3.51 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Mr. Deputy Speaker, in a statement made to The Island and other newspapers yesterday, the outgoing Chief Justice, Mr. Mohan Peiris, has said, I quote:

Maintaining the dignity and decorum associated with the office of the Chief Justice and ensuring its respectability and propriety is my prime concern. As the pinnacle of our judicial administration, it should be preciously safeguarded in its pristine purity; now and for the future - in the need to preserve justice as a wholesome entity.

This, Sir, is part of the statement made by the former Chief Justice and I see it almost as if a harlot is extolling the virtues of virginity because Mohan Peiris, who brought international disrespect and condemnation to our judicial system by his scandalous appointment two years ago and his conduct since then, is now shedding tears, if I may quote his own words, for the pristine purity" of the Office of the Chief Justice.

As you know, two years ago, on Monday, the 14th of January, 2013, a large contingent of military personnel

311 312

2015 02

occupied the Supreme Court Complex - this, I remind to these gentlemen here, who, today, talk about the rule of law - and from the early hours of the following morning, the Supreme Court was cordoned off and riots squads, barricades and water cannons put in place. All this and more to enable Mr. Mohan Peiris to be driven into the Courts Complex through its exit, the most appropriate entry for a fake judge. Outside the court gates, lawyers who had challenged the illegal and immoral eviction of Shirani Bandaranayake lit candles in daylight and, as they called it then, it was "the beginning of darkness at noon".

In fact, there are reasons, both substantial and procedural, which others today have gone into greater depth to point out why Mohan Peiris was not lawfully appointed to the Office of the Chief Justice. I think that has been dealt with by many of my Colleagues. But, since he claims to be an expert on unconstitutional processes, then, he is well aware of the degree of unconstitutionality that attends the eviction of the legitimate Chief Justice from a rightful chair by which, he, escorted by the STF and armed guards, took up and functioned in that chair. He actually, for the first few days and weeks, functioned with STF and armed guards around, like in one of those banana republics in Africa. He is also well aware of all that he had done to degrade the Judiciary, its dignity, independence, objectivity and reputation over these two years.

In fact, Mr. Mohan Peiris recently stated that the separation of powers is a fundamental feature of our Constitution. It is in the spirit of his own words then that I recommend that someone look at the appointment of this person. When he was appointed to this position, he was the Legal Adviser to the Cabinet, the Chairman of the Seylan Bank, a Director of the Lanka Logistics and Technologies Limited, the arms purchasing unit of the Ministry of Defence, and a Director of the Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Limited, a security company established by Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the then Secretary to the Ministry of Defence. He was also the Legal Adviser to the Ministry of Defence, the Attorney-General, the Government Spokesman before the UN Human Rights Council refuting allegations of war crimes and importantly, a close and partial ally of the former President and he should not hold the post of de facto Chief Justice.

He became the Chief Justice of this country while holding all these posts which I mentioned before. In fact, the dignity of the Judiciary, which Mohan so nobly now talks about, is dependent on its impartiality and objectivity as well as its independence from the Executive and the Legislature, as you well know. It also requires that the head of the system commands the respect of the community of lawyers, who, in this case, have been propelled to be the champions of resisting the former Chief Justice.

Under Mohan Peiris tenure, this illusory dignity and independence was a cobweb of conflicting interest and Mohan Peiris, in actuality, became an appendage or an extension of the State apparatus. In fact, the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct, the International Gold Standard - I am sure, my Friend, the former Justice Minister knows - in fact, states that a judge shall not only be free from inappropriate connections with, and influenced by, the executive and legislative branches of Government, but must also appear to be a reasonable observer to be free therefrom. Did Mohan Peiris give any thoughts to the sanctity of his judicial office when, on the 14th of April last year - we saw pictures all over the newspapers - he, apparently in the company of Gotabaya Rajapaksa joined President Rajapaksa and his immediate family in celebrating the Sinhala and Hindu New Year and joining the feeding of milk rice to each other at the auspicious time? Did Mohan Peiris think it was part of his job to become a member of President Rajapaksas entourage on an official visit to Italy and the Vatican in September last year, when we all saw on TV and otherwise, that he accompanied the President there? Did Mohan Peiris give any thought to the public perception of the Supreme Court when he begged for a diplomatic appointment from the Executive branch of the Government? In fact, it was only last week since I was sworn-in as the Foreign Minister, within about a week of being sworn-in, I got a call from the Prime Minister asking what stations are available for Mr. Mohan Peiris because he was demanding a diplomatic appointment, the Prime Minister said. I was rather taken aback, but I said, Okay, if it is to clean the Supreme Court, let us offer him something and I offered him Brazil. We said he can become the Ambassador for Brazil. Then, two days later, I got a message saying he is not interested in Brazil, that he is insisting on Italy and the Vatican. So, this is the way he bargained with the position he illegally got and he was trying to actually bargain the post of Chief Justice to become an Ambassador in Italy and the Vatican.

I hope the Hon. Members remember that I had made a complaint to the CID based on reliable information and in that complaint I have stated that Mr. Mohan Peiris was there when this conspiracy took place early morning of the 9th of January, along with the former President, along with the Defence Secretary, along with the former External Affairs Minister and the Provincial Councillor, Mr. Gammanpila. Mr. Mohan Peiris was there, as far as we know, taking part in a conspiracy to prevent this Government taking office, attempting to impede the one democratic process most crucial to the proper functioning of our society in any democracy.

It is clear from all that can be seen of this man's outward actions, transactions and relationships - ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

313 314

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) This Hon. Minister has made a complaint to the CID and initiated proceedings, thereby, to have this very serious matter investigated and while it is pending, he takes the liberty to talk about it.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) It is not sub judice, Hon. Member. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) I am not talking about sub judice. I am talking about the morality.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) You are the last person who can talk about morality out of all these persons. The most immoral person I have ever met is now talking about morality. What a joke! It is like Mohan Peiris speaking about purity of the Judiciary. It is like a harlot extolling the virtues of virginity. That is what you are doing.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) There you are! [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) It is clear from all that can be seen of this man's outward actions, transactions and relationships, that he cannot be expected to command the respect and confidence of the international community, or of Sri Lankans expecting accountability and transparency in a court of law. Hon. Members would recall the international backlash that attended the removal of the 43rd Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake two years ago. Statements, as you know, condemning the move and calling for her reinstatement were made by several governments, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of the Judiciary, the International Commission of Jurists, the International Bar Association and the Bar Associations of several countries and the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, which we currently chair, expressed the Commonwealths profound collective concern at what could be perceived to constitute violations of core Commonwealth values and principles.

In fact, I have the two reports which were never published. These reports were submitted only to the Commonwealth Secretary-General and to the former President Rajapaksa as the incoming Chair-in-office of the Commonwealth, where two of the most eminent Judges in the world were commissioned by the Secretary-General to assess the impeachment of Shirani Bandaranayake. One is, Sir Jeffrey Jowell and the other is the Justice Pius Langa from Johannesburg, South Africa. In the conclusion of the Memorandum it clearly states, I quote:

(b) It follows that all subsequent actions flowing from that, by Parliament and the President, namely, the impeachment of the Chief Justice and her removal from office were unconstitutional and unlawful. It also follows that the purported appointment

This is the very word purported appointment, which has been used.

of a new Chief Justice was also unconstitutional and unlawful, since the incumbent Chief Justice had not been validly removed.

So, this is the exact argument on which President Maithripala Sirisena based his decision to remove Mohan Peiris and to appoint a new Chief Justice.

In fact, 45 Judges from all Continents wrote to President Rajapaksa urging him to act immediately to restore the independence of the Judiciary by reinstating the legal Chief Justice and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights described the removal of the Chief Justice through a "flawed process, as a gross interference with the independence of the Judiciary and a setback for the Rule of Law in Sri Lanka.

She questioned how anyone could have any confidence in the independence and impartiality of Mohan Peiris when handling allegations of serious human rights violations by the authorities. In the two years in which Mohan Peiris was in power, creditability continued to wane. He was, after all, the person who informed the UN Committee against Torture that journalist Ekneligoda was comfortably and safely living in a certain country. Here, the Chief Justice of this country makes this very irresponsible statement and when called upon by a court of law to disclose the country where Mr. Ekneligoda was, the reply Mohan Peiris gave was, Only God knows. Having said that he knows the country in which this man is living, he finally said, Only God knows.

The many victims of Mohan Peiriss tenure include, but are not limited to, PTA prisoner Ganesan Nimalaruban, the Slave Island affectees who were banished in the name of development and the victims of the Welikada Prison riots. In a context when a credible judicial system is needed, both for domestic healing and to prevent international intervention in what should be a domestic process of reconciliation, Mr. Peiris would be a very significant hindrance indeed. It is a notorious fact that his former juniors operated and conducted legal

315 316

2015 02

practice from the Chief Justices official residence. This is a well-known fact. I am sure many Ministers of the former regime are well aware of the fact that he used even his official residence for his private practice.

It is also a notorious fact that appeals listed in different courts were arbitrarily moved to his own court when a party happened to be a friend or a relative. For example, he directed that the Supreme Court case where Asia Asset Finance was the appellant be heard before a Bench of which he was a member despite being well aware that the Chairman is his brother-in-law and his wife is on the board of directors and are major shareholders of the company. This is how he used the position given to him, the position gained by him illegally. It is a notorious fact that in two cases, supporters of the former Government were brought as suspects before Magistrates for assaulting Opposition supporters during the last Presidential campaign; you are talking about people getting assaulted. We condemn it from whichever side it emanates from, but this was what happened then. When our Opposition supporters were assaulted, Mr. Mohan Peiris called his Magistrates and ordered them to grant bail to the suspects. It was never heard of. Mohan Peiris, himself, during the last Presidential Election actually called his Magistrates and instructed them to grant bail to the suspects. Even the records of the Committee against Torture, the Treaty body of the Convention Against Torture, would bear testimony to the fact that Mr. Mohan Peiris stated untruths before it.

This is there in the international arena and he was thereafter called a "liar" by one of its members. The Chief Justice of Sri Lanka was called a "liar" in public by one of its members. This was judicial corruption at its best. Mohan Peiris was, without dispute, at the rotten core of the institutional mechanism that stands accused of committing violations of human rights and crimes against humanity. Not many of you may be aware that in November, 2013 Mohan Peiris attended a Conference of Chief Justices of the Asia and Pacific Region, convened by the Chief Justice of the Republic of Turkey and the United Nations, uninvited. He was not invited. He went there and gatecrashed this Conference. The Sri Lankan Judiciary had been deliberately excluded in view of the events in January of that year. Neither did the United Nations nor the Turkish Judiciary recognize Mohan Peiris as the Chief Justice of Sri Lanka. He just went and sat there in that international Conference. The whole Conference refused to recognize Mohan Peiris as the Chief Justice of Sri Lanka. Yet, he travelled to Istanbul with his wife, demanded that he be accommodated in the Conference hotel, attended the Conference and participated in the discussions without being recognized as a participant. A shameless chap, an absolutely shameless man Mohan Peiris is. On leaving Istanbul, he demanded that his airfare be reimbursed in cash.

The Istanbul Declaration on Transparency in the Judicial Process, which was adopted at that Conference does not bear his name. In fact, the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa

Rajapakshe can check all these details at his Ministry. This is how he misused and abused his powers as the Chief Justice. The Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct require judges not to do anything that detracts from the dignity of judicial office. However, what Mohan Peiris has done will detract from the dignity and reputation of our Judiciary for many years to come.

Finally, Sir, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, now it is my duty and responsibility to promote and safeguard the interests, integrity and the sovereignty of Sri Lanka. One of the principal issues, which you faced and I am facing today, is the question of addressing the ongoing inquiry being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations Human Rights Council into war crimes and violations of the International Human Rights Law and the Humanitarian Law alleged to have been committed in this country during the latter part of the war. If I am to convince, even when we were in the Opposition, it was always our stand that we should be against international interference in such matters, but even during the election - I was hoping to bring our Manifesto, the "Hundred-Day Programme" - we categorically stated that we believe in an internal domestic mechanism to look into these alleged war crimes and under our Government, such an institution will be set in motion.

In fact, many of our foreign friends have admitted that Sri Lanka still has some of the best judges in the world and we still believe - I believe personally - that we can look after many of these questions ourselves. We had a Judiciary which is competent, independent and impartial, a Judiciary which can rank as one of the best amongst the world. In fact, as you know, many of our judges are even serving in countries like Fiji, because of the respect we have been able to garner all over the world during the years. But, that respect was lost during the last few years. An international inquiry initiated last year is currently nearing completion. In fact, the results of this inquiry could lead to Sri Lankan Armed Forces and other civilians appearing before the International Tribunal, unless tangible steps are taken to restore judicial credibility.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Yes, I will be finishing in one minute. This is where the restoration of the credibility of our judicial system is extremely important. Especially, if we are to convince the international community that we do not want an international intervention in our internal affairs of our country, if we are to tell the international community that we have a judicial system which can take care of our own

317 318

problems, we have to ensure that the Judiciary is put back in order and the credibility of it restored as soon as possible. It is the previous administrations failure to set up a credible domestic mechanism that has led to our current difficulties. It is the current Governments position that the most effective way of beginning the process of healing between communities and preventing international prosecution, which many would feel will be a violation of sovereignty, would be to institute a credible domestic mechanism as soon as possible. In fact, we are in the process of doing it. The challenge today is to ensure that we are able to effectively enjoy the rights, privileges and benefits of re-entering the community of civilized nations and ensure that we, as a country, do not suffer economic sanctions, ill-dignity and a tarnished reputation because we fear justice or because we are too short-sighted to be able to pursue that justice in a credible manner ourselves. Because of the many regressions we have made, we have a long way to go before we can change perceptions and to prove that we, as a country, can institute a domestic mechanism that is as effective and just as any proposed international mechanism. We hope that under the new Chief Justice and the reforms we propose to introduce, we will be able to raise the Judiciary from the depths to which it has sunk to one that conforms to contemporary international standards and the essential requirements of a democratic multiethnic, multireligious and multilinguistic State. That is the principal reason for my intervention in this Debate.

Thank you. [.. 4.14]

The letter sent to the Chief Justice Mohan Peiris by the Secretary to the President undermines not only the sovereignty or the sanctity of Parliament but also the Judiciary. Because of the unconstitutional nature of the letter, today a lawfully-appointed Chief Justice stands displaced and supplanted by an interloper. I would say this is a historical blunder by a Government that came to power on the promise of Good Governance and the Rule of Law. You will never erase this blight that you have brought upon the Judiciary unless corrective measures are taken immediately.

According to the former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva, nowhere in the world has anything of this kind happened nor will it ever happen. I think the former Chief Justice should be heard by the leader of the JVP. What the former Chief Justice has to say must be heard by the Front Benchers of the Government, except for the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, who voted with us to evict Mrs. Shirani Bandaranayake. I would like to remind that there were others, my good Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, who also served on the Committee. I do not want to take much time because time is limited and I have been given only ten minutes.

The former Chief Justice says, So, we have set a great example of good governance in ousting a Chief Justice who still remains the Chief Justice of this country. You are not a lawyer, Hon. Foreign Minister, I am not a lawyer. You have never been a judge; I have never been a judge. Here is a person who headed the Supreme Court of this country, Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva, who very clearly states about the violations that you all have done. I will demonstrate with clarity how illogically wrong the Prime Minister had been in receiving advice from a group of lawyers who have an axe to grind against Mohan Peiris.

We see, today, how Upul Jayasuriya settled scores with Mohan Pieris; how he enlisted a group of senior lawyers who had personal interest in ousting the Chief Justice because these wise men who were named by Upul Jayasuriya in his speech recently could not manoeuvre and peddle influence with the Bench.

What I fear is that we are going into a state of anarchy. You all are violating the Constitution from the day of swearing in under the pretext of Good Governance. There is no good governance. You all are violating the Constitution in the fear that you will not have a majority vote in Parliament. This is the fear that you all have - that you cannot come to Parliament. I state very confidently, had you come to Parliament and had an inquiry on the charges that the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs had laid before the House, we, in Parliament would have supported if it was established. We do not want a violation of the Constitution. This is an anarchy that you all are promoting today.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. Order, please! Before that, the Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will take the Chair.

, [ ] .

, , [ ] . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Sumanthiran, you may commence your speech. [4.50 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for the opportunity given to speak on this Adjournment Motion. I wish to thank the Hon. Leader of the Opposition for bringing up this Adjournment Motion for the reason that there seems to be some uncertainty in the minds of the people of the country as to the procedure by which these changes took place last week.

Firstly, let me remind the House that, in terms of Article 107 of our Constitution, it is the President who appoints the Chief Justice amongst others. There are various conditions that must be fulfilled before he appoints the Chief Justice. Presently, the name must be approved by the Parliamentary Council. Before that, the name had to be approved by the Constitutional Council. Although it is the President who appoints the Chief Justice, without the recommendation of the Parliamentary Council, or previously, the Constitutional Council, the President cannot appoint the Chief Justice. If the President had appointed His Lordship Justice Sripavan as the Chief Justice without the approval of the Parliamentary Council, that would be null and void and of

329 330

no force or effect in law. Merely because the President appointed, that does not become a valid act because the Constitution says, "prior to the appointment, the Parliamentary Council must grant its recommendation". Similarly, in terms of the same Article of the Constitution, it is the President who can remove the Chief Justice, not the Parliament. The Parliament cannot remove the Chief Justice. We seem to be labouring under a misconception that we, as a Parliament, removed the Chief Justice. No, the Constitution says that it is the President who can remove the Chief Justice. But, prior to the President being able to remove the Chief Justice, there must be a condition that must be fulfilled. What is that condition? The Parliament must, by a Resolution, make an address to the President for the removal of the Chief Justice. So, like the example that I gave about the appointment, if the President removed a Chief Justice without an address of Parliament being passed as a Resolution, that act of the President is invalid and will not be of any force or effect in law in terms of the Constitution. This is the simple fact. This is easily understood. That is why I cited the example of the appointment procedure. All of us will agree that the President cannot simply appoint somebody. He has to have the recommendations of the Parliamentary Council. Similarly, the President cannot remove unless there is an address to the President by Parliament.

I must thank the Hon. Ajith P. Perera who is here today because, as I recalled, it was he who spotted what was in the Order Paper and brought it to the notice of other Seniors in the United National Party, the then Leader of the Opposition, the former Speaker, the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and I too was there. It was he who saw that Item 1 on the Order Papers of the 10th and the 11th of January, 2013 was not an address to the President for the removal of the Chief Justice. What had appeared as Item 20 on the Order Paper of 6th of November, 2012, resolving to appoint a Parliamentary Select Committee to inquire into the allegations was reproduced again in January, 2013. The same Resolution which appeared on the Order Paper -

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) What is the point of Order?

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakara, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) The Hon. Speaker gave a Ruling on the matter.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, that is not a point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) That is a point of Order.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, let him not take my time. Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, you reply later if you want to.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) The Hon. Speakers Ruling -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am coming to the Ruling. I am talking about the Ruling.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Sir, I am raising my point of Order. Hon. Sumanthiran, you are not the Speaker.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am on my feet. Do not take my time. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) I am raising a point of Order. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) What is the point of Order? There is no point of Order in that.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Please let me do that. The Hon. Speaker gave a Ruling after the matter was raised. So, that Ruling stands conclusive. How can he argue against it?

2015 02

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Sumanthiran, you can carry on. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, say today in the Order Paper, there is an item that is printed. The Hon. Speaker or whoever is in the Chair can put Item No. 1 to vote. That is all the Chair can do, put Item No. 1 to vote, and we vote. Can you or anybody in the Chair say that what was voted was for something else and not for what was printed and actually put to vote? No, you cannot do that. The Hon. Speaker's saying anything, with utmost respect to the Chair, I say, is wholly irrelevant because with what was put - I have the Hansard of 11th January, 2013 - he said, Item No. 1, put to vote. That is what the Hon. Speaker said : "Item No. 1, put to vote". I have the Order Paper of the 11th of January, 2013 and Item No. 1 of it states to appoint a Parliamentary Select Committee, nothing else. That is all that matters. So, it was Item No. 1 that was put to vote.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) What is the point of Order, Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara cannot say that something else was put to vote.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Sir, I would like to bring to your attention that there was a Ruling given by the Hon. Speaker. He merely did not put Item No. 1 to vote. He, having given a Ruling on the matter, put Item No. 1 to vote. So, the Hon. Member must combine the two; he must be honest.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) He did not put something else to vote; he cannot put something else to vote. He put Item No. 1 to vote and that was carried. So, the Resolution that was carried only resolved to appoint a Parliamentary Select Committee to inquire into the allegations against the then Chief Justice. The matter went to the President. Article 107 of the Constitution states, as I said at the beginning, that it is the

President who can remove the Chief Justice, but only if there is an address of Parliament sent to him for the removal. There was no address of Parliament sent to him because what was passed was a Resolution to appoint a Parliamentary Select Committee.

But, only when the Hon. Prime Minister made a Statement last Thursday, it dawned on all of us that the Legal Adviser at that time to the then President was none other than Mohan Peiris, who wanted to occupy that seat, had misled the then President and advised him to remove the Chief Justice without legal authority, a wholly unconstitutional act. Then, he went and occupied that seat.

The present Leader of the Opposition has very clearly stated that they are supporting the "Hundred-Day Programme" of the Government. The "Hundred-Day Programme" of this Government has 100 points and in those 100 points, point No. 94 is to restore Shirani Bandaranayake to the position of Chief Justice. You say you are supporting entirely the "Hundred-Day Programme". In the "Hundred-Day Programme", it is very specifically stated that she would be restored to the position of Chief Justice. Then, why are you raising this issue now? It not only has your support, but it had the support of the people because the "Hundred-Day Programme" was put as a mandate before the people. It was revealed to the people before the election that this would be done. If a person has not been appointed to a post, he need not be removed from that; he never occupied that post.

This has constantly been the position of the entire Bar of Sri Lanka. I want to put on record that when the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Minister of Justice and Labour Relations, was the President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, an unprecedented meeting of the Bar Association took place, where more than 3,000 lawyers assembled. Never before did we have 3,000 lawyers assembling! And, what is more? A unanimous resolution was carried saying that the removal of Shirani Bandaranayake was illegal and the Bar Association would not welcome anybody who would be appointed as Chief Justice consequent to her removal, and the Bar Association stuck to it for two years. When Mohan Peiris was appointed, he was not welcomed. He could not have had a ceremonial welcome. He had a ceremonial welcome, he got some private lawyer to welcome him. The President of the Bar Association did not welcome him. When the Bar Associations President's Convocation took place in March, 2013 - customarily, it is the Chief Justice who places the Bar Association President in that place - he invited Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake to do that act and the present Chief Minister of the Northern Province, retired Supreme Court Judge, Justice C.V. Wigneswaran, delivered a speech, in which he articulated very clearly that there is a de facto Chief Justice in this country. He compared the situation to the time when LTTE ruled certain areas of this country and there were judges appointed by the LTTE and judgments given. He

333 334

said those were de facto situations. That is the situation that prevailed.

I also would like to claim some credit for this position because on the 22nd of November 2012, just after Mohan Peiris was purported to have been appointed to that post, I took an objection to that. I will table* the case record in SC (FR) No. 665 of 2012, in which references were made to SC (FR) 666 and SC (FR) 667 of 2012.

The Judges headed by Justice J. Amaratunga had this recorded in that and I want to read that. It states, I quote:

Mr. Sumanthiran, who appears for the Petitioner in SC (F/R) 667/2012 insists that his objections should be recorded as follows;

He states that,

I object to the present application made by the learned Deputy Solicitor General on the basis that the person occupying the Chambers of the Chief Justice de-facto is a usurper in that office in terms of the pronouncement of this Court itself and therefore I have to object to an application under Article 132(3) (III) being sent to that person."

We considered him a pretender. We did not consider him a de jure Chief Justice right through these two years. The legal community of this country protested at every turn.

The crowning moment came last Thursday when a farewell was accorded to Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake in the Ceremonial Court, when the entire Supreme Court, the entire Court of Appeal and all the Judges of the High Court assembled. I have witnessed ceremonial sittings for 25 years, but I have never seen such a situation before, where more than 100 judges of the minor Judiciary, judges from all parts of the country came to the Supreme Court last Thursday. The decision to have a ceremonial sitting was made after 2.00 p.m. the previous day. In less than 20 hours, judges, magistrates, district judges and primary court judges from the length and breadth of this country came in their numbers. They could not find seats for them in the dais and they were accommodated on the side. The entire ceremonial Supreme Court was full and we accorded a farewell to her. That is because a grave injustice was done; that is because the entire Bar, without exception, recognizes the fact that what was said to have been the removal was no removal in law. We refuse to recognize that that was a removal in law.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We only addressed Mohan Peiris, because he was there by force. As was stated by the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs today, he came there by force. That day, all the lawyers cars and boots were examined; they checked whether Shirani Bandaranayake was coming to Court. She was kept out by force. But, when she came back to resume her rightful place, there was no force; there was not a single arm to be seen; there was no police; there was no STF; there was no army. The entire civil society and the lawyers took her to her Chamber and she resumed her place.

Therefore, I thank the Hon. Leader of the Opposition for bringing this Motion because this clarifies the position that Shirani Bandaranayake was never removed from her office in terms of the law and Mohan Peiris was never appointed to that position. He occupied it as a usurper in office.

Thank you very much. [.. 5.05] ( ) (The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa) , .

Judges hold office during good behaviour and liable to be removed on ground of proved misbehaviour and incapacity. Therefore, it is clear, the removal is solely based on personal conduct. Mr. Mohan Peiris was informed that he was not duly appointed to the Office of the Chief Justice. This is the position taken by the current Government. Mrs. Shirani Bandaranayake was informed that she had never ceased to be the Chief Justice. This is

the position the Hon. Sumanthiran also enunciated in his speech. The resulting position is that the reinstalling of Mrs. Shirani Bandaranayake was carried out not by the removal of Mr. Mohan Peiris. The position was that Mr. Mohan Peiris was not properly appointed as there was no vacancy and therefore Article 107(2) of the Constitution is not applicable to the circumstances of the subject matter. That is the simple explanation of this whole situation. There was no vacancy and therefore, it was void ab initio and that is what all of us in legal parlance say. So, when you take that position, it is very clear that the Executive - because the Executive is the appointing authority - has made the appointment for a position which was vacant. That matter has to be borne in mind.

Now, merely going into other areas, I think I need to also advert to another issue. Now, what we have to focus mostly is - I expected this to be said by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, the Leader of the House, because I have been at the receiving end of his arguments when I was the Minister of Justice defending the previous administration's mode of administration of justice in this country. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella quite often would point fingers at me and talk about Latimer House Principles. He said it is a shame that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, being the Head of the Commonwealth Heads of Government, was not honouring the Latimer House Principles. Now, it is time for us to revisit the Latimer House Principles. The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, the current Minister of Justice and Labour Relations, my Colleague in this Government has presented that to be included.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Please permit me to speak. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, let me not be - ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Is this action of the President now in terms of Latimer House Principles?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, I am not talking about that. Let this House deliberate on the need to have a proper procedure for the removal of the Chief Justice because there never existed a proper procedure. There is a lacuna. My argument is not about having removed the Chief Justice. My argument is that there was certainly a lacuna. Therefore, the lacuna has to be addressed and that is why, for all purposes, the existing position is that the removal procedure is through

341 342

a Parliamentary Select Committee. However, during the impeachment of Mrs. Shirani Bandaranayake, allegations were bias, non-adherence to principles of natural justice and many other reasons were alleged. The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara himself was quite affected by what was happening, I know that for all purposes.

Therefore, Parliament must provide procedure by legislation for removal of judges or, at least, we must amend the Standing Orders and set a procedure for removal of judges. It may also be advisable that the judge against whom allegations are made should be allowed to choose the procedure. Further, when a judge is impeached, the inquiry panel must consist of independent representation such as internationally-reputed individuals to ensure justice and impartiality.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, how many more minutes do I have?

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) You have three more minutes and in addition to that, you have been given another five more minutes from the time allotted to the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. So, altogether you have eight more minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Thank you very much, Sir.

As you know, I have been an emissary between the former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa trying to resolve the conflict. I have run between both of them; I have spoken to them; I have shared this with my Colleagues in the Front Benches several times, but it was a futile attempt. The intransigence on both sides perhaps contributed to what happened.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! A point of Order is being raised by the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Let me not be disturbed. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, what is your point of Order? - [Interruption.] It is okay, you may continue.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Having ventilated my pain and agony which became more pronounced as a result of my abortive attempts to broker peace in that constitutional convulsion, which saw this House debate a botched resolution in January, 2013 to impeach Mrs. Shirani Bandaranayake, I next dealt with the trajectory of the litigation that sought to dispose of the issues that cropped up in challenge to the Select Committee proceedings. In the crux of my speech during the impeachment proceedings, I focused on the rulings of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court drawing on some comparative jurisprudence from countries such as the United States. But, it has to be pointed out that when the Court of Appeal comprising late Justice Sri Skandarajah, the then President of the Court of Appeal, His Lordship Justice Anil Gooneratne, who has now been promoted to the Supreme Court after having been unfairly kept in the doghouse - I am very sorry to say this having been the Minister of Justice in the former administration, all of us felt that he was unfairly kept in the doghouse - for having associated himself with the final decision of the court then, and His Lordship Justice Salam, one of the most respected judges, later the President of the Court of Appeal, perhaps, he was denied the chance to get elevated to the Supreme Court because of his association with that Bench - these are all unfortunate events - issued a Writ of Certiorari in a Writ Application No. 41 of 2012 quashing the findings and/or the decision contained in the Report of the Parliamentary Select Committee; their attention exclusively focused on preliminary issues such as whether a writ can lie against Select Committee findings.

I still stand vindicated with my speech I made on the last occasion. Even when this matter went up in appeal at the instance of the Attorney-General, the Supreme Court considered two questions of law, which I can simply summarize as one. Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that the writ jurisdiction embodied in Article 140 of the Constitution extend to the proceedings of Parliament or a Select Committee of Parliament? It was the question that was put up, framed by the then Court of Appeal Bench.

343 344

2015 02

When the Supreme Court answered the above question in the negative, I have to point out that it did not go into the question that we are debating today, and I still stand by what the Supreme Court Bench said because it was wrong for the Court of Appeal to have quashed the Parliamentary Proceedings. It never possessed that authority and I have quoted extensive authorities on that when I spoke during the earlier Debate.

The question of invalidity of the Motion to impeach Mrs. Bandaranayake and the consequent illegality that flowed therefrom were never questions that were focused upon by the Supreme Court. I would summarize the all-important issue before us today.

Article 172 of the Constitution clearly declares that an address of Parliament supported by a majority of the total number of Members of Parliament, including those not present must be presented to the President before a Judge of the Supreme Court or a Court of Appeal is removed. Was there such an address? This is the simple question. The said Article uses the word shall and thus imports a mandatory requirement for Parliament to present an address to the President. Was this mandatory requirement complied with by this House when we debated the Motion to impeach the 43rd Chief Justice? That is the simple question. The answer is a mandatory, No. If there is such a non-compliance with the mandatory provisions of the Constitution, what is the effect of such non-compliance? That is the question.

The established principle is that it results in procedures that are null and void. The consequence follows that all subsequent acts taken in consequence of the non-existent address mandated by the Constitution will necessarily become void ab initio and that is how today measures had to be taken to rectify this injustice.

As students of Administrative Law, we recall the words of Lord Diplocks in the Civil Service Union case, Council of Civil Services Union v Minister for the Civil Service (1985). This case followed the age-old case of Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v Wednesbury Corporation (1948). This case rules when we talk about reasonableness in writ jurisdiction. Lord Diplock was quoted by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition as well in a different context. Lord Diplock gave a summary of the grounds of judicial review namely, illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. He defined "procedural impropriety" to mean a failure to follow mandatory provisions of law or to act with procedural fairness that would result in decisions becoming void ab initio.

There cannot be a more classic instance of such a procedural impropriety than the manifest illegality we committed in 2013, including me who voted for it, when we grievously voted to oust Mrs. Bandaranayake with scant disregard for the mandatory requirement of an address to the President. That is why I feel cathartic

today to comment on this and rest my case at that. This impropriety has been remedied in the case of the 43rd Chief Justice and I would commend that we put an end to this filibustering exercise.

Thank you very much. [.. 5.34]

I quote: The constitution has assigned no limits to the authority of Parliament over all matters and persons within its jurisdiction. A law may be unjust and contrary to sound principles of government. But Parliament is not controlled in its discretion, and when it errs, its errors can only be corrected by itself.

, , , . , . , . , , , .

Mr. Presiding Member, I would like to say a few words in English. As the Chairman of the Parliamentary Select Committee that investigated the allegations against former Chief Justice Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, I wish to make this statement on the recent events that have taken place in respect of the Office of the Chief Justice of Sri Lanka, which has given rise to grave concerns regarding the legal system of this country.

As a Member of Parliament and as a member of the legal fraternity, I wish to state that the process followed by the present Government to unceremoniously oust Mr. Mohan Pieris from the Office of the Chief Justice is entirely unacceptable, unconstitutional and an unsightly blemishes on the judicial system of Sri Lanka.

The Supreme Court is the apex court of this country and the citadel of the judicial power of the people as set out in Article 4 of the Constitution. The Office of the Chief Justice which represents the pinnacle of the judicial system is, therefore, a hallowed position that symbolizes the Rule of Law and embodies the peoples faith in the Judiciary as an effective check on the other two organs of the Government, namely, the Legislature and the Executive.

It is in recognition of the above that a single specific procedure has been very clearly provided in Article 107 (2) of the Constitution for the removal of the Chief Justice

361 362

or any Judge of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal on either of the two exclusive grounds: misbehaviour or incapacity.

It was also in recognition of the above hallowed nature of the Office of the Chief Justice and in acknowledgement of the supremacy of the Constitution that the Government took measures to ensure that former Chief Justice, Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake was impeached on grounds of misbehaviour in 2013 in strict and full adherence to the provisions made in the Constitution and the Standing Orders of Parliament.

I wish to remind this House that the impeachment of Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake was carried out by the then Government only pursuant to the adoption of a two-thirds majority in Parliament by the findings of a Parliamentary Select Committee, which considered an inquiry into the allegations of misconduct made against her, based on which only a Declaration was made by the President on the impeachment of the Chief Justice. Accordingly, the claim that the appointment of Mr. Mohan Pieris as the Chief Justice was void from the beginning, and Dr. Bandaranayake was removed unconstitutionally is entirely misconceived in law, since contrary to such claims, Dr. Bandaranayake was in fact impeached in adherence to Article 172, and no such action carried out in compliance with the Constitution can be deemed voidable or reversible.

Therefore, I wish to state with all responsibility, that the action taken by the present Government to unconstitutionally replace a duly-appointed Chief Justice with an impeached Chief Justice is a blatant disregard of the procedure provided in Article 107(2) of the Constitution and is completely ultra vires the Constitution and it seized the scope of the process vested in the Executive by the Constitution. This action which violates the accepted norms and values enshrined in our Constitution is a severe blow to the certainty and the integrity of the judicial system of the country and has caused irreparable damage to the faith of the people in the Judiciary.

I wish to conclude by reiterating that unconstitutional and capricious acts of this nature will not enable the present Government to achieve the good governance that it aspires to establish in the country, but would only undermine the democratic values and the Rule of Law hitherto preserved by Sri Lankan people.

Thank you.

[6.30 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. DEW Gunasekara) Sir, in view of the time factor, I wish to make my speech in English. The subject matter that we debate

today is another crisis generated by the J.R. Jayewardene Constitution of 1978 and that is the issue of Chief Justice 43, Shirani Bandaranayake, and Chief Justice 44, Mohan Peiris.

Conflicts and confrontations between the three organs of the State, namely, the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary have been the order of the day ever since the enactment of the J.R. Jayewardene Constitution. I do not want to recount all such instances. However, touching upon the Judiciary, this House had to face three impeachments and those were against Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon, Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva and Chief Justice Dr. (Mrs.) Shirani Bandaranayake and thereafter, now there is the question of the so-called removal of Chief Justice Mohan Peiris by the President.

Despite all such experiences of crises, this House had failed to take corrective measures so as to obviate the need to face such crises. When the question of Shirani Bandaranayake came up in Parliament on 11th January, 2013, I, along with my Colleagues, the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana and the Hon. Chandrasiri Gajadeera refused to support the impeachment on the ground that this Parliament was required in terms of Article 107(3) to provide a process for such an impeachment with such a procedure in respect of investigation and proof of the alleged misbehaviour or incapacity and also the right of such accused judge to defend herself.

I repeat that in terms of Article 107(3), Parliament is called upon to enact a law or Standing Order. We failed to satisfy this requirement till 1984, until the need arose in the case of the impeachment against Neville Samarakoon. And, yet again, despite the experiences in respect of Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva and Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake and now the Chief Justice Mohan Peiris, we have miserably failed to enact a law or Standing Order with regard to the process or procedure to meet with such situations.

Regrettably, neither the Judiciary, the Bar Council, the Attorney-General nor the legal fraternity - who for the slightest thing come to the streets - realized the need for a process or procedure in order to avoid such confrontations between the Judiciary and the Legislature or the Judiciary and the Executive.

This failure on our part had led to this impasse; crisis and confrontation.

I must remind this House that even the inadequate Standing Order 78A, which is the subject matter under Debate, was introduced to this House in a mighty hurry within a matter of 24 hours. Sir, this whole question on unconstitutionality arose from this glaring inadequacy. It is in this background that we should discuss the current issue of the reinstatement of CJ 43, Shirani Bandaranayake as well as the removal of CJ 44, Mohan Peiris.

363 364

[ ]

2015 02

I do not propose to repeat all the events that led to this Debate. I wish to raise the fundamentals of the constitutional requirements that we must satisfy and that is the supremacy of Parliament. As representatives of the people, we can claim to be supreme. But, the fact remains that under the 1978 Constitution, our supremacy has eroded; our power has been substantially reduced. As legislators, we do not enjoy the powers that were enjoyed under the 1972 Constitution. That was why we were demanding right throughout that remedy and that is to get rid of this destructive and defective Constitution.

In the past, there have been attempts of invasion by the Judiciary on the Legislature by the Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva. A former Speaker, late Hon. Anura Bandaranaike had to react and resist that invasion. Similarly, there had been attempts of invasion by the Executive on the Legislature, as in the case of Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon and Chief Justice Dr. Shirani Bandarnayake. In the case of Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon, the Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali saved the situation by arranging a quiet retirement for Neville Samarakoon. In the case of Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, the Legislature had to sucumb to the invasion by the Executive on the Legislature. It is in this context that I look at the two issues relating to the reinstatement and the removal of CJ 43 and CJ 44. Even if I am prepared to accept what the Hon. Prime Minister stated on the Floor of this House, giving reasons for the Executives behaviour on these two issues, he cannot get behind the need to honour the supremacy of Parliament.

Granting that Parliament may have erred by its failure to observe the provisions of the Constitution, that matter should have been referred to the Parliament for remedy. The Executive, or for that matter, the President, is not above the Constitution. I repeat that neither the Executive nor the Judiciary is above the Constitution. As much as former Speaker Anura Bandaranaike resisted the invasion by the Judiciary, the Hon. Speaker should, in this case, have resisted the invasion by the Executive.

To adjudicate on the issues relating to both reinstatement of CJ 43 and the removal of CJ 44 is a matter for the Legislature.

Parliament never attempts to use the powers of the Executive or the Judiciary. Equally, we, as the Legislature cannot allow the Executive or the Judiciary to cause invasion of our territory.

The reinstatement or the removal of Supreme Court Judges falls within the Constitutional rights of the Legislature. The Executive cannot bypass the Legislature under any circumstances. In these two issues, the Executive has blatantly bypassed the Legislature. Even if the Legislature has failed to observe the procedure or the process, as required by the Constitution, that could have been corrected by the Legislature itself. The Executive cannot act arbitrarily, simply because the Legislature has

erred. The whole episode of Shirani Bandaranayake and Mohan Peiris was a perpetration by the Executive.

I request the Hon. Speaker to study these two issues and pronounce the Legislatures constitutional position as a ruling of the Legislature for future guidance, in order to avoid repetition of such invasions by the Executive or the Judiciary.

Mr. Presiding Member, I do not claim that Parliament is above the Constitution. But, we claim to be supreme as representatives of the people who are sovereign. Time and again, issues of this nature arise from the destructive and defective nature of the J.R. Jayewardene Constitution of 1978. Therefore, we cannot abdicate our right to defend Parliament; that is what I have to say, Mr. Presiding Member.

Thank you.

[6.38 p.m.] (, ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne - Deputy Minister of Highways, Higher Education and Investment Promotion) Hon. Presiding Member, I am glad to participate in this Adjournment Debate and I would like to start by making the point that many have made throughout the day: that the Motion placed on the Order Paper on the 6th of November, 2012 was basically to investigate, and I might read it for the record. I quote:

Therefore we, the aforementioned Members of Parliament resolve that a Select Committee of Parliament be appointed in terms of Article 107.(3) of the Constitution read with the provisions of Article 107(2) and Standing Order 78A of Parliament enabling the submission of a resolution to His Excellency the President for the removal of the Hon. (Dr.) (Mrs.) Upatissa Atapattu Bandaranayake Wasala Mudiyanse Ralahamilage Shirani Anshumala Bandaranayake from the office of the Chief Justice of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka in the event the Select Committee reports to Parliament that one or more of the charges that have been levelled have been proved after the aforesaid charges of misconduct have been investigated.

And, as per this Resolution in Parliament, a Parliamentary Select Committee was appointed to go into the charges of the Impeachment on the 23rd of November 2012. It met on the 4th of December and also on the 6th of December.

I think many Hon. Members have made the point that this same Motion was subsequently placed on the Order Paper on the 11th of January, 2013 and this Motion clearly provided for the investigative aspect in terms of the allegations made about Chief Justice 43. Then there should have been another Motion placed in Parliament on the day that we were recommending her removal. Provision regarding the type of Resolution for removal of a Judge of Supreme Court is in Section 107(2) of the Constitution, which states, I quote:

365 366

"A judge of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal can only be removed :

By an order of the President made after an address of Parliament supported by a majority of the total number of Members of Parliament (including those not present) has been presented to the President for such removal on the ground of proved misbehavior or incapacity.

And, that Resolution needs to be signed by not less than one third of the total number of Members of Parliament, so that it could be adopted by Parliament.

Now, on that particular day, we remember that there was no such resolution and the Leader of the House, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva - if you examine the Hansard, you will find in his speech - tried to introduce a Resolution like that, but it had not been previously tabled. So, as a result, we have a situation where the Resolution passed on the 11th does not set out the alleged misbehaviour. It is not an address to the President to remove the Chief Justice, Shirani Bandaranayake. Instead, it was just the same Resolution enabling the submission of a Resolution to His Excellency the President. Therefore, the Resolution was never presented in Parliament; therefore deemed never to be voted for the removal and therefore the position of the Chief Justice was never vacated and, therefore, there was no position to be filled.

I have taken this position right at the outset. This happened on a Friday and on Sunday, I spoke to the media about this and in that media interview, I very specifically said that there is a risk in future, that this might be questioned for its legal validity. That is exactly what has happened at this point in time.

Now, we must remember that the process was flawed and this flawed process was not just about the Resolution to remove her. The Chairman of the Parliamentary Select Committee, the Hon. Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, spoke before me and I would like to point out to him that we did not accept the PSC Report from its very outset. The Superior Courts of our country have concurred with our view. Documents were tabled at the PSC on Thursday, the 6th of December 2012. The PSC Chairman, Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, announced that the Chief Justice and her lawyers will be given time until 1.30 p.m. on the 7th of December, 2012 to file answers. Never mind, the CJ and her lawyers, but, I would want to know whether the PSC Members themselves had enough time to read the documents and understand the logic behind the arguments in a few hours? It would then require calling for evidence, hearing of witnesses and so on. It was only natural then that the Chief Justice and her lawyers walked out of the PSC. Witnesses were called on the 7th of December; evidence heard; judgment determined and a Report prepared and the draft was approved by the PSC by 8.30 a.m. on the 8th of December. In a few hours, there was a

historical travesty of justice. Where in the world would this happen? Which right-thinking person could accept that Report of the PSC? But, that is exactly what happened and I have to refer to those events because I think those events need to be on record again because a question of the removal of the Chief Justice has been raised.

Impeachment is a responsibility of Parliament. It is Parliaments address to the President that will determine the removal of a Judge of the Superior Court. In that sense, judges do not determine the fate of the Superior Courts Judges whose conduct has warranted an investigation. So, it is Parliament's responsibility. The Supreme Court is also clear on this principle. In that sense, Parliament is supreme. However, on the interpretation of the Constitution, you may also say that the Judiciary is supreme. Article 4(c) of the Constitution directs Parliament to exercise judicial power to judicial institutions except in matters pertaining to the Privileges of Parliament and its Members. So, that is the only exception.

Article 125(1) leaves no ambiguity that the Supreme Court shall have the sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any questions relating to the interpretation of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has determined that proof being matters of law, will have to be provided by law to avoid uncertainty as to the proof of the alleged misbehaviour. The right of the judge, the right to be heard, cross-examination of witnesses, adduced evidence must also be provided. The judge is also entitled to equal protection of the law enshrined in the Constitution. This is what the then Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, tried to provide for, from the very inception of this crisis. He argued that an independent panel of judges should go into the allegations and through such a process, arrive at the findings. He went as far as to say the panel of judges should be constituted from the Commonwealth countries. When he was Prime Minister, an Impeachment Motion was brought against the then Chief Justice. It was the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe who initiated a process to obtain eminent judges of the Commonwealth. Justice must be done and justice must be seen to be done.

Naturally, the Chief Justice and her lawyers walked out of the Parliamentary Select Committee. The Opposition Members of the PSC also walked out the next day when it was evident that the principles of natural justice were being violated. We spoke against her Impeachment in Parliament; we voted against it and we have struggled to this day to ensure that Sri Lanka's Judiciary is independent.

I would also like to remind this House that Justice Shirani Bandaranayake was appointed to the Bench, not by a United National Party Government or a President of

that Party. Pradeep Kariyawasam was appointed as the Chairman of the National Savings Bank, not by a UNP administration, but by the then Minister of Finance and Planning of the country, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa. If Pradeep Kariyawasam did wrong, why was he not punished? You thought you could control the Chief Justice through that mechanism.

The Ruling of the Bench against the Divineguma Bill caused your pride to be shattered; the "Kings" fury saw no limits. Shirani Bandaranayake had to go. The court fought back to defend its independence. The court ruled that Parliament was right to impeach the Chief Justice, but also asked Parliament to adopt a process to hear out the Impeachment. I went with my fellow MPs - the Hon. Ajith P. Perera, the Hon. Niroshan Perera and the Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana - to court in support of that principle, that the Judiciary was supreme in matters of interpretation of the law. Therefore, we have now created a constitutional controversy. If there is a parliamentary controversy, it could be resolved by going for an election. But, such a mechanism is not available when you have a conflict between Parliament and the Judiciary; it cannot be resolved in that particular way. Constitutional governance requires that the three arms or pillars of a modern democracy be both independent and separate from each other.

The 18th Century French philosopher Montesquieu introduced the concept of separation of powers after looking at the Westminster model. We are told that the American and the French Constitutions were the basis for our Constitution and Article 33 - Powers and functions of the President - clearly states, I quote:

In addition to the powers and functions expressly conferred on or assigned to him by the Constitution or by any written law whether enacted before or after the commencement of the Constitution, the President shall have the power -

Article 33(f) states, I quote:

to do all such acts and things, not being inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution or written law as by international law, custom or usage he is required or authorized to do.

Our new President Maithripala Sirisena, seeing the constitutional crisis between the court and Parliament, has had to become the arbiter of the crisis and it is under those circumstances that he has now acted.

The question of an impeachment, therefore, does not arise. The question of an impeachment arises when it is about the behaviour of a Judge. The mechanism used here is not a punishment for unlawful or unethical behaviour. It is, correcting a constitutional crisis. The process was to correct a wrongful removal of a Judge, in this case, the Chief Justice. The senior-most Judge of the Supreme Court has been appointed to the Office of the Chief

Justice. Justice K. Sripavans name has been unanimously approved by the Parliamentary Council, which included the Hon. Leader of the Opposition of Parliament. We now have a new beginning.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) Mr. Presiding Member, I think all of us here look forward to having good governance and we were all hoping that this "Hundred-Day Programme" would be smoothly implemented with the cooperation of everybody in this House. I must say for myself that I am in support of all the progressive measures that have been included in that "Hundred-Day Programme". But, there are some, of course, which we do not accept. There are, in particular, the constitutional changes, which were expected to remove the Executive Presidency. But, now it looks as if there is only a reduction of its powers.

Basically, while we are prepared to cooperate in this exercise, I think it is very unfortunate that the Government has decided to bring up this issue of the removal of the Chief Justice. In the context of reducing the powers of the President and increasing the powers of Parliament, we see here a process of usurping a power with Parliament arbitrarily by the Executive, by the President, and this is completely unacceptable. This is a violation of our Constitution; it is a violation of Parliamentary procedures and it really is a violation of the sovereignty of Parliament and the people. I must say that the President - I can imagine under a lot of pressure particularly from the Hon. Prime Minister, who himself is a leading advocate of the Latimer House Principles - has really been prevailed upon to take this step.

369 370

As previous speakers had amply demonstrated, the dismissal of a Chief Justice must have the consent of Parliament; there has to be a Resolution moved in Parliament, which is the basis for the President to take that action and which has now been completely dropped. That whole Article, which really stresses the importance of that process, has been ignored and an arbitrary decision has been taken by the President as the Executive to dismiss the Chief Justice.

We totally oppose this and we regret that such a course of action has been taken. I would like to mention here that the excuse given for doing so is the fact that the dismissal of the earlier Chief Justice, the 43rd Chief Justice, Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake was done in an irregular manner. But, not only had the Hon. Speaker given a ruling on that, but also when the matter was taken up first by the Court of Appeal and thereafter by the Supreme Court clearly it was stated that it was a matter for Parliament and that Parliament has to decide on the course of action to be taken. That is what has been done. Even the retired Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva has clearly stated that what was done in the case of Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake is perfectly legal.

Here, I must add to what my Colleague, the Hon. DEW Gunasekara, said. We were unhappy with the procedure. We wanted the way in which the things were done to be fair and done in a more transparent manner. As a result of it, we ourselves abstained from voting.

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) But, your voice was never heard within the Government.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) I cannot help that. But - ( ) (The Hon. DEW Gunasekara) Hon. Dissanayake, he was in the same position as you were.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) Hon. Dissanayake, I think you were also in the same position.

( ) (The Hon. DEW Gunasekara) Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana, comparatively his was more than yours.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) So, the question is that is it legal or not? We maybe unhappy with the way things were done and we may have brought better methods of doing things. We ourselves made suggestions as to how the procedures could be improved, but it is acceptable, legal and that is what really matters. That procedure was legal. Therefore, now to declare arbitrarily that that procedure was invalid is not correct. Thereafter, the next appointment was made by the then Executive President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He had complete power to appoint a successor and he did so; whether the choice of the successor is to our liking or not is a different matter. But, the person chosen is a duly appointed Chief Justice and that Chief Justice has functioned for a period of over two years. He has been the head of the legal system for that entire period. He has officiated in various ways. His judgments are there. What is going to happen to all that? So, all that has been forgotten and here the arbitrary use of the executive powers has been exercised against the requirements imposed on us by the Constitution. So, this is a development which is dangerous, anti-democratic and it is against the very principle that you have been advocating of good governance and of the need for having a reduction in executive powers. So, here we have the President taking on powers that are not within his ambit.

This has set going a train of events. We know that in Court No. 5 in Hulftsdorp, how undue pressure was exerted on the Chief Justice by a group of lawyers. And, this same group of lawyers went to Court No. 5 where there was a disciplinary inquiry regarding a lawyer and the Magistrate had to leave the court. We are having here a situation of chaos. Your President got elected on the basis of having better law and order in the country. But, here, we have a breakdown of law and order. This is the trend that is continuing. We must not allow this to go on and we need to arrest this process.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have to wind up now. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) Hon. Presiding Member, please give me a half a minute.

I have a strong feeling that what ultimately is going to happen is what happened to Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike during the J.R. Jayewardene regime, where she was deprived of her civic rights so that she could not contest. We are having a similar trend taking place, today, and I will not be surprised if the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa also faces a similar sad fate.
