UNITED NATIONS ACT : REGULATIONS [1.57 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Mr. Speaker, I move,

That the Regulations made by the Minister of External Affairs under Section 2 of the United Nations Act, No 45 of 1968 and published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1892/37 of 11th December, 2014, which were presented on 05.02.2015, be approved.

Sir, I stand before you today to present Amendments in line with our international obligations to the United Nations Regulations No. 1 and 2 of 2012 promulgated under the United Nations Act, No. 45 of 1968.

As the House is aware, following the Al-Qaeda terrorist attacks in September, 2001, the Security Council of the United Nations, acting under Chapter VII of its Charter, adopted Resolution 1373 on 28th September, 2001, which is a wide-ranging, comprehensive Resolution setting out steps and strategies to combat international terrorism. The Resolution, which is binding on all States, called on countries, among other steps to be taken, to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorism. On 15th of October, 1999, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1267, setting out measures to be imposed also against the Taliban. This Resolution, its modifications and subsequent resolutions impose upon Member States a series of obligations relating to sanction measures against entities and persons associated with the Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, as designated by the Sanctions Committee of the United Nations, whose names appear on the Consolidated List adopted by the Committee.

In fact, Sri Lanka, in keeping with its international obligations, had duly gazetted the Regulations to give effect to the provisions of these two Resolutions of 2012. This had been done under the United Nations Act, No. 45 of 1968 by Gazette Extraordinary No. 1758/19 dated 15th May, 2012, which is referred to as the "United Nations Regulation No. 1 of 2012" and Gazette Extraordinary No. 1760/40 dated 31st May, 2012, which is referred to as the "United Nations Regulation No. 2 of 2012".

Also, Sir, the Financial Action Task Force - FATF - which is an inter-governmental body, has developed a series of recommendations that are recognized as the international standard for combatting money laundering, financing of terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This Task Force had also suggested for the Governments consideration, several recommendations to be incorporated as amendments to the Regulations promulgated in 2012, as the standards set by the Task Force had changed after Sri Lanka enacted its Regulations.

As I stated before, Sri Lanka has given effect to the provisions of the UN Security Council Resolutions 1373 and 1267, and what we seek to do today is to adopt Amendments to these Regulations in keeping with the recommendations made by the Financial Action Task Force and the Asia Pacific Group on money laundering to ensure that Sri Lankas legal framework in this important area is in harmony with internationally-accepted standards against money laundering and financing of terrorism.

211 212

2015 18

The proposed Amendments that have been gazetted in Gazette Extraordinary No. 1892/37 of 11th December, 2014 and tabled, before you, in this House, have received the careful examination of the Financial Intelligence Unit and the Inter-agency Committee on UN Security Council Resolutions 1267 and 1373, comprising representatives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Defence, the Attorney-Generals Department, the Legal Draftsmans Department and the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank. The Amendments relate to provisions for amending particulars related to names, widening the coverage of freezing orders, expansion of provisions when handling foreign requests, expansion of provisions when requesting foreign States to designate, reporting of attempted transactions, redress for persons who are inadvertently affected and the expansion of provisions on the proposal of names to the UN Sanctions Committee.

In fact, Mr. Speaker, I now seek, through this Bill today, the approval of the House for these Amendments to the UN Regulations mentioned before, to ensure that Sri Lankas legal framework in this respect is in harmony with internationally accepted standards against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. However, I also want to state here that while legal frameworks are of utmost importance, it is in the hearts and minds that the real battle against terrorism will be won, especially in the context of Sri Lanka, where the conflict was between two ethnic communities of the very same soil. Therefore, I propose that these Amendments be adopted, keeping very much in mind, this stark reality.

Mr. Speaker, as outlined, we are presenting these Amendments in line with our international obligations at a very propitious moment when Sri Lanka marks the 60th Anniversary of Sri Lankas membership in the United Nations. This important anniversary also coincides with the 70th Anniversary of the setting up of the United Nations Organization - UNO.

The Amendments to the UN Regulations No. 1 and 2 of 2012 are aimed at strengthening Sri Lankas domestic legislative framework to comply, as I said earlier, with the UN Security Council Resolutions on terrorist financing and money laundering. The Amendments will strengthen the capacity of the law enforcement and judicial authorities responsible for investigating money laundering and terrorist financing in keeping with Sri Lankas tradition of cooperation with the United Nations and our resolve to fulfil international obligations and act responsibly towards our citizens in cooperation with other countries in the international community.

Mr. Speaker, for much of Sri Lankas history since Independence, Sri Lanka was considered as an important member of the international community even in the United Nations. Having joined the UN on 14th December, 1955, Sri Lanka has contributed in many ways to the UN system including its norm-setting process. Just five years

since becoming a member, Sri Lanka, then Ceylon, was elected as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. Many distinguished Sri Lankans have held important positions in the UN and its agencies. They have chaired important conferences including the "Law of the Sea" and presided over the General Assembly as well as the Security Council.

Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the last few years saw our country drift from this traditional position of engagement, not only with the United Nations, but with the entire international community. We shifted from our position of a consensus-builder to a path of confrontation, non-engagement and intransigence. We abandoned our traditional partners including those countries that helped Sri Lanka in its journey of development and those who helped us in times of crisis. The Government, at the time, became obsessed with ideologies and concepts in a world where countries are required increasingly to work together in cooperation with each other to seek solutions to problems, pursue economic progress, increase investment and achieve sustainable development. Diplomacy was exercised as if it were a zero-sum game, cultivating only one set of countries at the expense of another. This was uncharacteristic of our nations inherent personality. We recall with shame when senior Members of the last Government made derogatory and highly defamatory statements about senior members of the United Nations and other senior members of the international community, sometimes even calling them terrorists or terrorist sympathizers for merely raising issues about Sri Lankas international obligations. Some of these obligations are the ones that we had undertaken on our own as a sovereign nation without any pressure, whatsoever, from the UN or the international community, in line with our duties and responsibilities towards our own citizens.

Mr. Speaker, defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a country is essential to the foreign policy of any nation, I agree. However, no country in todays world can take cover strictly behind the Westphalian concept of absolute sovereignty which, I believe, is no longer valid in the modern world of the 21st Century. If nothing else, we must awaken to the reality that the imperatives of globalization and interdependence, connectivity and technological advancements have cast the concept of sovereignty in an entirely different light. Sovereignty carries with it great responsibility which involves duties towards ones own citizens. When a Government fails to discharge such duties, external intervention of an unwelcome and intrusive nature is difficult to prevent.

Having successfully achieved the complex diplomatic task of preventing external intervention under the UN Security Council during the conflict in 2009, the Government at the time regrettably failed to pursue the path of domestic peacebuilding. By refusing to address

213 214

the issues of concern locally, the Government alienated communities within the country as well as Sri Lankas international partners. This resulted in our nation becoming the subject of successive resolutions in Geneva.

Mr. Speaker, the present Government, under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena pursues a policy of working with all countries. As you are aware, we are also involved in the process of renewing our engagement with other international organizations. The Government is committed to uphold the victory that the people of this country achieved on the 8th of January by taking resolute action to strengthen democratic institutions, good governance and the rule of law and enable peaceful dissent and freedom of expression. A credible domestic investigation into allegations of violations of human rights is an important part of this process. There is no basis at all to consider that human rights are an alien concept to this country. In fact, human rights cannot be considered as western values; human rights should be considered as universal values. Human rights, Mr. Speaker, are very much a part of our constitutional obligations.

In the document titled, ''We shall unite for Change. 'Dawn of Maithri Rule'. 'A new country in 100 days'' that was presented to the people in the lead up to the Presidential Election on the 8th of January, we have clearly stated the following under item 93. I quote:

Since Sri Lanka is not a signatory to the Rome Statue regarding international jurisdiction with regard to war crimes, ensuring justice with regard to such matters will be the business of national independent judicial mechanisms.

This was in our Manifesto which was distributed in English, in Sinhala and in Tamil to all the households in this country. Today, therefore, we feel that we have a national obligation to ensure that such a mechanism is put in place as early as possible.

These processes are essential to safeguard our national interest, fulfil the aspirations of all communities within our country and restore our nations image and reputation as a long-standing democracy and a civilized society. I reiterate that whatever domestic action that is taken is not because of international pressure as some allege but to fulfil our nations duty to our own citizens. It is to fulfil our Governments promise to the people in the lead up to the Presidential Election. It is to truly safeguard the sovereignty of the people instead of raising slogans about safeguarding sovereignty, which the previous Government engaged in, whilst opening up the nation to international ignominy and making our nation unduly vulnerable to intrusive external intervention. Taking action locally as a responsible nation accountable to all sections of our population, upholding the rule of law, good governance and democracy while working in

cooperation with the international community is the only way to project ourselves as a country that is at peace with itself. This is the only way to enable a secure atmosphere essential for foreign investment, which is required for the long-term economic development of our nation and for sustainable progress and prosperity of our people. True safeguarding of sovereignty can be achieved only by fulfilling our obligations to our people and by preserving and upholding the multiethnic, multilingual and multireligious nature of our society while learning to work with other nations and international organizations in this interdependent world, not through the pursuit of adversarial policies, as some try to make us believe.

Hon. Speaker, you would recall that on Independence Day this year, the Government made a Declaration of Peace and President Maithripala Sirisena called for meditative reflection on past errors and to desist from heaping blame on each other. He made a commitment to work towards reconciliation and to unite the minds of the people of all ethnic and religious communities in the country. In order to achieve meaningful reconciliation, strengthen democracy, good governance and the rule of law and to rebuild our nations international image, consensual democracy championed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe as against a culture of adversarial politics is an absolute necessity. In this respect, I am grateful to the Hon. Members of the Opposition for the support they have been extending to the Government in this important journey of regaining our nations dignity, which would ensure that Sri Lanka takes its due place once again as a responsible State among the community of civilized nations.

Mr. Speaker, as you are aware, in the spirit of working in harmony with the international community, the Government has extended invitations to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights - I believe he will hopefully be coming here in the month of June - and the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. In fact, some sections of the former regime call this a betrayal of the armed forces. However, this is furthest from the truth. Our objective, Sir, is to clear the name of our armed forces, which have received wide international recognition as professional and disciplined forces. This is obvious by their very acceptance to UN peacekeeping missions in different parts of the world. In fact, the new Government is being invited to participate even more actively in UN peacekeeping efforts around the world and this matter was discussed extensively when I met the US Ambassador to the United Nations last month. It is also our objective to ensure that the international recognition of our armed forces personnel is further strengthened by taking action against any misdemeanors that some individuals may have committed and efforts to tarnish the image of our forces.

215 216

This House would recall that this is not the first time that entities such as the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances have been invited. I remember, way back in 1990, the Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, as an Opposition Member of Parliament, on the very Floor of this House, extended invitations not only to the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, but also to the Amnesty International and the ICRC to come to Sri Lanka and more recently, we have documents to show, the former Defence Secretary, Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, too had given the green light in writing for the visit of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances.

Sir, I wish to draw the attention of this House to a matter related to the Regulations under the United Nations Act, which is the subject of our discussion today. The previous Government used the UN Regulation No. 1 of 2012 under UN Security Council Resolution 1373 to list 424 individuals and 16 entities by Gazette Extraordinary No. 1854/41 of 21st March, 2014 in the run up to the Presidential Election.

This was done, I believe, to build up the hysteria about the LTTE regrouping, which the Government used in desperation in President Rajapaksas re-election bid. In order to create this hysteria, they banned several Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora groups under these provisions for their alleged links to the LTTE. However, most of the organizations listed have been mere vocal proponents of Tamil rights and there was hardly any tangible evidence to link them to the LTTE. In fact, some of the individuals who were listed in that Gazette Notification had been dead for several years when it came out.

Therefore, in conclusion, Sir, I feel that reviewing of those individuals, entities and this ban is an important exercise at this juncture when the Government of President Maithripala Sirisena is seriously committed to expedite the reconciliation process. In doing so, the Sri Lankan diaspora, whether it be Sinhala, Tamil or Muslim, has an extremely important role to play, not only in taking the reconciliation process forward, but also in taking Sri Lanka forward as a modern 21st Century nation. Some of the best world-class doctors, scientists, lawyers, musicians, artistes, opera singers and many other professionals, who our nation can be proud of as Sri Lankans, make up this diaspora and we must enable them to take part in our journey to make Sri Lanka, as I said earlier, a truly multiracial, multicultural, multireligious and multilingual democracy celebrating its diversity.

Thank you. . . Question proposed.

Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. CHANDIMA WEERAKKODY] took the Chair.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , . [2.20 p.m.] () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Deputy Speaker, since this is the first occasion on which I am speaking in the House in the presence of my successor, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment and to wish him well in tackling the arduous tasks that lie ahead.

There is no doubt that it is a daunting challenge. There is admittedly an atmosphere of goodwill, which will no doubt be of considerable assistance to my successor in discharging his onerous responsibilities to this nation and in this, we wish him well. I assure him that our approach to the conduct of foreign relations does not admit of any degree of rancour or adversarial approaches. We believe that this, at least, is an area in which there must be consensus between the Government and the Opposition, between all the different shades of political opinion in this country and I, therefore, assure him of our goodwill and support.

As the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs indicated, the purpose of these Regulations is to ensure that the legal framework of Sri Lanka is in harmony with the international obligations we have undertaken. In fact, the two Regulations, which are the subject of Debate in this august Assembly this afternoon, were those signed by me on the 9th of December as the Minister of External Affairs of the previous Government and the purpose of these Regulations was to enable the designation of certain organizations which were thought to be linked to terrorist causes and also to take appropriate measures in connection with the freezing of the financial resources of these organizations.

However, since these Regulations were framed under the United Nations Act and as the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera remarked, this is the 60th Anniversary of

217 218

our membership of the United Nations and the 70th Anniversary of the United Nations Organization itself, I think it is appropriate to engage in a somewhat broader discussion about Sri Lankas connections with the United Nations System.

I would, with respect, disagree with the Hon. Minister on his assessment of the previous Governments approach to the United Nations system. It is not that we distanced ourselves from the United Nations; it is not that we told the United Nations that we are not prepared to work with them; we did not ask them to mind their own business and to leave us to get on with our own affairs; that was certainly not the case. The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera mentioned that he had invited the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights, His Excellency Prince Zeid Raad Zeid Al-Hussein, to visit our country. I hope that visit will take place before September. But, at the same time, we did invite Prince Zeid Raad Zeid Al-Husseins predecessor, Her Excellency Navaneetham Pillai, to visit this country. She came here and the Commissioner for Human Rights was not the only official representing the United Nations system, who we invited to our shores. We also invited Dr. Chaloka Beyani, who incidentally has the same degree from the same University. He has a doctorate in Philosophy from the University of Oxford. We had some very insightful discussions while Dr. Chaloka Beyani was in this country. His special field was Political Rights of Internally Displaced Persons. He spent several days in Sri Lanka. He visited the North and it was in every sense, a complete and fruitful visit. We also invited the Commissioner dealing with the rights of migrants. He, too, came to this country and formed his own impressions of the developments which have taken place in Sri Lanka since the cessation of hostilities. So, there was engagement with the UN system at these high levels and these officials accepted our invitation to come here, and they did visit our country. Dr. Francois Crepeau, I think, was the official who came here to discuss issues connected with migrants.

That was not the limit of our engagement with the United Nations system. I am sure the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera is aware of the Joint Needs Assessment, which the Government of Sri Lanka carried out with the United Nations system in the Northern part of the country, and that yielded some conclusions which are of definite value. There was also a great deal of work which our Government did with the Committee for Coordinated Humanitarian Assistance. That, I think made a signal contribution to the progress of reconciliation in our country. So, all these happened. It is not that we did not engage with the UN system.

The present Government as well as the previous Government agree on one matter: engagement with the UN system is salutary; it is essential. As the Hon.

Minister of Foreign Affairs rightly observed, we live in a world where such engagement is a matter of dire necessity. But, of course, foreign policy like any other aspect of policy has to do with the balancing of competing interests and we must try to arrive at a fair and just equilibrium. We are agreed that this country will not be subjected to any international investigations. That is the policy of both Governments. In regard to that matter, there is no divergence of opinion. This country will not be subjected to an external - an international - investigation.

Now having said that, we need to reflect on the views which the international community expressed about the situation in Sri Lanka during the last few years. The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera used some harsh words such as "intransigence", "adversarial approaches" and so on. I do not think that really does justice to some of the deliberations that took place in the organs of the United Nations system and, in particular, the Human Rights Council itself. I would ask the Hon. Minister to reflect on some realities in that regard. There were some principles which the Human Rights Council articulated with great clarity and emphasis in relation to Sri Lanka. I would suggest that those principles be borne in mind as the new Government goes ahead with its policy of dealing with some of these very vexed and convoluted issues.

First and foremost, there are many countries in the world, across geographical regions and not confined to one single culture, which said that country-specific resolutions are bad; country-specific resolutions are a betrayal of the mandate of the Human Rights Council; country-specific resolutions inevitably involve a high degree of politicization. There are many countries that stood up on the floor of the Human Rights Council and said this pursuit of Sri Lanka cannot be acquiesced in; we do not support it because in principle we do not think that the Human Rights Council was established by the United Nations General Assembly to pass country-specific resolutions. I think that is something that we need to bear in mind.

The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs is aware that a large swath of the globe including China, Russia, India, Japan, and the Arab World, all the countries that had seats in the Human Rights Council from Asia, with one exception, and more than two-thirds of the countries of the African Continent, they all said in unison, that one has to be fair while things are not perfect - and nobody claims that they are perfect - but the degree of progress achieved by this country since the cessation of hostilities is substantial. When you consider the complexity of the issues that had to be dealt with at the end of 30 years of excruciatingly painful conflict, the complexity, the magnitude of those issues and the progress that was made within the short space of time, which we had at our disposal since the end of the war, that progress is substantial. It is not complete; it is not perfect. There is

But, many countries said that there must be a sense of proportion in assessing these situations and to pursue Sri Lanka inexorably and relentlessly, year after year after year, during three consecutive years, is an attitude which is lacking in that desirable sense of proportion and, on that ground, they dissociated themselves from the content of these Resolutions and said, We do not think that this is acceptable from the stand point of fairness and equity.

The other point that was made by the large number of countries that supported us - as I pointed out on those occasions - the countries supporting the Resolution were in a minority and they said it is very important to apply the same yardstick. I mean Sri Lanka is not unique. There are many other countries that have had to deal with these difficult post-conflict situations. If you look at the former Yugoslavia, Cambodia and Spain at that time, why does Sri Lanka alone attract this degree of attention? There are other countries which have taken far longer than we have done to address these issues and countries which have made far less progress during a comparable period than we have done. So, many countries made the criticism that there was discrimination; it was invidious; different standards were applied and even at the basic level, there was an absence of uniformity and consistency in the manner in which Sri Lanka had been dealt with by some countries. These are matters of record. These are interventions that took place in the Human Rights Council and these are matters of which it is prudent to remind ourselves as we engage in this Debate this afternoon.

So, we are agreed on one thing: that an international investigation is out of the question. The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera spoke of taking action locally. We are agreed on that also. We have, as we speak, a Commission on Dissappearances - the Presidential Commission to Investigate into Complaints Regarding Missing Persons - headed by a former High Court Judge, Maxwell Paranagama. He has been entrusted with that responsibility. So, there is a local mechanism. - [Interruption.] I think he was expected to hand it over today. So, that is an ongoing mechanism. That is an Interim Report. I think they have received a very large volume of evidence. So, they thought it prudent to submit an Interim Report before waiting until they had completed the whole of their work. So, there is a local mechanism. Your Government is proposing a different kind of a mechanism.

We do not know yet and I am not saying this at all in a confrontational spirit. Anything that we can do to help, certainly, our assistance is at your disposal in a national cause. You are proposing, as I understand, a different type of local mechanism. I read in the media today a statement by the Hon. Ajith P. Perera, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, who says that "the contemplated mechanism will not be a panel or a tribunal, but the inquiry will be done by the established courts of the Republic".

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera)

. . rose.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Mangala Samaraweera. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) May I explain that very quickly? () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Yes, certainly. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Actually, we are looking at several options and we have not yet finalized, but before we do, we will also engage the Opposition on what the final format should be.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) We would certainly be happy to make an input into that, because that is a very complex issue. How would you frame the Terms of Reference? Your Government is on record as saying that although this will be intrinsically a local mechanism, there will be inputs by the UN system. - [Interruption.] Yes. So, all these elements will have to be woven into the structures and the mechanisms of the local body and as you are well aware, that is by no means a simple or easy task. So, again there is no disagreement. We both subscribe to the need for a local mechanism, but the detail is important: how will it be structured; what will be the scope of its jurisdiction; how will it operate et cetera. So, these are all matters which need to be considered in some depth.

I do not agree with the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera that the previous Government adopted an absolutist approach to sovereignty. Sovereignty of the nation State is something that we can depart from, but of course, sovereignty is not a total concept. It never was actually. I mean, sovereignty has to be abridged and curtailed by realities and those are particularly acute in the world in which we live. But, there is some residue of sovereignty that goes to the heart of national pride and that is why your Government is also asserting with great vehemence that we will not countenance an international investigation. So, sovereignty is not something that we can throw to the winds and abandon in a cavalier fashion. We must hold fast to some element of it. - [Interruption.]

221 222

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) We are not saying that we will throw it to the winds at all.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris So, what is involved Hon. Minister, is a disagreement with regard to the interpretation of sovereignty. Sovereignty has to be there. We cannot wish it away. But, what does it mean? So, it is really a divergence of opinion with regard to the content of sovereignty.

The Hon. Minister said that human rights is a universal concept. It is. But, again different cultures have different interpretations of human rights. The Buddha dhamma has a great deal of rich material interpreting the content of human rights. The Bhagavad Gita, the Islamic scriptures, all contain very valuable material on this subject of human rights and I would say that one of the attributes of the Eastern culture, the Asian culture, is that we do not place excessive emphasis on the retributive or the punitive elements - an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth - that is reflected in some elements of the Western tradition going back to the Roman law, but cultures in our part of the world depart significantly from that premise. So, human rights, I certainly agree with you, is a universal concept and it is not confined to any particular region of the globe, but different countries have different approaches to the application of human rights in contemporary society.

Then, another matter which should receive the attention of the new Government is the twin elements of accountability and reconciliation. It is not entirely clear as you said and that is entirely understandable. These are evolving thoughts. After all, the new Government has been in power for less than two months. So, it is not realistic to expect a complete picture at this stage. But, there have been some statements by representatives of the new Government that accountability and reconciliation are to be dealt with as two different facets or aspects. Is that possible? Is that realistic? Today, the Hon. Deputy Minister was also quoted with regard to the approach of the new Government to the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Here again, the circumstances of the South African situation are diametrically at variance with the situation that we are confronted with in our own country. Certainly, we do not need to reinvent the wheel. By all means, borrow what is good and applicable from the experience of other countries. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was presided over by Dr. Alex Boraine and the name of Archbishop Desmond Tutu is prominently associated with that Body. But, not many people are aware that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was critically assessed in South Africa. Many people commented adversely on some of the attributes of it. So, it is not something that

we can uncritically adopt and apply in the circumstances that prevail in Sri Lanka. But, certainly, it has many aspects, many elements which are worth looking at. Before I came into politics, I myself, have lectured in many of the universities of South Africa. That is because my doctoral thesis in the University of Oxford contained a large element of South African Law. So, I am familiar with the system. It is certainly worth looking at, it is profitable, but it has to be adapted creatively to suit the circumstances of the Sri Lankan situation.

The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera referred to the armed forces and said that far from abandoning the armed forces, the initiatives of the new Government are directed towards protecting the interests of the armed forces. I would ask him to examine very carefully the elements of International Humanitarian Law, which has a bearing on this, in particular, hostage situations. After all, the last stages of the war perhaps exemplified the most harrowing situation in modern military history with regard to hostages. You were dealing with hundreds of thousands of people trapped in a narrow strip of land, between the lagoon and the sea, and that was a situation in which military action was taken towards the end of the war. That situation certainly has a bearing on the content of the law to be applied, and I think there is a great deal of technical, legal work to be done in the matter of protecting adequately the soldiers in the field, whose fate is now in jeopardy in consequence of some of these potential investigations.

As for the diaspora, we have no disagreement whatever. Certainly, we have to work with the diaspora. I agree with the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera when he said that some of the worlds most distinguished doctors, lawyers and musicians are today part of the diaspora. We have no intention of isolating them, much less of demonizing them. They are a part of the overall equation. But, we must always be in the driving seat; we must be directing policy. All these people can make inputs. We must engage with them; we must find out what their perceptions and insights are with regard to these very difficult situations that we are handling. But, at all times, we must not succumb to pressure from outside, from whatever source it may emanate and we must always remain in total control of the formulation and the implementation of policy.

So, these are the matters that I wanted to respond to. Again, I certainly reject the criticism that the designation of entities towards the end of the tenure of office of the last Government was dictated by political considerations. That was not the case. There can be a genuine disagreement with regard to whether a particular entity qualifies or does not qualify in keeping with the criteria stipulated. But, there was certainly no mala fide action; there was certainly no intention on the part of the last Government to use these instruments in order to make political decisions and to implement them. That was not the case and I would, with respect, disagree with that particular view that was expressed by the Hon. Minister.

223 224

2015 18

In conclusion, I wish to say that we are now embarking on a new adventure, a new period in the history of our country and it is certainly the intention of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party to work in a spirit of partnership and collaboration with the new Government and, in particular, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. After all, this is a continuant. I mean, simply because one government ends and another government begins, that does not mean a paradigm shift with regard to everything. There is continuity; it is like a river that is flowing forwards. So, foreign policy consists of strips and layers that have been contributed by different administrations. That element of continuity is important and I conclude as I began with the remark, that it is certainly our earnest wish to assist the new Government in every way in tackling these difficult issues of foreign policy in the interest of our nation and he has my assurance in that regard. I thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

They are: the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Killings, the Special Rapporteur on Enforced Disappearances and many other Special Rapporteurs. -

[Interruption.] Yes, I know, you mentioned it. So, many other Special Rapporteurs wanted to visit Sri Lanka, but we could not schedule those visits for various reasons, the final reason being the visit of the previous High Commissioner for Human Rights to Sri Lanka, and then, of course, the Presidential Election came about. But, you cannot escape the reality that those Special Rapporteurs will have to be facilitated to visit Sri Lanka and do not forget that when they come to Sri Lanka, they will do their own investigations, then go back to Geneva and present their reports. So, this is the outcome of closer cooperation and as long as that can be handled and it does not endanger the political stability of this country, well and good. Finally what is important is for us to be in the driving seat and do what is needed, something substantive to ensure that the truth is found, so that whatever actions that stem from it can be taken and once again, the international confidence that we want to put in place could be put in place.

What is also important to remember, Hon. Minister, is that this kind of a journey must be embarked on, not only with those on your side, but also by joining hands with those on this side, who are progressive-minded, who do not think of politics when it comes to human rights and who think of sustainable development and durable peace in this country and, of course, of finally going that full journey to reach comprehensive reconciliation. So, we need to work together. I do not know what the future holds, but when it comes to even debates like this, I think it is important that we not only embark on constructive criticism, but also take the opportunity of instilling confidence in the minds of all the citizens of this country that regarding their rights and their future, we are willing to work together.

[4.23 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak. I am glad to speak after the veteran Communist, the Hon. DEW Gunasekara. It was nice to see him acknowledge that the Bodu Bala Sena was a mistake. The activities of the Bodu Bala Sena not only affected the voting that took place at the UNHRC, but it also affected the voting in this country, and Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa is at home today, very much due to the actions of bodies like the Bodu Bala Sena.

If the Government which won the war thought that it won the Elections in 2005 solely with Sinhala-Buddhist votes and by winning the war, they have the whole Sinhala community behind them; trying to keep that

euphoria of the Sinhala people up by using bodies like the Bodu Bala Sena, they have finally failed, because all the minorities and a fair number of the majority community who got together thought that what was happening in this country was not decent, was not the correct thing. They took a decision to get rid of the government that thought that they can ride on Sinhala-Buddhist sentiments alone while robbing this country. So, it is nice to see the Hon. Member, who does not believe in racial politics, accepting that it was a mistake to allow organizations like the Bodu Bala Sena to function in this country.

Today, we are passing Regulations, which is an international obligation, as a member of the United Nations Organization. It is against two serious offenders of the world, who feel that through terrorism they can establish their thinking. Their thinking is also based on racial politics and they are bound to fail in the long run. But, today, we all have to protect the law-abiding citizens against this type of terrorist organizations. So, we are cooperating with the United Nations Organization and passing these Regulations in this House.

Today, it is about 65 days since our Government assumed office. Our Foreign Minister has been doing a great job travelling around the world, impressing on world leaders that Sri Lanka has become again a decent country, a decent State that respects international obligations, respects democracy, respects human rights and also respects the aspirations of the people of the country. To damage somebody's reputation is very easy. It can be done overnight. But, to regain a person's reputation is not an easy task. Similarly, a nation which was looked down upon by the whole world is today having a Foreign Affairs Minister working overtime to restore the respect that our nation had as a decent State in the committee of nations.

Democracy does not just mean, having elections. In the past, the previous Government had many elections; not only elections to all bodies in the country, but they were split throughout the year with elections almost in every six months showing everyone that we have a vibrant democracy. But, a democracy that does not let people think on their own, a democracy in which the State uses its media organizations to distort the truth, a State which uses the public resources for its own political gains, is not a true democracy. Here, we had a multi-party democracy. True. But, the will of one group of people was imposed through force, through money power and State power in our democracy. That is the reason the whole world thought that Sri Lanka was going down the precipice into an autocratic State.

The people of Sri Lanka must be proud today that in spite of all the power that the contestant who wanted a further term had, the people rallied but they decided on their own. Last week and the previous week, I was in the Nuwara Eliya District; I was going from estate to estate. I

255 256

asked those people whether they knew Maithripala Sirisena; whether they knew what he stood for; whether he came and canvassed for their votes; whether his party people came from house to house; had meetings; or had gala events to propagate during that election. They said, No, we did not have any of that part of the so-called democratic process, where at an election time people have tamashas all over the country". But, they said that there were people who came and gave them gifts, there were people who were trying to give them chicken, goats and lure them to vote for Mahinda Rajapaksa. In spite of all that, they wanted to have a change, to restore democracy, to feel free again and they decided several weeks before the election that they would vote for Maithripala Sirisena. After those people took that decision, the mood of the people was well-known in the upcountry.

Some so-called leaders of the upcountry, who were sitting with the then Government, eating and drinking with them, enjoying perks of power, realized that the people are abandoning them and moving to the Common Candidate sponsored by the UNP and they thought that for their survival the only thing they can do is to jump to the other side and they came to our side. If they believe even in their dreams that they got the people in the upcountry to vote with them, that is a farce; it is a fraud and it is cheating the whole world. But, because they took a decision, they are being rewarded; they are again enjoying the perks of office as before. But, people know who they are and why they jumped ship. This is unfortunate in the democracy that we practise.

In the past, Members of political parties were lured away, rewarded and bought away with gifts, money, positions and power to cross-over to the Government side. Again, when somebody sensed that the other Party is going to win, they had no moral scruples, they jump to the other side and this continues. But, in the Nineteenth Amendment, clauses are going to be included, where Members who jump from side to side will not be able to retain their positions in Parliament. That will be a very good move. In a democracy when Members are elected, they should reflect the views of the people who elected them. But, today, once you get elected, you think you are a commodity that can be traded across the Floor of this House, which is unfortunate. Until we stop that, true democracy cannot be re-established in this country.

We have been talking about the different races in this country. People talk about a unitary State, about federalism. Some people say that federalism can lead to splitting up of countries. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet the Foreign Minister of Switzerland. They are a Federal State; they comprise of many counties which are totally independent. These are counties which came together and made a nation and they are now working together as a solid, single, indivisible country. So, we should take a lesson from Switzerland, which is a functioning democracy, a Federal State where all people feel equal.

We had in this House last week, the Prime Minister of India. When India gained Independence, they declared themselves to be a unitary State. At that time, many princely States, which were not part of the British India, came together to form India. Several States with several languages, people following different religions came together to form India. When India was formed and became a Republic in 1952, they thought that keeping India together is going to be difficult. Fortunately, they evolved a Constitution through a Constitutional Assembly and created a quasi-federal State. But, today, India has developed into a truly federal State where State Governments, which are based on language or ethnicity are functioning as a democracy. Indians, today talk about themselves first as Indians, then of the racial or ethnic group that they belong to or the State they belong to. That oneness has come because the federal concept through the State mechanism in India has functioned so well and the Centre respects the views of the different States and accommodates those views without being antagonistic to those who ask for certain changes in their systems. So, because of that, India has become a strong country, an indivisible country, a federal nation and a functioning democracy today.

Thank you.
