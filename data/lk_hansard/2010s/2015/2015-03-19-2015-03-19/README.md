[2.15 p.m.] .. ( , ) ( .. - , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Resettlement, Reconstruction and Hindu Religious Affairs) Hon. Deputy Speaker, this Order has been moved to extend the operation of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act, No. 2 of 2013 for a further period not exceeding two years with effect from 2nd of February, 2015.

As you are aware, the main provision of this Act is Section 2, which states, I quote:

Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 other than the provisions of section 43A of that Act, any peace officer shall not detain in custody or otherwise confine a person arrested without a warrant for a longer period than under all the circumstances of the case is reasonable and such period shall not exceed twenty-four hours exclusive of the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the presence of the Magistrate:

Provided that, where the arrest is in relation to an offence as is specified in the Schedule to this Act, such period of detention in police custody may, on production before him of the person arrested and on a certificate filed by a police officer not below the rank of the Assistant Superintendent of Police submitted prior to the expiration of the said period of twenty-four hours, to the effect that it is necessary to detain such person for the purpose of further investigations, be extended upon an Order made in that behalf by the Magistrate for a further period not exceeding twenty-four hours, so however that the aggregate period of detention shall not exceed forty-eight hours: ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

, [ ] .

, , [ ] .

Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, you may carry on.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, Section 2 further states, I quote:

Provided further, that any person arrested and detained for a further period shall be afforded an opportunity to consult an Attorney-at-Law of his choice and to communicate with any relative or friend of his choice during the period of such detention.

This Section on Detention deals with only the grave offences described in the Schedule of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act. I just want to bring those grave offences to the attention of this august Assembly. The Schedule which relates to Section 2 states, I quote:

"Column I Column II

1. Abetment of an offence set out in the Schedule, if the act abetted is committed. Section 102-Penal Code 2. Conspiracy for the abetment or commission of any offence set out in the Schedule. Section 113B-Penal Code 3. Murder. Section 296-Penal Code

4. Culpable Homicide not amounting to murder. Section 297-Penal Code

5 Attempt to commit murder. Section 300-Penal Code

6. Kidnapping or abduction to commit murder. Section 355-Penal Code

7. Kidnapping or abduction with intent to wrongfully confine a person. Section 356-Penal Code

8. Kidnapping or abduction with intent to wrongfully subject person to grievous hurt. Section 358-Penal Code

9. Concealing or keeping in confinement a kidnapped person. Section 359-Penal Code 10. Rape. Section 364-Penal Code

11. Theft, preparation having being made to cause death &c. Section 371-Penal Code

12. Robbery with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt. Section 383-Penal Code 13. Attempt to commit robbery when armed with deadly weapon. Section 384-Penal Code

14. Attempt to commit any of the above offences. Section 490-Penal Code

15. An offence committed with the use of explosives, an offensive weapon or a gun. Explosive as defined in the Explosives Act (Chapter 183); offensive weapon as defined in the Offencive Weapons Act, No. 18 of 1966 and a Gun as defined in the Firearms Ordinance (Chapter 182)"

327 328

2015 19

So, as you all can see, the Hon. Minister is trying to extend the operation of this Act for a further period of two years. You should look at the intent of the Legislature for this extension. By giving a 48-hour period of time for a person arrested to be detained, the police get the power to interrogate the culprit from all angles without interruption by any extraneous factors. This is very important as far as the judicial system is concerned because unless that person is under the custody of the police, there could be many other sources which could influence the police officers and the person concerned could also influence through many other sources.

Under todays judicial system, after the inquiry between the culprit and the police is over, they can file a fresh indictment straight to the High Court, where the case could be heard. Otherwise, the case would have to go to the Magistrates Court and then, there has to be an inquiry at the Magistrates Court. After the inquiry at the Magistrates Court, the Magistrate will have to indict him at the High Court. Then, there would be quite a delay. As per the particulars given by the Ministry of Justice and Labour Relations, many indictments have been made by the police directly to the High Court, after the inquiry was over. So, you can see why we are trying to extend the operation of this Act for a further period of two years.

Of course, there is going to be a major guidance by a three or four-member committee appointed by the Hon. Minister to supervise or act like an appellate body, where a person aggrieved by the police investigation could make representations to the said body. Then, the said body could intervene and see whether there has been any unwanted elements or wrongful attempt against the accused. So, this is a very good safeguard to prevent any intervention by extraneous factors, as far as the investigation is concerned. Today, as you are aware, justice in a court of law is achieved only after a long time through lengthy proceedings, to be factually correct. I am also a practising lawyer and, therefore, I have seen even in the civil courts and the criminal courts that cases are unduly delayed due to many causes. It maybe due to the lack of judicial appointees or it may also be due to lawyers, who very often unnecessarily ask for further dates, create a confusion and prolong the cases. These are matters that we have to very clearly and conceptually look into. I think we have got a very senior lawyer, a practising lawyer, who is now the Minister of Justice and I hope that there will be some sort of stringent rules brought into the judicial system through which these issues can be curtailed. Sometimes, when a lawyer makes an application either on personal grounds or for other reasons, the opposing lawyer is not in a position to oppose the application on ethics. There are certain ethics that we maintain in our judicial system. But, subject to all that, there can be genuine cases. The obtaining of typed proceedings from courts also take a very long time. Sometimes, it is one day before the trial that we get the proceedings of the case and, that too, after a lot of effort by the instructing attorneys to obtain these documents.

So, you can see that there have been a series of defects in the judicial process that has been taking place not only today but for so many years and this system is now in a very bad state. If you take, for example, the Supreme Court, cases that were heard in the District Court about 20 years ago, are being heard now in the Supreme Court. I just cannot see how we can eradicate this system or bring in a normal system where we can have speedy justice.

If you look at courts in Singapore or the Indian courts or the British courts, there has not been so many lapses or delays as we find in Sri Lanka today. That is the main reason why the Hon. Minister of Justice is trying to get this extension of time for a further period of only two years. Within this period of two years, probably the judicial system will be modified to a great extent. Our judicial system may have to go through a reformation in so many forms where certain amendments can be brought to safeguard the rights and the interests of the accused and also for speedy judgment and justice to the aggrieved person.

Today, we see in our society many abductions and murders taking place. Today, murder has become so common that it is something like a minor offence committed years ago. That is the mode of life in the present society. So, we really have to reform this whole situation. How are we going to reform it? There are people who are under the influence of drugs. I think that is the main cause for offences that are taking place today. The people who are committing these offences are probably unaware of what they are doing because they are under the influence of drugs. When they are under the influence of drugs, they are not in a position to understand what they are doing. Therefore, we have to curtail the smuggling of drugs and also curtail the society from taking them. We also have to curtail the younger generation; the youth of this country; the school children, from taking these drugs. In fact, drugs have got into schools for the sake of making money. This is the situation that we are in today. So, unless some stringent laws of this nature are brought in to safeguard the judicial system of the country, we are going to face a great deal of problems and it will be a tremendous loss to the society as far as justice is concerned.

These are some of the major elements that we have to consider and this is the reason why this extension of period is being sought, which is only for two years. As I mentioned earlier, there will be a supervisory or an appellate body that will supersede this situation of misdoings or misacts by police officers.

So, this is a very important law as far as the Criminal Procedure Code is concerned. It is very important that such laws are brought in to safeguard the rights of the accused, the persons who have been aggrieved. The family of the aggrieved party - whether it is a murder, a robbery or an abduction - has to be looked after, because sometimes cases go on for years. There are so many cases

329 330

in the Northern Province; there are so many cases in the Eastern Province and there are so many cases even in the Western Province, where children are abducted; children suddenly go missing from their homes. There are so many instances where children have suddenly been taken out of their residences and parents are not in a position to find out where their abducted children are. This is the trend in this country. How this is happening in this country, I do not understand. But, I must say that the police officers and the police authorities should stringently look into this matter and a severe penalty imposed, not any sort of lenient judgment. That is another matter to be considered because these are serious offences. Therefore, the accused should not be treated in a lenient way. I mean, to abduct a child or to abduct a person from a household is a very serious offence because you can see the amount of suffering that the entire household will have to go through in such instances.

There is another issue that has to be brought in and looked into very carefully. The penalties that are given by the judges in the appellate courts and also in the original courts of jurisdiction have to be done in such a way without any extraneous influence, because if the justice system of this country fails, the entire fabric of the society fails and that is the end of the society.

Why do we have to go through all this? That is because we do not have a proper judicial system. The Seventeenth Amendment was taken away. The Seventeenth Amendment established - as you all know, it has been mentioned in this House many a time - an independent Police Commission, an independent Public Service Commission and an independent Judicial Service Commission. Today, - not today, but during the last regime - all judges were appointed by the President of the country. If a judge is being appointed by the President of the country, how can proper justice prevail in this country?

Earlier, the judicial system was under the Judicial Service Commission, which was an independent body. The Chairman of the Judicial Service Commission probably would be the Chief Justice or a very senior Supreme Court Judge and two other judges who are competent enough would be appointed to the Commission. They had the power to appoint and transfer judges and look into the affairs of the judiciary. But, today it is quite different. Even the prosecuting officers of the Attorney-Generals Department have been appointed by the President. But, now, under the regime of the present President, we will bring this amendment and bring back the independent Judicial Service Commission, independent Police Commission and the independent Public Service Commission. In that way, I must say, the entire society will be changed.

Today, we are clamouring in this House and people are having agitations against the issues regarding the Central Bank and many other issues. We, within a period of a little more than two months, have brought in a complete reformation of the society. We have brought down the price of petrol; we have brought down the prices of essential commodities, basic utility items and we have brought in a fair judicial system. We are not interfering with the judiciary or with the police. I think His Excellency the President has made a number of comments that he does not want to interfere with the judicial system or with the police investigations. In the same way, the Hon. Prime Minister is also completely keeping himself aloof from these areas. Today, you can make all these fabricated accusations and publications and try to ridicule the Governor of the Central Bank in many ways. He may or may not have caused that sort of offence. But, there has been a Committee appointed. Why do you not wait till the Committee Report is given? Why do you want to jump that and make these unnecessary remarks in the newspapers and in the media? There is no necessity for that when the Hon. Prime Minister has appointed a Committee to inquire into that matter. Those three gentlemen - the members of that Committee - are very competent lawyers and they will ultimately report back to the Hon. Prime Minister of this country and then the Hon. Prime Minister will bring that Report directly to this august Assembly. There is a judicial system that our Hon. Prime Minister is following. He does not come to any conclusion suddenly to say that X is subject to an offence or not, like the earlier regime or even prior to that. I do not want to comment on those matters, but there has to be a proper judicial system; a proper way to adhere to these rules.

Therefore, I respectfully move, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, that this Order under the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act, No. 2 of 2013 be extended for a further period of two years from the 2nd of February 2015.

Thank you.
