( ) (The Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathan) , . , , . . [10.52a.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama - Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade) Hon. Speaker, I am indeed privileged to be a Member of this august Assembly and I would like to thank the Hon. Prime Minister for giving me the opportunity of serving our people.

As for the Budget, I would like to commend the Hon. Minister of Finance for presenting a progressive and a forward-looking Budget that has placed the country on a path of sustainable growth and development. The Governments twin objective of promoting inclusive growth and employment generation on one hand and taking steps to stabilize the economy on the other, have been addressed by the Hon. Minister of Finance. He has done this within the framework of laying a robust

foundation for achieving a shared prosperity and protecting the poor and the vulnerable. The task of the Hon. Minister of Finance was complicated by a legacy of high and unsustainable debt, low-growth in household incomes and an unbalanced growth model which had run out of headroom because it was excessively dependent on expensive foreign commercial borrowings.

Furthermore, cronyism has stifled private enterprises ranging from farmers, fishermen, Micro and Small and Medium Enterprises to the large corporates. This Budget has focused on laying the foundation for an economy which draws on the enterprise and dynamism of our people; an economy that fosters innovation and creativity. This is the only way we can build an economy which flourishes in the context of globalization, which places a very high premium on competitiveness. Our progress has been held back by policy, uncertainty and unpredictability. This was largely due to personnel discretion rather than principle-driving policy making. The widespread corruption, mismanagement and impunity has served to impose a burden on the people which continues to challenge us. It is a legacy which has compromised the health of public finances and has cast an unnecessary heavy debt burden not only on the current population of the country but also on future generations. An inclusive and harmonious society is crucial for achieving social stability which is a pre-requisite for rapid development. The concerted efforts that we are making to promote reconciliation will therefore be important for creating conducive conditions for economic progress. We have ushered in an era of consensual politics. We welcome both sides of this House to join hands with us to develop the country. Building a strong and a resilient economy has to be at the forefront of our priorities in a world characterized by increasing risk and uncertainties. This can only be done by all stakeholders working together in the interest of Sri Lanka incorporate. So, businesses, civil society and the public sector, as well as the Government and Opposition, must come together constructively to transform the future prospects of this country. We welcome everyone to join us on this long overdue journey.

Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Minister of Finance has laid down the key principles on which policy will be based. This will introduce greater stability and predictability. The key principles are stable macroeconomic fundamentals that are crucial for accelerated development of the country. For many years now, the Budget has been the main source of instability in the system. Large budget deficits have pumped excess demand into the economy leading to balance of payments and inflationary problems. This has inevitably put down the pressure on the rupee and upward pressure on interest rates.

Meeting the aspirations of the people while building a broad middle-class will be an overriding objective of our policies. This is the basis for building stable societies.

847 848

The Budget Speech has shown us the way forward in this respect.

Creating one million decent employment opportunities will be the key means through which the objectives of broadening the middle-class will be fulfilled. The private sector will be the locomotive for growth and development. The high priority being attached to improving investment climate reflects this. We recognize that it is the domestic investors who will have to lead the economic revival. Our policies will not disadvantage them.

Hon. Speaker, the majority of our people live in rural areas. The Budget has sought to uplift the rural economy on a sustained basis. Developing an internationally competitive economy requires urbanization to generate the necessary economies of agglomeration. We are putting in place policies and programmes for this to happen in a regionally balanced manner through the development of several urban hubs.

Promoting Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises will be the key to achieving shared prosperity. This is why there is a heavy focus on improving competitiveness of MSMEs so that they can plug into domestic and foreign value chains. With a market of 21 million we have no choice but to rely on export expansion to accelerate growth and development. This will be at the front and centre of our development programme. All successful countries in Asia have taken advantage of the capital markets, technology and know-how that comes with FDIs to boost their export performance. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair. , [ ] . , , [ ] . Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. SELVAM ADAIKKALANATHAN] took the Chair. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, you may continue please. ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, nothing is possible without human resources to support an

internationally competitive economy. This is the rationale for priority we are attaching to education, training and skills development. We also need a healthy population for the well-being of our society. This becomes even more important in the context of our aging society.

Affordable housing is a basic right. Incentives need to be provided for PPPs and house building programmes for low and middle-class families. This is what the Budget has done.

Finally, we cannot get away from the fact that we are a compassionate society. It is fully appropriate therefore that the Budget focusses on taking care of children, empowering women, protecting the senior citizens and supporting the poor and differently-abled. A social safety net will be provided.

Our commitment to price stability as a means of providing relief to the people has again been reinforced in this Budget. These are the principles on which the Budget was formulated. They will anchor our future policy making.

Let me now elaborate on some of the areas covered in the Budget, particularly those relate to my own Ministerial responsibilities. I will take a little time to elucidate how the Budget Speech has translated some of these principles into concrete actions. As I have said before, the Budget Deficit has been the main source of instability in the system. The Finance Minister has carefully balanced the need not to take too much demand out of the system at a time when we are trying to strengthen growth impulses in the economy with the need to embark on a programme of medium- term fiscal consolidation.

By limiting the reduction in overall aggregate demand, he has not squeezed the economy too much at a time when we are trying to stimulate economic activity and there is low growth and sluggish trade in the global economy. However, he has initiated action to achieve better fiscal outcome. Steps have been taken to streamline the tax structure, reduce exemptions and strengthen tax administration. These measures will strengthen the buoyancy of the tax system and improve its revenue collection. In addition, introduction of zero-budgeting will improve expenditure management. The restructuring of State-owned enterprises and professionalization of their management will have a positive impact on Government finances.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, our history of highly politicized mismanagement in the public sector and the lack of fiscal space for static policies leaves us with no option but to count on the private sector as a locomotive for growth and development. The flat-lining of domestic investment and about 22 per cent of GDP has been the most disappointing aspect of the post-conflict narrative.

849 850

2015 24

A key theme of the Budget Speech has been a creation of a better climate as well as direct opportunities for private investment. The opening-up of unused and underutilized State land and the creation of an online land bank have been designed to address a major impediment to private investment.

Tax incentives have been provided to promote investment in lagging regions such as the North and the East, Monaragala and Badulla Districts and so on and for the modernization and expansion of existing facilities and Mixed Developments. The Megapolis Project, the new industrial zones, the development of Hambantota and Trincomalee areas, PPPs for major infrastructure projects and Special Purpose Vehicle for existing ones to mobilize resources to retire debt, are all of major opportunities for private investment.

Other key investment-friendly initiatives relate to tourism, the Colombo International Financial Centre, Capital Market and financial sector development, sale on non-strategic Government assets, abolition of the archaic Exchange Control Act and a series of other legislative amendments which improve the business climate.

We are acutely aware that it will be the domestic investors who will kick-start the new phase of development and particularly employment creation. In this connection, the Hon. Minister of Finance provided support for the construction industry. New antidumping and countervailing duty legislation will create a more level playing field for domestic investors. Measures have also been introduced to strengthen innovation, R and D business start-ups, venture capital and private equity eco systems.

In addition, transaction cost for businesses will be driven down by investments we are making to improve connectivity. Road transportation, railways and inland waterways are all being developed. The private sector must now respond by recalibrating their risk to take advantage of this new era of business-friendly policies.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises are the backbone of the economy. We have recognized that they will play a major role in the creation of one million decent livelihoods.

The Hon. Minister of Finance has identified several thrust sectors. Initiatives, such as the MSME Credit Guarantee Scheme which will be merged into a large SME facility, the "fund or funds" for venture capital with tax incentives, incubators assisting MSMEs and efforts to assist them plug into domestic supply chains will all enhance the prospect of this crucial sector. As I said before, this is crucial for sharing prosperity and building a strong middle-class.

With regard to export expansion, turning round our dismal export performance is arguably our most important

task. A lack of attention to boosting exports in this country of 21 million was arguably the biggest folly in the last ten years.

In 1990, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, our goods exports amounted to US Dollars 2 billion. In 2001, it went up to US Dollars 5 billion and now it is just over US Dollars 11 billion. In the same period, Vietnams exports in 1990 was also US Dollars 2 billion, it went up to US Dollars 15 billion in 2001 and presently it is over US Dollars157 billion. So, you can see the comparison. Similarly in Bangladesh, it was US Dollars 5 billion in 2001 and now, it is US Dollars 33 billion. For the record, the exports of Malaysia and Thailand exceed US Dollars 225 billion. The urgency and importance of this task is reflected in the establishment of the Export Development Council of Ministers under His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister. The establishment of a Primary Industry Council and the creation of agricultural and fisheries zones will promote exports of agriculture, horticulture, fisheries and so on.

Our Ministry is also revamping the EDB and it will come under the new International Trade Agency. We are also working hard to eliminate the EU fisheries ban and to restore the GSP Plus concession within the next six to nine months. A lot of progress has been made in this regard with the assistance of the Hon. Minister Risad Badhiutheen, the Hon. Minister of Justice and the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Work is also going on to sign a framework agreement on the Joint Economic and Technological Co-operation Agreement between India and Sri Lanka. We are working on a timetable for signing the framework agreement by early January, 2016 and complete the negotiations on the full agreement by mid-2016. We will get the views and address the concerns of all interested parties before an agreement is signed and also ensure that the agreement would certainly benefit Sri Lanka. An integral part of the negotiations is the efforts we are making to address some of the non-tariff barriers, which have been a major impediment to the expansion of Sri Lankas exports to India. We hope to reach agreement on an early harvest by the time of signing the framework agreement.

Sir, just for the record, the exports to India from Thailand is US Dollars 5 billion and from Malaysia and Singapore, it is US Dollars 7 billion each and the exports from Sri Lanka to India is less than US Dollars 700 million. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, you have three more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Sir, please give me a little bit more time.

In addition, we are studying the implications of the recently concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership for Sri Lanka with a view to consider that our interests would be served by applying to join this grouping once it comes into being. The new International Trade Agency will give leadership to our efforts in this area. We will draw on the best talent in the private and public sectors to assist us.

With regard to FDIs, it is clearly seen that the FDIs have played a central role in boosting export expansion, which has been the key driver of success in the economies of the East and the South-East Asia. Regardless of size, from China to Singapore, FDIs have been crucial. Our FDI performance has been appalling. Even five years after the end of the conflict, it is still less than US Dollars 1 billion in 2014. Countries in this region have more than three to four times that as a percentage of GDP. It is our objective and our aim to increase the FDIs to US Dollars 5 billion in three years time.

The BOI is also being revamped. It will be located within the new Agency for Development, which will again draw on the best talent from all segments of our economy. We intend to process applications for foreign investments within 45 to 50 days. Sir, the abolition of taxes on leases on lands to foreigners will remove a major impediment to FDIs. These will be made available only to registered investors who will bring in FDIs and provide employment opportunities for our youths. There are opportunities for mega projects in Hambantota and Trincomalee. The Southern Development Authority will lead the efforts to make use of the currently underutilized Port and Airport in Hambantota. A master plan has also been developed for Trincomalee. In addition, the existing and new industrial zones will provide plenty of job opportunities through FDIs, including joint ventures.

Sri Lanka has no presence in the global and regional value chains. In a world of shared production networks, these are the most dynamic components of international trade. We need to leverage FTAs with India and China to make maximum use of trade and the investment nexus. Going forward, we should have Trade Agreements with India, China and other countries in this region. This will give us preferential access to a market of 2.5 billion people. We need to use our new 360 degree foreign policy to attract investments from both the East and the West. We have the potential to become a major shipping and airline hub. The Budget has such/ attached priority to attract global logistical companies.

The IT and the IT-enabled services are the fastest growing export sector. The World Bank has stated that this would become a US Dollars 5 billion export sector by 2020. This year, it should earn about US Dollars 1 billion.

Sir, with regard to human resources, very little will be possible without rapid skilling of our workforce. It is important that we do not let a skill gap become a

development trap. Our wages are too high to compete with countries like Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. At the same time, we do not have the human resources and productivity to compete with the likes of Malaysia and Thailand. This is why the Budget Speech has placed so much emphasis on education, particularly on the Sciences, IT, English and Mathematics, especially in the rural and regional schools, on benchmarking the performance of universities and vocational training and technical education.

Priority is also being attached to making sure that the additional money being allocated to education is well used. We need to improve the quality of education.

Sir, in conclusion, I would like to point out that the country is at a very important point in our history. The future has great potential. This can only be fulfilled if we work together as one nation. Divisions based on party affiliations, ethnicity, religion, caste et cetera have to be set aside. We need to have clarity and consistency in our overall strategy. This has been provided by the Hon. Prime Ministers Economic Policy Statement and the Budget Speech of the Hon. Minister of Finance.

Most important of all, we need effective implementation. We are creating a new architecture to draw upon the best talents in the country. While this architecture will provide leadership, all other stakeholders in Public Sector and business need to pull together to realize the promise of a potentially exciting future. We are determined not to be distracted by petty-minded and inward-looking thinking. The time has come to press on. Sir, I sincerely invite all the Hon. Members of the Opposition to join us in developing our country. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Including the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena. ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) We all owe it to our people.

Thank you. [.. 11.16] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training) ,

. . . [4.54 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for giving me this opportunity. This is my first speech in Parliament during a Budget Debate. I am very happy to say that the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, Minister of Finance, has given us a people-friendly Budget. He has reduced the prices of almost all the essential consumer items. In addition, he has increased the allocations for almost all the required Ministries.

Especially, when I was listening to the Budget Speech, I noticed that more allocations have been made for the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine for the construction of dialysis centres, cancer hospitals, stroke centres and upgrading of hospitals et cetera. A large amount of money has been allocated in this regard. These areas are major health issues in Sri Lanka and we have been facing a lot of problems. I know most of the patients who can afford have been going abroad, but the majority of the people who are unable to afford to go aboard will have to die. So, I think it is a very good idea of the Hon. Minister to allocate so much of funds in this regard. Especially, he has concentrated on certain hospitals which have been neglected. For instance, in my District, Puttalam, we do not have funds for the Puttalam Base Hospital which caters to people covering a vast area. The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie, Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation, knows about it. When I was the Minister of Health in the Provincial Council, I was able to do certain work in the Puttalam Base Hospital which caters to people covering an area over 200Km. But, unfortunately, they were not satisfied with the quality of the work and the Provincial Councils were unable to do that work. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister to take over that hospital under the Central Government and help the large number of people living in the Puttalam District.

As far as the education sector is concerned, I am happy once again that a large amount of money has been allocated because, there is a big shortage of teachers in our country. In the Puttalam Educational Zone, there is a shortage of 2,100 teachers. Every year, when a few hundred of teachers are appointed, another few hundred go away. So, this problem has been going on for a long time. When we go to the Provincial Council, they put the blame on the Central Government. When we come to the Central Government, they say, We have allocated the money; we have sent the funds to the Provincial Council." But either way, they have not been benefited. Therefore, I request the Minister to appoint teachers directly from that particular area as much as possible so that they will be

responsible. I am very happy with the amount that has been allocated for education.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, with regard to the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, I would like to mention as a Member coming from the Puttalam District, where we have about 160Km of seafront, that there are a lot of problems faced by our fisherfolk. I am also very happy to note that for the first time, there is a life insurance cover of Rs. 1 million for the fisherfolk who go for fishing and face accidents. I think this is a very good idea, because when the fishermen go for fishing, the whole family is waiting till they come back. Sometimes, they do not come back at all - it happens in our area. In such situations their families have nothing to do because they have been deprived even of their daily income. So, I think, that is a very good move we have done that for the first time.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it was also mentioned in the Budget Speech that fishery harbours are going to be upgraded. There are many fishery harbours in Chilaw and other areas and Rs.750 million have been allocated for them. We also have a fishery harbour in my Electorate, Kalpitiya, which is a major fishing area. I would also like to request the Hon. Minister of Finance to include the Kalpitiya Fishery Harbour also for the improvement, because it has been neglected for a long time.

Also, I would like to say a few words about the Agro Livestock and Fish Processing Park, where NAQDA would play a major part. NAQDA must be revamped and developed because it is they who assist the fisherfolk and are responsible for the entire fishing industry. But, I am not satisfied with its functions. There are good officers in that institution, but they are not at all financially supported. So, we must revamp that institution.

Then, I come to the prawn farms. The prawn farming industry is a foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka. For the last so many years, we have been making a lot of money through this industry; we have been getting foreign exchange in return. But, during the last few years, there have been a lot of problems in the prawn farms. They have been affected by prawn diseases. Nobody is there to advise them. The worst problem is, the cost of production, which goes up day by day. Also, there are only a few buyers. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please, Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Edward Gunasekara to the Chair? . . ( .. ) (The Hon. J.M. Ananda Kumarasiri) Sir, I propose that the Hon. Edward Gunasekara do now take the Chair.

947 948

( ) (The Hon. Vadivel Suresh) . . Seconded. , . . Question put, and agreed to. , . , , .

Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. EDWARD GUNASEKARA took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you may continue. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Sir, these prawn farms are mismanaged due to lack of fisheries officers. Also, there are only a few buyers. So, the prices are manipulated by them and are very low. Then, the prices of shrimp feed imported is very high. I think the Government and the Ministry must look into this and see that they get a better price for prawns and also the shrimp feed prices are brought down to a lower level.

Agriculturewise, in Puttalam, we have the Economic Centre in Norochcholai, from which so many lorry loads of vegetables are being sent out to the rest of the country daily. But, unfortunately, what happens is, when there are excess stocks, those go to waste and farmers lose. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister to have a cooler system in Norochcholai so that whatever excess stocks produced can be preserved and sent out to the rest of the country later on.

One item that I noticed missing in the Budget Speech is, the salt industry - nothing has been said about the salt industry. But, as you know, the salt industry is a must for Sri Lanka. In the area where I come from, 40 per cent of the total salt consumption of Sri Lanka is manufactured and it is done by private companies. They are supplying 40 per cent of the total consumption of the country. But, very unfortunately, these private salterns are not well looked after. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, all families must consume Iodized salt, because the easiest way for people to consume Iodine is through salt. During the last two years, they had made a survey and found out that only 70 per cent of Sri Lankan families consume Iodine because the private salt producers are unable to manufacture Iodized salt. In Puttalam, we have the

biggest salt pans, which cater to 40 per cent of the total salt consumption. We were not supported by any Government. I can remember, in 1995-1996 period, two salt Iodizing plants were given by the Government, by which we manufacture about 10 to 15 per cent of the total consumption. Therefore, the production has been low. The UNICEF, through the Government, has been helping the salt industry. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister of Industry and Commerce to look into this and provide us with the necessary machinery to produce Iodized salt. We are a member of the ICCIDD, which is there for the prevention of Iodine deficiency disorders in Sri Lanka. So, these are some of the problems faced by the salt manufactures of our area today.

Further, I am very happy to note that money is allocated also for Wayamba development and the relevant Ministry is getting a big amount. They always talk about the North, the South, the West and about everything else; but nobody speaks about Wayamba. This has been going on for years and years. Therefore, I am very happy indeed about money being passed for Wayamba development.

Then, Sir, I come to the issue of displaced people in Puttalam. This issue has been going on for a long time. I know, when my leader, the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, was the Minister of Rehabilitation, he was able to send so many thousands of displaced people back to the North. Today, some speak a lot of things about that. But, unfortunately, after his Ministry has changed, that had been stopped. I mentioned earlier also that 25 years ago, displaced people came in big numbers -over 100,000 - from Mannar and Mullaitivu to Puttalam. We looked after them. After 20 years, some of them have gone back to Mannar and now, people are saying that they are occupying lands of Wilpattu and so on. Sir, I would like to mention that they have gone back to their own lands after 20 years. That is the fact. They have the necessary deeds and everything and they have gone back to their own lands. But now, there are thick jungles in that area. So, now they say that land belongs to the Government. Further, we must not forget that still there are 20,000 people living in Puttalam. They are neither in Puttalam nor in Mannar. Now, after 20 years, the families have doubled. Therefore, I request the Government to look into this and solve the problems of those people from Mannar living in Puttalam. They must be properly sent back with all the facilities put in place so that they also can live peacefully like us. Sir, for the sake of opposing, the Opposition - there is no Opposition here - need not oppose.

Now, look at the tourist industry. I am very happy to note that they are going to improve the standard of the Puttalam Airport along with other airports. Kalpitiya has become a real tourist attraction. Now, the Budget of the present Government has proposed to allow foreigners to come in and invest freely so that more money would

949 950

2015 24

come in. I am very happy to note that our Finance Minister, along with the Advisers of the President and the Hon. Prime Minister, has given us a very good Budget.

Sir, I have another matter regarding irrigation. My area, Puttalam, is below the level of Anamaduwa, which has 600 minor tanks, major water schemes and three rivers. All the excess water from these tanks and rivers run across Puttalam before going into the sea. Sir, every year, we face this problem. I have been agitating for this for a long period because when it starts raining in September and October, they do not allow the water in the major tanks to flow out; they preserve the water. Normally, we have heavy rains in December. But before December, once the tanks get filled, all of a sudden, all the sluice gates are opened and our area goes under water. You would not believe, last week in the Puttalam City, there were 2,800 people marooned. For six days, there was water in their houses. So, I request the Government to take some measures to find a solution to this problem. The Kala-Oya also flows through Puttalam. The Mahaweli water comes into Kala-Oya and the excess water flows through Puttalam. Then, we have Mee-Oya; we have Deduru-Oya. Excess water from all these Oyas flow through Puttalam.

In fact, I had a meeting with the Hon. Minister yesterday and requested him to manipulate the problem in such a way that we do not get affected. Canals can be dug, but it had been neglected. As you know, since 1989, it is only now that I have come to Parliament as a Representative of Puttalam and am able to raise these matters. These are the facts. Nobody speaks about Wayamba; nobody speaks about the people of the North-Western Province. We also need all the facilities. We would like to live peacefully like others. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister to look into these matters and help us.

Once again, I thank you for giving me this opportunity.

Thank you. [5.11p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) Mr. Presiding Member, let me at the outset thank you for giving me 10 minutes of time to express my views on the Budget 2016. Ten minutes is a lot of time for a Member of the UPFA who sits in the Opposition; in fact, it is a luxury. Although, I still cannot fathom how 51 Members of the Opposition get much a lesser period of time than another group of Members who also claim to represent the Opposition. It is beyond me. I suppose it is much the same as the Budget presented for 2016. It is beyond all of us.

But, Sir, I must congratulate the Hon. Minister of Finance, even in his absence, for the lengthy presentation

concluded. I think it took over four hours. Although it might have bored a few Members - I noticed a Facebook update after proceeding home, which showed the Hon. Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister sound asleep with some other distinguished Members of the Cabinet - perhaps a true reflection of how this country is being governed.

To the matter at hand, Sir - Budget 2016, I think, can be interpreted in different angles. Some call it a "Capitalist Budget". Some view it as a Budget which offers no relief for the common man. Or, it could be viewed as a Budget which tries very short-term based revenue collection measures deviating from its medium-term goals. Whatever the manner one views this Budget, it could be seen as an ill-prepared Budget, perhaps a bit like the Finance Minister's speech. It is primarily stuck between an attempt to deliver on the promises which the Government made to its people and an attempt to carry out major austerity measures in order to support a flagging economy which this Government brought upon itself by promising undeliverable promises to the masses.

In another aspect, it can be viewed as a total policy planning failure, particularly when considering timing mismatches. I think an Hon. Member explained in this House the mismatch of timing of concepts like trying to reduce the number of vehicles on the road by introducing a monorail where the benefits could only be reaped in the medium term. Other policies are also complete follies. Let me give a few examples. I, particularly, like to raise the matter of allowing importation of tea leaves for blending purposes. I think this is a mistake. I am aware that Sri Lankan tea is more expensive than that of its counterparts. However, if our tea exporters are to blend cheap foreign tea with the superior local tea, then, why not encourage them to set up shops overseas and open our capital account in the true liberalization passion of this Government? But, instead, the Government has decided to take this adventurous policy by further risking price reductions and the livelihood of 400,000 tea smallholders which account for more than 70 per cent of the tea production in this country.

Nothing had been done to protect the rubber plantations and this double impact in districts like Kegalle has brought the rural economy to its knees. The withdrawal of the fertilizer subsidy will no doubt aggravate the situation. It can be seen that no measures have been taken by the Hon. Finance Minister in bringing any sort of relief to the people who are burdened with an increase in cost of living. Sir, the other day, I stepped outside in order to order an omelet from a night boutique and I was dismayed to find out that there were no chillies in it. The explanation which the shop owner provided me was even more astonishing. He simply said, ", 1,200." Other than not providing any relief to the masses, this Budget hints at some sinister motives of the Government which, I believe, is principally aimed at enriching its friends and family members.

The proposed merger of the ETF and the EPF rings immediate alarm bells. When the Central Bank has been successful in providing returns of more than two to three per cent over the inflation rate, historically, we must question as to why you set aside this practice and in all probability let this Fund be managed by a private fund management company for an annual management fee of about one per cent. And we all know how these things end up - with somebodys son-in-law or a close relative make a killing. The Hon. Minister must be reminded that these monies are not his to play with. There are the hard-earned saving of the working class of this country and must be protected at all costs. The creation of the Fund of funds could be viewed as an attempt not only to suck the interest components of the ETF and the EPF but also the Fund itself. I mean, when this Government has the highest fiduciary duty to safeguard the monies of the ETF and the EPF by investing those monies in the safest investment instruments, who in their right minds will propose for the use of the ETF and the EPF to promote venture capitalism - a very high risk strategy indeed.

Sir, if the Hon. Finance Minister thinks that the people of this country will sit and watch as he lets his capitalist friends plunder the ETF and the EPF, he has got another thing coming. He had wisely reversed the vehicle emission test fee of Rs. 5000 applied for motorcycles and three-wheelers as there was a public outcry. A Facebook campaign started calling for all those who oppose this policy to tie a black band. But in the case of the ETF and the EPF, I fear Sir, the people will not only take to Facebook, but take to the streets if it comes to light the perceived ulterior motives of this Government.

Sir, we also need to look at the rationale for introducing insurance for natural disasters. Now what the Hon. Minister proposes is what is referred to in insurance terms as a "CAT loss cover" or "catastrophes cover". Now for me, this again is an ill-advised policy. What should be done is to encourage the insurance companies to encourage its customers to simply take fire insurance for their premises and to include a natural disaster cover in the policies. By introducing a blanket cover, it would in fact discourage the customers from purchasing its own cover. But I do agree that the purchase of such a blanket cover for Rs. 300 million would enable somebody high-up to collect a fat reinsurance commission.

Another matter of concern is the granting of licences to 50 licensees for the importation of gold. Now, not only will this policy distort the level playing field but you can smell money a million miles away. Sea Street, here I come now seems to be the new calling of the Government. But in all honesty, if the Hon. Finance Minister says taxing gold is superfluous, then why restrict the market to only 50 players? Why not give everybody an equal chance?

You see Sir, this Budget is full of bad public policy and the ten minutes that I have been granted is not fully sufficient to even remotely peruse through the Budget Proposals. And, this Revolutionary Budget has imposed a tax on electric cars, a practice not carried out anywhere in the world. The word around town is a high net worth individual has imported 5,000 such cars to the country recently. So perhaps the Hon. Finance Minister will see it fit and a wiser policy to reduce the taxes on electric cars after this fleet of vehicles have been sold.

Also it must be noted there is a contradiction with the Budget Proposals and the Medium-term Policy Speech the Hon. Prime Minister presented on the 5th of this month. For instance, whereas the Prime Minister targets a higher percentage of this Government's revenue through direct taxes, this Budget does exactly the opposite, releasing even a higher burden on the masses.

So let me utilize the remaining minutes I have been given in presenting one or two macro-level deficiencies in the Budget presented. First and foremost, a revenue expectation of 38 per cent from the projected figures of 2015 seems overly ambitious, specially considering the fact that during the last ten years revenue growth has not exceeded 25 per cent. The 200 per cent increase in the non-tax revenue is also questionable. Since we all know that Government-owned entities cannot increase their profits 200 per cent year on year, the only reasonable presumption is that the Government will engage in a scheme of privatization to enrich its cronies. The increase in Government expenditure of 19.2 per cent, the highest seen in the last decade, will result in more pressure on maintaining a Budget deficit of below 6 per cent.

The analysts have already predict that this is not an achievable figure and will result in the reduction of Capital Expenditure and an increase of the budget deficit to beyond 8 per cent. But, there are also some encouraging initiatives which the Government has taken. By increasing the bandwidth of PAYE tax to Rs. 2.4 million, the real earning capacity of the private sector will increase thus encouraging the unemployed to seek jobs in the private sector. The attempt of trying to simplify the tax structure also needs to be appreciated.

So, let me conclude by saying that, all in all, I do agree with the statement of the Hon. Finance Minister that this indeed is a Revolutionary Budget. It will not only tear down the fabric of this society and it will also fail in its attempts to either deliver the promises to its people nor to carry out the stringent austerity measures that the IMF and other international agencies are calling upon. The Budget will definitely make a few people rich and the Hon. Finance Minister should have quoted more accurately the adaptation of John F. Kennedys statement, which is going around the circle these days, as ask not what Ravi can do for you, but what you can do for Ravi and you will be rewarded. So, in all sincerity, let me hope

the Hon. Finance Minister will have better luck in managing the economy of this country than he did in managing Sathosa, as we all know where that led to.

Thank you.

"We have achieved political freedom, it is true, but political freedom is only a means to greater ends. Political freedom to be worthwhile, to have any meaning to the masses of this country, must lead to economic and social freedom as well. It must lead to the establishment of a new order of society, suitable to the genius and culture of our people, based on principles of social justice, giving equal opportunities to all in all avenues of life. The Government must bend its energies to this end. It must address itself to this task with a vigour that should be infectious, with a courage and hope in the future that will run through the entire fibre of the nation."
