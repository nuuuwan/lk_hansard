Mr. Speaker, I think we have worked very hard over the last month. Initially, we tried to keep to your deadline, but I gather that we got an extension. I am specially upset because yesterday we were told that you had asked for a Report and the Chairman had decided that he would present, at least, an Interim Report today, because I think it is very important - given the urgent determination of the Government to delay this Report - that we should actually at least know what is happening. So, I would second the proposal of the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara and request the Chairman of the COPE to, at least, give a Progress Report today and, if possible, issue a draft Interim Report, which would very easily satisfy some of the requests. This morning, we had a very fruitful discussion and a much longer draft that had been given to us was looked into very carefully by several Members. In fact, the COPE had removed some of the areas that seemed contentious and I think the draft that was given to us late last night, is something that this House would benefit from, pending a final Report.

So, I would suggest that, in keeping with the commitment that you made to the House and given the urgency where we had, - what can only be described as a dilatory Committee whose Report was not tabled for a month - I think the evidence is very clear that there is an effort to prevent this incident being examined suitably by Parliament. I would, therefore, urge immediate action.

Thank you.

, . . copy . : : , PRICE HIKE IN ESSENTIAL FOOD ITEMS: STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara asked a Question under Standing Order No. 23(2), last Tuesday regarding the increased price of rice at Lak Sathosa during the last two weeks.

Lak Sathosa has not increased the price of rice during the last two weeks. Prices of rice sold at Lak Sathosa from January, 2015, are as follows:

Raw rice (White) - 1 kilo - Rs. 50; Nadu - 1 kilo - Rs. 50; Ponni Samba - 1 kilo - Rs. 60.

The cost prices of imported rice by Sathosa are as follows: Raw rice (White) - 1 kilo - Rs. 61.38; Nadu - 1 kilo - Rs. 65.07; Ponni Samba- 1 kilo - Rs. 75.81. The loss incurred by Lak Sathosa by selling at reduced prices are as follows:

Raw rice (White) - Rs. 11.38 per kilo; Nadu - Rs. 18.07 per kilo; Ponni Samba - Rs. 15.81 per kilo.

At a meeting of the Cabinet Subcommittee on Food Security held on 23rd April, 2015, the prices of rice have been increased in the following manner. In order to minimize the cost of living, consumer prices of rice have been subsidized as:

Raw rice (White) - Rs. 60 per kilo; Nadu - Rs. 60 per kilo; Ponni Samba - Rs. 75 per kilo.

Generally, prices of food items fluctuate from time to time due to seasonal changes, shortfall of supply, natural disasters et cetera. These slight price changes cannot be restrained and they move up and down depending on demand and supply. It has been observed that prices of certain commodities such as dhal, potatoes et cetera have come down now. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Hon. Minister, I request you that we go together to a Lak Sathosa retail outlet and examine the prices. -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon.
