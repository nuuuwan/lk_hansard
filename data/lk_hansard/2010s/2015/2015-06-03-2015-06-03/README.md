II . APPOINTMENT OF MR. ARJUNA MAHENDRAN AS GOVERNOR OF CENTRAL BANK ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Speaker, I ask this question from the Hon. Prime Minister. It is a matter for great regret that no effective action has been taken either by the Government or by this House for more than three months to deal with the consequences of one of the most colossal frauds perpetrated on the people and the economy of our country.

Quite apart from the conduct of the Governor of the Central Bank and those going to incredible lengths to cover this up, grave doubts have now arisen with regard to the legality of the appointment of Mr. Arjuna Mahendran and his capability to perform the functions of the office of the Governor of the Central Bank lawfully.

The Governor of the Central Bank is, by law, entrusted with powers and responsibilities, which have a vital bearing on the sound performance of the economy of Sri Lanka. He is also an ex officio Chairman of the Monetary Board. His functions include deciding and changing the par value of the Rupee, determining monetary policy, taking action to preserve monetary stability, ensuring international stability of the Rupee and determining the rates at which foreign exchange is bought and sold by the Central Bank.

The Governor, as the principal representative of the Central Bank and the Monetary Board, has the authority to represent the Central Bank and the Board in all its relations with other persons, including the Government and any body of persons, corporate or incorporate, whether public or private, domestic, foreign or international; and to represent the Central Bank and the Board in any legal proceedings.

Having regard to the crucial nature of his role in the management and direction of Sri Lankas monetary policy, it is only natural that the Governor should be compulsorily required by law to take an oath or to make

377 378

2015 03

an affirmation of allegiance to uphold and protect the Constitution of Sri Lanka. In terms of Article 165(1) and 170, read with Article 157A(7) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, the Governor of the Central Bank is required to take oath or make affirmation under the Fourth and Seventh Schedules of the Constitution.

Article 165(1), moreover, has the clear effect of precluding the Governor from embarking on the duties of his office unless and until he has complied with these mandatory constitutional provisions. In view of the extreme urgency of the matter and the paramount need to ensure that the crucial functions of the Governor of the Central Bank, including placing his signature on the countrys currency notes, are carried out in accordance with the Constitution and the laws of Sri Lanka, I ask the Hon. Prime Minister, in terms of Standing Order No. 23 (2), to respond urgently to the following questions:

(1) At the time of being appointed the Governor of the Central Bank, was Mr. Arjuna Mahendran a citizen of the Republic of Sri Lanka?

(2) Is he a citizen of Sri Lanka at present?

(3) Is he a citizen of any other country?

(4) Has he taken/made an oath/affirmation to any other country, renouncing loyalty to the Republic of Sri Lanka?

(5) Has he taken/made the oath/affirmation required by the laws of Sri Lanka before embarking upon the duties of the Office of Governor?

(6) Did he have the capacity to take/make the required oath/affirmation in view of any conflicting oath/affirmation to any other country?

(7) Does the Hon. Prime Minister agree that there are ample grounds for invoking Section 16 (c) of the Monetary Law which declares that the Governor can be removed if he has done any act or thing which, in the opinion of the President, is manifestly opposed to the objects and interests of the Central Bank and the Constitution of Sri Lanka?

Thank you. ( , , , ) ( - , , , ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Prime Minister, Minister of Policy Planning, Economic Affairs, Child, Youth and Cultural Affairs) Hon. Speaker, this is the eighth time in the last two months that I have answered a Question on this same issue. Generally, it is the practice in this House that you raise a Question once and do not repeat it. I am not raising a point of Order on that this time, but we will do so next

time, because I thought this is an opportunity for me to explain exhaustively to this House, the background and the legal position in regard to the Governor of the Central Bank, the oath taken by public officers as well as the background for the appointment of Mr. Arjuna Mahendran. So, I hope the House will bear with me until I explain this.
