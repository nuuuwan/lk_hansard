GRANT OF A GENERAL PARDON TO TAMIL POLITICAL PRISONERS: STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Mr. Speaker, I rise to respond to the Question raised by the Hon. Douglas Devananda yesterday on the Floor of this House. The Question the Hon. Member raised relates mainly to issues of land release, detainees under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, alleged secret detention centres, the tragic suicide of a student from Kopai last week and implications of these issues to achieving reconciliation.

Hon.Speaker, while not in any way attempting to provide excuses for any delays, I think one must acknowledge that we, the new Government, has achieved much, perhaps not enough, since the 08th of January when President Maithripala Sirisena was elected to power. With the Parliamentary Elections held in August and the National Unity Government formed thereafter, our

21 22

journey has only begun. Nevertheless, I agree, for the people who have suffered the agony of conflict and waited for a long time for justice, or for those who await information regarding the fate of their loved ones and for those who have been languishing in detention, every day, every hour, every minute matters. We are conscious and seized of this fact. The Government, under the leadership of His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, is determined to surmount all challenges and obstacles to ensure that justice is done and to ensure reconciliation, non-recurrence and a durable peace.

The Government is also committed to finding a solution to the issue of those detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. In fact, subsequent to discussions the Hon. Prime Minister had with the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and others, 39 detainees out of 48 have already been released on bail and according to the information I have, 48 detainees have been convicted and they are serving their sentences. One hundred and eighteen persons are in remand custody with their cases proceeding in court, cases are being filed against three persons and one is to be rehabilitated.

In fact, the Hon. Member of Parliament has pointed out quite correctly that in 1971 and in 1989, following the insurrections in the South, and in 1987, following the Indo-Lanka Accord, prisoners held under the PTA and other emergency laws, combatants and those persons accused, charged and/ or convicted under these laws were granted a general amnesty. - [Interruption.] Yes, you are one of them. In fact, I also believe this is something which we have to seriously consider and I think the President and the Hon. Prime Minister are looking into ways and means of granting an amnesty to the others as well.

The loss of yet another young life in connection with the issue of detainees is very tragic. I agree with the Hon. Member of Parliament that this is the time that all political parties and all citizens - irrespective of race, religion and language - should unite to find solutions to problems, no matter how frustrating such processes might be. There is a well-known saying: The more you sweat in peace, the less you bleed in war. So, it is time that we all unite despite our ideological differences to act with responsibility towards our citizens and work together to find solutions to the problems that have kept this nation divided for far too long since Independence.

The Hon. Member of Parliament has also inquired about secret detention centres. As we have mentioned before, there are no secret detention centres in operation in this country under this Government. In fact, the Hon. Prime Minister has already told the world categorically

several times that there are no such centres, but if anyone has any information of such centres, please give it to us and we will ensure that there is an independent investigation into those.

Because, if we have the information, the Government will take upon itself the task of ensuring that such facilities are examined and action is taken under the due processes of the law. The Government will not tolerate anyone holding another in detention under any circumstances outside the purview of the law of this land.

Sir, as you are aware, this Government carried out a decision taken by the former government in January 2013 to invite the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances to visit Sri Lanka earlier last month. In a letter dated 21st January, 2013, the former Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has conveyed to the Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Ministry of External Affairs at that time - that the Ministry of Defence has no objection to an invitation being extended to the Working Group to visit Sri Lanka and that the timing of the extension of the invitation should be decided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The Working Group visited Sri Lanka, in fact, after 16 years, from the 09th to the 18th of November, this year. They also met with Parliamentarians in this very House. They were allowed to visit the Navy Base in Trincomalee. This House is aware of the allegations made against our armed force personnel; this House is aware of the allegations about secret detention camps being maintained, which were made against our country during the previous regime. Even if we scream at the top of our voices saying that there are no secret detention centres in existence, such allegations will not go away until we prove that there are no such places in existence and that is why, when I met the Working Group as they arrived in Sri Lanka, I told them openly, Our Government and our country has nothing to hide any more. You are most welcome to go to any part of the country and see for yourselves the changes we have made.

In fact, we all know the sacrifices made by our security force personnel throughout the long years of conflict. In fact, do they deserve to be hounded by allegations of this nature for the rest of their days? Is that what they deserve as a reward for the many sacrifices they have made to enable us today to build a future for our nation on the foundation of the very peace they have created for us? That is why we believe that it is the duty of our Government to take steps to ensure that the cloud that hangs over their head is lifted once and for all. We owe it to them to clear their name. The way this can be done is not by standing in a street corner and shouting defensive slogans as some of the Hon. Members of

23 24

[ ]

2015 03

Parliament claim; it is not by sitting in protest in front of the Office of the UN or embassies of foreign countries and antagonizing our partners but by adopting sensible meaningful constructive approaches to this problem so that we lay these allegations to rest. It is by investigating into allegations through the due process of the law that we can do so. This is what legal systems and investigative and judicial processes exist for, so that they may be used for the innocent to be proven innocent and anyone guilty of any excesses to be brought to justice. This is the way responsible democratic nations that abide by the rule of law deal with such issues.

Despite the misinformation that some of the Members of this House may try to propagate, the visit to the Navy Base by the members of the Working Group proved to those both within the country and outside the country who alleged that there are still secret detention centres in operation in this site that there are no such detention centres in existence any more in the Navy Base in Trincomalee.

The Working Group actually expressed gratitude to the Commander of the Navy and the Director of the CID for providing access to the Navy Base and to the cells. This kind of cooperation is what will recreate trust in the eye of the public and in the eye of the families of victims as well as the international community that the Sri Lankan security forces are responsible and professional.

The Government takes the preliminary observations of the Working Group very seriously. The site referred to by the Working Group Members who were accompanied on their visit to the site by CID officers was in fact sealed by the CID in April this year on the basis of a court order on an ongoing inquiry. These investigations by the CID will proceed. The Government upholds that all official places of detention must be only those that are gazetted and the official procedures for detention must be followed at all times. If there had been deviations from what is authorized and approved, such incidents will be investigated and unlike before, there will not be a culture of impunity in this country.

The Working Group has also brought to our attention instances of alleged harassment perceived as carried out by police officers including some instances of sexual harassment and violence against mothers or wives of disappeared persons. At times, this is alleged to have been in exchange of promised information on their relatives cases. I take this opportunity to emphasize that the Government does not condone such harassment and will not tolerate any form of harassment against anyone including the families of missing persons under any circumstances. We are determined to take action against anyone who is found to have engaged in such harassment. In fact, I personally asked the Working Committee Members to let us know of the details of these errant

police officers who seem to have harassed some people who had the courage to speak to them. The Government is in the process of formulating guidelines to be observed by the police and security forces personnel in their interactions with the families of missing persons.

As this House is aware, since 2009, Sir, 47,300 acres of land have been released in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. This includes 19,143 acres in Jaffna, 9,704 acres in Kilinochchi, 2,888 acres in Mullaitivu, 2,804 acres in Ampara and 1,649 acres in Mannar. In March this year, 1,000 acres were released in Valikamam North. In Sampur, 818 acres and 237 acres in Trincomalee have been released.

A Cabinet Paper is also being currently prepared by the Ministry of Resettlement for the release of 6,000 acres of land in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. I know that a lot of people say that even the release of land is not happening fast enough. This is not due to a lack of intent or a lack of will. The Government is determined to hand over land back to the people and to resettle the internally-displaced. We are determined to ensure that only the land that is absolutely essential for clear and specific military requirements and for national installation remain under the charge of the security forces and the large plots of land which are not required for such purposes are released.

As I said earlier, Sir, there are many challenges that the Government has to overcome in bringing about the changes that are envisaged. I explained the causes for such delays which include having to deal with bureaucratic bottlenecks, attitudes and perceptions. In fact, the other week, I must confess, a respected Tamil activist and poet, Mr. Jayapalan, was refused a visa to travel to Sri Lanka to participate in a literary event to be held in Jaffna with other Sinhalese academics like Gamini Wiyangoda and Sannasgala. He was refused on the basis that he was deported in 2013 when he came to Sri Lanka to visit his mothers grave. In fact, it was done by one of our officials in the Chennai Mission and that shows that even in our Missions, Mr. Speaker, there are still some officials with the old mindset who seem to have forgotten that there is now a new Government with a new vision and a new direction.

We acknowledge the sufferings of the people, we recognize the mistakes of the past and we realize the need for this nation to introspect. We are aware of the weaknesses of our institutions. We will face these challenges. We will not seek to take cover by distorting concepts and principles such as sovereignty for narrow political gain. Instead, we will always strive to work towards the welfare of all our citizens. We remain open to honest and frank exchange of views and to dialogue with all concerned both within and outside the country. We have the confidence to face challenges and also seek help

25 26

where we require assistance from the international community for the benefit of our people.

Those who are skeptical about Sri Lankas ability to transform as a nation and address problems are many. They claim that there can never be justice in Sri Lanka and that there can never be recognition of all communities as equals. I say to such skeptics, Do not judge us by the broken promises, experiences and the U-turns of the past. Let us design, define and create our future by our hopes and aspirations and not be held back by the fears and prejudices of the past. Let us not be afraid to dream. Let us not be afraid to engage in meaningful dialogue aimed at finding solutions to problems as opposed to pointing fingers at each other heaping blame and scoring political points at the expense of the future generations. We are committed and we require the patient understanding of all right-minded citizens of Sri Lanka in this endeavour. The political parties and the politicians alone cannot achieve this. We need all the citizens of this country to work towards reconciliation. We need all to join hands with understanding to walk hand-in-hand in this journey to transform our country into a united, progressive, peaceful, and prosperous nation.

The Government of His Excellency President, Maithripala Sirisena and the Hon. Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe has the political will and the courage of their convictions to ensure that we take the country forward, breaking the barriers of ignorance, fear, prejudice and hate and create a new Sri Lanka.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you, Hon. Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) Hon. Speaker,- ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Hon. Member, we have to be mindful of the time because we have already exceeded the time limit -[Interruption.]. I must say that it is not normally allowed. At the Committee Stage, you can raise that. Otherwise, we will be breaking with traditions. Now, we will go to the next Item.

We are discussing the Votes of His Excellency the President, the Office of the Prime Minister, Judges of the Superior Courts, the Office of the Cabinet of Ministers and of several Commissions which have in terms of the Nineteenth Amendment, been appointed in recent times.

We are extremely happy that we are in the position to debate the Votes on these Commissions which today have been given a complete measure of independence to be able to perform their functions fearlessly without being in any way subservient to the Executive. I think that was achieved, Sir, as a result of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. The passage of the Nineteenth Amendment was eventually due to the very strenuous and indefatigable efforts of the President, His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister, Hon. Ranil Wickremesingthe. It was due to the efforts of the President, the Prime Minister and persons who thought correctly that the system had to be changed, that in the interests of the country and that it was vital to bring about certain changes to ensure that these Commissions will be appointed through a Constitutional Council that would function independently and that the persons who were appointed would be persons of integrity, calibre and possessed the necessary qualities to be able to serve in these Commissions in the best interests of the country.

I am happy that under your guidance, Mr. Chairman, you have indeed exercised, in my view, a great deal of alacrity in ensuring that these Commissions have been appointed without delay all these Commissions have been appointed. I have the good fortune of being a Member of the Constitutional Council in my capacity as the Leader of the Opposition. We have cooperated and made appointments purely in the interests of the country without being guided by any other factor.

Sir, I must also at this juncture record my deep appreciation of the manner in which you have guided us to achieve this very important task. We will wait and see how they will perform. I have not the slightest doubt that the performance will be something which the country, the people of this country will appreciate because the persons appointed are those who would, without fear or favour, serve the people of this country and not certain individuals, not certain high-powered persons in the Executive. They would be concerned with the best interests of the people of this country and would serve in the best interests of the people.

Having said that, Sir, since we are discussing the Votes of the President and the Hon. Prime Minister, I want to raise the question of the persons in custody - detainees. I was extremely happy to listen to the Statement of the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs. It was a very progressive and a very positive Statement. Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, we expect that you will be in a position to fulfill the various matters that you have outlined in the course of that Statement. You can rest

assured that within the framework of a united, undivided Sri Lanka, we will make our maximum possible contribution towards the bringing about of permanent peace, reconciliation, goodwill and harmony amongst all our peoples because the peoples have lived together in this country for, indeed, a long period of time and through the greater part of history in this country, we have lived as a united people. Unfortunately, as a result of the identities of people not being adequately recognized and they not being accorded adequate self-respect and dignity in this country, there have been certain conflicts. It has assumed a violent form, but all conflicts have to come to an end at some point of time. I think it is the duty of all of us to ensure that all conflicts come to an end and we are on that path now. We are not on the path of promoting the conflict. If there are any Hon. Members in this House, my Good Friends, who think that they can survive politically by promoting conflicts, I would appeal to them to abandon that path and return to the path where we all can resolve our conflicts and live together as a united nation, where we will serve the best interests of our country and in the best interests of all the people who live in this country, irrespective of which ethnicity they belong to.

Having said that, Sir, I want to deal specifically with this question of the persons who continue to be in custody because this has become a very serious issue, where there is a feeling amongst people that not enough is being done in this regard, that this is the first issue which is being handled, which is being tackled by the Government and that the Government should perform more expeditiously in bringing this to an end. Now, there are persons who have been convicted. That is one category. There are persons against whom cases are pending. That is the second category. Then, there are persons who have not been charged and that is the third category. We have discussed this matter with His Excellency the President and with the Hon. Prime Minister. General agreement that this matter should be brought to an early end is prevalent in the course of all our discussions. We have also discussed this matter with the Hon. Minister of Justice and other ministerial Colleagues. These persons have been in custody for long periods of time. In fact, if they had been convicted and sentenced, they may have been released from prison by now. Some of them have been in custody for such long periods of time - 10, 15 or even more than 15 years. Some of them have been in custody for such long periods of time - 10, 15 or even more than 15 years. Some others may have been in custody for a shorter period of time. But, the fact of the matter is that in many of these cases, if they had been tried, if they had been convicted and if they had been sentenced, they would have by now been released and they would have gone home. I know, Sir, that there is a hue and cry being raised in this country by some persons who are opposed to the release of persons in custody and who allege that their release would not be in the interests of national

security. I think this is a rather unrealistic and exaggerated fear which is being sought to be spread by some people in this country purely in order to bring about instability and to ensure that the Government is not able to proceed on its path which is to bring about reconciliation, goodwill, harmony, peaceful resolution of conflicts and enable this country to prosper and progress. Persons who are not interested in the achievement of this agenda and who are opposed to this agenda for their own selfish reasons think that they must somehow be an impediment and prevent these happenings. I would strongly urge the Government not to be influenced by such endeavours and to gather the necessary courage to be able to deal with this question in a very practical way.

All extremists in this country have been marginalized, both in the North and in the South. At the Parliamentary Election held last, persons who advocated extreme positions in the Northern Province have been totally marginalized. They have been totally sidelined; not one of them was returned to Parliament having taken up an extreme position and I want to say on the Floor of this House now that if anyone in the future attempts to take an extreme position, whatever his position maybe now, that person or such persons would be marginalized and sidelined. They will have no future in this country. Sir, I would like to say on the Floor of this House that if anyone in the North or the East thinks that by adopting extremist positions they can enhance their status politically, they are making a very sad mistake and they should abandon that position because the people of the country, the people of the North and the East have gone through such immense sufferings that they do not want that repeated any longer. They want to live in peace. They want honourable solutions to their problems.

As I said in Parliament a couple of days ago, the Tamil people are a very resilient and courageous people who will not succumb, but they are not a desperate people. They are not people who will opt to go along the path of extremism. They want to live peacefully with self-respect and dignity in this country. So, I think, Sir, even in the South, extremist elements have been marginalized. They have been cast aside by the people. We know that certain extremist organizations which were trying to spread communal venom in this country attempted to enter this Parliament at the last Parliamentary Election, but all of them have been marginalized. So, we should bear this in mind and I think that the Government should not hesitate; the Government should be courageous. The Government should do what needs to be done and deal with the situation pertaining to these persons in custody.

There have been such releases made in the past. In 1971, I remember the JVP insurrection, a large number of people were released and no one complained about it. They were young men who faced certain grievances. They had taken to violence. In fact, I have defended several of them in courts at that point of time. In 1988-89,

31 32

2015 03

consequent to the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord, there was a similar position when amnesty was granted and several people were released. The persons who were released at these points of time were also persons who tried to bring down the legitimate government of the day. Despite that they were released. They had taken to violence and used weapons. They attacked police stations, but they were released. So, I do not know why the Government should be reluctant now or should hesitate now or should delay now? During the time of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, thousands of people were released at the end of the war, after rehabilitation. They were persons who had engaged with the LTTE, fought with the LTTE against the Government. But several thousands of them were rehabilitated and they were released. They were engaged in an armed struggle. The offences committed by the persons in custody are not any more serious than the offences committed by these people whom I have referred to.

I want to refer, Sir, to the basis on which these people are being charged. These people are today being charged under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and I would like to read out what is contained in the Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the 16th of September, 2015 in regard to this matter. It states, I quote:

The Government has been slow to clarify the number and identity of detainees still held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and emergency regulations. As of writing, the Government is believed to have acknowledged 258 remaining detainees: 60 of whom have not been charged; 54 who have been convicted in the past; the remaining cases pending. Reports have continued to emerge about the existence of secret and unacknowledged places of detention, which require urgent investigation.

The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs referred to that in the course of his Statement this morning. So, in this Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, he refers to persons being held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and Emergency Regulations. Then there was a statement made, Sir, by the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the 30th of September where he says, I quote:

The Government has yet to clarify the number and identity of detainees still held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and emergency regulations. Reports have continued to suggest the existence of secret and unacknowledged places of detention. These require urgent investigation. According to local civil society sources, from January to August this year, 19 people were arrested under the PTA. 12 of them remain in detention and 14 cases of torture have been reported to us by credible sources since January 2015. I welcome the Governments commitment to review and repeal the PTA, which has long provided a legal context facilitating arbitrary detention, unfair trials and torture.

So, there has been a commitment made by the Government that they propose to repeal the PTA under which these persons have been held in custody. What does the Resolution that has been adopted by the UN Human Rights Council on the 1st of October say?

The Resolution states, Sir, I quote:

Welcomes the Government of Sri Lankas commitment to review the Public Security Ordinance Act and review and repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and replace it with anti-terrorism legislation in line with contemporary international best practices;

So, you have acknowledged it in the UN that the Prevention of Terrorism Act is a draconian law; it is a law which is unacceptable by international standards and that you will repeal that law. All those persons who are being held in custody, whatever position they maybe in, are persons who are being held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. When you yourself have made a commitment through this Resolution which you co-sponsored that you are going to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act because it is an obnoxious, draconian law, how can you - I ask you - continue to hold persons in custody? You have accepted that this law is not in conformity with acceptable, proper, legal principles and in the face of the commitment that you have made in the Resolution that has been adopted by the UN Human Rights Council which you co-sponsored, I think it is obligatory; it is imperative that this matter be not delayed any longer and that all these persons are released.

I want to say it very clearly Sir, that this is not a legal issue. This is a political issue. The decision that has to be taken, has to be a political decision. We cannot permit legal nitpicking and allow this matter to hang on forever or for a long period of time. I think what is required is a political decision. My Friends in the JVP - Senior Leaders of the JVP have made a demand that these people be released. I want to commend you for that. I want to thank you for that. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, who was the person who primarily conducted this war, has requested that these people be released. So, even Members of the JVP and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka take the view that these persons must be released. Surely they cannot act in this manner if it would bring any harm to this country.

So, in the context of the war having ended, in the context of the LTTE having been decimated, in the context of no LTTE as an organization functioning in the country at present, in the context of the people having repeatedly demonstrated through their electoral verdicts that they want to live within an undivided, united Sri Lanka with self-respect and dignity as equal citizens with a legitimate constitutional recognition of their legitimate aspirations - in this background - I do not think there can be any justification whatever, Sir, for these persons to be looked at differently and to continue to be kept in custody. I would therefore, earnestly request, Sir, that this matter be addressed early.

Thus far, as far as I am aware, 39 persons have been released on bail. Twenty persons have been recommended for rehabilitation against whom cases are pending. Two of these persons, have already been

33 34

released. Several cases are pending against those recommended for rehabilitation. They have been recommended for rehabilitation in one case, bearing one number. But there are several cases pending against these people which have different numbers. Unless they are recommended for rehabilitation in respect of all those cases pending against them under the different numbers, even after completing rehabilitation in one case in view of the fact that there are other cases pending against them, they will continue to be in custody. That matter needs to be addressed. All cases must be included in the rehabilitation procedures. There are, in all, 217 cases of persons in custody and only 59 cases have been dealt with thus far and there are yet 158 cases to be dealt with. So, I would urge His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister to look into this matter without delay. I think the persons who have been convicted must be pardoned and in view of your own Resolution where you say that the Prevention of Terrorism Act will be repealed because it is obnoxious; it is draconian and when you make an acknowledgement which accepts that without any reservation, how can you continue to hold in custody persons under that law? This is the question I want to pose. How can you take to court and charge persons under this law which you say is obnoxious, draconian and which, therefore, you are going to repeal? So, my submission is, Sir, that this matter should not be delayed any longer and these persons should be released early and I would earnestly request the Government to act expeditiously in regard to this matter.

I thank you, Sir. [.. 10.45] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - Prime Minister, Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) , . . . , . , . .

Sir, when I was the Minister of Food Security, I visited Jaffna and met the Chief Minister and other colleagues in the North at that time. As the Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife also I visited there twice. On the 17th of December, 2015, I am going to submit the Development Plan for the Northern Province to show you as to how the people are going to be benefited under the Votes of my Ministry. I would finish the Development Plan for the Eastern Province also and submit it to you.

Other Ministers should also visit these areas. That is for your understanding. I was surprised to know that there are about 32 per cent of Sinhalese students studying in the University of Jaffna. They learn in harmony. Many voters in Colombo are Tamil people. That is the harmony that we have to create and build up. I am happy to say that.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yes, during your time and my time as well. We were Whips on both Sides and we continued the tradition of Parliament. It is the tradition of Parliament to place the essential Reports before the Hon. Members in this House. It has not been done. The Hon. Prime Minister now comes in. I am very thankful for your presence, Hon. Prime Miniser, because I would like to bring this to your notice too. The Reports are not here. Normally, all the Reports are tabled when we take up a Ministry, a Department or a Commission. This is the first time it has happened. I have been in Parliament for the last 30 years and you, for the last 35 years, and it has never happened before, Hon. Prime Minister.

We would like to know from the Chair whether this is going to be the tradition for the next 14 days. I would like to know that. I think the Hon. Prime Minister, I and all of us, would agree that they should place the Reports before the Hon. Members. There is no other way. . , Auditor-General ? , National Education Commission ? , Bribery Commission ? . . ; this is our chance.

I normally do not want to raise issues like this, but I am forced to do that today. We have, under the 19th Amendment, Commissions and all the Commissions have been appointed. We appreciate that. We, the Opposition, supported the 19th Amendment subject to certain amendments. . 15 . ? Police Commission . I do not want to mention even the name. Now, how can a person who has been punished by the Supreme Court serve on the Police Commission? Of course, there were differences. On differences, Mr. Lionel Fernando said, I do not want to accept. That is a different matter. We respect Mr.Lionel Fernando, all of us, whether from that Side or this Side. But, here, the complaint is very clear and the copy of the Supreme Court Order has been submitted. So it does not prevent dealing with the person irrespective of who he is. If the person has been found guilty by the Supreme Court and you say, " Constitutional Council has appointed and therefore, we cannot change. The Police Commission is sitting", what do you expect from the Police Commission? I appeal to the Hon. Prime Minister to look into this matter because 15 of us have submitted all the details. We did not want to publicize this issue. As Members of Parliament we submitted- ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, you have five more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I will finish in five minutes.

It is not fair. Former Presidents who have retired and gone have no authority - they can make statements - to make statements on appointments or decisions that the Government is taking. It is not fair. I have to say that.

I agree with the Hon. Leader of the House. But, the problem is, if these things go on at this rate, we do not know what will happen to the Budget in the end. You are ready to listen to us and we are taking up issues for the people and in the end, perhaps, you will be amending the Budget so much and we do not know what will happen. So, let us know; let us sit down and discuss this. Let the President and the Prime Minister and the Opposition - we are the real Opposition, because we have 50 Members now. Remember that.
