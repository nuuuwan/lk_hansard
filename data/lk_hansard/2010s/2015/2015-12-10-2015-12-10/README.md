16 . 84 . category . . () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Yes, Hon. Minister. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne)Hon. Member, the problem is not that there are no A/Level-qualified students. All these years, the qualification required was, three passes in A/Level Bio-science stream. We do not have enough A/Level qualified Bio-science students. Now, we have decided to go for three passes in A/Level in any stream. We will give them six months' training before they start the course and then go ahead. Thereby, we will be able to fill those vacancies. There was a gap of three years without any training of nurses or paramedics. That is the problem. () . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) That is the real fact, Sir. Earlier, in the Northern Province we did not have nursing officers. Then we had to reduce the required qualification to O/Level plus A/L Arts stream. Ultimately, I would like to tell you that at one examination in the Jaffna Nursing College, the first grade was taken by an Arts student and not by a Bio-science student. This is an important area. We have to recruit students for para-medical subjects with O/Level plus minimum of three passes at the A/Level in any stream. That is important. If you expect a credit pass in Chemistry or a credit pass in Biology, it will not be possible to recruit people into this field, because our students can enter even the Medical Faculties in the universities with three ordinary passes. The guidelines are like that. That is how we have to think about recruitments in the future. This is important. This is for your consideration, Sir.

1295 1296

, , . () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) We have appointed three Psychiatrists; one in Jaffna, one in Mannar and one in Vauniya. There are several medical officers with experience in mental health. They have already been appointed. () . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) Thank you, Sir.

At the same time, please consider recruiting child psychiatrists. I do not know whether that type of medical officers are available. That is a special category. That need is also there. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) There is a problem with regard to the Consultants. There are only 1,577 Consultants available but there are vacancies for 1,387. The PGIM has very strict procedures. I got down the PGIM and told them that if they do not produce necessary people - when 132 people sit the exam, they pass only about three or four people. I said, "Either the MBBS qualification is not correct or your exams are not correct. You have to produce more people. Otherwise, I will have a PGIM for every Medical Faculty." Now they have decided to expand. The results will come in about two or three years' time. That was the whole problem. () . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) Thank you, Sir.

, . My request is to have a separate section for private pharmacists. We can train pharmacists and assistant pharmacists with low qualifications and engage them in the private pharmacies with the recommendation of Sri Lanka Medical Council.

In the Northern Province, there are a lot of vacancies in the Administrative Grade. That is a great difficulty faced by the people in our region. You need to fill all those vacancies. Then only we can settle that problem. Only five people attached to the Administrative Grade are working in the Northern Province.

, 3 , 6 , - Registrar - . . , . , () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Hon. Member, earlier the Northern and the Eastern Provinces were actually identified as difficult areas. Now, I would like to say that there are no difficult areas. There are worse areas like Medawachchiya and Padaviya in other Provinces. What I say is, that demarcation has to be removed now. All doctors who go there, after one year, want to get transfers. I said, No, you have to serve there for four years. You cannot ask for transfers until you serve at least for two years. So, hereafter you will have permanent doctors there. () . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) Your view is correct. Now, all the roads are carpeted. So, we can travel there within a few hours time.

, . , . , - Some mortuaries are functioning without freezers and in most of the hospitals there are no mortuaries. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Hon. Member, we are now working very closely with your Provincial Minister. I have told him to send me a report with all the deficiencies year by year. He has sent me all the details and it is my duty to fulfil them. So, can you please discuss all these requirements with him and see whether he has included all those things in his report? Otherwise, send me what is not included there.

() . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) I will collect those details and submit to you straightaway.

, .

Sir, there are more than 1,000 medical students studying at SAITM and there is a court order given to provide clinical training for SAITM students at State hospitals. That is a court order, but that has not been implemented up to now. I think the new Government has to take action on that. There are different opinions expressed in that regard. Sir, I am also a doctor and I am also against opportunities being given to students who have passed just one or two subjects. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) The Hon. (Dr.) Nalinda Jayathissa mentioned several such incidents and they have now been removed by the SAITM.

Now, there is a judgment by the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court, I think, has asked the Attorney-General as to why their judgment had not been implemented and called for explanation to be given on the 15th of this month. Yesterday, my officials were summoned by the AG. The AG was cautioned about two or three cases raised that day by the Supreme Court for not sending observations and for the delays. It is a court order. If it is not honoured it is considered contempt of court. They have given this ruling about one year back and they have asked to settle this matter by providing clinical training. I accept the fact that nothing has been done by our Ministry. But, anyway, it should be done in accordance with the law. So my officials are discussing with the Attorney-General and they will submit the report to the Supreme Court on the 15th of this month. () . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) Thank you. I am taking this-[Interruption.] () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Nalinda Jayathissa) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman)Yes, Hon. (Dr.) Nalinda Jayathissa.

() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Nalinda Jayathissa) What is the judgment? () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) This time they have asked, why this was not done and why clinical training has not been given and have asked us to inform on the 15th as to how to we can give clinical training. So, I asked my Legal Officer also as to what the actual position of the judges was. He said that they want clinical training to be given to those students at State hospitals. Anyway, my officials are discussing with the Attorney-General. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) , . () . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) 15 ? ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) 20 . () . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) 25 . ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman). 20 . , ! ! () . ( ( ) . ) (The Hon. (Dr.) S. Sivamohan) There is a small matter to be raised. Our students are studying in medical colleges abroad. In foreign countries, our students are allowed to get clinical practices at State hospitals. They allow our students to practice Community Medicine. They give their mortuaries for the study of Forensic Medicine in those foreign countries. All those countries give all the facilities to our Sri Lankan students. So, why are we reluctant to give Government hospitals for clinical training to our students? Why are we reluctant to allow them to study Community Medicine? Community medicine is a subject that they can study only under the MOHs. Then, we have to allow them to get some training under them. There would not be any disadvantage to others.

1299 1300

At the same time, they have to do their Forensic Medicine studies in the mortuaries of Government hospitals, because only Government hospitals can perform post-mortems. Private hospitals cannot do post-mortems. Private hospitals cannot handle subjects like Legal Medicine.

Therefore, my request is, please provide State hospitals for all the clinical practices of that private medical college. There is only one private medical college. You give them the necessary facilities. After that, if you want, you can give the same examination papers to all the students in the Colombo Medical Faculty and the SAITM. If they pass that examination, you can appoint them. Then, there would not be any problem.

I think with regard to this issue, the Sri Lanka Medical Council also has to consider certain matters because in their Report, they have not given any suggestions to address this situation. They have just said that this private medical college cannot be accepted. But, they have to make some suggestions in their Report with regard to in what type of hospitals these particular clinical practices should be conducted for the students and so on.

That is all I have to say on this matter. Thank you very much. [.. 11.30] ... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne - Minister of Labour and Trade Unions Relations) , 2016 , . . ,

We are now left with only 15 months more.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Hon. Member, as regards the Collective Agreement between the trade unions and the management of the plantations, it is a matter for them to come to some understanding and sign the Collective Agreement. Since they did not do that within the stipulated time frame, I initiated a discussion and paved way for them to sign the Agreement. But, they have failed to sign it yet. Nevertheless, I have summoned them again. At least, by next week, I hope that they will agree to sign the Collective Agreement. If there is any lapse of time as a result of this Collective Agreement not being signed, I hope a solution will have to be evolved after consulting the stakeholders.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, even though we praise the health facilities that are provided by the Karapitiya

1307 1308

Teaching Hospital, the main problem at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital is the overcrowdedness. We have seen that most of the wards are overcrowded now. So, the management and the staff of the Hospital have taken a decision to construct a ten-storeyed building for that Hospital. We hope that the Hon. Minister will provide funds for that, which is already approved by the Department of National Planning. This is not a problem faced by the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital alone. We have seen most of the wards are overcrowded in all the other teaching hospitals including the Colombo National Hospital and also the Kandy Teaching Hospital.

So, on a long-term basis, we believe that the Sri Lankan health system needs a referral system. We have seen most patients do bypass the peripheral units, the base hospitals and the other hospitals and they directly come to the teaching hospitals and general hospitals seeking treatment for minor ailments including cough and cold, simple cut injuries, urinary tract infections et cetera. So, on a long-term basis, we need to develop a referral system where we need to develop the patients database. We hope that the officials of the Ministry will take relevant measures to standardize the patients database so that patients could be referred from the peripheral units to the general hospitals.

To do that, we need to have Standard Operating Procedures. We know some of the Standard Operating Procedures are in place. But these are not followed at the hospital level. If we can convince the patients that the treatments that are available for different disease conditions at different hospitals are the same, then, we will be able to retain some of the patients at peripheral hospital levels instead of them going directly to the main treatment centres in the district or the province.

So, at a time when we talk about the non-communicable diseases which have reached epidemic proportions, we can easily lay down treatment criteria for conditions like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, strokes, cardiovascular disorders, et cetera. We know that some of these guidelines are already laid down but they are not followed and we know in most of the European countries like in the United Kingdom, the NICE guidelines are available. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has laid down criteria for management of more than 150 clinical conditions and they have Standard Operating Procedures for more than 300 different procedures and also for different surgical skills.

So, we can gather some knowledge from the European countries, also from Australia and New Zealand and we can standardize treatment at the hospital level. So, if the patients get to know that they receive the same treatment in the peripheral hospital, in the general hospital and also in the district hospital, irrespective of the health institute

that they walk into, they would be convinced to go to such institutions. I think that is a very important aspect that we need to think of. So, I request the Hon. Minister to go ahead and implement such criteria at least for treatment of main or selected diseases .

This is very important, because as much as we talk about the non-communicable diseases, Sri Lanka is also having one of the fastest aging populations in the world. So, the aging population and related issues need to be addressed more vigorously. We know the patients suffer from muscle and bone related conditions like arthritis and also osteoporosis. Also very importantly, nowadays an increasing number of people suffer from mental illnesses. These patients with mental health issues go unnoticed. Either they do not come to the hospital or they do not consider themselves as having such condition. Even if they go to the hospital, they go undiagnosed. Also because of the social stigma attached to such conditions, patients do not continue their treatment. I think we need to have more psychiatrists in our hospitals. We are made to understand that we have only about 40 Consultant Psychiatrists in Sri Lanka now and we need more than 75 Consultant Psychiatrists as per the current requirement. So, we hope that the Ministry will take necessary measures to train more Psychiatrists in the Sri Lankan health sector so that more patients would be diagnosed and they would be convinced to take treatment on a long-term basis.

I think, the important factor here is that we need to go for the basics to ensure that most of the conditions - the non-communicable diseases and the mental health conditions and the like - that could be prevented should be prevented rather than treating them. So, to do that, I think, we will have to start sending information and educate individuals, families and the community at large. We can start this from the preschool level. I heard that the Hon. Minister was talking about this. It is better to start sending that information to our students at the preschool level, primary school level and also secondary school level to ensure that students are aware of the non-communicable diseases and other health hazards that occur more frequently amongst our population.

Government. I meet all the Provincial Ministers every three months and I have requested them to send in all their proposals. I am allocating money. We have allocated Rs. 500 million to Negombo Hospital though it belongs to the Provincial Council. You spoke about the Batticaloa Hospital. I went and opened the Cancer Section in the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital. I went and laid the foundation stone for the Trauma Unit and we have given money for another multi-storey complex for other specialties also. So, we are doing our best to the North and the East. Today what we spend for the Western Province and the Northern Province is the same. ( ) (The Hon. Seeniththamby Yoheswaran) , ! . . . . .

[4.19 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Presiding Member, last week I stated in the House, I quote column 1720 of Hansard dated 01st December, 2015:

The current national policies are inadequate to carry out much-needed transition in the North-East and to implement the important programmes included in this Budget. National programmes and policies are designed on the basis of national parameters. The people of the North-East are in a conflict-emerging society. It has its own legacies, problems and needs. When you design the national policies, I could see no change in the frame of mind of the politicians of the South when it comes to accommodating the grievances of the Tamil people. In fact, there is hardly any change in the policy framework or conducive driving concepts in this Budget that reflect the challenges that must be addressed in the North-East.

My good Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, Minister of Health, who is always a positive thinker, is here. I always like his positive attitude. Hon. Minister, in 1983, when the Jaffna Teaching Hospital was a General Hospital, the approved cadre was 406 nurses. Then, it became a Teaching Hospital in 1985. But to date the cadre has not been revised. I got the details from the Director of that Hospital. The hospital management has mentioned that they are in need of 1,567 nurses, medical officers and other technical staff. I can give you all the details. I have got the papers in hand and I can provide it to you. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) What is the number of nursing officers that is required at the Jaffna Hospital? . ( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) According to the proposed cadre the number of nursing officers that is required is 1,567. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) How many nurses are there? . ( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) They said, after 1983, the cadre which was 406, has not been increased. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Why not? There are 64 consultants; 220 medical officers; 392 nurses; 24 MLTs; 28 pharmacists and 14 radiographers.

1391 1392

. ( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) No. I am talking about the nurses only. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) There are 392 nurses. - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) But, we need more than one thousand nurses. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) It is like that everywhere. There are 400 nurses waiting for transfers from the Colombo National Hospital. But we cannot do anything because there are no nurses. For three years, nurses were not recruited because of the qualification problem. When I was appointed I recruited students to the nursing schools. But they will pass out only at the end of 2017. There is a big dearth of nurses and MLTs because of the qualification problem. So, how can I produce them in months? - [Interruption.] Why not? We have recruited 1,800 students for nursing. - [Interruption.] We have recruited for training. But we have to train them for two years. How can we just supply nurses like that? If you ask for buildings I can give it to you, but not the nurses and doctors. They should be trained. What can I do when the nurses and the paramedical officers were not recruited because of the qualification problem? So, now I have opened up the entrance exam for applicants who got through A/L in any subject. Earlier it was restricted only to the Science subjects. So, for that you have to go to the Treasury; you have to go to the Department of Management Services and you have to go to the Public Service Commission to get to approvals. For the last three years there was no training. . ( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Minister, I am trying to point out what happened in the past. You have been here only for three months. So, you are going to improve it. - [Interruption.] () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) So, you can see this problem is everywhere, not only in Jaffna. . ( . ) (The Hon.E.

( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) It was sent by the welfare society six months ago. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Just because somebody has asked to upgrade it, you cannot do it. First, we have to supervise the place. Then

we have to negotiate with the Management Services Department and the Public Service Commission about appointing people. You cannot do it in a month or two.

The other thing is, you mentioned that there are vacancies. I do not know who has given you particulars of vacancies in the Teaching Hospital. . ( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) This is not about the Teaching Hospital. I am talking about rural- () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) What I have mentioned is the available staff, not the cadre, in the Teaching Hospital. I do not know who has given you this information. I checked with my officials. This is the staff available at present as per the records, it is not the cadre. . ( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) It is the proposed cadre given by the Director of the Hospital. The letter is here. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) No, it cannot be. . ( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) It is the proposed one. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) It is the same Director who had supplied this information to the Ministry.

About the blood banks, I myself opened two new blood banks, one in Mullaitivu and another in Kilinochchi. Now, there are blood banks in the Jaffna Teaching Hospital, Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi - all brand new blood banks. . ( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) This blood bank I am talking of - () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Earlier you said that there is no blood bank available in some area. So, you can get the services from the other places.

. ( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) I was talking about the Tellippallai Hospital because that is where the proposed Cancer Hospital will be set up. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) The National Hospital provides blood services to all the other surrounding hospitals. You do not have blood banks everywhere. Other than the National Hospital, there is a blood bank at the Colokmbo South Teaching Hospital, Kalubowila. . ( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) They have started one and there is only one doctor there. That is why they say another doctor is required. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) And the other thing is, you talked about making people permanent. All the qualified people in the Teaching Hospital I made permanent. Tellippallai is under your own Provincial Health Minister, from your own Party. He can make them permanent. I have no powers. . ( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) We have requested. I have been there. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) They do not do that, but I have done it. In the Teaching Hospital, over 100 staff I made permanent with one instruction. Why do you not ask him to follow me and make them permanent? . ( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) As the Minister, ask him about the difficulties and help overcome the problems. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) No, no. He has no difficulty. He can do that. He can recruit people. It is easier for him than for us. You can do anything with your Provincial Public Service Commission. For us it is more difficult. All Provincial Councils appoint their own people. I have no powers, actually. But I will give all the money to the Provincial Council. Whatever money he wants, I will provide. I have told this to Dr. P. Sathyalingam.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have one more minute. . ( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) The other issue, Hon. Minister, is the status of that Hospital. It is still a Base Hospital, but the facilities are there. It has to be upgraded either to a District Hospital or a Provincial General Hospital. Then the facilities can be increased. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) All doctor vacancies will be filled from the post-intern list. I have given appointments to all interns. Very soon we will be appointing the post-interns. From the post-intern list, I will fill all the vacancies.

About nurses, we have appointed 75 nurses. We have a very few nurses. From the referred batch, we have allocated 75 for the North and the East. Only 100 nurses have passed out from the referred batch. There will not be any nurses passing out till 2017. All volunteer people in the Jaffna Hospital were made permanent. . ( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) But there is a problem. I have been intervening in the matter. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have to conclude now. . ( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) Please give me one minute. There is another thing that I want to ask, regarding the Ashraff Memorial Hospital in the East. This Hospital also should be upgraded to a District Hospital, or a Provincial General Hospital. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne) Ask your Regional Director of Health Services in charge of the district to recommend. They know the procedure. Just because some organization asks, we cannot upgrade hospitals. Even if they ask, we send the request back to them to get a report. . ( . ) (The Hon.E. Saravanapavan) Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie. You have five minutes. [5.00 p.m.] ... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation) Mr. Presiding Member, let me open my speech offering my heartiest congratulations to the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine who was awarded the most prestigious World No Tobacco Day - 2015 Award by the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. He had been honoured as his illustrious predecessor His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena for the services he had rendered for the development of the health services when he was the Minister of Health. And, what a coincidence that this award was presented to Dr. Rajitha Senaratne by President Maithripala Sirisena himself at a glittering ceremony held on the 7th of December, 2015.

Health of a nation, no doubt everyone would accept, depends on the improvement of the health services. In this regard, I am happy to note that the Finance Minister has given sufficient attention to improve the health service of the country, inasmuch attention he has paid to education. Everyone would welcome the provision of 1,000 kidney dialysis machines at the cost of Rs. 6,500 million. It is a welcome move to construct a hospital specialized in kidney disease management in Minneriya for which a sum of Rs. 2,000 million has been allocated in this Budget. The increase of kidney patients throughout the Island is alarming. Patients awaiting dialysis in a queue invariably die off. Today, a single dialysis treatment costs more than Rs. 10,000 in a private hospital. Patients getting dialysis done in Government hospitals have do it every other week. While appreciating establishment of 1,000 units, I would suggest that you increase it by another 1,000 units, if possible.

Another area of concern is the high rate of increase of cancer disease. The Minister has earmarked Nallur, Kandy and Matara for the construction of three new cancer hospitals. Eastern Province has been overlooked and I would suggest that a cancer hospital be established in Batticaloa too. The Government is committed to provide free health services to the citizens through hospitals, since we consider ours a welfare State. But it is sad to say that the Government hospitals insist on the poor patients to buy some of the medicine that they prescribe. Now, this situation has to be changed and action should be taken to provide medicines to the poor free of charge by the Government hospitals.

It was during my time as Minister of Health that the General Hospital was upgraded to a National Hospital. But, today, the National Hospital is woefully overcrowded. This is the case even at the paying wards. I believe that the Colombo South Hospital should be geared to take in more patients. A new six-storey building has been completed at this Hospital sometimes ago, but surprisingly, the wards are still not functioning. I would urge the Minister to pay immediate attention to this problem and put the wards into operation thereby providing relief for thousands of patients who flock this Hospital daily. This would, to a great extent, ease the congestion at the National Hospital. Two floors of the said building can be transformed into paying wards. This would facilitate the people who could afford to pay, thereby reducing the congestion prevailing at the paying wards in the National Hospital.

Another hospital that should receive the attention of the Minister is the Colombo-Central Hospital at Maligawatta, Colombo built by the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa to cater to a large number of poor patients in Maligawatta, Dematagoda, Aluthkade, Grandpass, Maradana and other surrounding areas. When we were young, we had two fully fledged nursing homes, Kaleels Nursing Home at Maradana and Sulaiman's Nursing Home at Grandpass. They were providing very good health services to the poor and the middle class charging a minimum payment. But, today, there are highly advanced hospitals all over Colombo. These private hospitals charge exorbitant amounts which the ordinary citizens could not simply able to bear. For a stay of three to four days, they charge more than Rs. 150,000 from a patient. The Minister must step in to introduce proper regulations in order to reduce these exorbitant amounts charged by the private hospitals.

In the field of Indigenous Medicine, Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani are the traditional healings. Over the years, there have been representations made even through Parliament to develop particularly the Unani system of medicine. I remember the four Motions moved in this House by the Hon. Sir Razik Fareed, the Hon. M.E.H. Mohamed Ali of Mutur, the Hon. (Dr.) M.A.M. Jalaldeen and the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. They had occasion to point out that valuable books on Unani, which imparted proper knowledge to the students on this important system of medicine, were missing from the Ayurvedic College. I request the Hon. Minister to go into this matter and ensure that the books and other literature are imported so that the Unani system can flourish in this country.

Another useful medicinal system, namely, the Homeopathy system should also be developed. Homeopathy treatment is received even by leaders of the world including Queen Elizabeth and her Royal family.

1407 1408

Mr. Presiding Member, in concluding, I would wish to pay a tribute to the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne for his dedication, perseverance and hard work in order to make "Health the Wealth of the Nation". Also, I wish to thank his staff, from the Director-General to the Secretary, everybody, who are doing a good job of work. I appreciate them and wish them all good luck!

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Vadevel Suresh. You have nine minutes.

The Hon. Minister, (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, referred to the Ayurveda Medical Service Minute towards the end of his speech this morning, while elaborating the measures that he is initiating to improve the indigenous medical system in this country. The Ayurveda Act, No. 31 of 1961 as well as the Ayurveda Medical Service Minute should be amended to meet the present trends.

I request that a National Policy for Indigenous Medical System be introduced. I understand that even the qualified ayurvedic medical practitioners' bills are not considered for Agrahara insurance scheme and institutions such as the Sri Lanka Ports Authority do not accept these medical practitioners bills for payment. The Registrar of Department of Motor Vehicles also do not accept ayurvedic medical practitioners' certification. All these should be rectified.

Late Hon. (Dr.) Badi-ud-din Mahmud during his tenure as the Minister of Education granted university status to the College of Indigenous Medicine which was established in 1929, bringing it under the University of Colombo for the first time in the Sri Lankan history. We remember this act with gratitude.

The term Ayurveda includes Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha medicine too for practical purposes. There are quite a number of Unani medical practitioners pass out from the Institute of Indigenous Medicine in the University of Colombo. Unani medicines were imported only once from Hamdard (Waqf) Laboratory, New Delhi by the Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation in 2013. We have to continue to import effective Unani medicines since raw materials are not available in this country to manufacture quality Unani drugs.

Sir, there are some important matters I want to raise. In order to ensure availability of medical officers in hospitals, especially in the PMCUs, a one-man station, we must develop a system. That is very important. In the Eastern Province, we have experienced that. We have a PMCU, a one-man station, which sometimes operates partly or is closed completely because of the non-availability of a Medical Officer. No Medical Officer comes forward to work in such units. Sometimes, we receive complaints from the public that there are no Medical Officers in the hospital and even if they come, they are available only for one or two hours.
