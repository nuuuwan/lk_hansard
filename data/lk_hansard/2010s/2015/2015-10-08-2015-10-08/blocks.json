I find that these are the areas in which Sri Lanka has now agreed that participation of Commonwealth and foreign personnel will be permitted in this special court. That Resolution was also made consequent to the OISL Report, which very specifically made a very heavy indictment on the trustworthiness and the credibility of the judicial processes in this country.

Even with provisions where confession obtained under duress after torture - as in this particular case - it was not sufficient to ensure a conviction. It took 15 long years to be acquitted and all those years this lady, who is a mother of three children, along with her husband was in prison. The husband is still in prison facing charges. The Hon. Minister of Law and Order and Prison Reforms is here, and I have been informed that after her release the husband has now been moved to a maximum security prison in Welikada quite unnecessarily, when all this time he has been in the Magazine Prison.

    "text": "Little things like this will go a long way in regaining the credibility of your institutions, in regaining the trust of the victim community and this perhaps is a good opportunity when we are discussing mutual assistance with the world community and today, that too with a country like China, whose legal environment is perhaps very different to ours. Yet we are moving forward cooperating with the Commonwealth and other countries and facing questions of accountability and I urge the Government there too, to keep your promises not only in letter, but also in spirit and whatever processes that are instituted, that are put in place, must necessarily have the confidence and the trust of the victims, more than anybody else. Therefore, I urge this House, the Ministers concerned and the Government in general to act in that direction.",

Sir, if you read that paragraph, you would find that getting assistance could not in any way be construed as conceding to establish hybrid courts in Sri Lanka. I would also like to remind this House that if His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena did not win the Election on the 08th of January, Sri Lanka would have been further isolated from the international community. I have been to Geneva on one such occasion. On every occasion, we were troubleshooting and trying to win new friends as we were continuously losing our friends in the international community because we were not addressing to the core-issues in relation to human rights and other issues which we are obliged to fulfil in terms of international norms and laws.",

We have a judicial system which we can be proud of, but when you look at history, you would find that on numerous occasions, there had been setbacks especially with the impeachment of the former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake. I also supported the Impeachment Motion. But His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena was bold enough to rectify the wrongdoing and reinstate the Chief Justice. According to our Standing Orders, Sir, we are expected to vote as a quasi-judicial body. But did we vote as a quasi-judicial body? We voted on a political basis. Therefore, it has taken away the very purpose. I think, if we are to maintain the independence of the judiciary, we need to change our Standing Orders to keep in line with our international obligations.",

If we isolate ourselves, we cannot co-exist. Today, we are in a different era. Most of our goods and services are sent to the West.

In terms of the Harare Declaration, the \"Central Authority\" is defined as \"either the Attorney-General or the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice\". There are certain countries like Canada and Myanmar, where the Attorney-General himself is the Minister of Justice. In such countries, the \"Central Authority\" is the Attorney-General. In other countries, it has been interpreted as the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice. Since we are a party to the Harare Declaration and a member country of the Commonwealth, when we enacted this Bill as far back in 2002, they had followed the same procedure. In relation to China and all other countries which are not members of the Commonwealth, we have followed this system and so far, there has not been any issue with regard to the independence and the impartiality of the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice on any matter relating to this area. , .",
