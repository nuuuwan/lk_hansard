He is the Minister-in-charge of the Central Bank. We are not asking for an immediate reply. If that was the case, we would not have done this. But, all of us have the right - especially more than 21 Members of Parliament - to put this on the Table. I think goodwill is called for, Hon. Prime Minister. We are not asking that you should give an answer today, but, please allow this matter to be placed on the Table and you can give an answer -[Interruption.]

Hon. Speaker, we can also give a chance to the Hon. Prime Minister to give the answer to the whole country as this goes over television. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . . . , " , " . , . [ ] , . . [ ] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . .

, 2015 25 1920/27 , . . . Question proposed. [2.20 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Deputy Speaker, this Order is being brought in to Parliament for the reason that China is not a Commonwealth country and consequently, the provisions of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, No. 25 of 2002 could be made applicable only on the Minister making an Order, which Order the Minister has made in the Gazette Notification referred to in this Order.

I do not know, Sir, what the criminal activities are, which are going to be inquired into in China - a non-Commonwealth country - under the provisions of this Act and this Order. But, I want to use this opportunity to refer to certain matters pertaining to other countries, even Commonwealth countries, when I feel that the Government activities, if I might say so, have not been adequate or have been wanting.

453 454

It is believed, Sir, that during the tenure of the former Government, many persons who committed grave crimes in this country were able to find their exit from this country without difficulty. It would also appear that departure of some of these persons from this country was in fact facilitated by the Government. Some of these criminals that were here, are living in comfort in some Western countries, which are Commonwealth countries, to which the provisions of this Act would be applicable.

I remember, Sir, my Colleague, the late Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham, was gunned down during Christmas mass in Batticaloa. In fact, I met him before he left and advised him not to go to Batticaloa. But, he wanted to attend Christmas mass in Batticaloa. He went to Batticaloa and was gunned down. The name of the person who gunned him down was given to the former Government. It was given to very high personages in Government and they were aware of that person. But that person was not taken into custody and sometime later, that man was able to leave this country and now he is living abroad.

There are several such criminals who have been able to flee this country and what action is being taken by your Government to bring these offenders to book? Good governance must also mean that the horrible consequences of bad governance in the past are remedied by necessary action on the part of this Government. So, I would think that this is a matter in regard to which the Hon. Minister must give his mind and he must consider the question of taking action against such persons.

There is another matter that I want to refer to. While such people are able to get away and while we have had persons who have committed grave crimes in this Parliament, even in Cabinet positions; young men picked up for trivial offences - who were in custody at the time the war came to an end - continue to be in custody almost seven years after the war has come to an end. Some of them are being charged. I cannot understand why all these persons have been kept in custody. In fact, this is a matter that has become a matter of concern even to the international community; the matter has been talked about in the international community.

I believe that there is some reference to this matter even in the Resolution and in the Report that was submitted on the basis of an inquiry conducted by the Commissioner for Human Rights at the Human Rights Council. I want to ask the Hon. Minister, why these young persons were taken into custody for trivial matters? Please, do not look at it legally and be legalistic. Look at it in a practical sense. It is high time that this is brought to an end and these persons are released and reintegrated with society and become a part of normal society. I think this is a matter in regard to which the Hon. Minister

should pay his attention to. I know he has been spoken to; I know the matter is under consideration, but it is a matter of deep disappointment to us that no action has been taken to enable these young persons to be released. I would appeal with the Hon. Minister not merely to take appropriate action in regard to criminals who have fled this country, but also to take appropriate action to release these young persons who have been held in custody - it is not a large number but several young persons - in my respectful submission, without adequate justification, given all the circumstances over too longer period of time.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne - [Pause]. Not here. The Hon. Ajith P. Perera - [Pause]. Not here. Then, the next speaker is the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva.

Presiding Member, thank you for the opportunity given to speak on the Order presented by the Hon. Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana under Section 2 of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, which was brought in to facilitate various reciprocal arrangements that can be made; one between Sri Lanka

and Commonwealth countries and separately another procedure for Sri Lanka and non-Commonwealth countries.

Today, the Hon. Minister has placed before the House, an Agreement between Sri Lanka and the People's Republic of China. We do not quite know why an Agreement was reached between China and Sri Lanka with regard to mutual assistance in criminal matters, but reading through the Act one sees various arrangements that can be had with regard to tracing of monies stolen from one country and sent to another and I wonder whether this provision is what prompted the new Government to sign this Agreement with China.

Be that as it may, this also tells us the importance of international cooperation with regard to criminal matters. Now this Act was brought in 2002. A similar Act was brought in for mutual assistance in civil matters in the same year. So there has been, in the last few decades, an international movement for different countries to cooperate with each other with regard to their respective judicial processes. Now this becomes important at this point in time in our country; when just days ago, Sri Lanka had co-sponsored a Resolution at the UN Human Rights Council, which enables participation of judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators in certain special courts that are envisaged to be set up in this country. That is an important development and a welcome one too.

Todays Debate has seen mostly a discussion of the Attorney Generals Department, of our judiciary and of our police; more than the provisions of this Act. And, I was struck by the fact that there is agreement on both sides of the House that the Chief Law Officer of the country - of the Department - is not capable to actually carry out the duties that are entrusted to it by law. A sad fact as we stand today. Same goes to the judiciary, and there were several references made and with regard to the police too. I find that these are the areas in which Sri Lanka has now agreed that participation of Commonwealth and foreign personnel will be permitted in this special court. That Resolution was also made consequent to the OISL Report, which very specifically made a very heavy indictment on the trustworthiness and the credibility of the judicial processes in this country. I agree with the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama when he says, We must change this, and as an Hon. Member just said we have begun the change. But, as you know, Hon. Presiding Member, these changes cannot happen overnight, these changes will take a long time to happen and at least in that intervening period, we must obtain necessary help from the international community.

There were several references made by the Hon. Anura Kumra Dissanayake; several examples that he gave with regard to the functioning - or more aptly the non-functioning - of the Attorney Generals Department, the judiciary, the police and so on.

I like to highlight one sad example, that of Mrs. Vasanthi Ragupathi Sharma, who was released a few days ago having faced a trial in the High Court, indicted under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. She was acquitted a few days ago after being incarcerated for 15 long years. Even under a draconian law like the Prevention of Terrorism Act the State could not obtain a conviction. Even with provisions where confession obtained under duress after torture - as in this particular case - it was not sufficient to ensure a conviction. It took 15 long years to be acquitted and all those years this lady, who is a mother of three children, along with her husband was in prison. The husband is still in prison facing charges. The Hon. Minister of Law and Order and Prison Reforms is here, and I have been informed that after her release the husband has now been moved to a maximum security prison in Welikada quite unnecessarily, when all this time he has been in the Magazine Prison. So, I urge the Hon. Minister to please look into this.

For fifteen long years these parents have been in prison. He is a Hindu priest. Their three children grew up with others - with neighbours and relatives - and today we have the sad spectacle of this lady being acquitted after 15 years. Now what happens to her? It is being found and judicially pronounced that she has been subjected to torture. Fifteen years of a mothers life has been robbed from her by the State. Who is answerable to this? Hon. Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana, who bears responsibility on this? This is the reason why the Hon. Sampanthan was to plead with you earlier this afternoon to address the issue of detainees under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. As you took office, you acted adroitly and gave us the names and categories. You said 54 persons have been convicted and are serving sentences; there are still no charges for sixty persons, and the rest have been indicted and are facing trial in the High Court.

Now, Sri Lanka has agreed to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs made a speech on the 14th of last month at the UN Human Rights Council and he on his own said that the Prevention of Terrorism Act would be repealed and replaced with another law that is commensurate with international norms today and the Resolution which you co-sponsored very specifically undertakes that the Prevention of Terrorism Act will be repealed. I congratulate the Government for taking such a bold step. That Act was brought in, as you know, in 1979 as a Temporary Provisions Act valid only for six months. But, it was extended from six months to six months until 1982. Then, that provision which made it a Temporary Provisions Act was repealed and it was made permanent; although the title to the Act even today reads, Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act. It is a joke. Since 1979 till today the law is extant and the law is called, Temporary Provisions Act and so much misery has been caused to people under this Act because the police lost their capacity to investigate. When they were given the right to

obtain confessions and when this law made it admissible as evidence in a court of law, all they had to do was to obtain a confession by whatever means and there are enough and more cases where confessions have been obtained by torture.

What happens therefore? I have personally appeared in a case where an elderly couple, a respectable couple, were charged in court under the Prevention of Terrorism Act for failure to give information to the police. It is the only law that says failure to give information to the police is an offence. The indictment said "Failure to give information to the police with regard to a person named Babu". Then, Babu was also arrested but he did not make a confession and he was released. Then we had the spectacle - Hon. Minister of Law and Order and Prison Reforms, I do not know whether it was during your time as the Attorney-General; perhaps it was during your time as the Attorney-General that this happened - that when the case came up in the High Court that particular person named Babu came to watch the court proceedings. These two persons were accused for failure to give information about Babu. But, that man, Babu, who was roaming free came to watch the court proceedings. When these facts were brought to court, the judge said, Well, then you plead not guilty and go to trial." This elderly couple who had children said, No, we will plead guilty because if we go to trial there would be no bail. We have already been in remand for a year and we will continue to be in remand until the case finishes, perhaps another seven - eight years. So, they pleaded guilty; got a suspended sentence; paid a fine and came out. That is the kind of injustice that this law has caused.

While you are keen to have mutual assistance with a country like China in criminal matters, the law reform in this country must prioritize the repeal of Prevention of Terrorism Act. But even before the repeal of that Act, I urge both Ministers - the Hon. Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana as well as the Hon. Minister of Law and Order and Prison Reforms - to release these persons. I know that you have taken rather a technical view of how you describe these prisoners. You say, There are no political prisoners. These are all persons who are kept under a particular law. But I urge you that even in this Act that you have, the offences of a political nature are described and that is a matter that you, as the Minister of Justice, who is conferred with the powers under this Act, have to consider when a request for a mutual assistance comes from another country. So, offences of a political nature are not something that is outside your purview and persons who are arrested; detained; charged or convicted under the Prevention of Terrorism Act are persons who are supposed to have committed offences of a political nature. That is why they are called, political prisoners.

I have said this before as well - Nelson Mandela was considered a political prisoner. But if you ask the White South African Government of that day, they would have

485 486

refused to call him a "political prisoner" and they would have said that he had committed an act, under Act number such and such. Now, do not be technical like the White South African Government. I urge you to consider these persons as "political prisoners" because they are political prisoners for the reason that even if they have committed any other offence, those who have been committed not for any other reason but for political reasons. That is why they are called "political prisoners".

As we move towards reconciliation and as we move towards responsible accountability measures that this Government is taking, there is one small thing that you need to do - obtain a pardon from His Excellency the President. Those 54 prisoners, to my knowledge, have asked for pardon and only a Presidential Pardon can release them. The previous Government released, after two years of rehabilitation, almost 12,000 people who bore arms, who actually participated in the final war. But why are these people still being held? Some of them for failure to give information and as Mrs. Sharma, who after 15 long years found to be innocent of the charges that she was to face.

So, Hon. Minister, I urge you - the Attorney Generals Department may not co-operate with you as many have said here - but if the Government makes a political decision that these things must be done, and I know in 2002, when the Ceasefire Agreement was signed, a political decision was taken and cases under the Prevention of Terrorism Act were withdrawn. The Attorney General went to court and said, Any case which hangs only on a confession as evidence, I am not willing to pursue; I do not want to continue with those cases. So, there was political will at that time. Why do you not display more political will now and have these persons released as early as possible?

I want to urge you also with regard to this particular example that I cited of Mrs. Sharma. I say with responsibility that it is the duty of the Government to recompense Mrs. Sharma for taking away her liberty; for taking away the right that those three children had to have their mother with them for 15-long years as they grew up. Today you have found her to be not guilty. She is being subjected to severe torture and her husband, who is a Hindu priest, is still in prison. I urge you to look at these things a little differently and not technically saying, Well, these are persons who are remanded facing charges under a particular Act, whatever number of 1979. No. These are persons who have been victimized; who have had to suffer the ill-consequences of the past that we had in this country. Many people suffered under that. But, if we have now moved away and as the Government proudly announced to the UN Human Rights Council, We are different, we are not like before, we are not living in denial, we are willing to face these things, most kindly we urge you to put your words into action.

Little things like this will go a long way in regaining the credibility of your institutions, in regaining the trust of the victim community and this perhaps is a good opportunity when we are discussing mutual assistance with the world community and today, that too with a country like China, whose legal environment is perhaps very different to ours. Yet we are moving forward cooperating with the Commonwealth and other countries and facing questions of accountability and I urge the Government there too, to keep your promises not only in letter, but also in spirit and whatever processes that are instituted, that are put in place, must necessarily have the confidence and the trust of the victims, more than anybody else. Therefore, I urge this House, the Ministers concerned and the Government in general to act in that direction.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . 11. [.. 4.23] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne - Deputy Minister of Public Enterprise Development) , , .

, , . . , . , , , , . , . [5.18 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) Mr. Presiding Member, I am thankful for the opportunity to speak with regard to this Order. This Order relates to mutual assistance in criminal matters. It is a very progressive step which the Hon. Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana has taken by entering into an Agreement with China. China has been a great friend of Sri Lanka. I think in the international efforts of combating crime, this would be considered a very progressive step.

However, I would like to move away from this issue to an issue on which His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister have taken great efforts in order to save Sri Lanka from being isolated in the international community. As you know, Sri Lanka was continuously getting isolated in the past UNHRC Sessions. But due to the efforts taken by His Excellency the President and

Hon. Prime Minister - I would like to compliment the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana also - Sri Lanka was saved from being isolated.

Now, one of the issues which has been raised is that we have conceded to a hybrid judicial system by this Resolution. I would like to inform this House that the judicial power is vested in Parliament. I would like to refer to Article 4 ( c) of the Constitution. It states, I quote:

the judicial power of the People shall be exercised by Parliament through courts, tribunals and institutions created and established, or recognized, by the Constitution or created and established by law,

It is the right of this House to decide what our legal institutions are. Therefore, if one is to make an allegation that this Resolution can create courts, I believe that it is done solely with a political motive or for the purpose of discrediting the Government, which has taken great efforts to bring Sri Lanka back within the international community. Earlier, we were moving towards being isolated and we were losing all our friends in the international community.

I would also like to refer to Operative Paragraph 6 of the UNHRC Resolution. Sir, if you read that paragraph, you would find that getting assistance could not in any way be construed as conceding to establish hybrid courts in Sri Lanka. I would also like to remind this House that if His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena did not win the Election on the 08th of January, Sri Lanka would have been further isolated from the international community. I have been to Geneva on one such occasion. On every occasion, we were troubleshooting and trying to win new friends as we were continuously losing our friends in the international community because we were not addressing to the core-issues in relation to human rights and other issues which we are obliged to fulfil in terms of international norms and laws.

I would also like to raise the issue of independence of our judiciary. We have a judicial system which we can be proud of, but when you look at history, you would find that on numerous occasions, there had been setbacks especially with the impeachment of the former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake. I also supported the Impeachment Motion. But His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena was bold enough to rectify the wrongdoing and reinstate the Chief Justice. According to our Standing Orders, Sir, we are expected to vote as a quasi-judicial body. But did we vote as a quasi-judicial body? We voted on a political basis. Therefore, it has taken away the very purpose. I think, if we are to maintain the independence of the judiciary, we need to change our Standing Orders to keep in line with our international obligations.

501 502

Also, if you look at the UNHRC Resolution, you would find how we have been complimented for the progress we have made. With regard to reconciliation and establishing the rule of law, we have been very progressive. Therefore, we are moving on the right path. This Government has taken major steps to bring back the dignity that we had within the international community. It is very important that one does not isolate oneself. If we isolate ourselves, we cannot co-exist. Today, we are in a different era. Most of our goods and services are sent to the West. Today, we should be proud that the Western and the Eastern worlds, including India, are all with Sri Lanka and are supportive of our efforts with regard to reconciliation. There is a lot that needs to be done with regard to reconciliation.

His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena is spending a lot of time in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. The people in the North and the East, for 30 years, have had economic and other setbacks. So, we need to put them right. Today, we have the Leader of the Opposition from the TNA, which is a very progressive step. Then, we have - which is also a very progressive step - as the nominee of the Hon. Leader of the Opposition to the Constitutional Council, the Hon. John Senewiratne, who is from the UPFA.

So, today, we all are co-existing; we are working together in harmony. That is how Sri Lanka should be. With the vision of His Excellency the President together with the Hon.Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, we are a National Government today. We all are putting our party differences aside for the betterment of the country and I believe that this collective effort will bear fruit for the country.

Thank you. [.. 5.25] ( ) (The Hon. Chandrasiri Gajadeera) , 2002 25 , . , , . , , . , ,

, . . -mutual legal assistance- , , . .

I may be permitted to speak in English because of the necessity to use technical terms.

Mr. Presiding Member, Treaties on Mutual Legal Assistance facilitate the obtaining of evidence. For example, they facilitate the obtaining of evidence abroad in a manner that is admissible domestically. Summoning

511 512

[ ]

2015 08

of witnesses; locating persons; producing documents and other evidence; issuing warrants which may have to be executed for example in China; exchange of information; police to police relationships and judicial assistance and resolving complications between countries with different legal traditions are facilitated under this. Sri Lanka and China have completely different legal traditions and that is why we need treaties of this kind.

Also, Mutual Legal Assistance is afforded for the taking of evidence or statements. Sometimes, the crime may have been committed in Sri Lanka, but the witness may have gone to China. So, how do you take evidence or statements in China? This type of MLA -Mutual Legal Assistance- provides for such recording of evidence. For service of judicial documents, documents have to be served on witnesses. We cannot do it ourselves. So, we need the assistance of the other country concerned. Searches, seizures, freezing of bank accounts abroad, examination of objects, sites, providing information, evidentiary items and expert evaluation come into play and that is why we need MLA Treaties like the one that we are approving. Sometimes, the originals or copies of bank documents or records are not here which are necessary for the prosecution and they may be available, for example, in a Government Department in China, in a bank or a business. The MLA would provide us the opportunity of obtaining such evidence through cooperation.

The MLA also is afforded for identifying and tracing proceeds of crimes. Sometimes, the crime is committed here but the proceeds of the crime are taken abroad and may be stored, for example, in some place in China or any other country. So, we need to get evidence of the proceeds of the crime.

This is also facilitating for voluntary appearance of persons in the requesting party. The domestic laws may have to be amended to afford MLA because there is also the issue of dual-criminality. For MLA to operate, the offence or the act concerned must be a criminal offence both in the requesting country and the requested country. Sometimes, it may not be so. When you have an MLA, that also helps us to improve our laws. We may find a particular act an offence in China, but not an offence here. Therefore, we may be able to improve our laws also as a consequence.

Next is voluntary sharing of information. That is very important and the issue of - ( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! .

Whereupon THE HON. LUCKY JAYAWARDANA left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER took the Chair.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (DR) Jayampathy Wickramaratne) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I was on some of the legal issues that arise out of MLA. Sometimes, it is necessary for Sri Lanka to transfer a person detained in China or imprisoned in China to identify or to give evidence in this country. Both parties would agree ordinarily to assist the other. The other country would assist to bring the witness concerned to Sri Lanka. He would be kept in custody of the requesting party and then we have to return him or her to the requested country without delay. That will also be possible with Mutual Legal Assistance.

I do not want to go through the procedure involved. I only want to emphasize that a request for mutual legal assistance shall be executed in accordance with domestic law of the requested State and where possible in accordance with procedures specified in the request.

Mutual Legal Assistance can be refused in certain cases. These are all laid down in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.

. " " - "Central Authority" - , " " . .

, , I would like to explain. Sri Lanka being a dualist country, we are abided by certain conventions of the Commonwealth - . One such convention is the Harare Declaration. In terms of the Harare Declaration, the "Central Authority" is defined as "either the Attorney-General or the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice". There are certain countries like Canada and Myanmar, where the Attorney-General himself is the Minister of Justice. In such countries, the "Central Authority" is the Attorney-General. In other countries, it has been interpreted as the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice. Since we are a party to the Harare Declaration and a member country of the Commonwealth, when we enacted this Bill as far back in 2002, they had followed the same procedure. In relation to China and all other countries which are not members of the Commonwealth, we have followed this system and so far, there has not been any issue with regard to the independence and the impartiality of the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice on any matter relating to this area. , .

In addition to that, I must also say that Sri Lanka is a dualist country. When becoming a party to an international convention, just because you are a member, you are not bound to follow it immediately or it does not come into operation soon after it is signed. For that purpose, you have to first ratify it: you have to bring a Bill before the local Legislature and get it passed. Therefore, Sri Lanka being a dualist country, we have always followed that system without any obstacle and have had a smooth functioning.
