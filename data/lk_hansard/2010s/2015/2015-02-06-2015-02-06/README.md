Mr. Presiding Member, it is appropriate that I remind this House that the new President was elected on a mandate for good governance. My party and I, - and I am sure the majority in this country - welcome this and we are watching to see if this Government is serious about making robust changes to usher in good governance. It was on this very subject of Good Governance in our universities that I spoke in this House in November last year, especially on the grave shortcomings in the governance of the University of Jaffna.

611 612

In this regard, statements made by the State Minister of Higher Education raised doubts on how serious the Government is in reforming our university system. The State Minister was reported in the Sunday Observer of 1st February, 2015, that he will not sack the Chairperson of the UGC, Prof. Kshanika Hirimburegama, but will address many mistakes done by her. As we know, the Federation of University Teachers Association has been critical of the Chairperson of the UGC, who is a political appointee and in its recent press release, it requests the Government not to take ad hoc policy measures without following a serious consultative process with all stakeholders. What consultative process has the Minister followed in deciding that the Chairperson, a public official, whom he says has made mistakes, must not be removed? Such a decision requires a consultative process. If we go by what a Minister feels about a person, we will end up with unsuitable persons and a breakdown of the university system.

What was of particular concern to me was the University of Jaffna, which I referred to in my speech made in this House. The problems of abuse there are quite grave, as have been documented by the Jaffna University Science Teachers Association - JUSTA. If we simply extend the Ministers logic based on personal feelings and say that the Vice-Chancellor of the Jaffna University and the other persons in authority have made mistakes but must stay on, what is the guarantee of change for the better? Clearly, these persons have not been transparent and their competence is questionable.

Now, I will say something about the mistakes on the part of the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Jaffna and especially, the academic members of the Council. A letter signed by more than 80 academics expressing dissatisfaction about the recruitment practices in the University was sent to the Vice-Chancellor in December, 2013. There was neither an acknowledgement nor a response. Other detailed reports on abuse compiled by JUSTA were sent to her during the course of the year 2014. These detail several cases of how candidates with excellent academic credentials are shut out and persons with much lower ability are recruited. It is only when one of the rejected top candidates went to the Supreme Court that the Vice-Chancellor condescended to respond. There too, as the JUSTA has shown, the Vice-Chancellor and the Dean of Management have, under Oath, told untruths to the Supreme Court. In July 2014, the Chairperson of the UGC promised to conduct an impartial inquiry, but has done nothing so far, and has continued to protect the Vice-Chancellor. In this regard, I have tabled the relevant report in Parliament. How could the public believe the assurances given that these people would be kept on and the Minister would see that their mistakes are corrected? This is not a healthy approach to good governance.

Good governance means that when there is a public complaint about grave abuse, there should be a proper inquiry and those accused should not be kept in a position to influence the inquiry. These are persons who mainly acquire positions through political favour and we should be much more vigilant in keeping such persons in position. Is this country so lacking in talented persons that we hang on to those whose main talent is sycophancy? In the University of Jaffna, only one candidate went through the trouble and expense of going to the Supreme Court when hers was not the worst case of abuse. If all those whose cases have been documented could go to the Supreme Court, there will be a major stink. Good governance is about managing our institutions with fairness and competence, so that the need for legal recourse is minimized.

I would like to remind this House that the University of Jaffna is the only University in the North with the task of having to produce the intellectual capital and professional skills for the entire region. The present trend of abuses in recruitment would ensure that the University degenerates steadily and will, very poorly, serve the region. For example, the University is supposed to have top-rate skills in discipline ranging from Law to Environmental Management. The question of waste oil dumped by the Northern Power Plant contaminating the ground water in Chunnakam has been raised before 2012. There was not even a sound from the University. The authorities in the University had no particular commitment to the broader society or environment. They were quite happy to go after a Government Minister and fall at his feet to ensure that they keep their positions. The Minister would even rig the Vice-Chancellorss election to ensure that this same group remains in power. It is only after the recent election when they felt threatened that their power would be taken away that they are trying to drum up publicity for themselves parading as experts using the disaster in Chunnakam several years, too late.

What we need is a first-rate University, not a University that shuts out talent that is willing to join the university profession. JUSTA has also documented cases of the University shutting out well-qualified persons who want to come home and serve.

The University needs a major transformation, so that we will have real experts with social concern and what happened at Chunnakam will not happen again. The only way this can be done is to appoint a competent authority, a dedicated person of proven integrity who knows the University system well and is capable of bringing in the necessary reforms.

I repeat, we are badly in need of a competent authority, immediately. I want the State Minister of Higher Education to give a hearing. This is my second speech as regards the Jaffna University. Do you want talented people in the University to run the University, or

613 614

2015 06

do you want to give us some logical answers? I should say in this House that after my speech on the last Budget, the then Minister of Higher Education, the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake attacked me saying that I spoke after consuming liquor. He attacked me as if I was a drunkard. It was a very sad situation. I was planning to reply him, but unfortunately, today he is on my side. So, I cannot reply him.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam. You have 15 minutes. [..5.16] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam - Minister of Education) , , . , " " . ; . . . . ? , , .

There are 44 Wages Boards which are set up on a tripartite basis. If the Wages Boards are to determine wages, it may take several months or years. This process is dilatory since it involves calling for objections, publishing in gazettes and newspapers, analyzing the objections and publishing the decisions thereafter. Therefore, the Wages Boards decisions are to be made

prospective and not retrospective, as such delays are inevitable. It is, therefore, proposed to bring about a special legislation to give effect to this salary increase so that workers would benefit immediately.
