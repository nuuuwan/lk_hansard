( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Member, may I take the liberty of answering the first part of the Question in English because it contains some facts of a technical nature. I would appreciate if you would allow me to do so.

As per Section 15(1) of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006, the Financial Intelligence Unit has the power to receive reports from a law enforcement agency, a Government institution or agency or an agency of another country relating to suspicious transactions.

Relating to the newspaper article you referred to regarding Sri Lankans holding accounts in Switzerland, no such institution or law enforcement agency has reported any suspicious transaction to the FIU. According to the FIU, it is not in a position to initiate investigations under the provisions the Financial Transactions Reporting Act - FTRA. Further, I would like to highlight the fact that past experiences of the FIU with Switzerland show that they are not cooperative in providing assistance for investigation. Hon. Member, furthermore, this particular transaction was reported about five years ago and at that particular time, it was reported more vividly, even certain names came out. As a matter of fact, the Central Bank had information. Unfortunately, it is more outside the purview of observation because it has got to be done under the three specific areas: that is, on a report by a law enforcement agency or a Government institution or agency. Now, the media does not fall under this category. The structure of reporting to the FIU was changed in 2006 and I solicit the assistance of Parliament in this regard and would refer it to the President and the Prime Minister, that we should bring it within the ambit, enabling the FIU to look into any genuine information that is mentioned. We have also got information through different media that, though your Question mentions the total amount as Rs. 800 million, it is much more than that. But, as the FIU

has the right only to look into it on reports coming in from the three institutions and agencies I mentioned, it is not permitted to do so legally. Secondly, the same information has come from the National Bank of Dubai and Ukraine, which carries a lot of political names.

I thank the Hon. Member for bringing this into open. I would take the liberty to instruct the Central Bank to call for information on all the names reported by the media and to answer the questions that the media had posed, even though it basically does not legally hold the right to complain. I would also extend the area of investigation into Ukraine and Dubai, which have reported of almost US Dollars 72 million.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) That is, in addition to the Swiss accounts, is it?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, in addition to the Swiss accounts. I am sorry, it is not US Dollars 72 million, but US Dollars 720 million in two peoples names. About another US Dollars 26 million is in the names of 14 Sri Lankans in one bank, the National Bank of Dubai.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) The Financial Intelligence Unit can bring out these facts and details on the basis of the sovereignty of our State.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Member, I would like to once again point out that the investigation has to be done on a report from the following institutions: a law enforcement agency or a Government institution or agency. So, the law prescribes the area of investigation.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) So, change the law.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes. That is what I basically ask your support for. I am sure, if all of you are very willing, that could be taken up.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Change the law. - [Interruption.]

1365 1366

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, I would certainly take it up at the Cabinet Meeting tomorrow and bring it in immediately. I thank you for bringing it up.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Then, you will get money. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Your bringing it up at a time like this is helpful because it certainly helps the Ministry of Finance, which is completely depleted of money at this particular moment.

Also, I would greatly appreciate if any other matter is brought up because our Ministry is ready to answer your questions at any time. - [Interruption.] Yes. The right to information, even though it has been non-existent, will certainly be provided by the Ministry of Finance because I have been instructed by the President and the Prime Minister to answer any question at any time to show transparency of the Government.

Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

2015 03

[3.10 p.m.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Deputy Speaker, today, we are debating Regulations under the EPF Act, which are long overdue. I am speaking after the former Minister of Labour and Labour Relations, who brought these Regulations to Parliament. Those were initiated by the previous Minister of Labour Relations and Manpower, the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne. After all these years and two powerful Ministers, who are both trade unionists, it took a long time for the Regulations to be passed, so that the workers could benefit from it.

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Lokuge) I will explain why those got delayed.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Member, I have asked you about this so many times by meeting you at the Ministry, at the Consultative Committee and even privately. You always told me that you are keen to implement it, but your Government did not allow you to do that - you did not say it; I am saying it - because they needed the EPF money, probably for other transactions.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) To run the Government.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) On one side, it was to run the Governmen; on the other, they had their other deals to manipulate the stock market. There were people who were pumping and dumping and making big money. Those who started with a million rupees are billionaires today. So, they used the EPF. But, you brought these in good faith; the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne initiated those.

I can remember, at one NLAC meeting, the Central Bank came and made a presentation and said that you must have a unique number so that the EPF number does not differ for a single person, and they suggested to create a new number. But, at that meeting, it emerged - I also contributed to some extent - that the National Identity Card number is a unique number given to persons in this country and that it should be used as the unique number. The process has continued. I know, Labour Officers have gone to all the estates and have tallied the different EPF numbers with the National Identity Card number. They are ready to implement it, but your Government, Hon.

Lokuge, could not do it. You had to bring these Regulations and today, we have to pass them.

You know very well that from 2013, it has been in the Order Book. But, you could not persuade the then Leader of the House or the Chief Government Whip to get a date for debating these Regulations. We are confident that we can run this economy without the workers money, the EPF money. That is why we have boldly brought forward this. The workers can withdraw 30 per cent of their savings in the EPF for good purposes. One is, for health assistance. If they have to go for an operation, either a kidney transplant or a heart operation, they can have some funds from that. Further, more development-oriented, future-oriented cause for which you can take this money is for building houses. These are the two matters from which the worker is going to benefit, but you could not give this benefit. Though you passed this in December 2011, for the whole of 2012, you could not do it and in 2013, you just managed to bring in the Regulation but could not get it passed in this House. We have done it today. Give us the credit for it. And, we also give you the credit for initiating this measure.

Today, people in the plantations, their one request, one hope, one ambition is to have a house of their own; a separate house, not a line room. This was adopted as one of the promises in the 100-day Programme that was proposed by His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena with the backing of the UNP during the last election. We are now getting ready to release lands for people to build their own houses. This is a positive measure to help people build their own houses in the plantations using their own money. So, this delay has drawn our people aback by four years. From 2011 up to 2014, they had to wait. But, it is a good thing that it has come up today and we will benefit; the workers will benefit. The Hon. Minister of Justice and Labour Relations and his Deputy are present here. The people in the plantation areas still have difficulties in withdrawing their EPF monies. They have to go behind brokers which they find very difficult.

I wish to suggest in this House, to the two Ministers, to take action to streamline the application process for withdrawal of the EPF money when a plantation worker retires. In some cases, workers could not withdraw the EPF monies because their names were not spelt properly or written properly by the management. In other cases, the form filled by the management on behalf of the worker is not done in a proper manner. There is one issue which I raised with the Hon. Minister at one of the Consultative Committee Meetings, but it has still not been corrected. I also wrote a letter to him. It is about the Assistant Labour Commissioner's office in Hatton.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) With the specific number, can it not be solved?

1385 1386

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes, to some extent. That will help a lot to solve this issue. But, the attitude of the EPF Department: the Commissioner in charge of the EPF and the Assistant Commissioners down the line, has to be changed. I request the Hon. Minister to come and visit the office of the Assistant Labour Commissioner in Hatton. They say that if you do not come and take a number before 8.00 a.m, you cannot hand over the application on that particular day. I do not know why they stipulate this shut-off time and only on two days of the week, they accept applications. So, to hand over the application they have a ceiling, which is 8 o'clock.

People come in the night and sleep at the Assistant Labour Commissioners office to hand over their EPF applications in the morning. This is a very pathetic situation. If the same number of hours are given for people to submit applications, whether you go on from 8 oclock to 12 oclock or whether you shut off at 8 oclock, it is not going to make a difference. The officers there do not seem to understand this and even though I have pointed it out and explained to them, they refuse to change it. After the new Government came to power, I have not gone there and spoken to them. I request the Hon. Minister to - [Interruption.]. Even now it is happening.- [Interruption.]. I brought it to his attention only today. I am sure he will take some action to get this streamlined in such a way that people are able to get their EPF dues without difficulty.

Today, the general feeling among our people is that governments support the owners or the proprietors. Maturata Plantations has not deposited their EPF payments since 2011. I have taken this up several times, but no action has been taken against them. If you do file charges and take them to courts, they will honour their commitment. They have already deducted the money from the workers salaries. They are using that money for their business activities. They are not bothered about paying it to the EPF Department, where the worker would have his savings secure. This is a very important matter.

The JEDB and the SLSPC also, for several years now, have not made EPF deposits. In the past, your Government said that you were going to fell trees to make these payments. They did not even do that. I would not want trees to be felled for this purpose but for the benefit of the workers I did say, Even that would not be bad if you can do it". But, up to now, it was not done. I am sure - [Interruption.] No. There are so many workers who have died without claiming the EPF. Even their children are unable to claim the EPF today because monies have not been deposited by the JEDB and the SLSPC. There are some companies who are not doing that.

Then, Sir, the EPF law is being flouted by some of these plantation companies, which are public companies.

They project themselves as great corporate entities, but they employ workers on a casual basis without payment of EPF. When they pay on a casual basis, they do not pay the minimum wage; they pay only the basic salary. They are not entitled to the Rs. 30 allowance or the attendance incentive. This is a total flouting of the Collective Agreement and also the stipulations of the Wages Board. So, still the so-called big public companies are flouting the law without any respect for it. This has to be looked into, Hon. Minister. This is for your attention.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you are left with only one more minute.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Okay, Sir. Labour laws have to be enforced equally to all. Big companies get away after flouting the law; this has to be looked into.

Thank you. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , .

I quote:

"The EPF enjoys considerable economies of scale in managing its assets, resulting in very low administrative charges - certainly much lower than what a privately managed fund would charge. Combined with its improving performance in the past decades, leads to a conclusion that the investment returns of the EPF are in fact good and unlikely to be improved upon by radical changes."
