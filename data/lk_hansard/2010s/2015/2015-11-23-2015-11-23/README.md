Sir, as people from the Left, we are internationalists. We take a world view of development in all spheres and we cannot turn our back to the realities of the world economy. In the global economy of today, the course of development is through the promotion of technology, rather than through the expansion of production facilities.

Further, not only capital but even the accumulation of capital is an international process. Foreign capital does not just respond to invitation. Prior integration in the global circuit alone can induce investment.

The world Capitalist System has undergone tremendous change with globalization. National boundaries are collapsing permitting the free flow of capital, goods and services. This is the challenge that the Small and Medium Enterprises - SMEs- in industry and agro-business are facing as they find it difficult to compete in the international markets.

Among developing countries, such as ours, it is those countries that have encouraged and succeeded in getting foreign capital and the know-how alone who have succeeded in achieving economic growth. But, the price for this has been the widening gap between the rich and the poor. . gap , - marginalization of larger sections of the population- . In fact, this is also true of developed countries. The burden of bringing redistributive justice - ? .

Even, I want to say a few words about the State. - - .

. Even in the era of globalization, the State has an important role to play. Even the World Bank in its 1997 Report titled The State in a Changing World recognized that. It advocates a larger role for the State in protecting and correcting markets as a necessary partner - catalyst facilitator. It talked about the State; it stated that development without an effective State is impossible. This means recognizing the positive role played by the State working in partnership with market to correct their failures. The States unique strengths are its powers to tax, to prohibit, to punish and require participation. The States power to tax enables it to finance the provision of public goods. That is very important. Its power to prohibit and punish enables it to protect personal safety and property rights.

Sustainable development has to be measured not only through achievements in GDP. Sir, for us in the Left, what is important is the equitable distribution. , . Employment creation is an essential part of poverty reduction and that is how we look at the Budget. .

The proposal to provide the existing fertilizer subsidy scheme for small-scale paddy farmers is most welcome. Coupon

. . The measures proposed to revive the rural economy by allocating Rs. 1.5 million to each village would go a long way to rejuvenate this sector of our economy.

While supporting the grant of land ownership to rural and estate sectors, we must ensure that adequate rural credit is made available to ensure that they are not sold or mortgaged to pay off the existing debts. , .

, . . , , , absentee landlords .

, , for national development, Sir, a dynamic and contended workforce is essential. To ensure this, the promised Rs. 2,500 salary increase to the private sector must be granted by law. . 2,500 . , .

The present statutory minimum wage fixing machinery does not function adequately as it depends on the type of establishment or trade. The urgent need is to design a national living wage. Such a minimum wage shall be a minimum material entitlement to all workers irrespective of work, category or sector and shall be established as a fundamental right of all working people.

People are concerned about their standard of living. Can they enhance their income? Can they give better education for their children? Can their children find suitable employment following this educational system? Up to now, as a nation, we have failed to provide answers to these questions. We have been unsuccessful.

People are tired of what they have gone through. They seek genuine changes; real-time changes. That is why the people elected His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena as the Executive President on the 08th of January and the present Government under the Prime Minister, Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Let us all work together and be united for a better tomorrow and make our peoples lives better as one community in our country with lasting peace, harmony and prosperity. If these questions are raised again, we should respond positively in the years to come.
