But, in the course of this supposed Question, he has been making reference to the Tamil National Alliance and making criticism. I say this is totally out of order and this Question does not fall within the Standing Order No. 23(2). ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) This is not a criticism. ( ) (The Hon.

I urge that the Chair rules this as out of order.

Muslims have been living in this country in harmony, in a pluralistic society with multiple ethnic identities. We all have equally contributed historically to the development of this nation. We ought to celebrate this diversity in our country. We are extremely happy that we now have a good Government with a good a President and a good Prime Minister who have recognized the unity in diversity.

As a Representative of a predominant Muslim Party - the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress - I share the joy of almost 100 per cent of the Muslims of this country voting for this Government, that values peace and humanity among communities.

The previous speaker, the Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, also mentioned in his speech about the polarization of the communities in this country. I fervently hope that this Government will not neglect the interests of the Muslims who underwent a lot of hardships and insecurity in the past.

Sir, from the time of Independence, Budgets have been presented by the governing party. That is, either by the United National Party or the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.

1891 1892

2015 02

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Why are you reading? ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) If I want to read, I will read. I find it easier. - [ Interruption.] Please do not disturb me. You always feel that you know everything. - [ Interruption.] What is your problem? - [ Interruption.]

The election of His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena is where the General Secretary of the SLFP challenges the incumbent President and the then Leader of the SLFP and defeats him with the support of all progressive political parties, including the UNP, a section of the SLFP, the TNA and many others. His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena pledged to the nation that he will move away from petty politics, put the nation before self or party and steer the country for two years, forming a National Government consisting of the UNP and the SLFP. This Budget is a continuation of that pledge to steer the Government, where the Cabinet consists of Hon. Ministers of the UNP and the SLFP. There are ideological differences between the UNP and us. However, to steer this pledge, we act collectively in presenting this Budget.

Today, we, as a country, cannot live in isolation. If we are to reduce our foreign debt and attract foreign investments, we have to live in harmony with the international community.

Foreign entities to engage in business need land. Land is the only commodity that no foreigner, however big or small, can take away. Therefore, if a foreigner builds a 50-storey building, the net benefit will be to the country and our economy. But, we should prevent foreigners from obtaining absolute title to a land or pushing land prices up to make it prohibitive for the average Sri Lankan to purchase land.

Then, the reduction of the 15 per cent tax on projects implemented by foreigners would be very positive in encouraging foreign investments to come into this country. When I was the Deputy Minister of Investment Promotion, that 15 per cent tax deterred foreign investments from coming into this country and I think we are now on the right track by removing that levy.

Also this Budget is based on the following promises: generating one million employment opportunities, enhancing income levels, development of the rural economy, ensuring land ownership to the rural and the estate sectors, the middle-class and government employees and creating a vibrant and strong middle-class. In addition, the basic prices of essentials have been reduced.

The tax man will not be at your doorstep until you reach the threshold of Rs. 2.4 million a year, which is a major incentive to earn. The common tax slab of 15 per cent was on the Robin Hood theory, where a persons who earns more is taxed more and that mechanism is being taken away. I think that is a great benefit to the people. The Corporate Tax has been brought down, which could ignite the growth of the private sector.

The financial sector has been making greater profits compared to other sectors of the economy. The increase in the corporate taxes in that sector, if the tax burden is not shifted by the banks to the customers, would be a positive factor. So, one should be cautious to see that the tax increase is not shifted to the customer, whereby the cost of finances would be further increased.

The request made by the Women's Chamber of Industry and Commerce that 5 per cent of the loan portfolio for SME projects be granted to women be included in the Budget is a very positive factor as women entrepreneurship is an integral part in a vibrant economy.

I would request that the decision with regard to the cancellation of vehicle permits for the government servants and doctors be reconsidered or an alternative mechanism brought in to address their need for private transportation.

As a lawyer, I have seen entrepreneurs taking the benefit of the concept of limited liability, by which their risk is reduced and they can enhance their skills towards entrepreneurship. But, the amount of Rs.60,000 payable by a private company annually, I would say, would deter that because you always see entrepreneurs starting with a smaller capital and gradually building up. Therefore, if we have this payment of Rs.60,000 per year and if we move back to sole proprietorship or partnership, that would be going backwards. So, I request that the said suggestion of an annual payment of Rs.60,000 by a private company be reconsidered.

In dealing with my Ministry, the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government, due recognition has been given to the Finance Commission. Earlier, funds were given to the Provinces without considering the recommendations of the Finance Commission, which is a violation of the Constitution. Now, the Finance Commission has been given due recognition and funds for the Provinces would be made consequent to the consultation of the Finance Commission. Therefore, with this mechanism of consultation of the Finance Commission, my Ministry, being the Line Ministry, would be made accountable with regard to the funds given to the Provincial Councils, thereby making it easy for me to answer Parliament with regard to monies given to the Provincial Councils.

I am very confident that this Budget will empower the masses of this country for greater prosperity. I thank the

efforts of His Excellency the President, the Hon. Prime Minister and the untiring efforts of the Minister of Finance, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake and the officials of the Ministry of Finance.

( ) (The Hon. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) You say that you have taken a valuation of Rs. 121 billion. The question is, there are about 11,000 schools in the country. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) There are 10, 862 schools and 95 per cent of that number is functioning. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) How did you do the valuation and on what basis have you done the valuation? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) There is a government valuation which goes on a regular basis. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) You need a valuation report and you need a certificate on that. Was all that done within these three months? If so, it is excellent. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You do not know. The Government Valuation Department does this for all the institutions and this was in their books. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Then, you have to have a zero value because there are schools which are over 40 years. When you have 2 per cent depreciation on buildings within 40 years, that means you have a zero value. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella, do you not know that there is an Asset Register? You cannot have a zero value in the Asset Register. Those were fictitious assets. Those are the very things that we are trying to eradicate. That is the nonsense that went on in this country. Those fictitious assets were converted into real time peoples assets and that is how this has been done. This entire thing was there

1921 1922

in the Government Valuation Department. These were not hypothetical figures that were extracted from the skies to put in here.

after. We have certainly looked at the proposals that had come from you all. The President and the Hon. Prime Minister said, "If there is a variance, please look into it compassionately because that is an area that has been undergoing a lot of hardships. We have been saying very openly that the necessary allocation have been made and we are moving on. Certainly, if there is a requirement of anything further, we are there to ensure that it is met. We want to ensure that all - the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burghers and Malays - live in a very strong Sri Lankan social fabric.
