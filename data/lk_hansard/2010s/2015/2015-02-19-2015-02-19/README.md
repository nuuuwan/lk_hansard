( ) (The Hon. Shantha Bandara) , . . ( , ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage) Sir, this Bill had been on the drawing board since the year 2000. Several times - this is, in fact, the tenth incarnation of the same Bill - it was debated and adjourned after two days of full debate. Since it got entangled in the whole issue relating to the former commissions of inquiry on those ten incidents, again it got politicized, unnecessarily. In fact, all agreed that under the Criminal Justice system, this Bill is an important one. Unfortunately, this got muddled with all other international issues. Now, it is time that all of us, with bipartisan support, pass this Bill. I do not think we need to vet it through the Consultative Committee process. This is my humble opinion, Mr. Speaker.

Hon. Speaker, as you are aware, victims of crime face numerous problems as a consequence of being subjected to criminality. While some of these problems are of a general nature, some are directly associated with their participation in the Criminal Justice system, which is an adversarial system in our country. Having to face these problems add to their trauma, and is sometimes more traumatizing than the original crime itself. Furthermore, these problems prolong the suffering of the victims and, at times, cause permanent harm.

Lack of knowledge on how to deal with the incident: whether to complain to the police or remain silent; whether to institute civil legal proceedings et cetera; lack of support and advice; absence or lack of proper treatment and care by the State health service; absence of financial and other resources to obtain treatment from the private sector; absence of immediate financial relief to redress material harm or loss suffered by them; absence of psychological support; social stigma, isolation, marginalization; and occupational and financial losses are the problems that the victims of crime generally face as a consequence of being subjected to criminality.

Absence of an opportunity to submit to court the nature of the penal sanctions such person may wish court to impose on the convict; in a case of acquittal, the accused not receiving information regarding the reasons for the acquittal; in a case of conviction, the convict not receiving information regarding judicial review of the conviction about appeal or revision; absence of an opportunity to make legal representation at such hearing; not receiving information regarding the release of the convict from the prison; not having an opportunity to make representations before a decision is taken to grant a pardon, are the main concerns of the victims in criminality.

The other problems faced by the victims of crime are threats, harassments, intimidations, retaliations or reprisals, and other criminal offences. These are perpetrated to dissuade victims from coming forward, complaining to the police and testifying in court, or as a punishment for complaining, and testifying.

1085 1086

Problems associated with the receiving of compensation have also been adequately addressed in this Bill. The civil legal proceedings to obtain compensation are time-consuming and expensive. Hardly any compensation is received at the end of criminal proceedings, and the State does not have a mechanism for awarding compensation. These issues have been seriously addressed when drafting this Bill.

Then, the plight of witnesses has also been taken into consideration. They face certain problems such as harassment, disbelief, absence of assistance to attend court; threats, harassment and pressure not to attend court; intimidation, retaliatory attacks et cetera.

Child victims of crime and witnesses have also been addressed in this Bill. Due to tender age, inherent weaknesses and vulnerabilities, the situation of child victims of crime and witnesses has become a serious issue in our country. Family members and guardians of child victims of crime and witnesses also face numerous problems during the criminal justice process.

It is also necessary to consider the present position of the existing law. Victims are reluctant to report crimes in certain circumstances and witnesses seldom volunteer to make statements to the police. Sometimes, victims and witnesses are reluctant to come to court to testify. The overall efficacy of the criminal justice system has been adversely affected as a result of those weaknesses and lacunas.

Then, the objects of the new law are also an important factor which has to be considered during this Debate. They are: set out and recognize the rights and entitlements of victims of crime and witnesses; establish mechanisms to promote, protect, enforce and exercise such rights and entitlements; provide for rendering of assistance and protection to victims and witnesses; provide for payment of compensation to victims; provide for obtaining of redress by victims including restitution, reparation and rehabilitation; set out duties and responsibilities of judicial officers, police officers and other public officers with regard to the victims and witnesses; stipulate offences that may be committed in respect of victims and witnesses and provide for implementation of internationally accepted norms and best practices relating to the protection of victims and witnesses.

According to the general scheme of the proposed law, there are two categories of beneficiaries: the first is the victims of crime and the second is the witnesses. Two forms of relief have also been provided in the Bill: the first is assistance and the second is the protection of the law and the legal authorities.

A "Victim of Crime" means a person who has suffered any injury, harm, impairment or disability, whether

physical or mental, emotional; economic or other loss as a result of an act or omission, which constitutes an offence under any law, or an infringement of Fundamental Rights enshrined in Articles 11, 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution, and includes a person who suffers harm as a result of intervening to assist such a person or to prevent the commission of an offence, and any member of the family and next of kin of such person, dependents and any other person of significant importance to that person. That is the definition given in the Bill with regard to a Victim of Crime.

A Witness has also been defined. Witness means any person who has provided information, lodged a complaint, made a statement with a law enforcement agency; or, has been summoned by a court or a commission; or, has investigated into an offence or infringement of Fundamental Rights enshrined and guaranteed by Articles 11, 13 (1) and 13 (2) of the Constitution. Such category includes a victim of crime, a family member or dependent of such witness, or any other person of significant importance, and also includes an Expert Witness and a Defence Witness.

This Bill also provides to establish a Commission to protect the rights and entitlements of victims and witnesses. Commission means, a commission appointed under the Commissions of Inquiry Act and the Special Presidential Commissions of Inquiry Act; a Commission appointed under the Special Presidential Commissions of Inquiry Act; the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption; or the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka.

This Bill also makes specific provisions with regard to the Rights of Victims of Crime. A victim has to be treated with equality, fairness and with respect for his dignity and privacy. He is also entitled to receive adequate, prompt, appropriate and fair redress including reparation and restitution. He has to be protected from harm, intimidation, reprisals or retaliation; medically treated; and, be informed of legal remedies, the progress of the investigation, dates fixed for hearing of judicial proceedings, release on bail, discharge, institution of criminal proceedings, conviction, sentence, acquittal of the accused, assistance available et cetera. Such a person should have the complaint recorded by any police officer, and to have the complaint investigated into impartially and comprehensively. He is also entitled to make representations to the investigator and receive a feedback regarding the progress of the investigation. Such a person has to be represented by a legal counsel during investigations, and he is entitled to present written communications to the Attorney-General. Further, the victim is entitled to be present and represented during legal proceedings; to receive assistance required to attend legal proceedings; to obtain certain legal documentation from court; to submit to court - during trial or after conviction, or prior to the sentence or in appeal or

1087 1088

[ () ]

2015 19

revision - the impact of crime. If a pardon or remission of sentence is being considered by the relevant authorities, such a party is entitled to submit the impact of the crime and make representations. The victim of crime is entitled to receive actual financial loss or expenses incurred due to participation in legal proceedings; and to receive medical treatment.

Then, this Bill categorically provides certain entitlements to the witnesses such as to receive from investigational, quasi-judicial and judicial authorities, fair and respectful treatment; not to be harassed for providing information regarding an offence or an infringement of Fundamental Rights or Human Rights, volunteering to make statements with a law-enforcement agency, and, providing testimony. Witnesses are also to receive protection against any real or possible harm, threat, intimidation, reprisal or retaliation.

This law also provides protection to whistle-blowers, which has not been provided in the previous statutes. Accordingly, no person who has provided information regarding the commission of an offence, infringement of Fundamental Rights or Human Rights in such persons employment environment, shall be harassed, subjected to suffering, loss or damage or any adverse change in conditions of employment.

The Offences against Victims of Crime and Witnesses have also been defined in this Bill. They include: threatening; causing hurt; causing grievous hurt; wrongful restraint; causing forceful or deceitful movement; damage or destruction to property; harassment or loss or damage to whistle-blowers; unlawful or unauthorized divulging of information regarding informants or witnesses; providing a gratification to another to desist from providing information or instituting legal proceedings; providing false information to obtain protection; unlawful or unauthorized release of information relating to the providing of protection, and thereby placing the life of the protected person in danger.

This Bill also makes provisions to establish a National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses. This would be a statutory body tasked with the primary responsibility of promoting and protecting the rights and entitlements of victims and witnesses. It would recommend to Government institutions, the measures to be adopted to protect the rights and entitlements of victims and witnesses. Further, it will maintain a Compensation Fund to provide interim relief to victims, pending a court of law formally awarding compensation. Together with the Victims of Crime and Witnesses Protection Division of the Sri Lanka Police, it will provide protection to witnesses and victims. Further, it will provide necessary assistance to victims and witnesses, such as facilitating treatment, reparation, restitution and rehabilitation. It will also recommend the adoption of new measures relating to victims; and

investigate and inquire into infringements of rights and entitlements of victims of crime and witnesses.

This Bill also provides for a Board of Management tasked with the formulation of policy, supervision of administration and management, and control of the affairs of the Authority. There will be four persons chosen from the fields of criminal justice, appointed by the Constitutional Council. When the Constitutional Council does not appoint, within one month of the vacancy arising, the Minister of Justice, in consultation with the President, Chief Justice, Minister of Human Rights and the Attorney-General, shall make the appointment. That includes four persons chosen from the field of Human Rights, Secretary to the Ministry of Justice, Secretary to the Ministry in charge of the Police Department, Secretary to the Ministry of Human Rights, Secretary to the Ministry of Womens Affairs, Secretary to the Ministry in charge of the subject of Children, a member of the Human Rights Commission, a nominee of the Attorney-General and a Senior DIG nominated by the Inspector-General of Police.

There shall be a "Victims of Crime and Witnesses Assistance and Compensation Fund". The Authority will maintain a Fund to provide compensations to victims. The purpose of maintaining this Fund is to provide interim compensations to victims and assistance to victims and witnesses. The High Court and the Magistrate's Court can, when sentencing a convict, order him to pay an amount extending up to 10 per cent of the fine payable to the Compensation Fund. Additionally, the Parliament can vote funds to the Compensation Fund.

Protection to Victims and Witnesses, and the Victims of Crime and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division will also be established under this law. This Division of the Police will be responsible for providing protection to victims and witnesses. They will undertake providing protection to them on a request by a victim or a witness; a recommendation by the Authority; a report from a law enforcement agency or a notification from a court of commission. This Division will conduct a threat assessment and thereafter enter into a MoU with the victim or the witness.

The nature of the protection given by this Bill could be summarized as follows: security to the person and his property; temporary housing or accommodation; permanent relocation; temporary or permanent employment; necessary finances; re-identification; and any other measure which may be necessary to protect the victim or the witness.

There will be a number of protective measures adopted by a Court or a Commission. The Courts and Commission would be empowered to adopt and enforce necessary protective measures including the following: conducting proceedings in-camera; adoption of measures

1089 1090

necessary to prevent the victim or witness from being subjected to unnecessary harassment; intimidation or influenced by seeing the accused present at the venue of the trial; preventing the identity and the background of the victim or the witness or relevant parts of their testimony from being disclosed to those other than the accused and his lawyers.

Protection could be withdrawn when it becomes not necessary any further and such occasions have been identified in the Bill and could be summarized as follows: when the need for protection no longer exists; when the victim or witness requests that protection be terminated; when the victim or witness refuses to receive protection; when protection is abused; when the victim or witness acts contrary to the terms of the MoU; and when the victim or witness is found to have given a false statement or testimony; or false information to obtain protection.

Sir, one of the most important features in this Bill is that the victim is entitled to receive compensation in the same proceedings unlike in the previous procedure where you had to file a separate civil action, which takes years and years, and by the time a decision is taken, the purpose of the claimant is virtually lost. But, this provides immediate relief. In the Bill it is provided that every High Court and Magistrates Court convicting a person of any offence, can direct the convict to pay compensation to the victim of a crime, an amount extending up to Rs. 1 million. When compensation or damages are being considered by a civil court, this amount should be taken into consideration.

It further provides for testimony through the contemporaneous audio-visual links. The victim or the witness will be permitted to testify from a remote location via a cotemporaneous or near-contemporaneous audio-visual link. A court-appointed officer will remain at the remote location from where the victim or the witness is testifying, to provide authenticity to the process.

The High Commissioner has stated, I have received clear commitments from the new Government of Sri Lanka indicating it is prepared to cooperate with my office on a whole range of important human rights issues which the previous Government had absolutely refused to do, and I need to engage with them to ensure those commitments translate into reality. He further stated, I have therefore decided, on balance, to request more time to allow for a stronger and more comprehensive report.

, , ,

, will the new Government acknowledge the UN international investigation via the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and agree to cooperate with its mandate? Will the new Government give immediate access to the OISL team to Sri Lanka? Will the Government accept and arrange the visits of Special Rapporteurs to Sri Lanka which are pending?

Sir, the visits of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression and Working Group on enforced or involuntary disappearances, Special Rapporteur on summary executions, Special Rapporteur on torture and others are still pending for a long time since the Government of Sri Lanka has not accepted their requests or cooperated with their office.

The present Government has made a commitment to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to cooperate with him. So, I would like to know whether the Government will allow them to come to Sri Lanka for the investigations, so that a clear and a proper report can be given in the coming month of April. The Government wants to postpone the United Nations Human Rights Investigation Report. If they actually want it in September, they must tell it very clearly to the

1099 1100

2015 19

people because the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has said that the Government has made a range of commitments to him. Therefore, I would like to clearly know from the Government Benchers whether you will be doing that.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Peiris, you may start your speech.

[3.05 p.m.] () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am very happy to participate in this Debate on an important piece of legislation, following my Friend the Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala. This is undoubtedly a piece of legislation which goes a long way to fill a gap that has existed in the legal system of Sri Lanka. It is, therefore, an exceedingly timely and welcome piece of legislation. However, I would like to point out that there are several deficiencies in the Bill which we can still correct at the Committee Stage before this legislation is enacted in a final form. I say this particularly because this is a very far-reaching piece of legislation. That is indicated in Clause 38 of this Bill which declares that the provisions of this Bill shall have legal force overriding the provisions of any other law to the extent of inconsistency. So, if there is a conflict between the provisions of the law, which we are debating in this House today, and the provisions of any other statute law except, of course, the Constitution, then this particular piece legislation is entitled to prevail. So, it has a special status in that sense in the legal system of Sri Lanka.

A novel feature of this law which is also particularly significant in the current context, is the provision contained in the Clause 31 which enables testimony to be given through audio-visual linkage without the person giving that evidence, being physically present in court. That is an important change. So, using modern technology, a person can give evidence which is acted upon by a court of law, even though that person is not present in court at the time of giving his evidence.

It is important that this is confined to evidence given within Sri Lanka. The words within Sri Lanka are contained in Clause 31. I would like to refer briefly to the history of this legislation. In the year 2008, when the Assistance and Protection to Victims of Crime and Witnesses Bill was presented, it contained a provision enabling evidence to be given outside Sri Lanka through audio-visual linkage. Now, happily, that provision has been deleted from this legislation. When the 2008 law was challenged in the Supreme Court, Justice Shiranee Tilakawardane had some comments to make with regard to that matter. But, we do not need to pursue that further at this time because there is no provision in the existing law for evidence to be given in this manner outside Sri Lanka.

There is a further safeguard that is contained in Clause 32 (1)(a) which gives discretion to the Attorney-General

and to the Secretary of the Ministry of Justice to make a recommendation that in particular circumstances, evidence should not be received in this manner. In this connection, there is a suggestion that I would like to make to the Hon. Minister of Justice and this has to do with the provision contained in Clause 3(h) of this Bill which uses the word legal counsel. That is, a victim is entitled to be represented by legal counsel. That is the phraseology that is used in Clause 3(h). Now, the Supreme Court in its Determination - a copy of which I have here - has suggested that the word legal counsel should be deleted and that it should be replaced by the phrase attorney-at-law. That is to make it very clear that the person representing the victim should be an attorney-at-law of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. Legal counsel is a term which is used to refer to practising lawyers in other countries. It is a word that is commonly used in that context, but here we want to make it very clear that the lawyer representing the victim should be an attorney-at-law of the Supreme Court of this country and not a foreign lawyer. So, I think that should be the subject of an appropriate Committee Stage amendment.

Then, the other deficiencies in the Bill, which I would like to point out. The whole purpose of this legislation is to inspire confidence. The object of the Bill is to give protection to victims and witnesses, to encourage to come forward and give evidence without fear in their minds. That will, therefore, improve the quality of the administration of justice because the court of law will have at its disposal the full range of evidence that is necessary to arrive at the truth in regard to the matter which is the subject of the judicial inquiry. So, the whole idea is to give people confidence to come forward without fear, without anxiety, without apprehension.

There are some provisions in the Bill which militate against that objective. For example, there is a very powerful body that is established within the police force. I am happy that my Friend, the Hon. John Amaratunga is in the Chamber at this time. So, a very powerful mechanism for the implementation of this legislation is located within the police force and this is the "Victims of Crime and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division" of the police force. It is established by Clause 19(1) and this is a body that is created by the Inspector-General of Police, in accordance with guidelines by the National Authority. Clause 19(2) provides that a Senior Superintendent of Police shall be in charge of this Division. One of the deficiencies in the Bill is that there is no reference, whatsoever, about who will actually comprise this Division. This is a very powerful division and it performs crucial functions. For example, according to Clause 20(3), this Division within the police force has the power to decide whom to admit and whom to reject as beneficiaries of this programme. So, they have a discretion to decide who should actually be admitted into this programme.

Unfortunately, there is no indication, whatsoever, as to who would constitute this Division and what are the

1105 1106

criteria that are applicable in that regard. I think that is a clear deficiency in the law. Everything is left vague. Who is going to constitute this body; in accordance with what criteria is the body going to be constituted, is all left vague, nebulous and open-ended. That is not going to inspire confidence in the victim or the witness and to that extent the purpose of the law is frustrated.

Then, there is a further deficiency that is contained in Clause 21(2) of the Bill, which says that a request for protection should be made to an officer-in-charge of a police station. So, if I want protection, I have to go to the officer-in-charge of the police station. He is one of the people to whom I can make this request. But, in a situation where the person concerned is wanting protection from the police force itself, then there is an anomaly here and an obvious conflict. So, that again is something that stands in the way of accomplishment of the objectives underpinning the very beneficial legislation which is before the House this afternoon.

I would also like to bring to the notice of the Hon. Minister of Justice that there is a deficiency with regard to Clause 22(1) of the Bill. Clause 22(1) sets out different kinds of protection which are available, what sort of protection can be given. There are six different kinds of protection that are made available. But, there is no indication of the criteria in accordance with which this decision is made. If a person comes forward asking for this protection, asking to be admitted to the programme, how does one decide whether that person qualifies or does not qualify for admission? The criteria are not stipulated and that again represents a lacuna in the Bill.

There is a very useful article which has been written on this subject by an author called Rosalind Sipos and in that article, there is a citation of the Model Witness Protection Bill published in the year 2000 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. In this draft legislation there is an exhaustive enumeration of the criteria which can be called in aid in this regard and, in fact, those criteria are applicable in the law of several jurisdictions, including Hong Kong.

I would respectfully submit that the Sri Lankan legislation be significantly improved by the inclusion of criteria, which would determine whether a request for assistance is accepted or not. There are also some problems connected with the allocation of responsibility. Who actually decides whether a request is to be accepted or not? Clause 13(d) of this Bill states that the National Authority for Protection can perform this function. They will appoint an officer to carry out any inquiry and if that officer finds prima-facie evidence, then three members of the Board will meet to consider the matter.

So, one of the bodies having the power to make this decision is the National Authority. But, the National

Authority is not the only organ which has that power. It is also available in terms of Clause 19(3) to the Division that is set up by the Inspector-General of Police. So, there is a certain duplication of functions. This function can be performed by the National Authority; it can equally well be performed by the Division set up by the Inspector- General of Police.

That per se is not an objection, but there are other problems which are reflected in the text of the law. Clause 20(3) states that the Police Division may act on the recommendation of the Authority. So, the Authority recommends and the Police Division can give effect to that. But, Clause 20(4) states that the Division can provide this relief only after the conduct of a threat assessment by the Division. So, the Division is required to make a threat assessment. It is only after that, the relief requested can be provided.

Now, to my mind, there is a clear contradiction between Clause 20(4) and Clause 22(3). Clause 20(4) states that the Police Division can give this relief only after carrying out a threat assessment. On the other hand, Clause 22(3) states, I quote: When providing protection or assistance to any victim of crime or a witness, the Division shall act in accordance with the advice and recommendations made by the Authority. So, there seems to be a conflict between those two provisions.When the Authority makes a recommendation, is the Police Division bound to carry that out or would the Police Division act only after making an independent threat assessment and being satisfied that the relief sought is required?

There is also a gap in the Bill with regard to another matter. That is the removal or variation of protection, which is provided for in Clause 22(5). Naturally, the Bill has to provide for certain circumstances in which protection once given, can be withdrawn. For example, if the beneficiary of that protection abuses that protection or commits a breach of the peace or violates the memorandum of understanding in accordance with which the protection has been provided, of course, in those circumstances the protection has to be withdrawn. There are several persons who have the authority to withdraw that protection. There is a National Authority, a Senior Superintendent of Police in charge of the Division, or a Commission. All these people can order the removal of protection once given. That is frank. There is no problem about that. But, sometimes, protection withdrawn needs to be restored on certain conditions being satisfied. The giving of protection is not permanent. The withdrawal of protection is also not permanent. So, there are circumstances in which protection withdrawn may have to be made available once more, resumed. The South African law for example sets out very clearly

1107 1108

[ () . . ]

2015 19

circumstances in which there can be resumption of the protection which has been withdrawn. The Sri Lankan law has a hiatus in that regard, because there is no comparable provision governing the resumption of protection once it has been withdrawn.

There is also a defect, in my view, and I would like the Hon. Minister of Justice to give his mind to that. There seems to be a defect with regard to Clause 36 (1). That is, it creates an offence if any person were to disclose that "X" is a beneficiary of this programme. Then, that is an offence. If I were to say that "so and so" is benefiting from this programme, that of course would endanger that person. It would put him in jeopardy and, quite rightly, it has been characterized as an offence by the provision contained in Clause 36(1). It is proper but it is incomplete. What should be criminalized is not simply the disclosure that a particular person is a beneficiary of the programme. If you look at the Canadian legislation, for example, any disclosure with regard to the location of that person - you know, in some circumstances you may have to provide a person with a temporary abode, some address, a means of livelihood. Those are effective means of providing protection for victims and witnesses. So, if there is any divulging of the location of that person or any temporary employment, which may have been provided for him as a means of livelihood, those can also not be disclosed, because if those are disclosed, that would also entail substantial jeopardy to a person who happens to be a beneficiary of this programme. Those situations are catered for by the law applicable in other jurisdictions, notably Canada, but that is entirely lacking in the provisions of the Sri Lankan Bill, which is the subject of Debate in this august Assembly today.

The Hon. Minister of Justice may also like to consider whether he is entirely satisfied with the definition of the word, witness, that is contained in Clause 46. Particularly, in our culture, it often happens that threats are directed not only to the person concerned, but to the spouse or to a child, for example. In some countries, the ambit of the protection is not rigidly confined to the particular person whose evidence is required in a court of law, but legitimately that protection is extended to members of his family. But, the definition of the word, witness in the draft Bill, contained in Clause 46, is perhaps incomplete and inadequate in that regard.

There is also, to my mind, a problem with regard to the financial provisions under Clause 39. Clause 39 is a crucial provision, because it governs finance. Clause 39(1) states, I quote:

The provisions of Article 154 of the Constitution relating to the audit of the accounts of public corporations shall apply to and in relation to the audit of the accounts of the Fund of the Authority and the Protection Fund.

Clause 39(2) states, I quote:

The provisions of Part II of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971 shall mutatis mutandis apply to the financial control and accounts of the Funds referred to in subsection (1).

But surely, in this area of the law, you need to strike a perceptive balance between transparency, and accountability. Of course, these are public funds and the manner in which these funds are disbursed and expended needs to be known by the public. But, at the same time, there is a real need for secrecy, because you are protecting somebody who is very vulnerable and unless that person is satisfied in his or her own mind that they are safe, their family is safe, they will not come forward to give evidence. The entire object of this law is to remove inhibition in the minds of potential witnesses and to encourage them to come to a court of law and offer testimony without any vestige of fear or apprehension in their minds. Consequently, the provisions dealing with finance fail to accomplish that objective and do not, in my opinion, establish the equilibrium that is required in this area of the law.

So, these are some of the suggestions which I would like to make for consideration by the Hon. Minister of Justice and if he feels that some of these ideas should be incorporated into the law by way of Committee Stage Amendments, then, I would commend these matters for his attention.

The Supreme Court, in their Determination, has already pointed out some areas whether there is a lack of clarity. For example, three judges of the Supreme Court presided over by the present Chief Justice, have pointed out that the provisions of Clause 3(c), relating to procedures for redress, need to be improved. So, I am sure, that will be done by the Government at the Committee Stage. The Supreme Court has a -

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) We are going to incorporate all the amendments suggested by the Supreme Court.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) The point I am making, Hon. Minister, is that apart from Clauses 3(c) and 3(f), those are deficiencies which have been specifically pointed out by the Supreme Court. I am happy that the Government is accepting those suggestions and moving the Committee Stage amendments accordingly.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you have one more minute.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Okay, Sir. But, those are not the only areas where there is a lack of clarity. I have pointed out at least six or

1109 1110

seven areas where there is that a lack of clarity and that impinges upon matters of substance and can well stultify, at least in part, the very opportune and beneficial objectives that you are striving to achieve, quite admirably, by the presentation of this legislation to Parliament.

So, I would suggest that in addition to the suggestions made by the Supreme Court in respect of particular provisions of the Bill, that you give your mind more broadly to some of the other gaps in the Bill, because there are many gaps and if you compare this legislation with what is operative in other parts of the world, then we can see that the protection that is offered is incomplete in several crucial respects, and it may therefore be worth focusing on those areas in order to make the law more effective and to accomplish with greater efficiency, the laudable policy objectives which underpin the provisions of this legislation.

I thank you, Sir. [.. 3.26]

That is the reason. If this law had been enacted and if this was in existence, this would not have happened. Even in the case of the assassination of the former Minister, Hon. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, there is a lot of controversy. There are different arguments that come up as to who did it; how it was done; how people were kept hidden in a house; they ran away and half way through they were murdered. There are a lot of stories. But, we could not arrive at a final decision. I will come to that.

Hon. Presiding Member, this Bill that is before the House today, is perhaps one of those pieces of legislation which has undergone a long gestation period though the Bill itself has been a long-felt need in the Criminal Justice system of Sri Lanka.

I must thank the Hon. Lalith Dissanayake for having made some critical comments on this Bill. I, perhaps, am one of those in the Chamber today, who can be much relieved that this Bill is being finally taken up for debate and adoption. Being somewhat exhausted attempting to get this through the Cabinet, - it has been going back and forth from the Attorney-Generals Department, then to the Police Department - it is indeed a matter of relief that finally we see the Bill being presented by my successor, the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and debated. In a sense, it is a matter of conscience and a matter of credibility for all of us since this has been an assurance that we have even given to the international community at different forums including in Geneva. This Bill was originally formulated as a result of the National Centre for Victims of Crime promoting this, and then, way back in the year 2000, it was proposed that the Law Commission examines the need for this legislation. Unfortunately, though they started work in the year 2000, they shelved it for a while. Then, in 2004, it was revived once again and we were able to have deliberations with different forums, both governmental and the civil society. The Bill has had the benefit of input from diverse segments of society and has even been vetted through the Consultative Committee process several times.

Here, I must, particularly thank two officials of the Attorney-General's Department, Mr. Yasantha Kodagoda, who is present in the Officials' Box, and Mr. Sarath

Jayamanne, both of whom are now Additional Solicitors-General. They had assisted me when I was given this responsibility. I believe one has already taken silk and the other is due to take silk in a few days' time. Let me congratulate them and recognize them for having contributed immensely in the deliberations in trying to see this Bill through multifarious forums through which it had been vetted.

I must say that mid-way, in 2006, unfortunately with the institution of the so-called International Independent Group of Eminent Persons, who were appointed to supervise the Commission of Inquiry that was set up to go into 10 incidents of grave crime or some tragic incidents that took place during that period, the Bill itself became a very controversial subject getting entangled in political debate and that was particularly because of the incidents relating to the massacre of five students in Trincomalee and thereafter the so-called massacre of 17 aid workers in Muttur which became a matter of discussion in many international forums. Particularly, in the Universal Periodic Review Sessions in Geneva, our delegation had to face many hardships in trying to assure the international community that we, indeed, are concerned with the safety of victims and witnesses and that we are quite ready to make this idea of Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Bill, a reality. Ultimately, we have had some success in vetting it through different processes.

Let me tell you very briefly, Hon. Presiding Member, that some of us who have been in practice of the criminal law in the law courts of this country do know that victims of crime are quite often very reluctant to report the crime. Then, we also see witnesses seldom volunteer to make statements to the police. This is something that we see in everyday life. Victims of crime and witnesses are reluctant to come to court to testify. Then, we have victims of crime and witnesses who are not only reluctant to testify, they very often change their version of the story. Then, we also have the overall efficacy of the criminal justice system that gets adversely affected because of these issues connected with victims and witnesses. And, therefore a mechanism of this nature which gives protection to victims of crime and witnesses is a long-felt need in our criminal justice system.

I am sure my Friend, the Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake who looks after childrens affairs as far as her portfolio is concerned and others perhaps will deal with child victims and witnesses and women particularly, who very often are so reluctant to come before courts of law or to even report a crime to the police. Due to tender age, inherent weaknesses and vulnerabilities, the situation of child victims of crime and witnesses is much worse than adult victims. Family members and guardians of child victims of crime and witnesses also face numerous problems during the criminal justice process purely because of matters of stigma when it relates to social

1131 1132

[ ]

2015 19

issues and outrageous incidents that can happen to women in particular, and children. Therefore, this particular Bill, I am sure, is a long-felt need in our criminal justice system and we are all relieved that we have been able to finally bring this to some fruition.

I must say that there are two categories of beneficiaries here which all of us know. One is, victims of crime and the other is witnesses. Then there are two forms of relief that are sought to be given. One is, assistance and the other is the protection.

The objectives of this law are also very clear: set out and recognize rights and entitlements of victims of crime and witnesses; establishe mechanisms to promote, protect, enforce and exercise such rights and entitlements; provide for rendering of assistance and protection to victims of crime and witnesses; provide for payment of compensation to victims of crime; provide for obtaining redress by victims of crime including restitution, reparation and rehabilitation; set out duties and responsibilities of judicial officers, police officers and other public officers with regard to victims of crime and witnesses; stipulate offences that may be committed in respect of victims and crime and witnesses; provide for implementation of internationally accepted norms and best practices relating to the protection of victims of crime and witnesses. This, I believe, have all been embodied in an elaborate way in the several sections that deal with the different aspects of this Bill.

Then, we also have the issue relating to the protection of whistle-blowers. A whistle-blower is a person who is not connected with the victim or the witness; he could be a public-spirited person who could come forward to throw some light on a possible crime having taken place. No person who has provided information regarding the commission of an offence, infringement of fundamental rights or human rights in such persons employment environment, shall be harassed, subjected to suffering, loss or damage, or any adverse change in conditions of employment. This is something praiseworthy for having been included.

We also have the establishment of the National Authority for the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses and the Board of Management. I am sure the Hon. Minister will select the right type of people with the correct credentials to man these institutions that will be created. That will be done without delay once the Hon. Speaker places his signature and the Bill becomes law. This is going to bring lot of relief to many people. Unfortunately, as I told you, this had got entangled in political controversy because of some of the unfortunate tragic incidents that happened in the past and had got the country also into some disrepute for having procrastinated in passing this Bill.

Having been the former Minister of Justice, I have been at the receiving end of criticism by many Members

on both sides of the House perhaps and particularly from the Opposition. Now, I find myself among those very people who criticized me for having delayed bringing this Bill to fruition. But, as I told you, Sir, I am a much-relieved person today because we see the light of day at the end the tunnel.

Then, Sir, we have this important aspect leading to the protective measures to be adopted by a court or a commission of inquiry. Courts and Commissions would be empowered to adopt and enforce necessary protective measures, including the following: conducting proceedings in-camera which is quite often done in courts of law in this country; adoption of measures necessary to prevent victims of crime or witnesses from being subjected to unnecessary harassment, intimidation, or influenced by seeing the accused present at the venue of the trial. This particularly relates to child victims most of the time; preventing the identity and the background of the victim of crime or witnesses, or relevant parts of their testimony from being disclosed to those other than the accused and his lawyers. That, sometimes becomes absolutely necessary in a trial particularly when it comes to protecting victims of crime.

The Bill also goes to the extent when the protection will be withdrawn, which is also quite important, because otherwise, it brings in unnecessary expenses to the State to keep on providing protection to victims and to witnesses. Protection will be withdrawn when the need for protection no longer exists; when the victim of crime or witness requests that protection be terminated; when the victim of crime or witness refuses to receive protection - that also can happen. It has been observed in the past that sometimes giving protection can also attract unnecessary attention onto yourselves. Protection may also be withdrawn when protection is abused - that is another possibility. People can abuse the protection they get for a variety of other purposes. Protection may also be withdrawn when the victim of crime or witness acts contrary to the terms of the memorandum of understanding entered into; when the victim of crime or witness is found to have given a false statement or testimony or false information to obtain protection - this too can happen to people who have been associated with such situations in the past in a court of law.

Then, the most important other aspect which perhaps attracted some attention from some Members who participated in the Debate today, is this testimony through contemporaneous audio-visual link and this was particularly an issue which resulted in the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons, which oversaw the conduct of the inquiry by that Commission of Inquiry, that was appointed.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, you have exceeded your time.

1133 1134

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, I am winding up.

That particular Commission, which was led by a very eminent jurist from our region, Justice Bhagawati, got into a very awkward situation where our own Attorney-General virtually challenged the right of the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons to stipulate conditions for the testimony through contemporaneous audio-visual link, resulting from a particular testimony and while it was being recorded, it ran into a controversy.

So, all these dragged this whole issue into a muddle and finally brought us some disrepute, purely because some felt that we are deliberately procrastinating in bringing this Bill, based on some assumptions that we had something to hide. Certainly, we have nothing to hide and our judicial system is something that has been tested over a period of time. It may have gone through its own convolutions in the past and the efficacy of the system remains very much to the core. I am sure the introduction of a Bill of this nature will certainly enhance the value that our system enjoys and our criminal justice system will be very much richer in content with the introduction of this law.

Thank you very much, Sir. [.. 4.35]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Sir, there are about 182 suspects who have been taken into custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. They had been there for a long time. Now, we have appointed a committee to make an evaluation as to whether in fact there are evidences to prosecute them. After obtaining that report within two or three weeks, we may be able to make a decision very soon. With regard to the detainees against whom there are no material evidence, we will have to take steps to release them.
