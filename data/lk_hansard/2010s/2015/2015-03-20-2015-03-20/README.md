( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. R. Yogarajan. You have 10 minutes. [5.20 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I thought I should answer the Hon. Member from Ampara who spoke about the National Anthem in this House, but I am glad that the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, very appropriately, set the facts correct in this House. The Hon. Member from Ampara was saying that nobody sings the Indian National Anthem in Tamil in India. That is true. India is a Federal State where each State has its own anthem. So, they sing their own State Anthem in the language of that State. The National Anthem of India is not in the language of the majority community like in Sri Lanka, or at least, like the Member who wanted it to be sung only in Sinhala. It is in the language that is considered the sweetest language of India - Bengali. The Indian National Anthem was written by Rabindranath Tagore, Nobel Laureate, and it is valued equally by everyone in that country. As far as Sri Lanka is concerned, the Constitution provides for it to be sung in both languages. The choice is left to the people. The meaning and the tune are the same, and I do not think that people like the Hon. Member who spoke about it, should object to the singing of the National Anthem in both languages.

The Hon. Lasantha Alagiyawanna when he spoke, referred to the propaganda during the elections, saying that we spoke as if we knew everything. Not only we, even the people knew everything that was happening in this country - all the corruption, all the bribery that was taking place. That is one of the main reasons they replaced your Presidency and had the desire to change the Government. Maybe, we still have not brought to book all those who were involved in corruption, but the process is going on. The supporters of the UNP are asking us everyday, "Why are you not catching the rogues?" . We just do not want to bring people before courts; to arrest them; to remand them or to harass anybody like you did to Sarath

Fonseka - who contested against the former President - on false charges. Suddenly, his son-in-law who was in hiding, emerged on your side just before the elections and you gave him a pardon. I do not know why. So, we are not indulging in that type of activity. We have set up a separate institution with lawyers, with policemen, to investigate every corrupt deal and bring the culprits to courts and try them legally, not to harass them in any other way. Due to all this, investment promotion is hindered in this country.

This morning, I listened to a speech by the High Commissioner of India hosted by the Colombo Club. He said that the balance of trade between India and Sri Lanka is very much in favour of India and the only way to correct this will be by exporting the manufactured goods of Sri Lanka. We are an economy where 65 per cent of our GDP is from services. A service-oriented economy has very little to grow. We all know, GDP - Gross Domestic Product - means more production; more production means a higher GDP. But, production can be from services rendered to the citizenry of the country and to foreigners who visit us. So, 65 per cent of our GDP is from services and during the last regime, this was manipulated in such a way that we had a false-high GDP, where we tried to show that we are reaching an almost US Dollars 4,000 per capita income, which is not realistic because we do not find anybody in this country who has access to that type of income for us to say that our real GDP is so much. It could be, to some extent, due to the imbalance between the richest and the poorest. But, a GDP of US Dollars 3,800 or 4,000, as you all used to boast, does not seem realistic.

Due to the corrupt deals that have been going on in the past, we have had to stop many of the projects, review them, see what their real cost is, how much has been spent as top-up or bribes to the decision-makers and then resume those projects. So, when we do this, those contractors, sometimes from abroad, feel that there is an unfriendly business atmosphere in this country and bringing in investment is becoming more difficult. Normally, any UNP Government is considered as investment-friendly and as soon as we assume office, large-scale investments come into the country, which not only builds up our economy, but also brings in the know-how, long-term growth and real growth. But, all that is now pending. One reason for this is the lack of confidence that investments can come into the country in a friendly atmosphere because we have had to investigate many of the investment proposals that the previous Government had brought in.

Today, we have an airport and a harbour which are not productive. A large amount of money had been borrowed to construct those and those monies have to be paid back. And, because we cannot pay those back, we are giving part of that harbour to the country that built it. That is creating a lot of diplomatic issues with our closest

531 532

[ ]

2015 20

neighbour. So, these are the ways in which the previous Government functioned.

Today, economists in this country feel that a planned economy is necessary. In the past, we never had any idea as to which part of the economy needs to be developed; in which part of the economy we had to invest. It was not decided by the Government. We had no national plan. Somebody from abroad or any investor sponsored by the cronies of the Government would come and say, We are willing to construct this road. The cost will be so much. How much do you want as top-up? We are willing to pay that also and we will bring in the money. Then, they were given the contracts. So, haphazard development has taken place, not based on the needs of the people of the nation or the economy, but based on the unsolicited proposals that came into this country. So, there is an imbalance in the development of the country, which is very unfortunate.

We have been told by our Ministers that construction projects of hundreds of roads have been approved and work has been started, but there were no contracts signed with the contractors. Many of those projects proposed at, maybe, Rs. 200 million in the beginning, ended up at Rs. 400 million. But, the Government had to pay because there was no proper contract and that was also paid to people who were close to the Government. And, because they got something out of it, they did not object, but just paid. But, whose money are you paying? You are paying the money you have borrowed, which has to be repaid by the people of this country. So, you have been burdening the people. We have had to review these projects and that is causing delays and the people get disappointed.

Thank you. [.. 5.31]
