Further, in line with the liberalization of the exchange controls, I propose to abolish Securities Investment Account (SIA) through which the foreign investors have been requested to channel their investments to the country. Instead, I propose that investors should be allowed to bring in their money to Sri Lanka through any bank account existing in the formal banking system. The Government shall not take any criminal action against any person making inward remittances of such monies held overseas through the banking channel except in instances where the proceeds are the result of terrorism, drugs, human trafficking and corruption. I also propose to expand the scope of the exemption available under the Inland Revenue Act for services rendered outside Sri Lanka, provided all transactions are made through the banking channels.

The Governments short-sighted policies resulted in the loss of markets whereby the country saw substantially high trade deficits. Sri Lankas merchandise export, as a share of GDP has declined from 33.3 per cent in 2000 to 14 per cent in 2014 while Sri Lankas share in the global export market also has shrunk from 0.09 per cent to 0.06 per cent during the same period reflecting requirement for further measures to exploit its potential and improve its relative position through export diversification and bilateral regional trading agreements.

It is time that they too reciprocated. They must deliver now. Given that we have now entered into a flexible exchange rate policy, I see no reason why there should be an excuse for exporters not to bring their foreign funds back to Sri Lanka. Therefore, I urge all Sri Lankan exporters to remit their export proceeds in full, with immediate effect. This will further strengthen the macro fundamentals that will create the platform for a better economic environment. I am sure if you are truly Sri Lankan, you would not let Mother Lanka down.

I reiterate that such mergers should be carried out while ensuring the job security of all related staff. There are many companies and banks that have come forward. They only talk. So, we call upon the private sector to come forward. It is a wake-up call. Now it is time to walk the talk. We as a Government is setting policies. We are doing this on behalf of the industries. It is time for a continuous dialogue to ensure that they quickly go forward. So, I encourage all companies and banks that are talking of mergers to ensure that it is done. You will have a robust financial growth in this country owing to the policies that we are now implementing.",

Financial institutions have become over reliant on collateral-based financing, which new entrepreneurs as well as existing entrepreneurs are not in a position to provide. Therefore, I propose to implement a MSMEs Credit Guarantee Scheme in 2016 with Rs. 500 million contributed by the Government as initial capital together with the assistance of selected financial institutions. Under this scheme, the 75 per cent of the principal amount, if in default, of the total facility will be guaranteed. This will expand MSMEs access to financing options, which are relatively cheaper and long-term. In this regard, we have also been successful in obtaining a credit line of US Dollars 100 million from the ADB to support MSME lending at concessional rates. Further, the funding schemes such as Saubhagya scheme and the Poverty Alleviation Micro-finance Project (PAMP) that Central Bank has implemented to help SMEs will be merged into one large SME facility. The merger of these funds will create synergies that will enable the Central Bank to serve the MSME sector better.",

Our consumers also get a raw deal with substandard produce often at exorbitant prices. Hence, we recognize the urgent necessity for a reversal of this vicious trend. An out-of-the-box thinking is the need of the hour. It is in this context that our Government, led by His Excellency the President and the Prime Minister, have focused their attention on formulating a new agricultural policy.

In addressing this issue, I propose to set up warehouses with state-of-the-art technology to address the issue of post-harvest losses, which is about 30 to 40 per cent. These warehouses provide good quality storage facilities for farmers during glut periods to store their produce such as paddy, maize, gingelly, pepper, black gram. Using the receipts issued by the warehouse, 50 per cent of the value will be paid to the farmers by the bank, thereby solving the immediate cash flow of the farmer. However, once the prices are favorable, the produce could be sold in the market for a better price. This method ensures the farmer is not exploited by unscrupulous middlemen while ensuring that farmers also reap benefit from the higher market prices that will prevail during the off season. Already the Government has constructed warehouses in the Districts of Anuradhapura, Monaragala while the Mannar Warehouse is under construction. This method also benefits the consumer as price of the produce will be lower, given that the cost incurred from the farm gate to the final consumer will now decrease with the elimination of the middlemen. As such, it is proposed that Rs. 1,000 million be allocated to construct three more warehouses in the Districts of Polonnaruwa, Kilinochchi and Ratnapura (Embilipitiya) while completing the balance work of the Mannar Warehouse.",

This House has approved many of these benefits including the provision of fertilizer subsidy, land, technical support, seeds and the list is endless. Yet, what is the status of agriculture today? The contribution from agriculture has gradually declined in relative terms. We cannot compete internationally as our yield per hectare remains below par. There is still debate over the over-usage of fertilizer resulting in complexities such as the Chronic Kidney Disease Unknown of Aetiology (CKDU) in key paddy cultivating areas, which has become a social issue. It has also led to water and soil contamination leading to many health issues and becoming an environmental hazard. The issue that we face today is critical in deciding on the future of our agriculture policy? Studies also note that there is no direct positive correlation between the use of fertilizer and productivity in paddy. In spite of the support given to paddy farmers, they remain an exploited segment of our society. Consumers also are not the recipients of the envisaged benefits. In the background where neither the farmer nor the consumer has reaped the envisaged benefit, I am therefore forced to revisit the plethora of the support extended to agriculture in various forms, such that it yields better benefits to both the farmer and the consumer. As such, I propose to provide the existing fertilizer subsidy scheme to small-scale paddy farmers. A cash grant of Rs. 25,000 covering the production year, Yala and Maha, will be provided to farmers for a maximum extent of 1 hectare. This will allow the farmer greater flexibility in selecting his farming inputs and I am confident that this will increase productivity. For this purpose I have allocated Rs. 37,500 million, which is an increase over Rs. 35,000 million provided in 2015.",

It is time that they too reciprocated. They must deliver now. Given that we have now entered into a flexible exchange rate policy, I see no reason why there should be an excuse for exporters not to bring their foreign funds back to Sri Lanka. Therefore, I urge all Sri Lankan exporters to remit their export proceeds in full with immediate effect. This will further strengthen the macro fundamentals that will create the platform for a better economic environment. I am sure if you are truly Sri Lankan, you would not let Mother Lanka down.

A wide differential between the deposit and lending rates is seen in the low efficiency financial sector which has caused high cost of intermediation to the public and businesses in Sri Lanka. The Government will provide initial capital of Rs.10 million as equity and also issue a Treasury bond to the value of Rs. 25 billion with a tenure of 5 years for the FIRA. The Central Bank will be entrusted to undertake strict supervision on this restructured finance companies. However, as a prelude to the above proposal in order to provide the depositors with a sense of comfort and security, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka will give a 100 per cent guarantee on all deposits of all the registered finance companies by end January 2016.",

Honourable Speaker, we do not currently have a good understanding of the implications of the growing diversity among the older Sri Lankans and the demand for these services.

The portfolio of investments of the Government includes not only SOEs engaged in maintaining and controlling key strategic infrastructure in power generation, transmission, ports, airports, water supply et cetera, but also investments in hotels, condominiums et cetera that are non-strategic. As such, as stated by the Honourable Prime Minister in his address on this floor, the Government is keen to streamline its portfolio of investments and will therefore exit partially or fully from those non-strategic investments in Lanka Hospitals, Hotel Developers PLC (Colombo Hilton), Hyatt Residencies, Waters Edge, Grand Oriental Hotel, Ceylinco Hospital and Mobitel by listing such investments in the Colombo Stock Exchange during 2016. The monies generated through such listings will be used to retire high cost debt accrued by the Rajapaksa regime. I note that the strategy of this Government is not one sided insofar that while the Government will not hesitate to exit from non-strategic assets, nevertheless the Government will monitor the market and will also not hesitate to invest in strategic assets locally and internationally should it align with the economic policy of the country.",

Since the previous Government has not implemented any remedial action in order to manage such price fluctuations, the price of essential food commodities in the market have increased rapidly today. By managing such fluctuations in order to provide consumers with a reasonable price for the food items while protecting the local farmers, I propose to reduce the Special Commodity Levy (SCL) of potatoes by Rs. 25 per kilogram. Accordingly, it is expected to provide a price ranging from Rs.75 to Rs. 85 for a kilogram of potatoes for the consumers. I also propose to reduce the SCL for big onions by Rs. 25 and to provide consumers with a price ranging from Rs. 85 to 95 per a kilogram of big onions. As I have stated before, I also propose to reduce the price of a 400 gram packet of locally manufactured milk powder which is another main commodity to Rs. 295 and in order to cover the",

Hon Speaker, I also propose to reduce the price of a canned fish tin of 425 grams to Rs. 125. Accordingly, I propose to provide a subsidy of Rs. 15 for a canned fish tin of 425 grams. Hon. Speaker, the consumer has to bear a high price for sprats which is another essential food item. The retail price of sprats oscillates varies considerably in the market. When Lanka Sathosa sells a kilo of sprats at a price of Rs. 380, the retail sellers sells at a high price of Rs. 800. I propose to limit the maximum retail price of Sprats to Rs. 410 per kilogram. As a result of the intermediaries being prevented by accruing unnecessarily large profits, the consumers will be able to benefit significantly. The consumers have to pay a high price for Dhal, which is another main public food commodity since the intermediate sellers keep a high profit margin. Though the cost of importation is around Rs. 130 per kilo of dhal, the selling price of dhal in the open market is as high as Rs. 220 per kilo. Accordingly, I propose to implement a maximum retail price of Rs. 169 per kilo of dhal in order to provide a reasonable price for the consumers. To do so, I will completely remove the SCL imposed on dhal. Honourable Speaker, I also propose to impose a maximum retail price of Rs. 1,100 for a kilo of Katta which is the most consumer demanded dried fish variety and to impose a maximum retail price of Rs. 425 for a dried fish kilo of Salaya. By doing so, I expect to protect the local dried fish producers and to provide consumers with a reasonable price for dried fish. Although the selling price of chick pea in the open market is high as Rs. 220 per kilo, the cost of importation per kilo of chick pea is as low as Rs.160. Accordingly, I propose to impose a maximum retail price of Rs. 169 for a kilo of chick pea in order to provide relief for the consumers. In addition, I also propose to reduce the price of a 12.5 Kg gas cylinder by Rs. 150 with immediate effect and to reduce the price of 1 litre of kerosene by Rs. 10 in order to provide relief for the poor. Stern legal action will be taken against the sale of kerosene oil mixed with other oil in order to prevent discrepancies faced by the poor.

It neither generates the required revenue nor encourages the people to save. Plethora of taxes coupled with a multiple band structure has complicated the tax system, tax administration and discouraged the taxpayers' voluntary compliance. Developments in the government revenue in past years show a rapid decrease, from 20 per cent of GDP in early 1990s to 11.3 per cent of GDP by 2014. The urgent necessity to increase this ratio has been clearly identified by the government and we aim to achieve a revenue target of 17 per cent of GDP by 2018.

However, due to the fact that cigarettes price increases from time to time and increased public awareness of the health hazards, now the annual cigarette consumption has declined to 3,000 million sticks. On the contrary, importation of beedi leaves has led to growing trends in beedi production. Although cigarettes prices were increased every year, beedi price has not been increased. In view of discouraging the consumption of tobacco and establishing a minimum price, I propose to increase Customs Duty on beedi leaves. Further, beedi manufacturing licence fee also to be increased from Rs.1,500/- to Rs.5,000/-. I also propose to discourage the importation of beedi as a finished product, by increasing Customs Duty.
