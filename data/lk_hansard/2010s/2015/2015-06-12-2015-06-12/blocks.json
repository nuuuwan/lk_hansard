Second, the former Ambassador notes that she disseminated propaganda from the Tamil Information Centre, which was lilnked to the LTTE. I term her activities propaganda and not activism because they were lies. This was established when the UNDP denounced her telex to the World Council of Churches as factually inaccurate. Third, President J.R. Jayewardene echoed common knowledge at the time when he referred to her as \"terrorist agent. Fourth, reports from the Sri Lankan Mission in Geneva note that Ms. Kunanayakam was an active member of the \"Eelam lobby\" in the 1980s. Together, this forms very substantial evidence that she advanced the LTTEs interests in Geneva.",

I have merely stated facts which prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that she advanced the interests of the LTTE and worked against the interests of the Sri Lankan Government. However, I do not consider her as a human rights activist because her past record shows that she had been a mouthpiece of extremists and has a weakness for fascist leaders and some of the worst apologists of human rights violations.",

One such restriction is that discussions on matters pending adjudication before courts of law should be avoided on the floor of the House, so that the courts function uninfluenced by anything said outside the ambit of trial, in dealing with such matters.",

Though this has now come into prominence because of the large number of boat people who are leaving the shores of Myanmar to seek asylum in other countries, initially, some countries made them out to be economic refugees and refused to give them asylum. It is a matter of relief that countries like Malaysia and Indonesia have finally accepted the responsibility to give them asylum, and Sri Lanka too had not become an exception to this lot of boat people who turned up at our shores last year in several parts of our Island. We had ourselves housed some of these refugees, numbering more than 200, in Mirihana and we have a few of them still in transit camps in Wellawatta. I was told that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had taken them under their care and most of them have now been able to secure asylum in countries like the United States of America.",

Some of us, the minority politicians took up this issue and I, despite the fact that I was a Member of the Cabinet of the last regime, took this matter before the Organization of Islamic Countries and finally it resulted in the Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic Countries writing to the former regime of this country wanting to send a fact-finding mission. Similarly, the Organization of Islamic Countries has also intervened in the Myanmar situation and they have taken an additional step of appointing a Special Envoy of the Organization of Islamic Countries to try and mediate on behalf of the unfortunate victims, the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. What is finally left for the civilized world to do is to urge the Myanmar administration to treat these citizens of that country with respect and to give them the safeguards with their entitlements under all Human Rights Conventions, which have been adopted by the international community.",

Fortunately, Sri Lanka, being a democratic country, we had the opportunity to change regimes through the power of the ballot, but then, in countries like Myanmar, democracy is still to bloom to the extent to which we are experiencing. A transition period is now being observed in Myanmar and we find that a presidential election is due very soon. But then, the denial of right to contest for people like Aung San Suu Kyi in Myanmar is something that the international community is still not paying enough heed to. I believe, if the Myanmarese people are given full democracy, issues of this nature could be curtailed, at least, through the power of the ballot. In that regard, we should try and address these issues by adhering to principles of democratic traditions.",
