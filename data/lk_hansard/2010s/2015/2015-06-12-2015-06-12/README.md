asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs:

(a) Will he state - (i) whether he has claimed in a recent interview on Swarnavahini that Ms. Tamara Kunanayakam, the former Sri Lankan Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva had been a representative of the LTTE in the period of 1989 to 1990; (ii) if so, on which evidence the said statement was made; and (iii) if the aforesaid evidence deems to be substantial, whether steps will be taken to proscribe Ms. Kunanayakam? (b) Is he aware that Ms. Kunanayakam was a Human Rights activist during and around the period mentioned (a)(i) and supportive of the "Mothers Front" activities in which the Hon. Minister himself was connected? (c) Will he also state whether the Human Rights activism of Ms. Kunanayakam is the accusation of sympathy for terrorism? (d) If not, why? ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Sir, I table* the answer for Question No.5 - 6036/15 (3).

* : * : * Answer tabled:

(a)

(i) No, I did not claim that she was an LTTE representative. I claimed on Rathu Ira that she acted

777 778

2015 12

on the LTTEs behalf. By this I meant that she aided and abetted the LTTEs interests through her propaganda.

(ii) This claim was made on the basis of four pieces of evidence. First, in his book The War or Peace in Sri Lanka and in Agony of Sri Lanka, former ambassador T.D.S.A. Dissanayake who as a senior diplomat had firsthand knowledge of these issues, refers to Tamara Kunanayakam as a Geneva based Eelam propagandist. Second, the former Ambassador notes that she disseminated propaganda from the Tamil Information Centre, which was lilnked to the LTTE. I term her activities propaganda and not activism because they were lies. This was established when the UNDP denounced her telex to the World Council of Churches as factually inaccurate. Third, President J.R. Jayewardene echoed common knowledge at the time when he referred to her as "terrorist agent. Fourth, reports from the Sri Lankan Mission in Geneva note that Ms. Kunanayakam was an active member of the "Eelam lobby" in the 1980s. Together, this forms very substantial evidence that she advanced the LTTEs interests in Geneva.

(iii) Internal investigations are currently underway into the appointment and conduct of several politically appointed diplomats who were employed under the previous government. We will take necessary steps based on the results of those investigations. However, proscription is not an option we are considering.

(b) I along with Mahinda Rajapaksa MP were the conveners of the Mothers Front movement established by me in 1990. During this period Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa would regularly travel to Geneva to visit the UN Commission on Human Rights, the predecessor of the UN Human Rights Council, with information and evidence of human rights violations and other disappearances. I understand that Ms. Kunanayakam who was in Geneva at the time and a member of the World Student Christian Federation which facilitated Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksas entry into many of these sessions. I have also been told that she has provided bed, lodgings and other comforts. She may have supported the activities of Mr. Rajapaksa but I am certainly not aware of any support to the Mothers Front from Ms. Kunanayakam.

(c) It is obvious from Ms. Kunanayakams allegations against Ms. Senewiratne that it is she that resorts to accusations of the LTTE interest when she wants to defame her rivals. I have merely stated facts which prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that she advanced the interests of the LTTE and worked against the interests of the Sri Lankan Government. However, I do not consider her as a human rights activist because her past record shows that she had been a mouthpiece of extremists and has a weakness for fascist leaders and some of the worst apologists of human rights violations.

Sir, I just want to answer the specific questions raised by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition last afternoon. The answer is:

(1) As the Press Statement issued by the Member of Parliament from the TNA, the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, and the Director of Strategic Initiatives of the GTF, Mr. Suren Surendiran, indicated very clearly, what was discussed were:

the needs of the displaced people, providing for their housing, providing basic facilities so that they could resettle in the lands that have been returned to them,

the release of prisoners held under the PTA of those who cannot be charged and the process that is currently underway,

the annual review of the persons listed under the regulations of Gazette Nos. 1758/19 dated 15th May, 2012 and 1760 dated 31st May, 2012, to give effect to the UN Resolution 1373 and 1267. This annual review of this ban is mandatory and I believe that ban earlier in 2014 was really a kind of an election gimmick because it was not well-considered at all.

Former Hon. Minister of External Affairs, there were people who were included in the list who had died several years before this list came out. So, that shows that it was a hurriedly-compiled list without taking into consideration the actual facts and, in fact, already a statement about this meeting was issued earlier this week in London, I believe, on Monday, and for those who have not seen that statement, I will table* it.

(2) The persons who were present at the discussions:

Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, Member of Parliament from the TNA,

Representative of the GTF, Mr. Suren Surendiran and

A representative of the National Reconciliation Unit, Mr. M.S. Jayasinghe.

Then, we also had a representative from the Government of South Africa, who actually initiated a dialogue with the diaspora during the period of the UNP Government. That was, at least, a first good step. I know that similar discussions were held during the latter part of the last regime between the members of the diaspora and senior Members of the Rajapaksa regime.

Then, there was also a representative of the Government of Switzerland and Mr. Tore

803 804

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

Hattrem, the former Norwegian Ambassador in Sri Lanka, who is a senior Foreign Ministry official today and Mr. Erik Solheim, - the point which many of you wanted to know - participated briefly on the first day for about two hours where he talked about his experiences in engaging the diaspora.

(3) All details of discussions at all times are always reported back to both the President and the Prime Minister.

(4) There was absolutely no discussion of lifting the proscription of the LTTE.

That was never discussed, and also, we did not discuss any issues regarding a political solution nor did we discuss the impending domestic mechanism, which the Government at the moment is preparing as mandated by the people in January 2008.

But, as I said the annual review of the persons listed under the gazetted regulations in 2012 was discussed.

(5) No.

(6) No.

(7) I have explained to the House the background, reasons and details, and will also share a copy of the Press Statement, which I have already tabled, issued by the GTFs Director of Strategic Initiatives and the Member of Parliament of the TNA.

I would also like to inform the House that we also, as I said earlier, discussed a public declaration renouncing violence as a means of achieving political objectives and a public commitment by these Tamil diaspora organizations to a united and undivided Sri Lanka. And, I am sure many will discuss and this public declaration will be forthcoming in the not too distant future.

I would also finally like to table* two statements, which I would say, very clearly shows the shifting mood of the diaspora. One statement was issued by Rev. Father S.J. Emmanuel, President of the Global Tamil Forum. I will table the whole statement but I will read one little bit from it. This shows the enormous change in their mindset and you should be happy, we all should be happy. It states, I quote:

President Sirisena, who was praised so well recently by Carlo Fonseka, shows signs of an emerging patriot and statesman. Some of his predecessors have publicly made serious and erroneous remarks about the Tamils. But by word and example, he is appealing

to us all to put the country and the people before political parties and seek a peaceful coexistence of all peoples. The new government and the progressive forces from all communities are identifying some root causes which ruined the country in the past and are able to identify the fundamentals for a peaceful coexistence of all.

What is remarkable about this statement is that Rev. Father Emmanuel is not talking about Eelam. He is not talking about a separate State. He is talking about coexistence in one country. I mean, is it not the change that we were all waiting for?

Again, in the final sentence of his Easter message, he says, It is up to all well-wishers of Sri Lanka to put their heads together ., "of Sri Lanka", not of anything else. Now, they are accepting Sri Lanka not as a divided country but as an undivided country, invite various sectors of society and their leaders to explore possibilities of reconciling communities. This is my Good Friday Appeal and Easter wish to my friends in Sri Lanka.

So I think this is a very propitious beginning and I seek the cooperation of the Opposition in the days ahead in getting all our communities abroad to work together as one for the benefit of the country.

One such restriction is that discussions on matters pending adjudication before courts of law should be avoided on the floor of the House, so that the courts function uninfluenced by anything said outside the ambit of trial, in dealing with such matters.

[2.47 p.m.] ( , ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Hon. Mohamed Aslam has proposed this Motion to invite the attention of this House to urge the international community to take decisive action in addressing the issue of the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in the State of Myanmar.

This issue is a serious blot to the entire civilization. We have not had many other parallels of such incidents happening anywhere in the civilized world today. Though this has now come into prominence because of the large number of boat people who are leaving the shores of Myanmar to seek asylum in other countries, initially, some countries made them out to be economic refugees and refused to give them asylum. It is a matter of relief that countries like Malaysia and Indonesia have finally accepted the responsibility to give them asylum, and Sri Lanka too had not become an exception to this lot of boat people who turned up at our shores last year in several parts of our Island. We had ourselves housed some of these refugees, numbering more than 200, in Mirihana and we have a few of them still in transit camps in Wellawatta. I was told that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had taken them under their care and most of them have now been able to secure asylum in countries like the United States of America.

At this juncture, I must also take this opportunity to condemn the attitude of the Government of Australia for refusing entry to boat people who turned up at their shores by forcefully turning them away to places like the State of Nauru, where very inhuman conditions await them and some of those deserving people who have to be accommodated for political asylum are denied and some of them die in the high seas not being able to reach the shores of some of those countries, which have got to abide by the international conventions respecting the refugees.

In this situation, we also realize that in the past Sri Lanka has been a transit country for many such people who seek asylum. We should not forget that unscrupulous elements and syndicates who operate human-smuggling rings are exploiting these poor people. But, in the meantime, the very Motion that has been brought up today needs to focus on the need to address the issue of statelessness of these Rohingya Muslims living in the State of Myanmar.

This has been a festering issue and we also find some parallel in our country. In fact, when you look at the type of vocabulary that is being used in the persecution of Muslims in Myanmar, the same fate visited us a few years back and even last year, in Alutgama, what happened to the Muslims of Sri Lanka was similar, to a certain extent, to the incidents that had taken place in Myanmar. Incidentally, Sir, next Monday, on the 15th of June, we would be completing the first year after the recent, worst violence against minorities in this country, the Alutgama and Dharga Town incidents.

When you look at what happened in those areas and the type of xenophobic propaganda and bigotry that was part of the hate campaign of the mobs who engaged in such violence, and the type of patronage that were given to them by State authorities, it was a matter of deep regret for those who believed in democracy and law and order in this country. Some of us, the minority politicians took up this issue and I, despite the fact that I was a Member of the Cabinet of the last regime, took this matter before the Organization of Islamic Countries and finally it resulted in the Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic Countries writing to the former regime of this country wanting to send a fact-finding mission. Similarly, the Organization of Islamic Countries has also intervened in the Myanmar situation and they have taken an additional step of appointing a Special Envoy of the Organization of Islamic Countries to try and mediate on behalf of the unfortunate victims, the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. What is finally left for the civilized world to do is to urge the Myanmar administration to treat these citizens of that country with respect and to give them the safeguards with their entitlements under all Human Rights Conventions, which have been adopted by the international community.

In the meantime, it is important for us to realize that in both Myanmar and Sri Lanka - which adhere to the exalted traditions of Theravada Buddhism - this unnecessary bigotry and xenophobic tendencies that have now crept into some of the religious leaders and their propaganda is something that needs to be curtailed. Fortunately, Sri Lanka, being a democratic country, we had the opportunity to change regimes through the power of the ballot, but then, in countries like Myanmar, democracy is still to bloom to the extent to which we are experiencing. A transition period is now being observed in Myanmar and we find that a presidential election is due very soon. But then, the denial of right to contest for people like Aung San Suu Kyi in Myanmar is something that the international community is still not paying enough heed to. I believe, if the Myanmarese people are given full democracy, issues of this nature could be curtailed, at least, through the power of the ballot. In that regard, we should try and address these issues by adhering to principles of democratic traditions.

In the meantime, we must try and invite the attention of our Government to treat those few refugees who have

819 820

turned up in our shores and to see that they are expatriated to safer locations. I also appreciate the fact that the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs is here to respond on behalf of the Government and giving him some space to state his response, I conclude my speech. Thank you very much. [2.57 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, may I first thank the Hon. Mohamed Aslam for bringing in this very timely Motion. As you know, Sir, the Government of Sri Lanka has continued to closely observe the situation with regard to the Rohingya community. As you are aware, the Rohingya people actually come from the Rakhine State of Burma or Myanmar. In fact, the United Nations describes them as a religious and linguistic minority from Western Myanmar, and the United Nations also describes the Rohingya people as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world.

It is in that context, that the Government of Sri Lanka continues to cooperate with the UN and other international and regional initiatives to addressing the issue facing the Rohingya community today.

Despite not being a signatory to the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol on the Status of Refugees, Sri Lanka has been handling cases of asylum/refugees in terms of the Agreement signed between the Government of Sri Lanka and UNHCR in 2005. We called it the Terms of Reference of the Working Arrangements with Regard to the Issuance of Certificates by UNHCR to the Asylum Seekers and Refugees.

In the above context, Sir, the Government of Sri Lanka has continued to cooperate with the UNHCR in the resettlement of 96 Rohingya persons who have arrived in Sri Lanka by boat on two occasions in February 2013. As of 30th April 2015, the Government of Sri Lanka has actually facilitated the resettlement of 57 Rohingya persons as refugees in third countries, mainly in the United States of America. As at 30th April 2015, only 39 Rohingya migrants remain in Sri Lanka, whose

resettlement continues to be facilitated by our Government in cooperation with relevant stakeholders in Government and the UN Agencies.

Additionally, the Sri Lanka Navy has been instrumental in saving from drowning, some of the Rohingya migrants stranded in our waters. It maybe noted that the Government of Sri Lanka has continued to extend protection to Rohingya persons in Sri Lanka, including the provision of free medical facilities.

In terms of cooperation in the regional and multilateral fora, as recently as 29th May 2015, Sri Lanka participated at senior official level in the Special Meeting on Irregular Migration in the Indian Ocean organized by the Government of Thailand with the participation of Asian countries in the region affected by this situation including Myanmar, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia as well as Japan, Switzerland, the USA and international organizations comprising the UNHCR, UNODC and IOM, with particular focus on the situation of the Rohingya community.

The salient issue highlighted at the above Meeting was that irregular migration is not only a growing regional but a global challenge today. Another important point which emerged at this Meeting was that the Government of Myanmar has agreed to cooperate with the assistance of the international community to improve the livelihood in affected areas.

The Government of Sri Lanka will continue to cooperate with the international community in addressing the issue of the Rohingya persons and, as a Government committed to democracy, equality and human rights, we condemn discrimination and persecution of all forms, in adherence to the protection of human rights in accordance with international law.

Thank you. , . . Question put, and agreed to. . .3.00, 2015 23 ..1.00 . .. 3.00 , 2015 23, .. 1.00 .

Adjourned accordingly at 3.00 p.m. until 1.00 p.m. on Tuesday, 23rd June, 2015.
