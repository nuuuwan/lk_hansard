Paragraph 47 ? I quote:

"It is clear to the Commission that this doctrine may be engaged as it concerns the allegations relating to the white flag killings of LTTE leaders and the images of executions that have formed the subject matter of a series of Channel 4 television broadcasts. The Commission is of the view, as found by the LLRC, that there are matters to be investigated in terms of specific instances of deliberate attacks on civilians. These matters must be the subject of an independent judicial inquiry. There are credible allegations, which if proved to the required standard, may show that some members of the armed forces committed acts during the final phase of the war that amounted to war crimes giving rise to individual criminal responsibility."

. UN . . Paragraph 450 ?

I quote:

"The Commission takes the view that the extra-judicial executions of 18 May 2009 that were dubbed White Flag Killings in the Channel 4 programmes must be the subject of an independent judicial inquiry. These events are alleged to have led to the deaths of Balasingham Nadesan, the head of the political wing of the LTTE, and Seevaratnam Pulidevan, the LTTEs head of the peace secretariat, and others who are said to have emerged under the protection of a white flag and on assurances of their personal safety. If proven, such conduct undoubtedly qualifies as a war crime under the Hague Regulations, "

I quote:

"In February 2013, a series of photographs emerged depicting Balachandran Prabahakaran, the 12-year old son of the LTTE leader. The images suggest that he was in a bunker alive and well in May 2009. The allegation is that he was then in the custody of the SLA. Not long afterwards he is shown dead on the ground with his chest pierced by bullets. Whilst both sets of photographs are said to have been taken, a few hours apart with the same camera.586 Forensic pathologists instructed by Channel 4 suggest that the child was executed. Clearly if this allegation is proven, this is a clear breach of the laws of war. At least one serving senior Sri Lankan General, Major General Udaya Perera, has stated the importance of an investigation into this alleged atrocity.The need for war crimes investigations has even been supported, more recently, by the former Commander of the SLA, now Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka.

. , . . . [2.31p.m.] .. (, ( .. - , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. Firstly, I wish to inform this august Assembly that the conduct of Parliamentarians has totally eroded. It was seen today just two hours ago by the way the Opposition Members were behaving. I think, if it is allowed to happen continuously in this august Assembly, the entire Parliamentary system will be a failure. And I think the authorities concerned, especially the leaders of all political parties, should take necessary steps to safeguard the interests of Parliament.

Today, Members of the Opposition have spoken many a time with regard to the UNHRC Report and our accountability in respect of this Report.

Firstly, I should state that, as it was very clearly laid down by many speakers from the Government Benches, the pledge to address the accountability came about in May, 2009 in the Joint Communiqu by the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon. The failure to take action resulted in appointing a committee to advise him on whether violations of international human rights and humanitarian law occurred during the war. During this war, there have been misdoings both by the armed forces as well as the LTTE and that has been spelt out very clearly in their communiqu.

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights was requested by Council Resolution 25/1, to monitor the human rights situation in Sri Lanka, especially to investigate into the alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka during the period covered by the LLRC.

A special team was established by former High Commissioner, Navi Pillay, which consisted of three distinguished experts: Martti Ahtisaari, former President of Finland; Dame Silvia Cartwright, former High Court Judge of New Zealand; and Asma Jahangir, a former President of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. This inquiry was only a human rights investigation and not a criminal investigation. During this investigation, the Council had to face many constraints. Lack of access to Sri Lankan

1047 1048

[ . ]

2015 22

witnesses and witness protection concerns posed enormous challenges to this inquiry. The investigation team attempted to identify the patterns of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law perpetrated not only during the final stage of the armed conflict but during the whole period covered by the investigation.

These patterns of conduct consisted of multiple incidents that occurred over time. These were often executed by a number of perpetrators who were in high command. When the Human Rights Council adopted Resolution 25/1 - when the investigation was on - the then Government of Sri Lanka categorically and unreservedly rejected and refused to engage in any related process in that inquiry. That was the stand of the former Government. The present Government had engaged more constructively with the High Commissioner on a possible note for accountability and reconciliation process, which has been accepted by them.

The Government-invited Special Rapporteur stressed the importance of developing a comprehensive State policy on transitional justice through broad-based public consultation and participation.

The introduction of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution limited the powers of the Executive Presidency; re-introduced the limits of the Presidential terms and restored the Constitutional Council, which makes recommendations on appointments to the judiciary and the independent commissions. As you are all aware, the judicial system had been a complete failure during the last few years due to the appointments made by the former President on personal reasons and because of that, the entire judiciary is now collapsing. I, being a lawyer myself, would like to make this statement in this House.

Since January, 2015, there had been a significant opening of space for freedom of expression; although reports of surveillance, interference and harassment of human rights defenders continued to be received at district level.

The present Government lifted restrictions on access by journalists to the Northern region. His Excellency the President has appointed new civilian Governors for both Northern and Eastern Provinces and major security checkpoints have been removed. This was also greatly welcomed in the Northern Province. The Government is still to embark on any comprehensive process of demilitarization. I will come to this subject a little later.

Local civil society sources recorded 26 cases of harassment and intimidation by military and intelligence services in the North and the East during the period from January to August in 2015. This figure highlights the reality that the structures and institutional cultures that had been created earlier - the repressive environment of the past - remain in place and will require much more fundamental security sector reforms.

One major continuing problem is the military occupation of private land. The Government has proceeded with land releases of 1,000 acres in Tellippallai and Kopay in the North; 1,000 acres in Sampur in the East; in Iranamadu in Kilinochchi His Excellency the President a few weeks ago donated another 650 acres back to their worthwhile owners. It is noteworthy for me to say that under the direction of the His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister, 2,650 acres have been released by this Government.

Women head nearly 60,000 households in the Northern Province. Food insecurity, rising inflation and lack of livelihood opportunities have pushed these households further into debt.

The Government reported that there are 258 detainees remaining; 60 had not been charged; 54 had prior conviction while the remaining cases were pending. I had the opportunity, prior to the fast by the detainees, to submit a note to the Cabinet requesting whether His Excellency the President can grant pardon to these detainees wherever there is no proper charge against them or there is lack of evidence and this is now being considered by His Excellency the President.

The Prevention of Terrorism Act, which has long provided a legal context for arbitrary detention, unfair trials and torture remains in force. According to the civil society sources, from January 2015 to August in 2015, 19 people had been arrested and 12 remain in detention.

Although the Government has engaged in a dialogue with the Tamil diaspora groups in many ways, it has not yet taken steps to delist the numerous Tamil diaspora organizations and individuals. I think that may be necessary for us to protect the diaspora in the future and His Excellency the President as well as our Minister of Foreign Affairs are taking all the necessary steps, because we have to get the diaspora to come into the Northern Province for further development and investment.

During the period of 2014 to 2015, 112 incidents of hate speech against Muslim community have been reported and it was 22 since January 2015. Christian groups also reported such incidents. The Government announced plans to revise the Penal Code to criminalize hate speech and the amendments are now being processed. I had a word with the Hon. Minister of Justice and Minister of Buddhasasana and he mentioned that in a few weeks' time, the "hate speech law" may probably be presented to Parliament.

There were no prosecutions in relation to the attacks by the Buddhist group Bodu Bala Sena on the Muslim community in Aluthgama in June, 2014, where four people were reportedly killed and 80 injured. While it has not always been possible to establish the identity of those

responsible for these serious alleged violations, these findings demonstrate that there are reasonable grounds to believe that gross violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law had taken place and crimes were committed by all parties during the period under review.

The investigation team also believes that the LTTE too killed Sinhalese, Muslims and Tamils who were not sympathetic towards them. They also investigated into the allegations of extrajudicial executions of identified LTTE cadres and unidentified individuals on or around 18th of May, 2009, some of whom known to have surrendered to the Sri Lanka Army. Facts remain to be established that the witnesses testimony and photography appears to be sufficient information that they were killed after being taken into custody. This is a serious violation by whoever in the military forces who had done this and it is going to have serious consequences.

The investigations also revealed the arbitrary arrest or abduction of individuals by security forces and group members operating in unmarked white vans, which were able to pass through security checkpoints or enter into security force bases. No one was in a position to check them. The team also received information about hundreds of cases of enforced disappearances during the period under review, especially from the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. The Sri Lankan authorities carried out a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population. The investigation team also documented the use of torture by security forces, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the armed conflict, when former LTTE members and civilians were detained en masse.

Sexual violence by security force personnel was widespread against both male and female detainees, particularly in the aftermath of the armed conflict. There are reasonable grounds to believe that there had been violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law relating to sexual violence.

The LTTE cadres abducted youths in contravention of the Common Articles of the Geneva Convention and forcibly recruited them. Children under 15 were also recruited by the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal - the Karuna Group - after its split from the LTTE in 2004. Recruitment of children is a violation of the Geneva Convention. There are reasonable grounds to believe that the Government security forces may have known that the Karuna Group recruited children in areas under its control. This again indicates violation of the provision of the Convention.

The shelling of hospitals is a very important matter. Hospitals in the Vanni and other medical units had been targeted. The recurrence of such shelling, despite the fact

that the security forces were aware of the exact location of hospitals, raises a serious doubt that these attacks were accidental. Other civilian facilities in the no-fire-zones - humanitarian facilities and food distribution centres in particular - were also affected during that time.

Directing attacks against civilian objects or against civilians not taking part in hostilities is a serious violation of international humanitarian law. By compelling civilians to remain within the area of active hostilities, the LTTE also violated its obligation under the law to take all feasible measures to protect the civilian population under its control against the effects of attacks from the security forces.

As demonstrated in previous OHCHR Reports to the Human Rights Council, recent years have witnessed a total failure of domestic mechanisms to investigate, establish the truth, ensure accountability and provide redress to victims of serious human rights violations and abuses described above.

As at 30th June, the Commission had received a total of 16,826 complaints of missing civilians and 5,000 complaints relating to missing members of the security forces, and 2,200 were subsequently invited to give testimony at 47 public hearings in different districts.

The present Government reinvestigated the death of 27 prisoners during a security operation to control a riot at the Welikada Prison in November, 2012 and found that a number of those killed or injured had not been involved in the riot.

In the case of the killing of protestors by army personnel at Weliweriya in August, 2013, an investigation conducted by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka concluded in its Report in 2015 that the death of three people, the injuries of another 36 and the destruction of property indicated that the security forces had used excessive force. It is also noted that the presence of senior officers at the scene suggested that the shooting could not have taken place without orders. So, there again, the armed forces have been cited to be a party to these shootings. This is a case of a conflict-related violation being successfully prosecuted and the remainder of many other such cases have stalled or are pending at various stages.The previous Government reported having intensified its investigations, but highlighted difficulties involved in summoning or interviewing potential witnesses and suspects who are now living abroad.

The developments in 2015 in the investigation into gravesites at Mannar and Matale have highlighted ongoing forensic challenges and possible tampering with evidence. The presumption behind such systematic crimes is that those require some degree of organization to perpetrate. This challenge of addressing such crimes is

1051 1052

even greater in an environment where the criminal justice system remains vulnerable to interference and influence by powerful political, security and military actors.

The design of any truth-seeking and accountability mechanisms must be pursued through a process of genuine, informed and participatory consultation. The independence and integrity of key institutions such as the Attorney-Generals Department and the Human Rights Commission remained compromised. Therefore, the Government, by the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, has taken steps today to see that there is independence of the Judiciary and the Human Rights Commission and now, it is the Constitutional Council which makes the appointments to the independent Commissions, not the Executive - the President. That is a fundamental step by which we can now retrieve the entire society.

The security forces, the police and the intelligence services have enjoyed near total impunity and have not undergone any significant downsizing or reforms since the armed conflict. The military retains an oppressive presence in the war-affected areas of the North and the East, still occupying extensive private land, expanding into commercial economic activities and maintaining a culture of their own. I think His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister are taking necessary active action to see that these lands are given back to the owners. The military cannot do commercialized business there. The Government would also see that the lands, which are not being really and totally used for military operations, are given back to the legitimate owners.

The history of Sri Lanka includes moments where governments pledged to turn the page and end such practices as enforced disappearances by "white vans", but their failure to address the issue meant that "white vans" could be reactivated when needed.

The Government of Sri Lanka will need to embark on fundamental reforms of the security sector and justice system, including a fully-fledged vetting process, to remove personnel suspected of involvements in human rights violations.

Then, "Conclusions and Recommendations" of the Report says that the investigation contained in the Report was born out of the past failure of the former Government of Sri Lanka to address accountability for the most serious human rights violations and crimes. Political will and concerted efforts are required to ensure that these violations and crimes do not recur.

Sri Lanka needs to address the patterns of serious human rights violations and other international crimes that have caused such sufferings for all communities over decades if it is to prevent them from haunting its future.

Sri Lanka should draw from the lessons learnt and good practices of other States that have succeeded with hybrid special courts, integrating expertise and such a mechanism will be essential to give confidence to all Sri Lankans. But, I think, even if we do not have a hybrid court, if we can have a domestic inquiry with technical assistance from abroad, it will be of great value to deal with human rights violations in Sri Lanka.

The Human Rights Council has played a prominent role in accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. Setting up of a high-level executive group to develop a coordinated, time-bound plan to oversee the progress in implementing the recommendations is contained in this Report. Inviting the OHCHR to establish a fully-fledged country presence to monitor the situation of human rights in the future is also contained in the Report.

So, there are immediate steps that we have to take. The present Government is already at it. His Excellency the President, the Hon. Prime Minister and the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs have been taking into consideration the whole investigation report very seriously and all necessary steps have been taken to look into human rights violations and see that those will not recur. Whether it is the Tamil population that has been affected or whether it is the Sinhala population, basically, if the entire system - the countrys humanitarian grounds as well as judicial system - erodes, there will be no justice in this country and it will become a barbaric banana republic.

So, Mr. Presiding Member, I thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak a few words in this regard today. I feel that the present Government is taking all necessary steps to protect the interests of the Tamils as well as all communities in this country and ensure that these issues will not recur. If their interests are not protected in the correct manner, these issues will recur and there can be more barbaric acts of violence as that happened during the last 30 years.

So, I take this opportunity to reemphasize this fact and I hope the international community will also consider it. I have also been given the responsibility to look after rehabilitation and resettlement of people and I am taking all endeavours to accomplish that. I must thank all the relevant authorities; His Excellency the President, the Hon. Prime Minister and the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs again for giving me all the support in my endeavours to see that the Tamils who have suffered for the last 30 years can at least regain their lands and regain fundamental rights as humans to live in Jaffna in the future.

Thank you.

, - - . . , . . . "" , "" , "" , . . ( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. You have 35 minutes. [3.58p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Presiding Member. As I begin, I must put on record and correct certain misapprehensions that some Members seem to be harbouring with regard to our Partys position in respect of this Resolution. I will read out the statement that we issued on the day the Resolution was adopted. It states, I quote:

The Tamil National Alliance welcomes the passage of todays resolution on Sri Lanka at the Human Rights Council.

We have welcomed it.

We welcome, in particular, Sri Lankas co-sponsorship of the resolution indicating their willingness to implement it in full.

The TNA has already welcomed the tabling of the draft last week after consensus was reached, and reiterate those sentiments. We hope that the spirit of cooperation that enabled consensus will animate the governments work in implementing this historic resolution.

Thursdays resolution reflects a difficult consensus, and involved the weakening of some paragraphs in the original draft

resolution and the strengthening of others. We are deeply mindful that any perceived compromise causes hurt to those most traumatized by the horrific crimes that have been committed in Sri Lanka.

Nevertheless, the resolution - if implemented - provides a genuine opportunity for real progress on accountability and reconciliation. We are grateful to the co-sponsors of the resolution for engaging with the TNA throughout the process, and accommodating our concerns and views.

This remains our position to date. So, I urge the Hon. Members - who perhaps misunderstood our position - as much as you say that you worked on reducing the hard impact of this Resolution, we have in our statement said that weakening of some of those paragraphs have hurt the sentiments of people who are most traumatized. But, we have gone on to say, nevertheless that this gives an opportunity to move forward together and it is in that spirit that we have welcomed it.

We are happy today that Members of the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the two biggest Parties in this country, are agreed that this Resolution must be implemented. What you are saying is that you really did not even need this prodding from international community and you yourselves want to do it. That was reflected when you co-sponsored it. When you co-sponsor a resolution, it is more than agreeing to that resolution. It is taking ownership for the resolution. This Resolution is not that of the UN Human Rights Council anymore. This is your Resolution. Nobody who stands up and proposes a Resolution or seconds it - in this case co-sponsors it - can then say; We will decide now what parts of this Resolution that we like, that we can implement and so on. This is your Resolution. You fully own it and we congratulated you on the 1st of October 2015 for taking that bold step. We also congratulate you today for taking the bold step of abiding by this Resolution and for the speeches made on both Sides of the House affirming that this Resolution is supportive of the processes that you yourselves wish to initiate for accountability and for reconciliation in Sri Lanka. We are fully supportive of that.

The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, when he made the speech on the 14th of September at the UN Human Rights Council very clearly said, "We are no longer in the land of denial." He was very bold. He even went to the extent of saying, We have failed in the past - several Commissions were appointed; nothing saw the light of day; reports were not even made public. Then, he appealed and said, But, have trust in us. We are different now. We will deliver. And I must say, your actions today in this House have demonstrated that. When he made that statement, we said, Well, it is all good for him to say that in words. But he himself says that successive governments have not delivered, have failed and having said that merely asking people, 'Now, have confidence in us' will not work." People must see action. People must see it being implemented. "The proof of the pudding is in

1073 1074

the eating "; they say. They must actually see it happening. So, I want to repeat what we said on the 14th of September again in this House, not from a sense of superiority or anything like that, but as fellow citizens we appeal to you and say, let the people actually see it; feel it and experience it.

Your words today are most welcome. But, please remember they remain only words up to now. This Resolution must be implemented in full. I say, in full, because I was rather disturbed when the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe sought to make a distinction between "implementing the Thirteenth Amendment" and "implementing the Thirteenth Amendment in full". I asked him, What is the difference?. If it makes any difference, after this, in every sentence you mean to say, I will do this you have to say, I will do this in full. If you give a commitment to do something, you do it. You do not come and say, I never said I will do it in full. So, because of that speech made in the morning, I am saying now that "this Resolution must be implemented in full". Otherwise, I would have stopped with the words, It must be implemented. But, it must be implemented in full for the reason that I have already stated that this is your Resolution, nobody elses, not ours, you co-sponsored it.

This promise that the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs made very rightly and very boldly must be kept. Because it is in keeping that, that we can together stand up in the international community and show the others that we keep our word; that we deal with these difficult issues. These are difficult issues, no doubt. But the measure of our country in the international community will be known only when we keep to our word and we implement. We actually have to show it in action.

Sir, I want to say a word about sovereignty since that word is often misused. Sovereignty is the right of a people - perhaps of a republic - to rule themselves, to retain for themselves the right to make decisions and to implement them and not to concede it to one person or two or anybody else. It is a right of the people and that is why our Constitution also says that "sovereignty resides in the people". But that cannot mean that sovereignty can be exercised only by some people to the exclusion of others and that has been the problem in this country, because there are several peoples who inhabit this Island. They are in different proportions. Some are 70 per cent, some are 20 per cent, some are 10 per cent and some may be 5 per cent or even less. But that does not mean that a particular group that is superior in numbers can solely exercise sovereignty and exclude others from exercising any measure of sovereignty. That has been the issue that has plagued this country and if we are now truly turning around, if we are now seeing a new path, that must be a path in which every single person, every citizen must

have equal citizenship rights, irrespective of which peoples group he or she belongs to. That right of sovereignty must be real. It is not with regard to citizens and non-citizens or colonial rulers. It is also within this country. That sum, merely because of numerical superiority, does not hoard that sovereignty to themselves and exclude others from having any share in that sovereignty. That would be a mistake. I am saying this because several statements were made with regard to sovereignty. It is because we were specifically excluded when the Republican Constitution was made in 1972 that this issue heightened. Firstly, it was equality. It was discrimination. But the First and the Second Republican Constitutions excluded us from the exercise of sovereignty, from the exercise of State power and that is why we said, Well, if you exclude us, then let us have our own way. Leave us alone.

My Party President, the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah, read out to you a newspaper article of a meeting that was held recently where several Members of this House - I am sad to say - have said, We will now create a Sinhala State in this country. If that is the case, then necessarily you will have to allow us to be by ourselves, because we do not belong to the Sinhala State. I am a Sri Lankan, but I am not a Sinhalese. The Sinhalese are a great race with a long tradition. They can be proud of their heritage. But I do not belong to that race. I am a Tamil, and I am equally proud of my race. Being a Tamil, I have my own heritage; equally long, if not longer. Therefore, if you talk in terms of sovereignty and imply that sovereignty means that only the Sinhala people of this country can exercise it, then you yourself are telling us to divide. We are not asking for it. The persons who say that this is a Sinhala country are the very persons who are telling us to divide, to be separate. You are the separatists, not us. I said that I was very saddened that several Members of this House were saying that. But I am glad that they can be counted on ones fingers, only a few, and that is why I said at the beginning of my speech that I am glad that the two major parties have agreed today that this Resolution must be adopted. This Government is also a hybrid Government - this is a season for hybrids. First, we had the cars; now, we have a Government. This is a hybrid Government. Let us have a court. That also reflects a new trend. That will give confidence to the people most traumatized by violence. Whatever mechanism that you institute will be useless if it does not have the confidence of the victims. It must be something that the victims appreciate; it must be something that the victims accept as a just mechanism. Grandeur illusions of sovereignty cannot instill in the victims a sense of belonging, a sense of satisfaction, a sense of justice. The credibility of that mechanism is the most important aspect, not what we think as our sovereignty.

If you are truly concerned about reconciliation, if you are true to your word about being responsible with regard to accountability, then you must strictly adhere to what

1075 1076

[ .. ]

2015 22

you yourself have proposed in the Resolution. In the Resolution they have very specifically stated the importance of certain persons who will not be citizens of this country participating in that special court. It says the importance of that participation. You have identified that as an important element, not the UN Human Rights Council, but you yourself. You have underlined it and said that judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators are important. You have categorized them into four categories and you have said that it is important that Commonwealth and foreign personnel participate. Surely, it must be participation by them in those very capacities; not otherwise, as somebody said, "technical assistance and so on". No, if it is technical assistance of international community, you say "technical assistance of international community". You do not separately identify the different categories of persons participating. A judge participates a qua judge; a prosecutor participates a qua prosecutor; a lawyer participates a qua lawyer; an investigator participates in his capacity as an investigator and not to sit and give advice as to how this is to be done. So, we urge more than you, that this Resolution must be implemented.

Is it not strange that the Government sponsors a Resolution and we are saying, we are more keen that you implement it in full more than you, because we represent the victim community. I am not saying only the Tamil people are victims in this country. Many people are made victims through this war. But, if you take it as a whole, we perhaps represent those most traumatized by the violence, because that end period was most traumatic and most allegations about violations, about war crimes, about crimes against humanity arise from that period and as true political representatives of those people, of that community, it is our bounden duty to raise these concerns to underline what you yourself have underlined in the Resolution. We wish you underline and highlight it today - the importance of such a mechanism; the importance of such proper participation without which your mechanism for justice will fall flat on its face.

We congratulate you for adopting the principles of transitional justice. The Hon. Minister spoke about the four pillars of transitional justice - of truth, of justice, of reparation and the guarantee of non-recurrence. The second pillar of justice must not only be done but also be seemed to be done. That is what Sir Desmond de Silva has said as quoted in the Paranagama Commission. That is what Sir Desmond de Silva, QC is reported to have said when he was a prosecutor in Gambia. What has he said? He has said; for people to have any confidence, all of these people - prosecutors and judges - not just a hybrid, he says, "all of them" - must come from outside. Your Sir Desmond - I say, your Sir Desmond because Desmond de Silva gave an opinion to the Government of Sri Lanka on the 23rd of February, 2014, five months before he was appointed to the Panel of Experts by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Five months prior to being identified and paraded to the world as an "independent

expert", he gave an opinion, for which fees were paid by the Government of Sri Lanka on the very questions that were gazetted - for him to assist the Commission to find answers on distinction, on proportionality and on collateral damage. On all of these three principles, he gave a written opinion dated the 23rd of February, 2014 and five months later, he was brought in as an independent expert.

On the last occasion I spoke on this matter, I said this is a clear conflict of interests. Any final-year law student who studies ethics will know that and I urge the Government of Sri Lanka to make a complaint against him to the UK Bar Standards Board. I am thankful that somebody has made a complaint and Sir Desmond de Silva is now facing a disciplinary inquiry before the UK Bar Standards Board. But, the point I am making is that even Sir Desmond de Silva's opinion, when he was performing another role, when he was not paid by the Sri Lankan Government - when he was paid, he gave another opinion - but when he was prosecuting in Gambia in the first internationalized court, the first hybrid court, as a prosecutor, his opinion then, was that every prosecutor and judge must come from outside. So, the point I am making is, even the person you bought for money, when he was not bought by you for money, gave that opinion, an independent opinion.

Look at the Paranagama Commission Report. Quite contrary to what the Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne said, we are not picking what we like from this report and that report and putting together and saying others are bad. That is not what we are doing. He must follow the argument properly. What we are saying is that we wanted the Paranagama Commission's mandate terminated forthwith. We never had any confidence in the Paranagama Commissions sittings. In fact, the OISL Report, in its recommendations, states, Terminate that Commission; terminate that mandate. That has no credibility. Even today, that is our position with regard to the Paranagama Commission. The point that we are making, though, is very different. What we are saying is, even such a bad Commission, even that Commission, could not escape from saying that Channel 4 video does not seem to be faked; it seems genuine. All of those photographs of extra judicial executions do not seem to be faked; they seem to be genuine. Therefore, conduct an independent judicial inquiry. Sir, I will, at this point, say that because the Paranagama Commission Report on those three vital questions - on distinction, proportionality and collateral damage - for which they got international so-called "expert" help, went with Sir Desmonds prior opinion on the Sri Lankan Government. They did not exercise their mind to the matter; they went with the paid opinion and reproduced it in this Report. They had to strike some balance; they had to show something that seems to be reasonable. And these are the issues they have highlighted - surrendering under a white flag; several other surrenders and of disappearances. So, there

1077 1078

must be answers found to this. There must be persons held responsible for this.

It is not only the armys atrocities that are highlighted in the OISL Report. The OISL Report of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights identifies several acts of the LTTE and terms them war crimes. We have very specifically, in our statements, welcomed the entire Report and have gone further and said, This also gives us - the Tamil people - an opportunity to introspect. As the Tamil National Alliance, we have said, We are prepared to lead our people through that painful process of introspection, of looking inward, looking to see what went wrong with us. Now, we are prepared to do that. It is not a politically expedient thing; it is not a populist thing. It will bring us under a severe, sharp focus, but we are willing to do that because if we are to move forward, if the words "reconciliation" and "accountability" are to have any meaning in this country at all for the future, we must be prepared to do that. That is why I am happy that today in this House the two major Parties have taken that seriously, taken accountability seriously.

Stop being a Government of denial. Accept that these horrific things did happen. We all are ashamed that this happened. But, let us see how we can deal with that justly, honestly and transparently to the satisfaction of the victims, more than anybody else - not to boost our image, not to contemplate what the other countries will think of us, of our national image, as it were. Let me say most humbly that we will only elevate our national image if we truly deal with these issues and rightly deliver justice without sweeping these matters under the carpet.

Let me conclude, Sir, by saying that, as for the Tamil National Alliance, we are willing to give the Government our fullest support for the full implementation of this Resolution. The Resolution that you sponsored, we accept with its limitations - still, we accept it - but we want to see it fully implemented. It is not an easy task, we understand. It is not easy for you; it is not easy for us. But, we have made a start and we are willing to go with you in that journey. Our appeal to you is that you stand firm in your resolve to go through that difficult path and do not give in to extremist voices, because extremist voices on both sides can be marginalized fully if we come together and deal with these questions honestly and sincerely.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . 9 .

Presiding Member, at the outset I would like to comment on the speeches made from morning up to now. There were very constructive speeches delivered by the Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne and the Hon. Vijitha Herath. There were quite a few speeches like that.

It is very unfortunate that some of the Members are still not prepared to consider reconciliation. Today and tomorrow, let us speak very frankly. But they must speak towards reconciliation. It is time for them to do so in the national interest. Going ahead with their political agenda and delivering speeches to the people for their own political advantage will definitely continue to make the Tamils victims of the situation and the problems, the turmoil and turbulent times will continue to exist. There will be no end to it.

1085 1086

The whole day today, I was listening to the speeches made in this House. Some of the speeches - especially the speech mady by Hon. Wimal Weerawansa - it is racism, purely racism. We are forced to tolerate all these speeches here. Sometimes, we feel ashamed when we are seated here.
