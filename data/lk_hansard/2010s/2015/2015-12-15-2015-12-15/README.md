asked the Minister of Defence:

their lives in grave danger as in the case of Millennium City incident in 2002?

(b) Will he inform this House -

I would also like to say a word about the private banks here. In the past term, unfortunately, the Government of the day used government institutions to buy shares in private banks. And what did they do using those shares? They appointed directors to the private banks in an attempt to actually control the private banks. It is unfortunate that I have to say this in this House today that the former Governor of the Central Bank was involved in appointing directors to the private banks using those institutional equity positions. The only responsibility of the Central Bank when it comes to directors of banks is not in appointing directors of banks, it is only to make sure that the nominees coming from banks are fit and proper persons. That is the only responsibility. Therefore, our Government will not interfere in the private banking sector. Those directors will be responsible to their shareholders and they will be monitored. They will have to comply strictly with the monitoring of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. That is a freedom that we give. But it has to operate within the legal framework and the requirements of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. That era is gone and I call upon directors who are in such positions to rethink their positions in those banks.

* : * :: *Rest of the speech tabled: Hon. Sir,

1. The first ever Budget 2016 of the National Government by the Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. The 2016 Budget focuses on rural development and industry development of the country. As the Minister of Industry therefore I commend Minister Ravi Karunanayake for his focus on industries.

2. Let me attempt to illustrate the key achievements of Industry and Commerce Ministry to the best of my ability. In fact, Hon. Sir, the economic scope of my Ministry and its departments are vast. Therefore today I stress that I am only highlighting the few most important achievements and performances of each department and division to this august House, to save its valuable time.

3. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MIC) plays a dynamic role in the development of the industrial sector, international trade, business sector as well as internal retail and cooperative trade. It is the key Ministry responsible for promoting industrial development in the country. This Ministry has been assigned certain functions in planning, formulating, coordinating, implementing and setting up of the necessary infrastructure for the promotion and development of industries, international trade, internal retail sector trade, cooperative sector and business sector.

4. As for industries, manufacturing is the main type of activity in our industry sector. In 2014, value addition at current prices of manufacturing industries were at $ 12 billion which was broken down as factory industry at 13.2 per cent, cottage industry at 3.7 per cent and export processing industry at 7.5 per cent. The food, beverages and tobacco sub sector is about 50 per cent of the total of our Factory Industries by Industrial Category in 2014. Textile and apparel 20 per cent, Chemicals, Petroleum, Coal, Rubber and Plastic Products at 18 per cent and Fabricated Material, Machinery and Equipment" at 7.8 per cent.

The Industrial Policy and Development Division

5. The Industrial Policy and Development Division of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce contributes to the formulation of trade and tariff policies by the relevant authorities, by ensuring that the interests and aspirations of the manufacturing industrial sector of the country are

correctly and adequately, reflected in the same. During the year, this Division has contributed to resolve several tariff related issues of industrialists through the Ministry of Finance, while engaging in discussions with the Department of Commerce and the Ministry of Finance on concerns of the industrial sector which are related to Free Trade Agreements.

Regional Industrial Development Section

6. Regional Industrial Development Section of Ministry of Industry and Commerce contributes to widen the development in regional level and is responsible for encouraging regional investments in the industries. Under the regional industrial development efforts of this Ministry we have established 29 industrial estates throughout the country in 18 districts and developed 924 acres land with needful infrastructure facilities such as electricity, water and road facilities to achieve these objectives. 29 out of 304 industrial estates involve in commercial manufacturing and other 24 industries are building up buildings. 17,490 employment opportunities have been created in these industrial estates. Government investment in infrastructure facilities is Rupees Million 2,696 and private sector investment is about Rupees Million 26,755. Among other future regional industrial development efforts are Phase III of Trincomalee Industrial Estate. Hon. Sir, to strengthen Industrial Development, a Cabinet Paper has been forwarded to promote investments of the industrial estates that have already been developed and expected to be developed in future by the Ministry, to take approval to charge, lease, rent for the land on the undeveloped value of the land (to be charged on the undeveloped value of the land) and to offer 50 per cent tax relief for that.

Development Division - 1

7. This division mostly caters to agro-based industries including processed food industry. In the Processed Food Industry Sector, 40 industries have been selected for the food safety certification programmes such as ISO 22000, HACCP, SLS and GMP from a recognized institution for the first year after submission of the certificate to the Ministry. Profoods-Propack Exhibition was successfully concluded for the fortieth consecutive time in August 2015 with an SME pavilion. Eight industries have been enrolled to obtain Temporary Import for Export Processing (TIEP) facility to encourage exports. Ayurveda Expo Exhibition in 2015 was concluded successfully.

8. The main objective of this selection is to facilitate to strengthen local industrial sections of moulds and pressure moulds, rubber related industries, machinery and basic metal industries et cetera. The Development Centre of Moulds and Pressure Moulds has shown significant progress earning Rs. 16.11 Mn. Hon. Sir, realizing the importance of rubber related products industry, we implemented various special projects for the development of it and starting with finding of accurate statistics that the industry lacks. A data bank was established in 2013 for the section of rubber related products industry at a cost of Rs. 3 Mn. to minimize this situation. Programmes on promotion of sales such as Boat Show Trade Exhibition was organized by the Boat Building Technology Improvement Institute (BTI) at only Rs. 3 Mn. Development Division - 3
