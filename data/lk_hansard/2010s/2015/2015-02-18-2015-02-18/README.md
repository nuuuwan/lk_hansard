[]

The Bill seeks to repeal the Cosmetics, Devices and Drugs Act No. 27 of 1980. The Bill provides for the establishment of a Regulatory Authority to be known as the National Medicines Regulatory Authority. This Authority will hold responsibility for the regulation and control of registration, licensing, manufacture and importation of medical devices, borderline products and investigational medicinal products and all other aspects pertaining to medicines. Furthermore, it provides for the establishment of divisions of the National Medicine Regulatory Authority and the establishment of a National Advisory Body.

The National Medicines Regulatory Authority, consisting of 13 members is placed as an apex body independent of the Department of Health and is a body corporate which has perpetual succession and which can sue and be sued. The powers and functions of the Authority are stipulated in Section 14 of the Bill and includes provisions to guide and oversee all aspects regarding medicinal drugs which is an essential part of the health services in the country. By Article 27(2)(c) of the Constitution, the State has pledged to establish in Sri Lanka a democratic socialist society, the objectives of which includes the realization by all citizens of an adequate standard of living for themselves and their families under the Directive Principles of State Policy. This Bill is patient-centric, in that to make good quality affordable medicines, medical devices and borderline products continuously available to the patients in the society with adequate checks and balances. We observed that the Bill is designed with the best interest of the general public in mind, in line with the policy objectives of the Government.

At the hearing before Court, many clauses which would attract Article 12(1) of the Constitution were taken into consideration and amendments to overcome the situation were agreed upon in court.

This Court suggested that in Clause 12(b) of the Bill, the word absolute should be deleted and it should read as The Authority shall have the discretion of accepting or rejecting the views of the experts and the Deputy Solicitor General agreed to the said amendment.

Under Delegation of the Powers of the Authority, Clause 25(1) was agreed upon to read as follows:-

The Authority may in writing and subject to such condition as may be specified therein, delegate to the CEO and any Head of the relevant division of the Authority, any of its powers or functions and any such persons or Head of the relevant divisions shall exercise or perform such powers or functions in the name and on behalf of the Authority.

The Deputy Solicitor General suggested to delete certain parts of Clauses 29(2) , 36, 40, 101(3), 119(5) (b), last line of 130, 131(1) and 143(2) to read as follows:-

Clause 29(2) - Expenses incurred by any member, the CEO or any Officer or employee of the Authority in any suit or prosecution brought against him before any Court or Tribunal in respect of any Act which is done or purported to be done by him under the provisions of this Act or any other written law or if the Court holds that such act was done in good faith, be paid out of the Fund of the Authority, unless such expenses are recoverable by him in such suit or prosecution. Clause 36 - The Minister may make regulations to give effect to the provisions of this Part of this Act.

Clause 40 - The Minister may make regulations to give effect to the provisions of this Part of this Act. Clause 101(3) - Any person who contravene any provisions specified in sub Section 1 or 2 of this Section commits an offence. Clause 119(5) - The Authority may upon consideration of all records and information pertaining to the application, (a) grant the Applicant the license; or (b) refuse the application and inform the reasons for such refusal to the Applicant in writing forthwith. Clause 130 - Last Line - to read as shall be guilty an offence under this

Act. Clause131(1) - Every person who contravenes any of the provisions of this Act or any regulation made thereunder shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction be liable:- (a) Clause 143(2) - No civil or criminal proceedings shall be instituted against any person for any act which in good faith is done or purported to be done by him under this Act or any regulation make thereunder. This Court was concerned of Clause 125(1)(e) which empowers an authorized officer to seize and detain any article or vehicle in relation to contravention of provisions of the Act or regulations made thereunder and of Clause 125(9) which requires such officer to inform the Authority. The Deputy Solicitor General addressed court on this matter and gave us the discretion to give a specific time for the officer to inform the Authority. This Court is of the view that Clause 125(9) should remain as it is, since the authorized officer is duty bound to inform the Authority as soon as possible, without much delay and that is the reason why it is mentioned in the said Clause that the officer should inform the Authority as soon as practicable. Clause 49(1)(c) as in the Bill drew the attention of Court since it refers to any substance that may cause injury to the health of the user, where the word injury could even be interpreted to mean side-effects of a drug administered to cure a disease. The Deputy Solicitor General suggested that an amendment to read it differently, qualifying the word injury, could overcome this problem. The amended Clause 49(1)(c) to be read as follows is in accordance with the wording used by the World Health Organization in their model law. Court is satisfied with this amendment to read as follows :- Clause 49(1)(c) - has in or upon it any deleterious substance that may cause injury to the health of the user; or This Court was called upon to exercise its constitutional jurisdiction by virtue of a reference made by His Excellency the President in terms of Article 122(1)(b) on the provisions of this Bill. Article 27(1) of the Constitution states that the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in Chapter VI of the Constitution shall guide the Parliament, the President and the Cabinet of Ministers in the enactment of laws. In the case of Wijebanda Vs Conservator General of Forests and Others (2009, 1 SLR 337), this Court held that although the Directive Principles of State Policy are no specifically enforceable against the State, they provide important guidance and direction to the various organs of the State in the enactment of laws and in carrying out the functions of good governance.

2015 18

This Court observes that public health by itself is not specifically mentioned in the Directive Principles of State Policy in Article 27 of the Constitution. Yet, it is quite significant that adequate and affordable health facilities such as the core substance included in this Bill, providing and regulating safe drugs for affordable prices available at safe places as well as regulating the manufacturing of medicines, medical devises and borderline products are facilities necessary to ensure an adequate standard of living for all citizens alike, which is included in Article 27(2)(c).

In the Indian case of Vincent Panikurlangara Vs Union of India & Others [ 1987 AIR 990, 1987SCR (2) 468, 1987SCC(2) 165, JT 1987 (1) 610, 1987 SCALE (1) 490 ], the Supreme Court of India made the following observation:-

As pointed out by us, maintenance and improvement of public health have to rank high as these are indispensable to the very physical existence of the community and on the betterment of these depends the building of the society of which the Constitution makers envisaged. Attending to public health, in our opinion, therefore, is of high priority, perhaps the one at the top.

The States obligation to enforce production of qualitative drugs and elimination of the injurious ones from the market must take within its sweep an obligation to make useful drugs available at reasonable prices so as to be within the common mans reach. That would involve regulating the price. It may be that there may be an improved quality of a particular medicine which on account of its cost of production will have to sell at a higher price but for every illness which can be cured by treatment, the patient must be in a position to get its medicine. This, in our view, is an obligation which the Court has already found in the relevant Articles of Part IV of the Constitution.

This Court concludes therefore that the Bill is an attempt by Parliament to enact laws in accordance with the Directive Principles of State Policy.

We further note that the Bill is intended to apply across the board to the private as well as the public sector. Public Corporations such as State Pharmaceutical Corporation and State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation are also brought within the regulatory scheme set up by this Bill. Hence it covers policy. We are of the opinion that the Bill is not inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

The subject matter of this Bill does not come within any of the headings in the Provincial Council List or the Concurrent List contained in the Constitution and therefore it can be enacted without following the procedure set out in Article 154 G(3) or 154 G(5) of the Constitution.

We have considered the provisions of this Bill and we are of the opinion that the Bill contains national policy which is within the legislative competence of Parliament. We do hereby determine that the Bill is not subject to any of the prohibitions or restrictions in the 13th Amendment, is not inconsistent with any of the provisions of the Constitution and may be passed by Parliament with a simple majority.

We wish to place on record our appreciation of the valuable assistance rendered by the Deputy Solicitor General.

[3.40 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Presiding Member, I thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak on the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (Amendment) Bill.

I think from what the Hon. Minister stated, it became necessary for this Bill to be brought in because of the ban imposed by the European Union. I want to find out from the Hon. Minister whether he is taking any steps to get

971 972

[ ]

2015 18

the ban removed or whether he is speaking to the European Union people who are involved in this because unless he does it, we will lose our own wealth.

Sri Lanka is known as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean and around Sri Lanka you find seawater. If we develop the fisheries industry, we can get all the foreign exchange we need. Why do we not do that? We are importing fish. When we have got enough fish here, why do you want to import fish? Another matter I have noticed is that our fish which is our wealth, is being plundered by foreign countries like China, Japan and Thailand. I also understand that the Government has given licences for these countries to come and do fishing here. Hon. Minister, please stop that. Then only we can develop our industry.

The Navy does not arrest any Chinese, Japanese or the Thai people They arrest only the Tamils who come from South India who are living below the poverty line. How can the Navy close their eyes and be in the sea without arresting the Chinese, Japanese or the Thai people?

Please see that you stop issuing further licences to all these countries to come and do fishing here. Please take necessary steps to get that ban removed. If we can develop our fisheries industry to a certain extent, we can get all the foreign exchange we want without depending on any other products. So, I kindly request the Hon. Minister to stop issuing licences to other countries to come and do fishing here and direct the Navy to arrest even the Chinese, Japanese and Thai people, not only the Tamils, who come and do fishing here.

Thank you.

[3.44 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Foreign Affairs) Hon. Presiding Member, as you maybe aware, at the end of January, I was in Brussels, the home of the European Union. The objective of my visit was largely to revive positive relations and begin a new chapter in Sri Lanka-European Union relations, based on mutual respect and understanding. But, I was also in Brussels to specifically address two very urgent issues of great national importance: firstly, the EU-IUU fishing ban which was announced on the 14th of October last year and which came into force three months later, on the 14th of January this year, exactly one week after the new President was sworn into office. Secondly, I went there to discuss the question of the GSP Plus tariff concession, which was withdrawn from Sri Lanka nearly five years ago as a result of the previous Governments persistent reluctance to embrace good governance and ensure basic human rights.

When engaged in high seas fishing, countries have obligations to comply with the international regulations that help ensure the sustainability of common resources. These international regulations help ensure that fish stocks are sustainable and attempt to limit environmental damage. In Sri Lankas case, the relevant regulations are those agreed upon at the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission or better known as the IOTC. According to the Environmental Justice Foundation, global losses associated with IUU which stands for Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing are valued at between US Dollars 10 million to 23.5 billion annually.

The EU imposes bans on countries that fail to comply with these regulations. These bans are imposed after multiple warnings, and offers of assistance to help with compliance and investigations. It is the previous administrations failure to comply with these regulations despite repeated warnings, and their turning a blind eye to IUU fishing activities that led to the current ban. Thus, all nations and specially countries like Sri Lanka whose coastal fisheries account for nearly 53 per cent of total marine fish production, have an incentive and a duty to protect and manage common resources in a way that prevents the depletion of fish stocks, and ensure the preservation of this resource for posterity.

In fact, as you are well aware, 1.8 per cent of our GDP is generated through fish and fisheries products and fisheries is the ninth largest export sector. In 2013, the share of seafood in the overall export basket was around 2.5 per cent generating export income of nearly US Dollars 246 million, and the EU accounts for about 40 per cent of our total fish exports.

Mr. Presiding Member, the IUU fishing by Sri Lankan vessels was first flagged as an issue of concern, when an investigation mission from the European Commission in 2010 found Sri Lanka to be non-compliant with standards enforced by the IOTC. Thereafter, on the 15th of November 2012, a yellow card was issued to eight countries, of which Sri Lanka was one, formally notifying Sri Lanka on the possible identification of the country as a non-cooperating third country in the EU-IUU fishing regulations. Following that early warning, the Ministry of Fisheries and the Sri Lankan Government managed to hold several very fruitful discussions and dialogues with members of the EU and IOTC, showing much progress on the ground, and was even on the verge of reversing the yellow card and having the file closed. Indeed, recently, as early 2014, the EU commended Sri Lanka on its significant progress in terms of its compliance with IOTC regulations, including addressing the IUU fishing.

I have been told, Sir, that, in fact, Sri Lanka has 1,615 vessels in the high seas, where over 90 per cent of this fishing fleet is less than 15 metres in length, all of which are by international standards considered to be artisanal fishing vessels and minimally damaging to the

973 974

environment. However, the problems started in March 2014, when a political decision was taken by the previous government to increase the quota of fish that Sri Lanka could export, by introducing eight high capacity Chinese-built and owned Purse Seiner vessels. These commercial ships are over 45 metres long, have a capacity of 651 metres and may catch as much as 300 metric tons of fish per trip. Their catch size is between 25 and 100 times more per trip than the small sized artisanal Sri Lankan boats, which, as I just mentioned, are the type of vessels traditionally found in Sri Lankan waters.

The fishing gear used by these vessels has pernicious effects on the environment, sustainability of fish stocks and marine bio-diversity. Purse Seine fishing produces significantly greater "by-catch", that is the catch of non-marketable sea animals than other more traditional fishing methods such as long line fishing.

Most importantly, however, the introduction of the vessels took the other stakeholders in the Indian Ocean by complete surprise because they were not forewarned because it seemed to be at odds with our overall policy for fishing in the Indian Ocean, because at the time, there were no regulatory and control measures in place signified to our partners in the Indian Ocean that we were about to embark on large-scale commercial fishing without the consultation of other stakeholders or the consideration of the environment and our international obligations.

In April 2014, Sir, the Director-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries in Brussels, better known as DG-MARE, declared that the momentum set in motion, during which much of the progress has been reported, is likely to be on a derailed path. Not soon after, on 14th October, 2014, the European Union decided to inform us of the decision to ban Sri Lanka's fisheries exports to the EU but had decided to implement the ban only three months later, thus giving Sri Lanka yet another three months to rectify the situation. However, due to sufficient lack of progress in these three months, the ban unfortunately came into effect on the 14th of January, this year.

But, let us not be misguided in thinking that the ban will be so easily removed as by revoking the licences of those eight large vessels. The EU has also drawn our attention to the fact that that not all vessels flying the Sri Lankan flag and which are authorized to fish in the high seas outside the jurisdiction of our own waters, have valid licences. In fact, out of the 1,615 vessels, I have been told that only 86.3 per cent have valid licences and many vessels are still, however, submitting catch certificates even without a logbook and VMS data is still only limited to a small number of vessels. In the most recent count, I have been told that only 35 vessels, out of 1,615 are

having these Vessel Monitoring Systems in place. Further, deterrents to violations were at the time inadequate to prevent additional violations; physical inspections rarely revealed non-compliance of vessels to the IOTC regulations and when there were such reports, not enough was done unfortunately to follow up.

At the time of issuing of the ban, the vessel observer scheme was underdeveloped, VMS reports on progress required by Resolution 06/03 had not been provided, length frequency data for coastal fisheries required by Resolution 10/02 had not been submitted and neither had there been a report on import, landing, and transshipment of tuna and tuna-like fish products as required by Resolution 10/10.

Thus, there are many areas where Sri Lanka needed and still needs drastic improvement, especially in the application of legislative frameworks and in the ground policing of vessels. While all my meetings were extremely warm and cordial - in fact, there was a great need amongst all the officials I met to help Sri Lanka to come out of this impasse as soon as possible - it became evident that Sri Lanka needs to implement several serious reforms before the EU may begin to consider lifting the ban. The constant revisions of deadlines, such as the deadlines to order and introduce the appropriate transponders on board ships, have been the cause of a significant loss of credibility or, as the DG-MARE put it in my meeting with her, the cause of much "disappointment" from within the EU and despite the well-intentioned administrative work force within the Ministry of Fisheries, it was stressed that what was lacking in Sri Lanka was the "political will" to execute the necessary changes.

But, I am happy to note that under the new Minister of Home Affairs and Fisheries, this "political will" has been amply displayed and in fact, there was a meeting just a week ago chaired by the Prime Minister himself, where the question of Vessel Monitoring Systems being ordered as early as possible was discussed in great detail, and I am sure, the Hon. Minister will inform the House that the process has already begun. We believe that by the 1st of July, more than 1,500 of these Vessel Monitoring Systems would have been ordered and fixed in these vessels.

In advocating for the need for swift and urgent reforms, let me also note one important consequence of the EU- IUU fishing ban. The EU, as a trade bloc, has emerged as the number one market for Sri Lankas exports for decades and in 2013, accounted for about 32 per cent of Sri Lankas total exports. In the period between 2005 and 2010, Sri Lanka was a significant beneficiary under the GSP Plus scheme, which was extremely important for the success of Sri Lankas business community, and achieved a GSP Plus utility rate as high as 72 per cent. These tariff concessions helped Sri

Lanka promote and develop ethical trading practices primarily in the garment and textile sector, and over the years more than 100 garment factories across the country were awarded with the garments without guilt label by the International Certification Authorities for their progress in providing positive working environments.

Currently, Sri Lanka enjoys trade preferences granted by the European Union under the standard GSP scheme where the utility rate of preferential trade concessions has been in an average range of 61 per cent during the 2011-2013 period. Thus, in this context, it is crucial for the EU-IUU ban to be lifted immediately in order for Sri Lanka to have a positive response by the European Commission to its GSP Plus application.

In fact, we know that there was a reversal of such a fishing ban in Belize, where, I was told that it took eight months. The senior officials I met in Brussels assured me that they will give priority to Sri Lanka but Sri Lanka must, as I said earlier, have the political will to implement these reforms as early possible and I think this Bill which is presented in Parliament today, again amply demonstrates the political will of the new administration to get this ban reversed as early as possible.

Thank you.

[5.20 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for this opportunity to speak on the attempt by the Government to address the issues raised by the EU, which has banned the export of sea products from Sri Lanka to the EU. The Government has now taken action to address the issue of the ban on fisheries products exported to the EU on a political and also on a legal and technical front.

The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, explained to this House how he has been dealing with the EU on a political front. Further, the Government has brought to this House the current Amendment to the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act to address the issues raised under IUU fishing, which has been highlighted by the EU to impose larger fines and to regulate the fishing industry in and around Sri Lanka.

In this Debate, I wish to highlight the issues that have arisen between India and Sri Lanka in the field of fishing. We all know that, every now and then, Indian fishermen intrude into our waters, they are arrested and their boats are confiscated. Similarly, when our fishermen intrude into the Indian waters, they are also arrested and their boats are seized. This has been going on for some time and each time there would be an exchange of pleasantries between the leaders of our countries, then boats or fisherman would be released, they would be exchanged and we go back to a neutral position again and again. But, this issue is continuing. Recently, the previous Government had taken a decision that whenever an Indian fisherman intruded into our waters, he would be arrested, but soon released. However, there was a decision to hold the boat as a deterrent to continuous intrusion by Indian fishermen into our waters. And, through that policy, 87 boats of Indian fishermen were held by Sri Lanka and as a countermeasure, the Tamil Nadu Government and the Andhra Government had seized as many as 28 Sri Lankan boats and held them.

There was a situation where the Indian fishermen were worried that they would lose their boats and so were the Sri Lankan fishermen. They, as individuals, had invested large amounts of money to buy these boats and by losing them, they were losing their means of livelihood. Hence, there was a human problem also. At that time, after the change of the Government, there was hope in the minds of the people in India that the new Government would address this issue in a more humane manner. I got an invitation through a friend of mine, Mr. K. Jayakumar, Secretary to the Sree Narayana Guru Society of Indian Malayalees in Sri Lanka, from a well-known Swamiji in India called Sunil Das Swamiji of Calangute. I accepted the invitation and went there. I had the privilege of meeting the Indian fishermen led by N. Devadas, President of Rameswaram Co-operative

999 1000

[ ]

2015 18

Fishermen's Association, who pleaded with me that I should speak to the Government of Sri Lanka and help release 87 boats held in Sri Lanka. When I returned, I spoke to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to the Minister of Home Affairs and Fisheries, to the High Commissioner of India, and the honourable Attorney-General and came to know that His Excellency the President had ordered that these boats be released when the Minister of Foreign Affairs went to India, but the technicalities had been delaying and the coordination was not in place. I intervened with all the parties: the Minister of Home Affairs and Fisheries, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Indian High Commission, the fishermen and the Deputy High Commissioner for Sri Lanka in Chennai, and by bringing these parties together, we were able to get the 87 boats held in Sri Lanka released to their owners in India, and also to get the 28 boats and six fishermen held in India, back to Sri Lanka.

This was done before the visit of His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena to New Delhi in India to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and President Pranab Mukherjee. Through this, we have now re-established goodwill among the fishermen of India and the fishermen of Sri Lanka. We have to put a stop to this arrest and harassment of fishermen by both sides. The ideal thing would be for these fishermen not to cross the border but, as we all know, there is no fence in the maritime border. Fishermen, as was said by some of the Hon. Members today, go behind the fish and then they intrude into international waters or beyond the borders of Sri Lanka, into the waters of India. So, this is a problem that we have to think of in a more prudent way. The fishermen of India are in larger numbers with more powerful boats. We have very few; comparatively less fishermen and less facilities. So, there has to be some understanding between the fishermen of India and the fishermen of Sri Lanka. Several rounds of talks have taken place between these two groups, but we have still not been able to reach an understanding. The fishermen of India are demanding or requesting that they be allowed to fish in our waters for 90 days in a year including the 52 Sundays each year, because on Sundays our fishermen do not go to sea. However, there has still not been an understanding. The next round of talks is expected to take place in Chennai on the 5th of March this year and during that time, with the current understanding between the people in the two countries, we can reach an amicable solution or an agreement. In fact, the people in Tamil Nadu had celebrated the victory of our Government and the replacement of the former Government because they believe that this Government would be more fair to the Tamil people in Sri Lanka and, in turn, also understand the issues that the Tamil people of Tamil Nadu have regarding the Tamil people living in Sri Lanka. Hence, I request that we all look at it as a human problem which exists between the fishermen of Sri Lanka and the fishermen of India and not as a problem between two governments, and try to solve this issue on a give-and-take policy.

Further, our Government, in its Manifesto, had promised great relief to the people, which has now been granted. Similarly, relief to the fishermen has also been promised and I am glad that the Minister today, in this House, reiterated that these promises to the fishermen will be granted as promised in the "Hundred-Day" Programme of President Maithripala Sirisena. Under this Programme, it is necessary to grant relief to the fishermen on the equipment, nets and boats that they use for fishing. The cost of fishing comes down as soon as you reduce duties as promised in the "Hundred-Day" Programme of President Maithripala Sirisena. Fish is an essential food item for our people and today, through the export of fish products, we earn a large component of the foreign exchange required by our country. Under these circumstances, the fishing industry is a very vital and important industry, which has to be sustained and developed. Towards this end, we should formulate policies, implement them and empower the fishing community to deliver what the country expects from them. Thank you.
