[4.05 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Hon. Presiding Member, the young debutante Parliamentarian Hon. (Mrs.) Hirunika Premachandra has brought in this Motion for discussion in the House today, I believe because this subject is a matter of public debate these days following some gruesome murders that have taken place in the recent past.

I must say that, as a former Minister of Justice, I would like to shed some light on some recent developments concerning prisoners on death row in our prisons. This House has the advantage of having senior legal practitioners who have entered the House this time - in the criminal justice system, there is the Hon. (Dr.) Jayampathy Wickramaratne, who has had years of experience as a defence practitioner and we have our former Attorney-General, the Hon. Tilak Marapana, Presidents Counsel, who has both the experience of a prosecutor as well as a defence counsel after he left the Department. I am sure, they will shed more light on to this subject of death penalty and our status as a retentionist country when you compare other countries which have either abolished the death penalty or have retained it in their law books.

Having said that I must say, Hon. Presiding Member, that human civilization has evolved progressively since the dark ages of retributive justice. So bearing that in mind, I am quite pleased that the Hon. Minister of Justice who has succeeded me has shed some light on the issue of our countrys position when it comes to our international obligations and has made it very clear that we do not intend to right away take a decision about abolishing the death penalty, but would continue to be a retentionist country though there is an attempt by various countries based on the current human rights discourse to urge us to abolish the death penalty.

Although no execution took place since 1976, the sentence continues to be passed by courts and those sentenced resign to their fate of automatic life imprisonment remaining in the death row in the absence of execution. The consistent practice of retention on death row without enforcement of the penalty and acknowledging that such retention would amount to a violation of the rights - particularly, cruel and degrading punishment of the inmates - I was asked by many organizations to approach this issue to resolve the impasse that we have had for many years.

271 272

As a consequence of which, I had then appointed a committee in early 2014 to review the cases of prisoners on death row. The committee consisted of a former Judge of the Court of Appeal, the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice, the Secretary to the Ministry of Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms, Additional Solicitor General, Commissioner of Prisons, a psychiatrist and a criminologist and it convened regularly on a weekly basis in order to identify and recommend cases in which the sentence could be commuted to life imprisonment.

Now, I was told by some of the members of the committee that it was yet to be confronted with a case where the prisoner alleged that there was a miscarriage of justice. That is a very significant point. The significance of the recommendations of the committee is that a sentence of life imprisonment as opposed to death penalty may be limited to a minimum period of twenty years, with the President wielding the power of pardon on special occasions and release the offender after a few years of imprisonment. This issue of commuting life imprisonment in fit and proper cases was to be considered and that is why we started this process. Having said that, I am told that this committee has just submitted an interim report to His Excellency the President and I am sure the President will be considering this committees report to look at even this subject, which is very much in the public domain these days.

Apart from that, I would now like to deal with the entire criminal justice system in this country. If you look at the recent reports about police excesses, custodial deaths while in police custody, it has been a serious issue that we have had for several years and has not paid sufficient attention to. We have now and again heard of people supposedly running away from police custody and being killed while running away. These are all issues which need to be looked into very closely.

We ratified the Convention Against Torture and then enacted legislation in this House. If you find out from the Attorney-Generals Department as to how many indictments have been filed or charges brought against torture, and then how many were brought before court to be charged with the offense of torture, up to now, I am told, that there is only one conviction. But, then, torture is an issue that needs to be looked at very carefully. Therefore, it is important for us to look at police excesses, custodial deaths and issues of torture in police custody. These are issues which we also need to focus our attention to while rightfully discussing issues such as the death penalty.

Since I have very limited time, Hon. Presiding Member, I would just submit these matters for consideration of the House and conclude my speech.

Thank you.
