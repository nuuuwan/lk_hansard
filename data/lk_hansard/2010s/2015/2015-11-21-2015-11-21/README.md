Order read for resuming Adjourned Debate on Question - [20th November] "That the Bill be now read a Second time".- [ The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake] Question again proposed. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) .. . [10.38 a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Speaker for the opportunity given me to open the Debate on the Second Reading of the Budget for the Year 2016 that was presented by the Hon. Minister of Finance yesterday in a lengthy delivery to this House. One was reminded of yesteryears when the Hon. Ronnie de Mel was the Minister of Finance and sometimes delivered longer budgets than what was done yesterday.

Nevertheless, let me record the fact that the Minister of Finance mentioned right at the beginning of his Budget presentation that this is the seventieth Budget since Independence and that he was presenting it as the twentieth Minister of Finance and he sought to make a point about that fact, therefore this is a landmark Budget.

When one listened to the Proposals, it seemed that there was a deviation in the economic policy, a significant deviation. Even some of the measures proposed - which the newspapers have highlighted this morning, as is the custom - prices of essentials, which are the most concerned to the ordinary person, have been highlighted and there is good news there. The prices of at least 11 essential items have been reduced and reduced significantly. But when one looks at the method by which these reductions have taken place, one finds that it is more a price control measure than actually a spending by the Government. There are, of course, some proposals to grant subsidies to take the shock, so to say, of these reductions by the traders. But this poses an important question of the Governments interference with the market forces. It is good to tell the people and it is good to reduce the prices. It is not good to reduce the income that the farmer would get for his produce. So, the task then is to keep the prices that the farmer gets high enough, the yield for him to be substantial and yet keep the selling price low.

I know this is not a mean task and yet, it is for that purpose the Government exists. The Government needs to formulate economic polices and implement them in such a way that the low-income earners in the country, the poor in the country, will still be able to sustain themselves by buying essential items and at the same time, the same category of people - who are generally the producers - get enough income for themselves for their production. The Governments intervention can be positive or it can be negative. The objective might be to achieve what I just said, but the result might be the opposite. So, this is a balancing act and I am not very sure whether these Proposals that have been made, have actually come out of proper deliberations and formulation of sound economic policy or whether this is another Robin Hood Budget as the mini-Budget that was presented in January, this year. () ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of Special Assignment) . . rose. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, Hon. Minister. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, prices have been reduced by slashing the import duties. On the other hand, attempts have been made to ensure that the work of the local producer is also profitable. For example, take the case of canned fish.

505 506

Now, we have reduced the prices; but we are giving a subsidy of Rs. 15 to the local manufacturer so that he will not go out of business. So, both sides have to be looked into. You are quite right, but in fact, all these reductions in prices of potatoes et cetera, come through a reduction of the import duty and these are fluctuating. As you know, right along every government has intervened depending on weather conditions, local productions and things like that. So, while your argument is -[Interruption.] These are not price controls. It has been done by reducing the import tax. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) You can have a detailed discussion during the course of the Debate. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am thankful to the Hon. Minister. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) It is only a clarification. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I welcome that. I am now a little wiser as to what the portfolio of the Hon. Minister for Special Assignment actually handles. -[Interruption.] You would have been better off here asking questions rather than sitting there and answering them.

I was actually about to congratulate. I only posed a question to see whether these have received sufficient attention and whether these Proposals have come out of a proper thought process, research and so on, because I am raising the issue of sustainability of this approach. As a stopgap, yes, this is useful; but how long can government intervention mechanisms work to keep tight control of market forces? How long can subsidies be maintained? What is the long-term strategy to ease off the subsidies, to ease off even price control of essentials? Because one should look at what one must achieve in the long-term. I agree with what he said. I agree with the Proposals that it is important now to bring in these measures so that people do not starve. And, I know there are certain areas, certain sections, that were near levels in terms of adequate nutrition - this is not to be alarmist. So, you have to fix those problems. I would congratulate the Hon. Minister for introducing these Proposals that in fact people can purchase these absolute essentials for their nutrition at significantly lower prices than what they were being sold at.

Now, looking at the revenue collection - this has been one of the biggest problems - the forecast for revenue in Annex I to the Hon. Ministers speech, I think, is Rs. 223 billion more than the previous year. If that materializes, it is well and good. But, how confident are you that these new measures that you are introducing will actually result in a higher revenue for the coming year? I am raising this question because many of the measures are new measures. When you introduce a new measure of revenue collection, it takes time for that traction. It takes time to actually start collecting. So, I am rather skeptical about your projection for the ensuing year that you have an increase of Rs. 223 billion to that of the last year. There is always a huge gap. I looked at the utilization of that increased amount and I am glad that about 30 per cent of that increased projected revenue is for education. I would like to congratulate the Government for utilization of about Rs. 70 billion out of this Rs. 223 billion into the education sector, except that you have not reached the 6 per cent of the GDP in this Budget. There is a significant shortfall, but nevertheless I think the approach of expenditure in education, in the health sector and various social infrastructure development is a welcome proposal.

Now, how is this going to be funded? That is why I said it continues to be a "Robin Hood" approach. There are increased collections proposed from slightly higher income earners and that is also to be welcomed in a country where we want economic equality, equity and somewhat equal sharing of resources. This kind of measure is to be welcomed. But again, by the measures that have been proposed with regard to vehicles - a large share of this, I believe, will come through the changes that have been made to vehicle importation, emission tests and other methods. There are two objectives that are sought to be achieved here. The Hon. Minister is trying to kill two birds with one stone. He is trying to collect revenue, but he is also trying to deal with excessive vehicles on the roads. I think, that is a good approach. We have had, as has been said in the Budget Speech, a rise in the number of road accidents, deaths due to road accidents and excessive vehicles. The approach is good. But for the next year, is it possible to actually implement this, because it is not possible for you to increase the efficiency of public transportation methods in one year. You need time. This approach will then not necessitate increased roads. You do need roads for development. It is important. But for mass public transport, other measures have to be introduced.

There are important measures that have been mentioned in the Budget Speech like "monorail", "park and ride" et cetera. "Park and ride" was introduced sometime ago. But, it has been a failure. People are not using it. Moratuwa has a yard - a car park area and fairly semi-luxurious buses that can take people to work. But, people are not using them. So, one has to look into the failed projects and see why people are not using them. It may be a small adjustment that is necessary, but unless that is looked at and merely saying park and ride,

507 508

[ () ]

2015 21

monorail, increased waterway transportation will not help. I know that research also was done sometime ago with regard to utilizing our canals. That is an excellent idea. But, how much of that can be implemented over the next year? I think you cannot implement any of that in a period of one year; certainly not even two years or three years, perhaps it will take longer than that. So, while you make your effort at improving those mass transportation methods, you have to ease off the vehicular transportation cost of private vehicles, because otherwise, you are going to have a problem of people unable to own a small car, for instance, for a small family, and also not able to utilize efficient public transportation system.

The whole approach according to the Hon. Minister has been based on the Policy Statement presented by the Hon. Prime Minister on the 5th of November. If you look at that, it states, creating a wide and a strong middle-class. If you look at the middle-class of yesteryear and what is called the middle-class today, there is a significant difference. The middle-class 50 years ago was able to afford a vehicle for the family. They lived fairly comfortable lives. People at that level of position in Government sector or even higher cannot now afford those facilities that the middle-class of yesteryear was able to afford. So, then the question arises, How is it? What are the measures that are taken to strengthen this middle-class?. When I look at it in the economic Policy Statement and in Budget Proposals, I take it that the strength that you talk about is the economic strength, the self-sufficiency of a family unit to be able to sustain themselves, live fairly comfortable lives and even save for the future. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair. , [ ] .

, , [ ] .

Whereupon THE HON. SPEAKER left the Chair, and DEPUTY SPEAKER [THE HON. THILANGA SUMATHIPALA] took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, please continue. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

So, these are some of the issues that I wish to raise with regard to the actual implementability of these Proposals.

The revenue collection, the Hon. Minister has said, will be more efficient because DS Divisions are going to be utilized for revenue collection. I think that is a good idea, because that is one of the weakest in the whole system - where the revenue collection agency is not able to collect the projected revenue. There is a huge gap between what ought to be collected legitimately as the revenue and what they are actually able to collect. If you do utilize the Divisional Secretaries, because they function fairly efficiently and are able to reach each household and each small business, that may work well.

With regard to micro, small and medium enterprises, the proposals that have been made are good. Overall, the economic proposals that have been made in the Budget Speech are to be welcomed, but yet, the sound of caution is that how much of it can actually be achieved. For instance, what would then suffer is the Capital Expenditure. When you are unable to reach your targets, Recurrent Expenditure cannot be compromised on; that has to be met. But, Capital Expenditure is the one that suffers. If you look at Mid-Year Fiscal Statements and so on, that would be reflected. When Capital Expenditure suffers, all of your Utopian ideas that are reflected in this Speech will come to nothing because - [Interruption.] That is right. What I am saying is, what is projected as Recurrent Expenditure you have to spend anyway. So, the shortfall in the revenue collection will impact on your capital spending. Then, you would not be able to actually implement many of the projects that have been proposed - projects that are good; projects that are forward-looking and projects that will ease our economic situation for the future. You may not be able to even start some of those because your revenue collection machinery is not functioning properly.

In that respect, corruption is a huge factor. I can say today that corruption, even by revenue collection agencies, is a serious issue and until that is dealt with, the State will not be able to actually receive the projected revenue. Only recently, we saw the officials of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption nabbing some Customs officers. The amount of bribe that was caught, or said to have been caught, was enormous. In one raid, if you can find that amount of cash as bribery passing hands, then you can actually imagine how much of revenue to the State that is being withheld. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Only 35 per cent. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Only 35 per cent? The Hon. Member from Kandy seems to know the rate of bribes that the officials take. I am clueless on these and thank you for elucidating. So, if he says it is 35 per cent of that 100 per cent, 35 per cent is

509 510

what the State loses as revenue. It is well and good to have all of these targets. But, unless the Government policy with regard to bribery and corruption is clearly spelt out and demonstrated that there is zero tolerance for bribery, we will not be able to achieve any of these targets. And talking of policy, I am glad that the Hon. Minister of Finance ended his Speech by hoping that this country will become a "Rainbow nation" where the happiness index will be high and so on.

We are also glad that there is a specific allocation of Rs. 14 billion for North-East development. I think it is the first time such an allocation has been made since the end of the war. That is to be welcomed. But the question is, what will it be used for? For Southern development, the allocation is Rs. 2 billion; for North-East development, it is Rs. 14 billion. Yes, it is seven times the allocation for Southern development. But, what will it be used for and how? If you use that allocation for, say, building of roads, most of that will be swallowed up. So, I urge the Government that other infrastructure facilities such as roads, railways and various other network arrangements should not be taken from this particular allocation, but that expenditure must go from the allocations made to the respective ministries.

Along with this allocation of Rs. 14 billion - we would have liked to have much more than that, but I appreciate allocating this amount - comes a promise of a Donor Conference for North-East in 2016, particularly with the aim of recovery from the devastation of the war. We welcome that and urge the Government to hold that Donor Conference so that we might receive substantial sums of money for this very important aspect, because this has been neglected for six years since the end of the war. Six years is a long time. If you neglect an area that has been devastated by war for such a long period of time, then the recovery takes even longer and the investment that you have to make will be enormously higher than if you addressed it immediately. Unfortunately, that was not a priority. There were roads and bridges built - we conceded that and welcomed that - even in the course of the last Government, but that did not reach the people. Yes, you have made some allocation for the North-East development, bearing in mind that that area needs far more than perhaps the other areas because of the special needs associated with war recovery. But, how that money is to be utilized, is absolutely important and how you consult with the people there and how you identify the very special needs of that area - which are different to the other areas - is absolutely essential. And I hope that that exercise of consultation with the People's Representatives of that area will be genuine, will be real and will actually result in projects and methods that are implemented, which will raise the living standards of the people there. We need to empower those people to stand up on their own feet. This is a fundamental issue that needs to be addressed.

Various measures were implemented over the last four - five years. When the war ended, the first institutions that rushed to the North were the banks - banks went and lent money. Now there is a huge issue of people being indebted, unable to pay back their debts. A huge debt culture has been created. This is a common feature of our banks that they lend without proper evaluation of the ability of the borrower to repay. They are happy to take security and have the comfort of the security for the lending that they give without actually examining the method, the viability of the project. This has happened in the North-East, particularly in the North, where people have kept as security, sometimes even the Indian houses that were given to them, because it was owner-built, owner-driven projects and when they wanted to expand, have an extra room or so, they mortgaged that very property; borrowed from the banks and built the houses. Now they are unable to repay those loans and the house and the property is mortgaged to the bank and is at a serious risk of being taken away by the banks. We were happy when the Indian Government gave so many - fifty thousand houses - and I think, twenty seven thousand or more have been completed and the others are nearing completion. But one of the huge problems that we are now facing is that even those recipients have been caught in this debt trap. This needs to be addressed even for the future.

The Hon. Prime Minister said on the 5th of November that it is the policy of this Government to create one million jobs. That is a tall order, but you need that. If you look at - I am speaking here about the North and I believe this applies with almost equal force to the other areas as well - people do not have jobs, the youth do not have jobs. With regard to unemployment, I do not know what the official figures that the Central Bank is dishing out, but if you actually go to the villages you will see that people do not have employment, people do not have jobs. This again is a huge issue that is confronting the North, particularly the youth, and the fall out is also not something that is good. If they are unemployed, if they cannot keep themselves occupied, there are other issues that arise and some of those we have seen in the form of various social evils, and this must be a prime concern. As much as I welcome the general tenor of these Budget Proposals, I do not see enough in these Proposals to actually achieve that target of one million jobs that the Hon. Prime Minister set out on the 5th of November. You need a massive drive, a job creation drive. It must be at a policy level that will actually result in a sea change of bringing the unemployment down and that is not something that we can see in this. As someone who represents a war-devastated area, the need there is even greater. I urge the Government to think, work out methods of job creation, increase economic activity and as I said before, your weakness in revenue collection will definitely have an adverse impact on even the mediocre proposals that you have with regard to job creation. Because that will be Capital Expenditure and

511 512

[ .. ]

2015 21

you will not be able to utilize funds for Capital Expenditure and all the money that you are able to collect will be swallowed up by the Recurrent Expenditure. So, there has to be a paradigm shift in the economic thinking and the vision, if you are to actually move forward and achieve those targets that were said as the economic policies of the Government by the Hon. Prime Minister the other day.

With regard to reconciliation, we welcome the sentiments that have been expressed and some token measures that have been proposed. But, the whole economic recovery of the country, prosperity of the nation, is very much dependent on, as the Hon. Minister of Finance himself said, "happiness index" and that happiness index must be by all peoples of this country. You cannot have a policy, I am not accusing this Government of that policy, I am merely saying you cannot have a policy of making some section of the country happy at the expense of the other. Now this has been one of our serious issues. Irresponsible statements were made by political leaders so that their constituency's happiness index increases exponentially whilst others are badly affected.

I am going to give some examples, some current examples. Again, this is not an allegation that I am making against this Government. When the war ended, there were several people in detention under the Prevention of Terrorism Act - a piece of legislation that has been universally condemned as draconian. It has features that have affected everyone in the country. My Colleagues in the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna were at the receiving end at sometime or the other. It is draconian, it cannot remain on the statute books of any civilized country. That is accepted. At the end of the war there were nearly 12,000 fighting cadres of the LTTE who were taken into custody and the Government made a very positive policy decision not to charge them with any offence but to rehabilitate them. We have commended that. I, myself have spoken a number of times in this House, commending that effort. Through a period of two-year rehabilitation, they returned to the society - even those who bore arms and fought in the final battles. But for some inexplicable reason you continued to detain the others who were in prison under the PTA prior to the end of the war and most of them charged only with helping the LTTE. In certain areas, around those times, there was no option but to help the LTTE. They were arrested for giving a parcel of food or for selling some produce in their shops to somebody known as an LTTE cadre. The law has a provision which says, "Failure to give information to the police is an offence". They do not have bail while they are incarcerated. So, over 800 people were in detention. Now that has come down to 200 odd. Various figures are given, but I believe it is 200 odd. At one point it was 273, at another point it was 216 and 217 and again, two days ago it was 268. I do not know how these figures can change. That itself gives rise to a lot of suspicion.

There is a lot of suspicion today because the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances just came to Sri Lanka and left and they have found it be true an allegation that we made known to the country and to the Government early this year, that there was a secret detention camp in the Naval Dockyard in Trincomalee. They have found it to be true and what is more? This morning's newspaper quotes former Navy Commander Karannagoda confirming that it is true. The front page of the todays The Island newspaper reports what the Former Navy Commander Karannagoda has said. He says, Yes, we used some old British air raid shelters to keep them. All he says is, We did not torture them. But he admits to the secret detention camps. He is able to say that and walk around freely on the roads today. How is that possible? Where are those people, today? Where are those people that the former Navy Commander reveals to the country as having been kept in secret detention camps in old air raid shelters that were there in the Naval Dockyard in Trincomalee? We brought this to the attention of the Government early this year. The Government said, "We have asked the Service Commanders and they say that there is nothing like that. But we have met people who were kept there - some of them who have later been released. It was with evidence that we confronted the Government and it took the Working Committee on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances to actually visit the country. Now we know why the Rajapaksa Government did not allow a visit by the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. The irony is that Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa in 1989 and 1990 took lists of people to this Working Group. It is to this Working Group that he went and gave lists of persons who are said to have disappeared in this country and it was he - when he was President - who refused to allow them to come into this country. We commend the Government for opening the doors because, experts as they are, with 1,2 or 3 visits, they have been able to ascertain the different places of not only secret detention, but also of torture, because they have been able to find writings on the walls. Torture victims have written on the walls with their blood and that has been found by the Working Group. The Former Navy Commander, who thinks that he is acting so wisely, says, No, we did not torture them, but we kept them. What does this revelation do to this country? ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) "Kept in secret." .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, "kept in secret" - so that confirms. Now, you have all these good words to say about "reconciliation",

513 514

"Rainbow nation", "allocating funds" and so on. But, will there be reconciliation in this country if a serious issue such as this is continued to be swept under the carpet? And what is worse, people who have spent their time in prison for such long periods - some have been there for over 30 years; some have been there for over 20 years - and their cases are not yet over. Now the number is only 200 and measures are being taken to have them released through some programme and what do we have? People screaming "blue murder". Persons who are attached to the former Regime say, "If you release them, terrorism will rear its head again." What kind of irresponsible statement is that? Prof. G.L. Peiris, claiming to be learned in the law, is issuing public statements. He was a Minister; he was the Minister of External Affairs in the previous Government, when you took the responsible and the right step of deciding to rehabilitate 12,000 people who actually fought in the final battle and released them. So, how is it now possible to justify keeping these persons in custody, who are only accused of having helped the LTTE in carrying out its activities? When the new Government accepts that, that must be rectified. He comes out with stories to whip up racial hatred, emotions in the South, which is totally unjustified. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Karunarathna Paranawithana - Deputy Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government) We do not accept it. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, you do not accept it. I am glad that the Hon. Paranawithana says that. But, this venom is being spread to the South. Why is that happening? I am glad that you say, We do not accept it. But, we have a grievance against your Government as well. This is a very small number that have been left to rot in prison for so long. So, why can you not release them? You are relying on officials and these are the very officials who tortured them. These are the very officials in the Terrorist Investigation Division. There are enough reports internationally today by persons with medical evidence who have been tortured in the TID. Those very officials are still manning those posts. They are still there and they come for meetings and oppose releasing these people who have spent over 20 years and 30 years in prison. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) You are holding them under laws, which you say will be repealed.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes. You have agreed that the Prevention of Terrorism Act will be repealed. Then, how are you holding these people? How can you hold these people? It is a law that you yourself have now finally admitted as draconian and must be taken off the statute books of this country. ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) It was a commitment given to the Human Rights Council. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That was given as a commitment by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in his opening speech itself on the 14th of September this year. The Resolution that you co-sponsored says it but there is still reluctance to release them. All you have done so far is release 39 persons on bail. You have not released them; you have only enlarged them on bail - initially with tough bail conditions that they could not furnish. Fortunately, that was later reduced and most of them have been able to go home; but on bail only. If they are on bail, what does it mean? They are suspected to have committed an offence under the PTA. You do not even know what that offence is, because they have still not been charged. You will only enlarge them on bail, only some of them on bail, and you say the others cannot be enlarged on bail.

Ninety nine of these prisoners have written and said that they are willing to undergo rehabilitation. I met them - I met them with the Hon. Minister of Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms; I met them with the Hon. Leader of the Opposition some time ago and I met them with the Chief Minister of the Northern Province. At all of those times they told us that they are giving that letter only because that maybe a way out for them. They are not giving those letters with their heart in it, they are giving it so that at least through that process they would be released. Ninety nine of them have given letters. The Government says, Yes. We will consider that favourably. It is on that promise that the second fast-unto-death was suspended last Monday. But there is no commitment to send even some of them to rehabilitation.

The information that I got yesterday is the Government agrees to send some of them for rehabilitation. But, there are further conditions attached to that and that is not acceptable. Why cannot people who have been in prison for over five years, over ten years, over fifteen years, be released? They are held under the PTA. You have to repeal that Act tomorrow. In nine months there will be an oral update to the UN Human

Rights Council. Repealing an Act does not take you that long, it can be done in two months. But you have to do that. You are holding on unreasonably to people who have suffered immensely through this incarceration. Their families have suffered and continue to suffer deprivation. I am making this allegation against the Government: you are doing that because you are worried about these irresponsible accusations that are being levelled by the Members of the former Regime. The people of this country are not so unreasonable. They will not protest if the truth is told; they will not protest if they are told that these people have been kept for helping the LTTE, when 12,000 LTTE cadres themselves were released by the former Regime, when the LTTE leaders were Ministers in the previous Regime sitting in this House, the deputy commander of the LTTE - who is accused of killing in cold blood several hundred policemen - was seated here as a Member of the former Regime. With what face are they facing the people and uttering these untruths that releasing these few 200 people, who have been incarcerated unjustifiably, unreasonably for such a long period of time, is going to revive terrorism again in this country while they have made one of them the Chief Minister of the Eastern Province? ( ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan) He was arrested for murder of a politician. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Only now he is being arrested. Wheels of justice, they say, grind - but exceedingly slow. So, we can see the slow progress. Nevertheless, we recognize the progress. At least now some action has been taken. But, there are others, some of whom are sitting in the Opposition benches now, who have been identified by name in your own LLRC Report. They are still out and about. The former Deputy Minister is still out and about, the one that the whole world knows as an arms procurer. Hon. Deputy Minister, you were vociferous from this side about KP. He is still a free man. You were the Deputy Minister of Justice for a number of months. He is still a free man. You shouted hoarse from here asking questions about him. He is still a free man under your Government. () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana) . . rose. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Member from Galle, you were a Member of the previous Government. - [Interruption.] I am shocked that

you are -[Interruption]. The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana is generally a very reasonable man. You were a Member of the previous Government. All this happened under the previous Government. I am calling them to task for not delivering their promises. But certainly, it does not lie in your mouth to say, "Shame", "Shame" to them. - [Interruption.]

So, I am asking these questions. How are you able to justify keeping all these poor souls in prison, worried and frightened that some outdated Professor will charge you; will scream at you; will wipe up racist sentiments, while you are not taking any action against persons against whom there is an Interpol warrant? The late Hon.(Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardena produced that warrant - the red notice from Interpol - here, in this House. It is 11 months since you said you ushered in Yahapalanaya. It is Yahapalanaya for that man, not for the good people of this country. Your good governance seems to be good for bad people, whom you have allowed to remain free. This cannot go on. Now, this is the month of November. Before I wind up, I want to say something very important. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have three more minutes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you Sir, for letting me know the time and within that time I have to say this important issue.

This is the month of November. It is in the month of November that we remember fallen heroes. That is why poppies are sold at the beginning of November. I wore a poppy flower that was given as I walked into Parliament. We all honour the dead; we all honour those who fell fighting for some cause or the other. When I made my Maiden Speech on the 6th of May, 2010, I said, We mourn the death of every Sri Lankan soldier who died in this unnecessary war. Similarly, the Government and every Sinhalese and Muslim person also must mourn the death of every LTTE cadre who died in this unnecessary war. That sentiment must be expressed. It is important, if you are serious about reconciliation, it is important for you to allow memorialization, and the Government has agreed that memorializaiton will be allowed. Many of the LTTE cemeteries have been desecrated - the most uncivil action by the previous Government. I have gone to some villages, I will mention the names of the villages, Uduturai, Aliyawalai in my constituency where people showed me the area where their children are buried. There are coconut estates there. It has been flattened by bulldozers.

The most uncivil thing that any community can do is to desecrate cemeteries. That has been done. They still

517 518

want to remember their children in the month of November. As we remember and celebrate it world over - I did wear a poppy flower - I want our people who have lost their children - they may have been LTTE cadres - to remember them. But they all belong to us and they have died. I want those parents and others to remember their children and brothers in the month of November. They have done that for years. They were prevented by the previous Regime from doing that. But I plead with this Government to permit them to remember them in those cemeteries in the month of November. We are at a stage where we are not asking for division of the country. You know that. We are at a stage that we have publicly eschewed violence. You know that. You know that those people, relatives of the fallen cadres, have voted for that kind of policy. What more do you want? We have said, We do not want to divide the country. We have said, We do not want to take up arms again, but let us remember our children who fought for a cause. Be magnanimous and permit these families in this month, beginning tomorrow, for another week to remember their dead.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) The next speaker is, the Hon. Kabir Hashim. You have 30 minutes. [.. 11.38] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim - Minister of Public Enterprise Development ) , . . , 10 , . . , . , . - - . .

ILO - International Labour Organization - . .

A few years back, I had the opportunity of attending the International Labour Conference of ILO in Geneva. During the tea break, I had an argument with the then Minister of Labour from Lebanon over migrant workers. That topic came up during the tea break and I said, "the migrant workers from Sri Lanka are coming to your country; they are being treated in a very low manner; they are not treated properly; they are not recognized properly; they are not paid their salaries properly. You all must realize that it is a service-oriented matter. It is a win-win matter. My service is for you and your salary is for me. So, you all must not think that you have only to pay the migrant workers, but they should also be treated properly". Then, that Minister of Labour got annoyed over my statement and he asked me in a very sarcastic manner, Are you from the 'housemaid country'?. Sir, just see as to how we are classified; how we are recognized. He asked me whether I am from the

619 620

"housemaid country". He was having a cup of tea in his hand. Then, I replied, Look here! I am not from the 'housemaid country'. I am from the country which produces the best tea in the world. That is 'Ceylon Tea' which you are having now. Please mind your business and do not utter unnecessary words." Sir, I told him that I am not from a "housemaid country", but I am from the best tea-making country in the world. He shut his mouth as he never expected me to reply in that manner. He may be the Minister of Labour in Lebanon, but I am not concerned about that. I replied in such a manner so that he realized that I did not like his reference that I am from the "housemaid country". Just see how they recognize us. Sir, if other countries can buy our tea, blend and sell, why do we also not import tea from other countries to blend it here, to add value and to re-export to other countries so that we can make a lot of money? We can make profit out of that. I really welcome the suggestion made by the Hon. Minister of Finance to import tea, blend it and add value to that. ,
