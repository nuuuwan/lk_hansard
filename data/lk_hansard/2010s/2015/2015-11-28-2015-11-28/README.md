[1.39 p.m.] ... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am very proud to address this august Assembly when you are presiding. Please permit me, in the first instance, to congratulate the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake for presenting the maiden Budget of the National Government while standing up boldly to face the challenges to the nation.

All of us must consider the extremely trying circumstances and adversities created by forces beyond our control under which the Budget was presented to this House. The two main Parties, the UNP and the SLFP, which previously presented separate Budgets when each Party was in power, have presented a combined Budget for the first time. The Government presented a mini

Budget in January this year. This is the first full Budget presented by the two main Parties under the National Government, a Consensual Government.

Sir, the people of Sri Lanka elected His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena as the President in pursuit of much-needed changes. This was confirmed at the Parliamentary Elections held in August this year.

This Budget is expected to contain important proposals for the development drive and consolidate the strong economic growth. The Government has paid attention to five important areas of concern - generation of one million job opportunities; enhancement of income levels; upliftment of rural economies; ensuring of land ownership in rural and estate sectors and creation of a wide and a strong middle-class.

Changes have been made to the tax policy which would focus on earning 60 per cent of revenue from indirect taxes and the rest through direct taxes. This is different to the present policy of earning 80 per cent of the revenue from direct taxes. It is also announced that the one-off tax and import tax on textbooks and sports goods would be removed, which would benefit the persons in education and sports sectors. Then, all sorts of taxes will be exempted from all Sri Lankan expatriate workers. It is also announced that those living in Government-owned houses on rent for more than ten years and those living in line rooms would be given ownership. Further, a system similar to that in Singapore would be introduced and an institution would be set up with regard to National Entrepreneurship.

Meanwhile, several new institutions such as National Development Agency to handle development projects; International Trade Agency to formulate international trade and a Competitive Tribunal aimed at controlling monopolies in the financial markets will be set up. In addition, agriculture insurance agencies where farmers will play a role will also be set up in order to build a stable agricultural sector. A new Trust will be established to safeguard public wealth and properties where both the State and the private sector will play a role.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, now we have the opportunity to present to this august Assembly our vision and our economic strategy for development. Our standing in the world is secured, sustainable and strong. Based on this, we believe we can build a strong economy for Sri Lanka. Also, plans have been drawn up to put in place mechanisms that will seek not only to strengthen the economic sphere, but also many other sectors such as political, social, education and health. Within the next two years, we can build to consolidate our plans and take the journey forward.

Sir, in January this year, salaries of Government Servants were increased; incentives were given to pensioners; prices of petrol, diesel, and gas were brought down; Mahapola Scholarship grants were increased and the Samurdhi allowances were increased by over 200 per cent - which were admired by all the people. Further, the

1385 1386

debts of the farmers were removed and they were assured a certified price for paddy. Charges on marriage registrations were reduced. Special allowances are to be provided for montessori teachers and dhaham pasal teachers. This Budget is a "Peoples Budget" where prices of several essential commodities were reduced and controlled for their benefit.

Sir, I must thank the Finance Minister for removing the emission test fee of Rs. 5,000 imposed on trishaws and motorcycles. I would also urge the Minister to remove the tax imposed on vans, especially school vans. This increase would largely affect the parents since they will be called upon by the van owners to bear the increased amount. I feel the increase of the price of a three-wheelers by Rs. 100,000 would put the poor auto owners into great difficulties. Each four-wheeler is an employment generator for them. They also must live and they do not have any other means of livelihood. Over hundreds and thousands of poor people ride their luck on three-wheelers in order to keep the home fires burning.

Now I wish to turn a new leaf. There is a great awakening all round today as more and more mothers take to breastfeeding. But the reduction in milk food, I would believe, would discourage mothers from breastfeeding. I feel that this is not a healthy sign. It is better to encourage mothers more and more to breastfeed their babies, which is definitely encouraged by the medical world, and not encourage them in any way to go in for imported infant milk food.

A considerable sum of money has been allocated for education considering electricity supply to many schools, development of schools, including primary schools and to improve water supply and sanitary facilities.

This Budget has also allocated a large amount of money for the housing sector. Special focus must be given to the middle-class and rural people.

I am extremely happy that His Excellency the President had offered me a portfolio in order to promote national integration and reconciliation at a crucial time in the history of our country. People of this country gave a mandate to His Excellency the President in order to establish permanent peace in the country and to build up a healthy nation sans enmity, hatred and racial acrimony. I am fully aware of the responsibility cast upon me and shall endeavour to do in my best ability in order to help the Yaha Palanaya" achieve these laudable objectives.

Muslims in this country have always stood for national unity and national integrity of this country. We had, in the past, great national leaders like Dr. T.B. Jayah, Sir. Mohamed Macan Markar, Sir. Razik Fareed, Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel and Dr. Badiuddin Mahmud, to name a few. These great leaders have left us a rich legacy on which path if we would march together, we will be able to build a strong Sri Lanka enabling every community to live with happiness, tranquility and peace.

Intense interest is shown internationally on the progress made by this National Government in so short time after coming into power. In this context, I view the visit of Samantha Power, US Permanent Representative to the UN, to Jaffna. She has called for a robust mechanism and speedy actions to bridge the trust deficit that exists in the Northern Province where people call for truth and an end to impunity.

The truth is that the entire Muslim community in Jaffna were chased away within a short period of four hours from their place of birth, their places of dwellings, educational institutions and places of worship. While not failing to miss out on a "strategic opportunity", as she asserts, the Muslim factor should not be forgotten or put in the limbo of forgotten things. When the Chief Minister, Mr. C.V. Vigneswaran; the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. R. Sampanthan and the TNA are seeking assurances from the US that pressure would be continuously applied to deliver on promises given to Tamils, equally or more importantly the multifarious problems faced by the Muslim community there, should also be fully addressed. Their lands must be given back; their houses, properties, schools and mosques and madrasas must be rehabilitated and Muslims must be settled there as before.

I am equally happy that Samantha Power visited the Moor Street in Jaffna and engaged herself in "elle diplomacy" with Muslim girls of Osmania College, Jaffna. One is reminded here of the "Ping-pong diplomacy" engaged on an earlier occasion by the USA and China bringing face to face the two great powers in building up a bridge of understanding and reconciliation. I am sure that Samantha Power would have personally seen the scars left over in the area by the horrendous crimes committed by the ruthless LTTE of the worst ethnic cleansing of Muslim community in the North. I could positively believe she would stand up to "truth and justice", as she said, when briefing New York and Geneva on the problems of Sri Lankan Tamils.

Almighty God says in the Holy Quran: "Wa Baraka Baina Huma Bil Khair." He calls upon the humanity to build love and affection on the basis of unity. This sublime teaching would definitely charter a clear path for all the communities in the country who enjoy the fruits of Yaha Palanaya.

This is the most opportune moment for all of us to get rid of our ignorance and pursue a path to promote national integration, dialogue an understanding as Gouthama Buddha said that "the darkest night is ignorance".

Thank you.

Sir, further to the political matters in the Budget, I want to express some real facts regarding the Malabe private medical college. Recently, around 500 students of

that private medical college protested in silence in front of the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine and sought justice from this Government. The South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine - SAITM - is the only private medical college in our country. Close to 1,000 students are studying there.

Recently, we heard that the Sri Lanka Medical Council has announced by a letter that the medical degree offered by SAITM will not be recognized by them. But, the Sri Lanka Medical Council has not made any suggestion to this private medical college as to how it could get its medical degree recognized. The SLMC is of the view that the number of patients in the Teaching Hospital of SAITM is not enough. It is okay.

In 2014, a court case had been filed by SAITM. Ultimately, the court had ordered the Government to authorize some government hospitals for the clinical studies of the medical students of SAITM. But, up to now, it has not been implemented by the Government, not even by the present Government. My request is, implement the court Order, which is essential for SAITM students. Foreign countries like Russia, China, India, America and Canada allow Sri Lankan medical students to do the clinical practice in their State hospitals. So, why can we not allow Sri Lankan medical students to do their clinical practice in our State hospitals?

The second matter is regarding forensic medicine. In Sri Lanka, private hospitals cannot do post-mortem examinations. That is the duty of the government hospitals. Then, SAITM students have to do their clinical studies in mortuaries of the government hospitals, which the court had already ordered. So, why is this Government reluctant to allow that?

The third matter is regarding community medicine. Community health comes under the Medical Officers of Health in the country. Then, SAITM students have the right to do clinical training under the MOHs. Foreign countries allow Sri Lankan students in their community to do such clinical studies. Why is our country acting against our own students?

Running a private medical college in our country is a way of educational tourism. I am saying that because, a study done by the UNESCO shows that Rs. 145,000 million goes out of the country every year for education. Sri Lankan students who pursue higher studies overseas reportedly spend Rs. 145,000 million annually. If private universities like SAITM can be established and developed in our country, we can save billions of rupees flowing out to foreign countries every year because around 4,000 Sri Lankan medical students study in foreign countries. Through educational tourism, we can attract foreign students from South-East Asian countries to come and study here. So, by developing that tourism sector, we can earn more. That is a fact.

Sir, only 16 per cent of the Sri Lankan students who qualify for higher education are recruited to the national universities. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Order, please! . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , " " . , . . Question put, and agreed to. , . , , . Whereupon THE HON. MUJIBUR RAHUMAN left the Chair, and THE HON. GNANAMUTHU SRINESHAN took the Chair. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please continue. . ( . ) (The Hon. S. Sivamohan) Sir, only 16 per cent of the eligible Sri Lankan students are recruited to the national universities according to the website of the University Grants Commission. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, if the Hon. Member wants a private medical college in the North, we are willing to support. Hon. Member, you must help us to establish it.

. ( . ) (The Hon. S. Sivamohan) Thank you for the views expressed by the Hon. Leader of the House.

So, 84 per cent of those students are left out of the universities every year. This has resulted in 8 per cent of the students going abroad for higher studies. For example, if SAITM is given a chance, they can study here in this country within our culture. If female students go to foreign countries for studies, it is even bad for our culture.

The Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Health and the University Grants Commission have been maintaining a deadly silence over this matter up to now despite calls from students and professional bodies including the Government Medical Officers' Association to address it. Recently, I had a discussion with all the Consultants of the Government Medical Officers' Association, Vavuniya Branch. They are willing to give clinical training even in the Vavuniya General Hospital for the SAITM students.

Sir, the University Grants Commission approved the medical degree offered by SAITM in 2011 through a Gazette Notification. Thereafter, the University Grants Commission started selecting students to study there, conferring it equal status with the other State universities. Also, they have agreed to give degree certificates. But, the problem lies with the Sri Lanka Medical Council. The Sri Lanka Medical Council has to make their suggestions as to how SAITM could be developed for its degree to be recognized. That should be done. But, they have not suggested anything regarding SAITM. If they feel that the clinical practice given to the students of SAITM is not enough, they have to suggest to the Government to give clinical practice to those students in State hospitals. That is the way. All private universities abroad, even in Russia, Canada and everywhere, make use of government hospitals for their clinical studies. So, I think the Government has to initiate action immediately in this regard, because in the near future, the first batch is due to get their degree certificates. Therefore, we have to give our support to them.

At the same time, if the Sri Lanka Medical Council feels that the students of SAITM have a poor knowledge, they have to come to a conclusion whether to give the students of SAITM the same exam papers that are given to the students of the Colombo Medical Faculty. The students of SAITM agree to sit for the same examination. So, some sort of suggestions have to be made by the Sri Lanka Medical Council in this regard. If they fail to do so, we have to give SAITM a chance.

I am also a doctor. When I was in university, I also fought against private universities. But, now I feel that

those are wrong ideas. We had those ideas as a result of the ego of young doctors. That is the reason. Other than that, I do not think there is any reason to be against private universities. . Now, the world is so wide. , , . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I want to ask the Hon. Member whether he can find an investor to start a private medical college in the North. If he can find an investor, we will support him. . ( . ) (The Hon. S. Sivamohan) First, we have to give some solution to the problems at SAITM. Then, we have to develop willingness among students to study in private universities. Then only other private universities will also open their branches here. As I said, Rs. 145,000 million goes out of the country every year for Sri Lankan students to study abroad. Therefore, we have to start private universities in Sri Lanka so that we can save our money. That is my view and that is why I raised this matter in this august Assembly. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Member, will not the medical students of the University of Jaffna oppose this? . ( . ) (The Hon. S. Sivamohan) In every university some students are of that view. Now, in the Sri Lanka Government Medical Officers' Association, around 30 per cent are foreign-educated doctors. That means, they had gone to foreign countries for their higher education. About 25 per cent of the Consultants are also foreign-educated. Now, the situation is changing a little bit. Earlier, it was not like that. But, that is the reality. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) You speak to the students and the lecturers, and if there is agreement, we can do something. . ( . ) (The Hon. S. Sivamohan) Definitely I will take this matter up with them.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Kindly follow it up. . ( . ) (The Hon. S. Sivamohan) Yes, I will follow that up.

. . That is a nursery - a preschool. Sir, in towns, these preschool teachers are getting enough money from the parents. But, in our poor areas, parents of these children are not in a position to pay even Rs. 100. , ; . . , . , ? , . , .
