Mr. Speaker, the US State Department released their Counter-terrorism Report this June, 2015. The report covered the calendar year 2014, during which the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva himself was a Cabinet Minister in the Rajapaksa administration. It is noted that a total of 13 LTTE supporters were arrested in Malaysia in 2014. Like the report that preceded it covering the calendar year 2013, it mentioned that the LTTEs network of support continued to operate shockingly, under the very regime that claimed to have eradicated the threat of terrorism once and for all.

That LTTE groups may still have the motivation to sustain their financial and support networks five years after the end of the war is a clear indicator of the failure of the Rajapaksa administrations post-war counter-terrorism policies.

The Report, as you all know, covers developments in countries in which acts of terrorism occurred, countries that are State sponsors of terrorism, and countries determined by the Secretary of State to be of particular interest in the global war on terror. As provided in the legislation, the Report reviews major developments in bilateral and multilateral counter-terrorism cooperation as well. In fact, we consider these Annual Reports extremely useful for all Governments and all organizations and agencies that are committed to combating terrorism.

The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva has correctly pointed out that five years after the war, the threat of violence may still exist. What should then be debated is not whether this Government is aware of a Report that has been produced every year since 2004, but why the post-war counter-terrorism strategies of the Rajapaksa regime have failed so miserably. It is clear that we must now employ new strategies to ensure the future security of all Sri Lankans.

Mr. Speaker, this Governments approach is very different to the approach of the previous Government. We are using soft power and diplomacy, while ensuring

159 160

2015 24

our borders remain strong and our maritime security remains firm to win the hearts and minds of all those who may have opposed the State, whatever ethnic, religious, class or cultural group they may represent. It is the Governments intention to remove the base of support of violent radical groups, by diminishing their popularity and legitimacy among the populations who might otherwise sustain them with material and moral support.

Sir, in this regard, I wish to reiterate to this House that this Government is firm in its resolve to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. This is, and always will be our consistent policy with regard to terrorism. Our nation has been torn apart by acts of terror for several decades in its history. We are sadly all too familiar with the bombs at market places, in city centres, trains and buses, places of worship and commercial establishments. We have all been affected in some form or another by the brutal violence of a conflicted nation. The responsibility of ensuring that this country never regresses back to an era of violence and terror is not one that should be confined to any one party, any one Government or any one leader. It should be the collective and shared responsibility of all.

Following the wide ranging consultations held, the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission states very clearly in its Report, I quote:

The conflict could have been avoided had the southern political leaders of the two main political parties acted in the national interest and forged a consensus between them to offer an acceptable solution to the Tamil people. The Tamil political leaders were equally responsible for this conflict which could have been avoided had the Tamil leaders refrained from promoting an armed campaign towards secession, acquiescing in the violence and terrorist methods used by the LTTE against both the Sinhala and Tamil people, and failing to come out strongly and fearlessly against the LTTE, and their atrocious practices. A collective act of contrition for what happened would not come easily to either party. It would come only if they are ready to make a profound moral self-appraisal in the light of the human tragedy that has occurred.

These are the wise words of the very Commission appointed by former President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, and I am glad to say that at last the two leaders of the two main political parties have come together to act in the national interest even at this late stage.

As you are aware, Sir, the LTTE continues to be listed as a US Government-designated foreign terrorist organization. This Government is in the process of strengthening diplomatic ties with those countries that have worked with us in the past to weaken the LTTEs funding and support networks.

The USA was one of the first countries to list the LTTE as a Foreign Terrorist Organization way back in 1997 and also listed its front organizations such as the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization - TRO - and cooperation continues even today between security agencies of the USA and Sri Lanka on pending cases against the LTTE operatives in the USA.

In fact, in 2006 in my earlier incarnation as Foreign Minister, the US Government at the request of the then Secretary of State, my then counterpart, Condoleezza Rice established a special unit in the FBI consisting of 41 full-time agents to track the various LTTE funding outfits operating in the United States of America and I believe that that unit is still functional even today. The US designation was pivotal to the suppression of the LTTE, which led to their military defeat in 2009. The listing in the US and in other parts of the world prevented much needed funding from reaching the LTTE, which was essential for the carrying out of its terrorist activities in Sri Lanka.

Mr. Speaker, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition wishes to know whether the Government is vigilant and is taking necessary precautions in dealing with the LTTE and entities connected to the LTTE. He also wishes to know whether the Government is examining the activities of such entities and taking necessary steps. I would like to remind the Hon. Leader of the Opposition that our Government agencies maintain close cooperation in intelligence sharing with all interlocutors, particularly those committed to combating terrorism. This includes combating financial networks. The Government of Sri Lanka continues to maintain its partnership with the US Department of State, Homeland Security, Defence, and Energy on securing the countrys maritime border. The US Coast Guard, under the Department of States Export Control and Related Border Security Programme, continues to train Sri Lankan Coast Guard and Navy personnel on border and export control matters, and the Sri Lankan Government continues to cooperate with the US Customs and Border Protection through the Container Security Initiative.

In addition, our Government continues to collaborate with the EU Immigration Department on an Advanced Passenger Information System, which transmits passenger information to Sri Lankan immigration officials upon arrival. And further, Sri Lanka is one of 85 partner nations in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism.

Mr. Speaker, this Government is firm in its resolve to uphold the safety and security of all the citizens of this country. All Government agencies responsible for security and intelligence as well as my Ministry have maintained a consistent policy of combating terrorism for decades. The listing of the LTTE by the European Union was originally done in 2006, during the time I was the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Subsequently, as you know, the listing was suspended in October 2014.

The Report of the US State Department identifies Sri Lanka and India as the area of operation of the LTTE. As you are aware, the LTTE remains banned in both countries.

Since the 8th of January, those who had given up faith have now once again begun to bear renewed hope of true reconciliation, durable peace and dignity and prosperity for all. People of Sri Lankan origin who had fled this land and had ceased to dream of a united, reconciled Sri Lanka are now unafraid to dream once more of a land of peace, harmony, success and unity. Those who were once reluctant to pledge their commitment to a united Sri Lanka are now reconsidering their stances. As I mentioned to you last week, again in making a similar Statement, even some of the so-called "diaspora groups" representing the Tamil diaspora are now getting ready to make a public declaration in support of a united, undivided Sri Lanka.

We owe it to our nation to keep distinct those who espouse a violent, separatist agenda from those who express concern about the welfare of the Tamil people. We must not confuse those who raise funds through illegal activities to promote their violent agendas with those who voice concern about the displaced or the detained. This distinction is important if our country is to turn its back on its violent past for good. , . . . , , . .

Engagement and dialogue are essential to ensure that those who hold dissenting views are heard and those who suffer grievances may resolve them without having to resort to violence.

As His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena said on the 19th of May this year, Sir, at the conclusion of the armed conflict in May, 2009, we failed to mend hearts and minds of the people of our country. This nations twin agenda, henceforth, should be reconciliation and development. Our mission should be not only to mend hearts and minds of our citizens, but also to unite them in the spirit of an undivided Sri Lanka.

Sir, the moderate voices of Tamil politics and the genuine representatives of the Tamil people, the TNA, are now strong advocates for a united, undivided Sri Lanka. These are the individuals we should encourage to participate more fully within our democratic institutions and with whom we must work closely to eradicate the radical elements within our society. Just as the JVP was brought into mainstream politics, we must now empower the Tamil people to express their grievances through their elected representatives, through credible State mechanisms and non-violent advocacy.

New forms of terrorism that may emerge if we isolate and radicalize aggrieved communities in our country will be difficult to predict and maybe hard to control. They would be difficult targets for any military, especially if they are small or geographically dispersed. We cannot afford to risk the security and stability of our country again on poorly planned or non-inclusive strategies and on failures in diplomacy. Now is the time to address the root causes of violence, use global law enforcement cooperation, improve domestic criminal justice systems and to increase outreach to affected communities. These will be the tools with which we permanently steal away the hearts and minds, the very oxygen, from terrorist organizations.

Therefore, in conclusion, Sir, I urge the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and all those in the Opposition to join us in this journey of confidence-building, reconciliation and development. Join us to address the real grievances and concerns of people of all communities, especially the minority communities in the North and the East. This is the surest way to ensure that terrorism will not raise its ugly head in this country ever again.

There is a system about compensation in this Mixed-Member Proportional Representation system. As everybody knows, the compensation works this way: The parties that have got more than their share in the Proportional Representation System do not lose out when seats are allocated on the district basis. But, if any party has not got a single constituency, has not won but at the proportional level if they have won a seat, they will be allocated a seat from the PR system. But, then, that compensation system is also not working in the manner where such Mixed-Member Proportional Representation is operational in other countries. Take, for instance, Taiwan, New Zealand and Germany. In all these countries, there is a provision for the use of the double ballot system. That is, to enable justice for smaller parties and smaller ideological groups to be able to get in.

You cannot satisfy the minority parties by 145 Members only being elected through the First-Past-the-Post System. Therefore, there is an obligation on all of us to act with responsibility as the people of this country have demanded a change in the electoral system. His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena went before the people. I am happy to say that I am one of the Members who supported His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena in his election campaign. All of us

215 216

today have a great responsibility. Today, we have a President who appointed the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister. Nowhere in the world is there a situation like that. So, His Excellency has the power and the will to get the support of all the Members. If we do not pass the Twentieth Amendment in this Parliament, it will never happen.

Therefore, I beg of you, all Members of Parliament, to have a great responsibility towards the people. We should not think as, Our Party; What is our share?; Will our share increase?; Will our share reduce?; or If we go for an election now, will it be beneficial to us?, so on and so forth.

In President Maithripala Sirisenas Election Manifesto, he has stated two matters. One is the abolition or curtailing of the powers of the Executive President. He also promised that the electoral system would change. He said that there will be a committee appointed. If one is to construe the Election Manifesto to the fact that only a committee would be appointed and that we will not change the electoral system, we are doing injustice to the masses.

Today, on television when you see the masses being questioned on the Twentieth Amendment, what do they tell us? They say that the Twentieth Amendment is more important than the Nineteenth Amendment because under the present electoral system, we see drug dealers and thugs coming into Parliament. However, we do not have a Member of Parliament who is responsible to the electorate. There is a greater need for that. Also, the Twentieth Amendment has the female representation increased to 10 per cent, a mandatory requirement. Then, to satisfy the smaller parties, the district cut-off point has been brought down to 3 per cent. So, justice has been done to a great extent.

The Hon. DEW Gunasekara stated, I do not understand what the Twentieth Amendment states". I also have difficulty in understanding some of the clauses of the Twentieth Amendment. But, we should use the Twentieth Amendment to make whatever changes and be progressive. How can you have an Adjournment Motion dealing with a Bill which has been approved by the Cabinet and which is to be placed on the Order Paper?

So, all of us should act with responsibility. I am sure we should all support His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena. I humbly beg of the United National Party, "Do not try to block this; support this as the people of the country require this". We can go for an election, but before we go for an election, we should act with responsibility to the masses; we cannot shun that responsibility. Today, if we do not act with responsibility, we will never achieve it. Everyone one of us in this House state one and the same thing, and that is, We have to change the electoral system. But, nobody says how it should be and what it should be. But, I believe that if we

work together like how we did in passing the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, we can pass this.

There were parties who said that the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution will never be passed but His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena took the sole initiative to get the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution passed and it was passed with 212 votes. I am sure that if we all act with the same responsibility, we can get this passed. But, here most parties are wondering, Will we lose our share?, but that is not how we should look at it. We should look at it the way the masses want. I being a minority, I also would state that the minority representation should be looked after, and also the JVP representation should not be curtailed as they have been a very progressive party.

So, I am very thankful for having been given this opportunity to speak a few words and once again I appeal to all Members of Parliament on the need to change the electoral system and this is the only chance that we can do so. We have a President who appointed the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister. So, he can get the support of the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister. So, let us all work together; let us use the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution as the starting point. We can address all issues, all grievances at the Committee Stage.

His Excellency the President at the Group Meeting of the UPFA yesterday stated, I will summon all the smaller parties and address their issues. I will tell you with confidence that His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena will never permit any electoral system to be passed, without looking at the interests of the minorities, or curtails the representation of progressive parties like the JVP. I, for one, believe that the JVP should be in Parliament and their representation at no stage should be curtailed.

So, once again I appeal to fellow Members of Parliament, let us work together and amend the electoral system in this Parliament as we will not have a majority to do such a change in the next Parliament. Therefore, all of us should get together and strengthen the hands of His Excellency the President and see that he keeps his pledge by amending the electoral system.

Thank you [.. 1.22] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Shantha Bandara - Deputy Minister of Mass Media) ,

Finally, Sir, I want to raise a more fundamental issue. What has been given to us is a document called the "Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution". But today, there has been another document tabled in this House called the "Twenty Fifth Amendment to the Constitution", which has been published in the Gazette on 22nd May, 2015, whereas the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution has been published on the 12th of June. I do not know how this came to be. How is that the Twentieth Amendment is published after the Twenty Fifth Amendment? We already have another Twentieth Amendment that has been tabled before this House. So, we have up to 25 amendments to the Constitution. After the Nineteenth Amendment, I believe all six are Private Members Motions, which have been placed by the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha. Perhaps, due to that fact, those maybe inconsequential and will all disappear very soon. But, nevertheless, officially, we have had the Twenty Fifth Amendment to the Constitution gazetted first and what had been gazetted after that is termed the "Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution". This is a serious flaw. That also shows that what is termed the "Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution" will never be the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution and that it ought not to have been published in the Gazette.

This does not reflect the discussions we have had in preparation for an electoral reform. We have been shown projections as to how different parties will not suffer in a new system. But, that is not quite correct. They were alikened to different systems and trying to show that all the parties in Parliament will not suffer any losses and will continue. That is not our concern; it is not the concern of any right-thinking person - that the representation the different parties have had over the years must continue in that same way. People have a right to change; people have a right to change their thinking. What we are most concerned about is that when a new system is introduced, that new system must be more democratic than the system that is in extant and to that extent, what we are discussing today does not cross that threshold and it fails miserably.

Therefore, let me conclude, Sir, by urging the Government and everybody else not to indulge in an exercise of urgent gerrymandering with electoral processes like this, particularly when one is staring at a general election, but await a new Parliament. At the beginning of the new Parliament, have a proper discussion and consult the people as well because any delimitation exercise must necessarily have the consultation of the people at the ground level. It cannot be done through Google maps. It must take into

267 268

consideration the different views that people will come and tell the National Delimitation Commission. Therefore, this hurried exercise of changing an electoral system is totally unwarranted and we urge that this be abandoned and undertaken, if at all, in the new Parliament.

Thank you very much. [.. 4.13] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Eric Prasanna Weerawardhana - Deputy Minister of Ports and Shipping) , . . " - " . " " , . 120 ; .
