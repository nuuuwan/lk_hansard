The violations by both sides were clearly and specifically recorded in that Report. The Sri Lankan Government rejected that Report and referred to that in the most derogatory terms. Even when the United Nations Human Rights Council Resolutions were adopted in 2012 and 2013, there was ample opportunity for the Sri Lankan Government to address the issue of accountability through a domestic process, which Sri Lanka arrogantly and recklessly refused to do. Sri Lanka unreservedly rejected those Resolutions that were adopted by the UN Human Rights Council in 2012 and 2013, though those Resolutions were carried convincingly at the Human Rights Council Sessions in 2012 and 2013 respectively.",

This uniform conduct at both the domestic and the international levels was driven by shallow thinking to serve a very narrow and self-serving political agenda, which was to retain political power in the country at any cost, even by crudely inciting feelings of chauvinistic nationalism and pseudo-patriotism on the continued imaginary footing of a threat to the countrys sovereignty and territorial integrity.",

Anura Dissanayake, the leader of the JVP, to international involvement in the issues in Sri Lanka. He made an appeal to the TNA in particular, that we should not rush to India; we should not rush to the international community and solicit their support because this is essentially a Sri Lankan problem and the resolution to this problem must be addressed locally. I cannot agree with him any more. But I must also remind him that the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact was not signed in New Delhi; the Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact was not signed in Washington and all other steps taken towards resolving the conflict in Sri Lanka amicably and peacefully were not taken in some European country. Those were all taken in Sri Lanka. What happened was whenever the Tamils agitated and performed \"satyagraha\", which means that \"satyam\", truth; you demand the truth and \"graha\" means that you bring upon the people concerned the necessary force to bring about that truth. How do we do that? It is through \"ahimsa\", through peaceful means and through non-violence. We performed sathyagraha in 1961. We prevented government officers functioning in our districts. As a young lawyer, I was also held in custody with my leaders in Panagoda. We know what happened. So, we did not rush to India; we did not rush to Washington; we did not rush to Europe. We wanted the issue to be solved in Sri Lanka. But, instead of solving the issue, we were subjected to violence, and that was the reason for the birth of the LTTE. The reason for the birth of the LTTE was that the issue was not solved amicably and peacefully in Sri Lanka and whenever the Tamils protested or agitated they were subjected to violence. That was the reason for the birth of the LTTE.",

Tamil Eelam and the emergence of the LTTE were consequent to the failure on the part of the people in this country to address the Tamil question in a reasonable way and find a reasonable, workable and a durable political solution. Even today, what we want is a solution within the framework of a united, undivided Sri Lanka that will enable us to live as equal citizens in this country and exercise real powers of governance without in any way adversely impacting on the unity or the integrity of this country in the areas in which we have lived for generations and centuries.",

We are confident and happy with the meeting that took place in the Presidential Secretariat yesterday where the President has summoned all the political parties to discuss this Resolution and we could see sobriety and a desire on the part of many who attended the meeting to achieve that goal of ensuring that the truth is established, the justice is restored, that there is reparation provided to the people and that there will be no recurrence of whatever happened in the past which should necessarily entail that there is an honourable political solution that can bring this conflict to an end.",

If all the time we are going to cover up the truth and prevent any process to take place to ultimately find out what really happened during those difficult periods - all of us went through these difficulties - my community is not an exception. Sometimes when you talk of the Sri Lankan ethnic conflict, it has become a usual norm only to talk of this conflict as a Sinhala-Tamil conflict. It is far from that. It is also a conflict relating to Tamil-speaking Muslim community. It is also a conflict affecting the upcountry Tamil community. It has visited every home in this country. Every community has lost lives; lost their properties; lost their livelihoods and therefore it is necessary for us to address the issues that need to be addressed at this particular time. That is why the international community has seen to it that they will have to get us to be accountable for what we did. So, accountability does not mean that we are going to immediately punish people. The Hon. Prime Minister has made an intervention. Through his efforts, he has ultimately managed to agree to set up a Compassionate Council. Over and above the Truth Commission we are",

By the 30th October, in another weeks time, they would have been living in temporary camps for 25 years or more. Their resettlement is yet to take place. Only a fraction of those people who left the North has been able to return. There are more than 10,000 families still awaiting some assistance to return with dignity. If you want to return without dignity, there are so many ways. There is no proper shelter, there is no proper infrastructure. So how are they to return to those areas? Finally we find that they are also now being deprived of their rights to vote - to elect their own people in the forthcoming Local Government Elections. In fact, I have proposed to the Hon. Prime Minister that we must try and amend the law to make way for these people, who live as displaced people still in the North Western Province, particularly in the Puttalam District, to be able to vote to elect their local representatives as they have done in the past for Parliamentary Elections.",

Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation) Mr. Presiding Member, Sri Lanka is a country with more than 2,500 years of civilization. Our rich civilization demands that we should be in the forefront of the campaign to promote human rights and indeed we have been and we will be. Different people and cultures may interpret human rights differently, but we agree that every human being is born free and enjoys the right to life, right to own property, the freedom of worship, the freedom of expression and assembly. No one has the right to violate the dignity of another human being. Everyone should be free from fear and free from hunger. Sir, Sri Lanka has gone beyond these basic values and our judicial interpretations of Fundamental Rights have given rise to a wide range of human rights. Our achievements in the fields of political, economic and social rights have made us a shining example among civilized nations.",

The Paranagama Commission probe had obtained assistance from foreign judicial experts. The Udalagama Commission saw an International Independent Group of Eminent Persons monitoring its activities during its early days.

    "text": "There are problems. I can remember, 20 years ago about 100,000 people were chased away from Jaffna and they came to Puttalam and we supported them. There were a lot of difficulties. I can still remember one incident. A young husband and wife were travelling in different lorries and they had an infant. When they landed in Puttalam, I can still remember that the husband asked whether the child was with the mother and the mother said, No. This was the situation. Sir, they faced so many difficulties. Out of that 100,000 people about 70,000 to 80,000 have gone back. But still there are about 20,000 people living in camps in Puttalam. I mention this because that problem still exists. They went back to Mannar after 20 years. Some children were born in Puttalam. When they went there, I can remember certain people saying that they were cutting down trees and so on. No, it was not so. Actually they went back to their own lands after 20 years and the area has become a big jungle. These are the problems that we are facing.",

We always forget that we are Sri Lankans. We are Sri Lankans. We maybe Muslims, Tamils, Sinhalese or whatever. But when it comes to the question of country, I think we must be united.
