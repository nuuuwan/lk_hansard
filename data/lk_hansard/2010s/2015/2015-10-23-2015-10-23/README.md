Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we are discussing through this Adjournment Motion the Resolution adopted at the 30th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council on Promoting Reconciliation, Accountability and Human Rights in Sri Lanka. This is the fourth Resolution relating to Sri Lanka adopted by the UN Human Rights Council in consecutive years; the others being in 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively.

It could be said that we brought this situation upon ourselves. As a sovereign country and as a long-standing Member of the United Nations, which commanded the friendship and respect of fellow member States, we had every opportunity to steer more favourably the course of events on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka, if that was in deed what we truly desired, while, at the same time, also recognizing our responsibility as a Member of the United Nations and our commitment as such Member to that august body. Sri Lanka is a party to and has subscribed to several covenants adopted by the United Nations, pertaining to human rights, which Sri Lanka is bound to accept and comply with.

When the Secretary-General of the United Nations visited Sri Lanka in May, 2009, almost immediately after the war came to an end, there was a Joint Communiqu issued by the President of Sri Lanka and the Secretary-General, where Sri Lanka agreed to address the question of accountability relating to the manner in which the war was prosecuted during, particularly, its final stages. This was a commitment which the Sri Lankan Government failed to honour.

It was in these circumstances that the Secretary-General of the UN appointed a Committee of three experts, headed by Mr. Darusman of Indonesia, to advise him on the question of accountability in Sri Lanka. It was that Report of the Darusman Committee which initially brought into the public domain the violations of international human rights laws and international humanitarian laws by both sides to the conflict. The violations by both sides were clearly and specifically recorded in that Report. The Sri Lankan Government rejected that Report and referred to that in the most derogatory terms. Even when the United Nations Human Rights Council Resolutions were adopted in 2012 and 2013, there was ample opportunity for the Sri Lankan Government to address the issue of accountability through a domestic process, which Sri Lanka arrogantly and recklessly refused to do. Sri Lanka unreservedly rejected those Resolutions that were adopted by the UN Human Rights Council in 2012 and 2013, though those Resolutions were carried convincingly at the Human Rights Council Sessions in 2012 and 2013 respectively.

1161 1162

The Sri Lankan Government, which was drunk with power at the domestic level, where authoritarianism was on public display; where the rule of law had deteriorated to such a degree that impunity was rampant and where all institutions, whose independence was crucial and essential for good governance, were treated with utter contempt and became subordinate to the rulers, seemed also to have mistakenly believed that even internationally its conduct could be as arrogant and reckless. This uniform conduct at both the domestic and the international levels was driven by shallow thinking to serve a very narrow and self-serving political agenda, which was to retain political power in the country at any cost, even by crudely inciting feelings of chauvinistic nationalism and pseudo-patriotism on the continued imaginary footing of a threat to the countrys sovereignty and territorial integrity.

The United Nations and every member of the international community, big or small, and even political forces within this country, ever since the concept of sharing powers of governance meaningfully began to be addressed more than 25 years ago, have unequivocally subscribed to the unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Sri Lanka and all democratic verdicts in the country in the same period have once again clearly established that reality. The verdicts of all the people in the country at the Presidential Elections in January - 2015, despite the constitutional and electoral manipulations and despite the full deployment of the resources of the State to the advantage of the incumbent - and at the Parliamentary Elections in August, 2015 have clearly demonstrated that the people of this country are not prepared to continue to be victims of such selfish, self-centred maneuvering and scheming and that in their view, Sri Lanka must march unitedly to a prosperous and better future based upon the universal principles of justice and equality, truth, democracy and good governance.

We need to be conscious of the fact that there are forces in this country, who, in order to pursue their narrow political agenda of capturing political power, will continue to resort to this agenda of spreading ill will and discord amongst our people based on such imaginary fears and suspicions and this should not be allowed if we are to develop into a modern State, exploiting our full potential and enjoying a quality of life comparable with many other prosperous States the world over. This is something which everyone, who has the best interests of Sri Lanka at heart, should remember.

If I may revert to the UN Human Rights Council Resolution, Sir, it was the Resolution adopted in 2014 that mandated an investigation by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights with the assistance of three much-respected international experts. Even in 2014, there was every opportunity available to the Sri Lankan Government to commence a transparent, independent and

a credible domestic process to address the question of accountability in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka was adamant that it would not do the right thing.

A Resolution in 2014, mandating an investigation by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights became inevitable. The Sri Lankan Government rejected the Resolution adopted in 2014 and publicly declared that it would not assist the investigation. It went on to prevent the investigators from arriving in Sri Lanka to proceed with the investigation and thereby even impeded and obstructed the investigation. The people of this country need to ask themselves the question whether the Sri Lankan Government was not being palpably unreasonable and foolish in doing so and whether it was not the most short-sighted conduct on the part of the then Sri Lankan Government that has brought upon this country the present situation. The investigation was conducted by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and its Report was available to be tabled at the Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council in March, 2015.

There was a change in the office of the President in January, 2015 in Sri Lanka, followed by the assumption of office by the new Prime Minister and consequent to a more cooperative and rational approach adopted by the new Sri Lankan Government, the tabling of the Investigation Report was postponed to September, 2015. The General Elections in August, 2015 have confirmed the continuance in office of the same Prime Minister and also enabled the formation of a National Government incorporating the two main political parties in the country. The Investigation Report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has been presented at the 30th Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council, and a Resolution has been adopted on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka. This has been done on the basis of consensus and Sri Lanka has been a co-sponsor of the Resolution. All members of the UN Human Rights Council have agreed to and supported the Resolution. This is indeed a significant achievement which has the support of the entire international community. Sri Lanka was defeated in 2012, in 2013 and in 2014, when Resolutions were adopted at the UN Human Rights Council. Sri Lanka has been able to win back the trust of the international community and redeem the country from the path of confrontation and conflict that was rather unwisely pursued by the former regime. This course of action, in my submission, is in the best interest of Sri Lanka and all its peoples.

Sri Lanka and its peoples should not be isolated from the international community. Our relationship should be built on mutual trust and confidence. Such trust and confidence also depend upon the countrys performance and the international communitys assessment of the countrys performance domestically. Very much more needs to be done in Sri Lanka. In many an area we have

1163 1164

not even started or merely started on what needs to be done. We have a long way to go before we can achieve real progress on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka. We need to however recognize and acknowledge the difference in attitude and approach between that of the former regime and the present regime. This has been the main reason for the High Commissioner for Human Rights agreeing to the tabling of the Investigation Report being deferred until the 30th Session in September, 2015 and the Resolution adopted by the UN Human Rights Council not being as strident or stringent as it could have been otherwise. This only enhances the need for the current Sri Lankan Government to discharge its duties and responsibilities with commitment expeditiously and effectively so as to provide the necessary relief to the long-suffering civilian population in the North and East. Very much needs to be done and I am sure, the Government is aware of that, and the Government must address this issue as expeditiously as it can.

The way to start could be by honestly and fully implementing the Resolution adopted by the UN Human Rights Council. Having co-sponsored the Resolution and the Resolution having been adopted on the basis of consensus amongst all members of the UN Human Rights Council, it would be in Sri Lankas interest to ensure that the Resolution is fully, honestly and effectively implemented. The Resolution has the preambular paragraphs and the operative paragraphs. We have all read the Resolution. It may not be necessary for me to analyze the various paragraphs in the Resolution. The Resolution is clear and, in my submission, well-balanced.

If I may comment briefly on the judicial mechanism, I would only state that if it was exclusively international, a section of the people in this country could be apprehensive, that it would be prejudicial to their interests or the interests of their kith and kin or people close to them and could therefore be opposed by that section of the people. If it was exclusively domestic, yet another section of the people could be apprehensive that it would be prejudicial to their interests and could therefore be opposed to it. In support of such apprehension on their part could be their past experiences. In both instances, it would be the perception of the people that would matter and not what the real position is.

In the circumstances, a via media would be the best course of action; would be the least controversial and perhaps inevitable. If we are to genuinely promote reconciliation and accountability, we would need to take along with us all our people on this journey. The Resolution addresses this question adequately. We need to ensure that the Resolution is strictly observed and implemented. What is important is that we do not promote hostility amongst our people. The effort must be aimed at bridging the existing gulf.

The whole purpose of this exercise is to address the issues that pertain to the civilian population. The civilian population, at all times, have certain definite rights that need to be safeguarded. No one is advocating any rights on behalf of the LTTE. In fact, very serious charges of grave violations are being levelled against the LTTE in the Investigation Report of the UN Human Rights Council. The law has to be maintained. The country knows what happened to tens of thousands of youth in the South during the JVP insurrections in the early 70's and the late 80's. Non-combatant civilians have a right to be protected; have a right not to be subjected to avoidable harm. If the war has been conducted not merely with the purpose of militarily defeating the LTTE, but also with the objective of subjugating a section of the population and thereby sustaining oneself in complete power, if need be militarily and if in that process there have been grave violations of international human rights laws and international humanitarian laws, that surely needs to be examined and addressed. No one is above the law. But all the evidence available would seem to suggest that some people concluded that they were above the law.

Why was the number of civilians in the conflict area estimated at only 70,000, when all reports indicated that the number of civilians in that area was well over 330,000? Eventually, almost 300,000 civilians came out of that area establishing that the figure of 70,000 was palpably false. Food, medicine and drinking water was sent only for 70,000 people. Why were the non-governmental organizations sent out of the conflict zone in September, 2008, particularly after such a gross underestimate of the total number of people in that area? Why was access made difficult for the UN agencies and for the ICRC? Why was the media restricted? Why was the media only permitted guided-tours in that area? Why was everyone, including Members of Parliament, prevented from having access to the people in that area? In fact, Sir, I sent the then President a letter signed by all the TNA Members of Parliament, everyone of us, and requested that we be permitted to go as a team to that area and see for ourselves what was happening during the final stage of the conflict? There was no response to that letter. Why was there such secrecy? What was sought to be hidden? There seems to have been a thinking that what was desired could be done however unlawful or illegal and that no answers needed be given for what was done. Such a situation is surely unacceptable and cannot be allowed in a country which respects the rule of law.

I do not wish to go into matters that could be the subject of investigation and trial through the judicial processes. All I would say is that this issue cannot become a political football to be kicked around as you please. If we make this issue a political football and kick it around as you please, I think, I would have to state that you will end up kicking the ball into your own goal. We need to seriously and calmly address the issue of what needs to be done. Truth, justice, reparation, and non-

1165 1166

recurrence are the crucial words. The Resolution is comprehensive. I have not the slightest doubt that most Hon. Members of this House want the Resolution to be implemented and the right thing to be done. I would like unanimity on this issue. What we need to do is what would be in the best interest of the country. The victims must not be looked upon as enemies. They are a part of the population of this country. They are entitled to justice on the basis of truth; they are entitled to reparation; they are entitled to guarantees of non-recurrence; they are entitled to a future that ensures their self-respect, their dignity and their equality. The achievement of such a goal is well within our reach and let me, Sir, request all my Colleagues in this House to work towards the achievement of this end.

Before I conclude, Sir, there are two matters that I would like to refer to, which cropped up in the course of the Debate in the morning. There was a reference by my Friend, the Hon. Anura Dissanayake, the leader of the JVP, to international involvement in the issues in Sri Lanka. He made an appeal to the TNA in particular, that we should not rush to India; we should not rush to the international community and solicit their support because this is essentially a Sri Lankan problem and the resolution to this problem must be addressed locally. I cannot agree with him any more. But I must also remind him that the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact was not signed in New Delhi; the Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact was not signed in Washington and all other steps taken towards resolving the conflict in Sri Lanka amicably and peacefully were not taken in some European country. Those were all taken in Sri Lanka. What happened was whenever the Tamils agitated and performed "satyagraha", which means that "satyam", truth; you demand the truth and "graha" means that you bring upon the people concerned the necessary force to bring about that truth. How do we do that? It is through "ahimsa", through peaceful means and through non-violence. We performed sathyagraha in 1961. We prevented government officers functioning in our districts. As a young lawyer, I was also held in custody with my leaders in Panagoda. We know what happened. So, we did not rush to India; we did not rush to Washington; we did not rush to Europe. We wanted the issue to be solved in Sri Lanka. But, instead of solving the issue, we were subjected to violence, and that was the reason for the birth of the LTTE. The reason for the birth of the LTTE was that the issue was not solved amicably and peacefully in Sri Lanka and whenever the Tamils protested or agitated they were subjected to violence. That was the reason for the birth of the LTTE.

In our election manifesto in 1970, the Federal Party very clearly stated that we should oppose separation and called upon our people to defeat any candidate who contested on a separatist ticket. People like the late Prof. Suntharalingam and Mr. Navaratnam from Kayts were

resoundingly defeated - forfeited their deposits - on the basis of the call by the Federal Party that we should not support separation and that we should defeat all persons who contested on that platform. So, even the LTTE, in a sense, was created by you - by the leaders in this country who did not address this question. Tamil Eelam and the emergence of the LTTE were consequent to the failure on the part of the people in this country to address the Tamil question in a reasonable way and find a reasonable, workable and a durable political solution. Even today, what we want is a solution within the framework of a united, undivided Sri Lanka that will enable us to live as equal citizens in this country and exercise real powers of governance without in any way adversely impacting on the unity or the integrity of this country in the areas in which we have lived for generations and centuries.

This, in my view, Sir, is a legitimate demand, which we have not conceded all this time. I think the Debate that has been taking place in this House, both yesterday and today, has reflected that a vast majority of the Members of this House have now themselves come to realize that this cannot be a story that will never end, that this matter has got to be brought to a close. We are confident and happy with the meeting that took place in the Presidential Secretariat yesterday where the President has summoned all the political parties to discuss this Resolution and we could see sobriety and a desire on the part of many who attended the meeting to achieve that goal of ensuring that the truth is established, the justice is restored, that there is reparation provided to the people and that there will be no recurrence of whatever happened in the past which should necessarily entail that there is an honourable political solution that can bring this conflict to an end.

I thank you. [.. 11.56]

Hon. Lady Member, I will give you a copy of this to read. Yasmin Sooka was funded to do this by an European fund. How can you say a UN officer is free and impartial? The TNA was involved in giving information and other necessary support for Sooka to come up with this Report. This Report came up in September. Why did the Government not challenge it? Okay. After the 8th of January, why did you not challenge this? You have put your own Government into trouble.

Their children were taken by the LTTE. You do not get

Our country chose a middle way of individual amnesty for truth. Some would say, what about justice? And we say retributive justice is not the only kind of justice.

In modern criminal justice systems, there are witness protection programmes, such as exclusion of public from trial and video testimony where witnesses can give evidence from different locations and they can be questioned while giving evidence from different locations, because sometimes with physical distance the witnesses feels secure.

Then there is also another method called "witness concealment". , screen . Anonymity of witnesses, witness . . , , . . .

The Court cannot assess the credibility fully, but on the other hand important evidence may be lost. Therefore, there is the need to balance the rights and interests of the accused and the endangered witnesses. Therefore, in developed criminal justice systems - I said, we are a party to the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime - these safeguards are limited only to serious crimes. The court or the investigating judge should be satisfied that the threat is real and substantial and should also be satisfied about the reliability of witnesses and the reasons for the witness's wish to be anonymous. Not every witness is allowed to give evidence in anonymity. Judges need to be trained to ensure that there is no adverse impact on the rights of the accused.

We must have a closure for all this misery that people have undergone. So, how do you bring a closure to the misery that people have undergone? It is only through a process where there will be some way in which the truth will surface. If all the time we are going to cover up the truth and prevent any process to take place to ultimately find out what really happened during those difficult periods - all of us went through these difficulties - my community is not an exception. Sometimes when you talk of the Sri Lankan ethnic conflict, it has become a usual norm only to talk of this conflict as a Sinhala-Tamil conflict. It is far from that. It is also a conflict relating to Tamil-speaking Muslim community. It is also a conflict affecting the upcountry Tamil community. It has visited every home in this country. Every community has lost lives; lost their properties; lost their livelihoods and therefore it is necessary for us to address the issues that need to be addressed at this particular time. That is why the international community has seen to it that they will have to get us to be accountable for what we did. So, accountability does not mean that we are going to immediately punish people. The Hon. Prime Minister has made an intervention. Through his efforts, he has ultimately managed to agree to set up a Compassionate Council. Over and above the Truth Commission we are

going to set up, the Compassionate Council which will consist of religious dignitaries and religious leaders who finally will have to give guidance as to how this entire process of reconciliation will take place.

Now, look at the plight of the Northern Muslims. There are more than 100,000 people who have been living in temporary refugee camps for more than 25 years. By the 30th October, in another weeks time, they would have been living in temporary camps for 25 years or more. Their resettlement is yet to take place. Only a fraction of those people who left the North has been able to return. There are more than 10,000 families still awaiting some assistance to return with dignity. If you want to return without dignity, there are so many ways. There is no proper shelter, there is no proper infrastructure. So how are they to return to those areas? Finally we find that they are also now being deprived of their rights to vote - to elect their own people in the forthcoming Local Government Elections. In fact, I have proposed to the Hon. Prime Minister that we must try and amend the law to make way for these people, who live as displaced people still in the North Western Province, particularly in the Puttalam District, to be able to vote to elect their local representatives as they have done in the past for Parliamentary Elections.

I was very pleased when the Hon. R. Sampanthan yesterday at the Presidential Secretariat referred to the Geneva Resolution as a very balanced Resolution. In fact, there are many among the diaspora Tamils who still decry the Joint Resolution that has been passed, because it is not up to their satisfaction. It is not a document which has gone to satisfy the extreme Tamil opinion, nor is it to satisfy the extreme Sinhala opinion, nor is it to satisfy the extreme Muslim opinion, if it existed. Therefore, this is a very balanced document which seeks very genuinely to introduce reconciliation in this country.

Therefore, Mr. Presiding Member, we should not look at demons behind the bushes. We have to first examine the document in its totality.

When you address the document in its totality it is quite apparent that what the international community wants is for the truth to surface and then through the surfacing of the truth, the people will be able to finally reconcile their differences and redeem their lost dignity and that is ultimately what is sought from this entire exercise. Therefore, let us not be talking as if we are like ostriches, burying our heads in the sand and not looking at reality.

We also heard the Hon. Anura Dissanayake in the morning very passionately making an appeal because he is somebody who suffered certain losses in his own family during those difficult periods in the late 1980s' and the early 1990s'. His own Party had to undergo a similar situation. There were scores of people who had been killed or summarily executed or disappeared without a

1225 1226

trace and there is no closure to all this agony and misery that people went through in the South. So, similarly in the North, there are our own brothers, our own citizens who have undergone immense difficulties. Be it Tamils, Muslims or Sinhalese, everyone equally has suffered and therefore to bring a closure to all this suffering, it is necessary for us to engage in an exercise not for any retributive justice but to restore their dignity and to be satisfied with the end result that we finally know the truth and that is exactly what is being sought to be done through this exercise.

We had the LLRC mechanism, the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, and that Commission was also an escape valve that was suggested by the international community for the Government to very truthfully address issues and to settle them. If we had followed the recommendations of our own Commission, the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, and implemented the recommendations very truthfully, we would not have been in this plight today. What we did was, every time when the time came for us to address those issues we started shifting the goalpost.

Rauff Hakeem) Yes, they said they were prepared to be introspective in their approach as to what happened in the past. So, that was the way in which the principal Tamil party in this House had approached this issue despite the fact that there is a large segment, quite a considerable segment of diaspora movements decrying this whole Resolution, because they expected a totally independent, international inquiry and they were disappointed. Everybody is disappointed: the diaspora is disappointed; the extremists in Sri Lanka are disappointed; Sinhala extremist forces are disappointed; everybody seems to be disappointed. Then, what does it point to? It seems it is a balanced

1229 1230

document. It has taken into consideration various views and has finally decided that this is the best way to proceed and this is the best way to bring a closure to the misery of these people.

This country has a potential to prosper. So, that potential to prosper must be given a chance to go ahead and let us become a nation of which we can all be proud of; a nation in which pluralism will be something regarding which all of us can be proud of. Today, some of us are not prepared to accept that this is a pluralist nation. We all say that this nation belongs to one race or one part of the country belongs to another race. That is not the way in which we have to approach this issue. Now the time has come for us to forget the past. But, the affected, the aggrieved, need to see a closure to their grievances. They need to know what happened. That is the meaning of accountability. Therefore, we have to become accountable in the eyes of the international community. We are a community of nations.

This kind of a thing happened in the aftermath of the World War II. Then everybody decided that they had to put an end to this inhuman way of killing each other and should prosper together. That is why the United Nations was created. So, the purpose of this Resolution is to allow us to prosper. Therefore, we must make use of this opportunity and prosper together.

Saying that, I conclude, Mr. Presiding Member. Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . 10 . [.. 3.44] ( ) (The Hon. Tharaka Balasuriya) , Resolution , .

, , . . , , . , , . . . [3.57 p.m.] ... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation) Mr. Presiding Member, Sri Lanka is a country with more than 2,500 years of civilization. Our rich civilization demands that we should be in the forefront of the campaign to promote human rights and indeed we have been and we will be. Different people and cultures may interpret human rights differently, but we agree that every human being is born free and enjoys the right to life, right to own property, the freedom of worship, the freedom of expression and assembly. No one has the right to violate the dignity of another human being. Everyone should be free from fear and free from hunger. Sir, Sri Lanka has gone beyond these basic values and our judicial interpretations of Fundamental Rights have given rise to a wide range of human rights. Our achievements in the fields of political, economic and social rights have made us a shining example among civilized nations.

However, it is very unfortunate that we now as a nation are at the receiving end of many a global human rights campaign. We want to remind the world that just as we long for the topmost place in global social indicators; just as we long for a place among the economically developed countries and just as we long for the champion trophy at every Cricket World Cup and gold medals at every Olympics, we long for recognition as a country that promote and uphold human rights. But we must be seen again as a country that has an unshakable determination to uphold human rights.

Sir, on this score, I must say that our Government is on the right path. We are not running away from allegations being thrown at us. If we are a people who cherish and value human rights, why should we run away from probes into human rights violations and war crimes? Countries that go to war do not fight clean wars. Clean

war is a myth. But, civilized nations, when complaints are made that the rules of engagement have been dishonored and that the laws of warfare, especially the international humanitarian laws have been violated, show no hesitation to probe into the allegations. The time has come to tell the world that we are a cultured nation with a proud history.

Our President has proved this point. By taking measures to wipe out the deficiency in democracy in Sri Lankas body politic, he has restored the international communitys confidence in Sri Lanka and its people. The President played a key role in the enactment of the Nineteenth Amendment, once again limiting a sitting Presidents Office to a maximum of two terms and also reducing his term of office from six years to five years. He has also said that he will not contest another Presidential Election. These measures have won international applause.

Yet, we have been accused of filibustering with regard to probes into war crimes. The long delay in launching a credible domestic inquiry has invited allegations that we are not serious about these complaints. Our civilization enriched by the noble teachings of Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and other religions and philosophies and the exemplary conduct of our ancient kings, demands that justice be done. We must not fight shy of calls for human rights probes. We must walk with our heads held high in the community of civilized nations.

Some Opposition politicians will decry the Governments decision to support the September 29, 2015 United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution that recommends, among other things, a credible domestic probe. These self-centred politicians project themselves as patriots. Far from it, they are a bunch of troublemakers who try to gain political mileage by misleading the people of Sri Lanka into believing that the Government by agreeing to the Resolution has sold the countrys sovereignty. Far from such political stunts, the Resolution reaffirms its commitment to Sri Lankas sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity. Under no circumstances, the Government of President Maithripala Sirisena and the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe will agree to a proposal that eats into our sovereignty.

Nowhere does the Resolution call for a hybrid probe. Neither has the concept of a hybrid court been couched in legal or technical language anywhere in the Resolution. The Resolution says that a credible justice process should include independent judicial and prosecutorial institutions, led by individuals known for their integrity and impartiality. The Resolution only affirms the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, including the Special Counsels Office, Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers and authorized prosecutors and investigators.

1235 1236

[ ]

2015 23

Please, note the use of the word affirms here. This gives more leverage to Sri Lanka to decide whether there should be foreign judges and if so, in what capacity. So, we see the Resolution as a victory for Sri Lanka. As the Prime Minister has pointed out and as the people of this country know, we have seen the participation of foreign judges and eminent persons in probes exclusively Sri Lankan. The Paranagama Commission probe had obtained assistance from foreign judicial experts. The Udalagama Commission saw an International Independent Group of Eminent Persons monitoring its activities during its early days. I admit that the participation of foreign judges in any domestic probe indicates the lack of confidence of the international community in our judiciary. This is a sad state of affairs brought about by our own doings.

Sir, we have embarked on a journey to make our country win a major battle at international level. We are not heaping insult on the armed forces who are our heroes. We respect them and we are grateful to them for bringing about an atmosphere where we are free to move about without entertaining fears about whether we would be the victims of the next bomb blast. As a direct victim who survived 3 bomb blasts - the last of which was a suicide blast at Akuressa - I have undergone the pain of terrorism and I feel how relieved and safe I am today because of the sacrifices of our security forces, our heroes.

Our armed forces are not culprits. Our security forces are not machete-wielding bigots. They are officers and gentlemen. They are committed to uphold human rights. They value justice. Theirs is a force that believes in discipline. They have no fear to face any probe, for I believe they have nothing to hide and nothing to worry about. Their conscience is clear. Yet they understand that the only way to get the country out of the tangle that it has got into is the domestic probe mechanism. They know that the countrys progress, development and reputation rely on our compliance with the UNHRC Resolution. The Government is not going to make them scapegoats. The Government will defend the security forces and uphold their dignity.

The domestic probe structure being worked out by the Government places its focus on truth and reconciliation; forgiveness and non-recurrence. Even those who oppose the Governments stance to gain political mileage know that this is the opportunity to re-launch Sri Lanka and rebuild its image. Let all of us do it together.

"The Secretary-General welcomed the assurance of the President of Sri Lanka contained in his statement in Parliament on 19 May 2009 that a national solution acceptable to all sections of people will be evolved. President Rajapaksa expressed his firm resolve to proceed with the implementation of the 13th Amendment, as well as to begin a broader dialogue with all parties, including the Tamil parties in the new circumstances, to further enhance this process and to bring about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka. "

It further states, I quote:

"Sri Lanka reiterated its strongest commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, in keeping with international human rights standards and Sri Lanka's international obligations. The Secretary-General underlined the importance of an accountability process for addressing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.

"Retired Justice Paranagama told Express on Wednesday, that there is as yet no domestic law to try war crimes of the kind which allegedly took place in the last phase of Eelam War IV. And as it stands, Lankan criminal law cannot be applied retrospectively unless specifically provided for."

It further states, I quote: " 'But there is provision in the constitution to bring about suitable legislation', Paranagama pointed out. 'And in our report, we have mooted the idea of setting up of a Special High Court to try war crimes', he said."

Further, Manouri Muttetuwegama's statement is also there in the news release about the Udalagama Report. It states, I quote:

" 'The investigations did not find any individual guilty', said panel member Manouri Muttetuwegama. 'The Attorney General's lawyers came out with so many different possibilities in every case, that it was not possible to come to definitive conclusions', she explained. According to the panel, police investigations 'lacked professionalism'. Panel member Javed Yusuf said they were 'shoddy'. "

Therefore, extrajudicial killings cannot happen in the future in this country and we must work in partnership with the United Nations or any other international bodies, of which we are members, to make sure that Sri Lanka is part of the civilized international community. , . ; that itself is a sign of maturity of a country, of a civilization. game .

Our Government is a democratic Government, an open Government and hopefully, a tolerant Government towards other communities. We must enforce the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and make sure that all communities, especially the Tamil community in this country, have equal rights and can actually live in prosperity and without fear. , , . We must think of future sustainability of this country. Henry Kissinger : There are no wars in the future between nations, but there are wars within nations. That is what has happened in this country. 1948 . . We hope we can do that in future. , , .

Therefore, we must make sure that the reconciliation process is really done in a meaningful way. What is a reconciliation process? Are we going to follow the South African model? Some people are saying that the South African model is very good. Are we going to follow the Irish model? Some people are saying that there are very good attributes of that. I say, we must follow a Sri Lankan model. Therefore, what is this Sri Lankan model? Let us start somewhere. Let us start and see. There are two

Commissions that have been established now. We can work with them. Let the truth come out, whatever happened, not only for the Tamil people but also for the Sinhala people. How many have been killed by the LTTE? How many have been killed? We know all that. Of course, the LTTE is no longer a violent, threatful organization. But we must make sure that our actions do not create a second LTTE. This is also very important. We must make sure that there are no terrorist activities in this country. How did terrorism come about? How was it sustained? Who sustained it? These are open questions that we must ask, because there is no room for Sinhala terrorism or Tamil terrorism or Muslim terrorism in this country. Therefore, what we do now is very important for the future. Our own Reports, our own Commissions are saying that human rights were violated, that there were arbitrary killings. There is no denial of that.

Some of our army officers have taken photographs from their mobile phones. They are selling those in the international markets. It is available. We have seen it. They are authentic. So, who gave the orders to kill? Do we not have a right to know? Was it done on the spontaneity of the war? We do not know. These are the things we have to find out. The reconciliation process can be very painful; it can be very bitter. But, we must go through that process together with Tamils, Sinhalese and Muslims, if we are going to live as brothers in this country.

Also the Government must be genuine in whatever devolution of power. If we agree to some devolution of power, I think the first thing is, to implement the Thirteenth Amendment - implement that fully. Then, we must stick to it and the Tamil political leaders must accept that genuinely. If we are not going to accept that genuinely, then there will be a problem in the future. After accepting the Thirteenth Amendment fully, you cannot later say, We want a Quasi-Federal State. That is not possible. I do not think that is genuine. But, we, the majority community in this country, must be genuine with our brethren - Tamils and Muslims. These are the genuine concerns that I have. If we are going to create a pluralistic, open, democratic and liberal society, surely there must be tolerance in all sides and there can be no violence. Surely we can discuss or we can disagree, but there cannot be violence. Violence is not acceptable to any community, any religion or to any race.

For the last two days we have been listening to the arguments for and against this Resolution. We forget that we belong to a small country. We are divided in so many ways, but we must not forget that we must unite for the sake of the country. These problems have been going on for years and years and when the Government is trying to take a decision to end this problem, we must all cooperate with the Government to solve this problem.

I think we have got the best chance today because the President and the Prime Minister along with the two major Parties have formed a National Government and

1263 1264

[ ]

2015 23

we have been working together. So, this is the best opportunity for us to solve this problem. If we do not solve this problem now, I do not think we will ever be able to solve this problem.

There are problems. I can remember, 20 years ago about 100,000 people were chased away from Jaffna and they came to Puttalam and we supported them. There were a lot of difficulties. I can still remember one incident. A young husband and wife were travelling in different lorries and they had an infant. When they landed in Puttalam, I can still remember that the husband asked whether the child was with the mother and the mother said, No. This was the situation. Sir, they faced so many difficulties. Out of that 100,000 people about 70,000 to 80,000 have gone back. But still there are about 20,000 people living in camps in Puttalam. I mention this because that problem still exists. They went back to Mannar after 20 years. Some children were born in Puttalam. When they went there, I can remember certain people saying that they were cutting down trees and so on. No, it was not so. Actually they went back to their own lands after 20 years and the area has become a big jungle. These are the problems that we are facing.

Now the Government is taking all steps to solve these problems, especially our Minister, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, has been trying for so long. When we are coming to some sort of a solution, it is our duty to get together without thinking of party politics. We must think of the country. Now, we are divided. We always forget that we are Sri Lankans. We are Sri Lankans. We maybe Muslims, Tamils, Sinhalese or whatever. But when it comes to the question of country, I think we must be united. I say that this is the best opportunity. Therefore, I request everybody, all the Members of Parliament, to get together for the sake of the country.

Thank you. [.. 5.33] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Foreign Affairs) , . , .

. . . .

In fact, Sir, because of the constraint of time I would like to outline the proposals put forward by the Government for a domestic mechanism. These are merely contours of the proposed mechanism. . The final architecture of the actual mechanism will be decided only at the end of the consultation process. . . consultation process , . . . . , . .

Our Government has committed itself to winning the peace and securing the country from political violence that has haunted it since Independence and it has dedicated itself to ensuring that the culture of impunity that has prevailed -whether for corruption, drug dealing or violations of human rights- is put to an end.

Sri Lankans, whether they be children in the North desperate to know if their fathers are alive or not; mothers of soldiers yearning to know the truth of what happened to their son who went "missing in action"; families of the 600 policemen who were killed in cold blood by the LTTE or the wives of slain journalists, have a right to know what happened and they also have a right to seek justice. Similarly, if such crimes occurred, society has a moral obligation to investigate and apply legal systems for justice and reparations. The State bears such a legal responsibility.

In fact, Sir, the Governments 100-Day Work Programme - the Election Manifesto - as point 93, states

that since Sri Lanka is not a signatory to the Rome Statute regarding international jurisdiction with regard to war crimes, ensuring justice with regard to such matters will be the business of national independent judicial mechanisms.

, , 100 93 ," " . .

Therefore, in order to break away from our turbulent post-Independence history, which has included two Sinhala youth insurgencies, multi-actor Tamil militancy and LTTE terrorism and to set the country on the path towards sustainable peace, security and prosperity, it is our duty by the people of this nation and our duty towards future generations to undertake a course correction to ensure non-recurrence of violence. These measures include the creation of a new Constitution to solve the national question and addressing of many of the root causes of the conflict that have plagued our land for many decades. Collectively, these measures will ensure that our society is never tormented by such violence ever again.

Therefore, both to prevent violence, abuse and impunity from ever occurring again and to ensure that the suffering of those who have lost loved ones is recognized, that crime is punished and that any injustice is remedied, the Government has resolved to adopt a four-pillared strategy. The four pillars are: truth, justice, reparations and non-recurrence. Under this strategy, the Government intends to create four separate institutions. . , - consultations , , - .

Number one is the Commission for Truth, Justice, Reconciliation and Non-recurrence. For many victims of human rights abuses from whichever community, where the perpetrators are unclear for a judicial mechanism to handle or where the practices of the State and society have resulted in discrimination, this Commission will allow to discover the truth, understand what happened and help remedy any sense of injustice. A special feature of this will also be a Compassionate Council consisting of senior religious dignitaries.

In fact, , .

Then, Number two is an Office of Missing Persons based on the principle of the families right to know to be set up by Statute with expertise from the ICRC.

1269 1270

. . .

, . . . A judicial mechanism with a Special Counsel is to be set up by Statute. This takes into account the right of victims to a fair remedy and aims to address the problems of impunity for human rights violations suffered by all communities and as I said earlier, whatever the architecture of the final mechanism we agree upon at the end of consultations will be, I can assure all the Hon. Members of this House that it will be a Sri Lankan mechanism, uniquely Sri Lankan, which will address the grievances of all those who suffered during the latter part of the war.

Then, Number four is an Office for Reparations to be set up by Statute to facilitate the implementation of recommendations relating to reparations made by the proposed Commission on Truth, Justice, Reconciliation and Non-recurrence, the Office of the Missing Persons, the LLRC and any other entity and these bodies will be created after wide-ranging and deep consultations with all the stakeholders involved including the victims, experts and political parties. In fact, we are starting consultations with the civil society next week. As I have already said, the President started consultations with the political parties through the All Party Conference yesterday and we will also be working out arrangements to get the views of the victims in those areas and even the security forces who may want to give us their ideas. The All Party Conference held yesterday and, chaired by President Maithripala Sirisena is the beginning of this process. We will also be having a workshop next week with civil society to consult on the consultation process.

Then, of course, many people asked, Mr. Presiding Member, why we need such a process and why has the Government decided to seek international participation. We have not ruled out international participation because we feel that wherever we do not have the expertise, and if it is going to be a credible mechanism, we will have to rely on expertise from other countries and it is not anything new to Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka has suffered a long-history of political violence. In fact, we have endured far too much violence for a country our size. We have experienced, as I said earlier, two youth insurgencies, militancy and terrorism and a war which lasted for 26 years. But following the defeat of groups engaging in violence, we have always tried to take wide-ranging, deep and perhaps even radical measures to address the root causes of violence and ensure long-term social stability.

The previous Government felt that monitoring by international experts would strengthen the independence and credibility of the Udalagama Commission. Therefore, it created the IIGEP - International Independent Group of Eminent Persons. The IIGEP made an internationally monitored investigation into charges that the LTTE and the security forces had committed violations of human rights. Experts to the IIGEP were nominated by Australia, Britain, Canada, the EU, Japan, the Netherlands and the US.

If one looks at the Report prepared by the Commission the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed, the Paranagama Commission, he would see extensive international participation from across the world.

"" , .

Furthermore, as this House is aware, Sri Lankan judges and investigators, including those from the Attorney-Generals Department and the police, have performed and continue to regularly perform judicial and investigative responsibilities overseas. In fact, six of the eight judges of Fijis Supreme Court are Sri Lankans; . . Sri Lankan judges have also served on the benches of other Commonwealth countries. They have served in international courts that deal with issues of war crimes. For example, Justice Christopher Weeramantry was the Vice-President of the International Court of Justice and Justice Asoka de Silva served in the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. Justice Raja Fernando sat in the Special Court for Sierra Leone and Justice Nihal Jayasinghe served in the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. , , .

As I said, especially because the credibility of our Judiciary is at an all-time low, the Resolution gives the Government flexibility in deciding on the architecture of the domestic mechanism. The Resolution, at operative paragraph 6, states, I quote:

1273 1274

......and also affirms in this regard the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, including the special counsels office, of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers and authorized prosecutors and investigators;

Therefore, Sir, the architecture of this mechanism will be in Sri Lankas hands and Sri Lankas hands alone.

However, the Report of the Paranagama Commission, a Commission appointed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, prescribes the Gambian formula, where all judges and prosecutors were foreigners.

. , . . '' '' , , . ? , . . .

I will quote from the Paranagama Report - , '' '' . Paragraph 616 :

.. it is the view of this Commission that a successful experiment in The Gambia in 1981, following an upheaval in which many died, may possibly be viewed with favour. In that instance a court which was part of the national legal system, known as the Special Division of the Supreme Court of Gambia, was set up taking on some judges from the Commonwealth.795 This was a court that met both national and international concerns.

So, this is what the Paranagama Report is recommending to Sri Lanka - to set up a special mechanism as they did in Gambia with foreign judges - whereas the Sri Lankan Resolution, which we fought for and won, gives us the total flexibility in deciding who and what should be.

, . Even in the best of armies in the world, you have some miscreants. So, it is only by punishing those who have done wrong that we can save the reputation of the armed forces. . . , , . , , .

.

In fact, - - there are many instances where we have dealt with the armed forces. As I said, in 1996, five soldiers and a policeman were convicted and sentenced by a trial-at-bar in Colombo for the Krishanthi Kumaraswamy murder. In 1999, a Brigadier, a Captain and six other security forces personnel were prosecuted for the abduction and murder of 30 school children in Embilipitiya in 1989. Two members of the armed forces were tried and convicted, as you know, in 1971, for murder of Premawathi Manamperi. And then, there are many other cases of prosecutions such as on the floating bodies of Bolgoda and Bindunuwewa incident.

As the Paranagama Commission points out at paragraph 76, The LLRC Report has already made it clear that it was incumbent on the Government of Sri Lanka to bring the individual perpetrators of war crimes to justice and that this would also avoid besmirching the reputation of the Sri Lankan Army as a whole. Indeed, contrary to international opinion, senior SLA officers concur with this approach. In responding to the question whether the Government of Sri Lanka should investigate the alleged execution of Balachandran, Prabhakarans youngest son, Major General Udaya Perera, former Chief of Staff, stated: More than the Government of Sri Lanka, it is we, the army, who should take responsibility, if that cowardly killing happened at the hands of our men.

In fact, yesterday, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka at the All-Party Conference said that as the former Army Commander he welcomes an international investigation. ( ) (An Hon. Member) He wanted international commanders to participate. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) He wanted international commanders to participate and he says that that is the only way we can save the good name of the Armed Forces.

. .

This is why Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka has supported the need for investigations. Being a military man he did not mince his words, plainly saying, "We have to clear our name. If there are allegations against military operations, I am ready to face anybody and present the right picture. There is no problem. In addition, he has expressed his support for foreign assistance in the process.

In fact, we owe it to the vast majority of soldiers, who, in the face of great adversity, stood by their principles and duty acting with decorum, professionalism and humanity. We owe it to them to clear their name. We will not let the mistakes of a few cloud them and their future prospects, including for international roles such as contributing to maintaining and upholding international peace through the United Nations.

In fact, Sri Lanka is not the only country in the world to initiate such action to save the good name of security forces personnel. It is the trial, conviction and imprisonment of the few services personnel who have committed crimes that help maintain the reputation of the armed forces as a whole. For example, the US trial and imprisonment of those responsible for the Abu Ghraib torture helped protect the name of the US security forces as a whole.

, . , '''' , . .

. . , . . . .

The people of Sri Lanka have the right to know of any violations of their rights or atrocities that have taken place. The Udalagama, Paranagama and OISL Reports identify many cases of LTTE atrocities, including the killing of civilians, holding the Tamil population hostage, torture, political assassinations, murder of surrendees, child recruitment, atrocities against the Muslim population.

There are many more. An international participation will help convey to the world atrocities committed by the

LTTE. Allow me, in fact, to quote from the OISL Report. At paragraph 49, the Report states, I quote:

The LTTE developed as a ruthless and formidable military organization, capable of holding large swathes of territory in the north and east, expelling Muslim and Sinhalese communities, and conducting assassinations and attacks on military and civilian targets in all parts of the island. One of the worst atrocities was the killing of several hundred police officers after they had surrendered to the LTTE in Batticaloa on 17 June 1990.

Again, there are many instances where they talk about the atrocities of the LTTE.

The other important area is the command responsibility. Because finally, Sir, I personally believe that many of these actions were carried out because of orders from above. Many of our army people, as I said earlier, are disciplined people. I do not think they are going to kill off surrendees with white flags on their own accord unless they had political direction. I am sure they would not have bothered to kill the young son of Prabhakaran unless they had orders from above and that is why this concept of command responsibility is very important.

In this process the focus must be on those who bear the greatest responsibility for any wrongs committed. This is in fact the recommendations of the Paranagama Commission and Udalagama Commission. This is not the OISL Report.

recommendations . , command responsibility .

The Paranagama Commission Report states at paragraph 613,

There can be no effective domestic mechanism for the purpose of investigating international crimes that apply in all conflicts, including non-international armed conflicts, unless the Government of Sri Lanka incorporates into Sri Lankan law the core crimes applicable in non-international armed conflicts, so that they could be relied on under statue law to investigate and prosecute. In particular, the doctrine of command responsibility, which is part of customary international law for all conflicts and thus applicable to the Sri Lankan conflict, should be incorporated into Sri Lankan law. This has occurred in many other countries through the adoption of specific legislation ..

. :

In inquiries of this nature of the question of command responsibility plays a significant role. The question of command responsibility which focus not

1277 1278

only on the responsibility of superior officers for issuing illegal orders which are carried out by subordinates but also refers to responsibility for omission to act.

In fact, when orders are issued from the political leadership, the armed forces are obliged to carry it through without questions asked and therefore this question of command responsibility is open. Would any member of the security forces have killed white flag surendees or Prabhakarans son without orders from the top? If so, those who gave orders need to be dealt with, just as much as those who may have committed these crimes.

So, Mr. Presiding Member, in conclusion I just want to say that Sri Lanka has yet another window of opportunity to come to terms with its past and to move on. Extremists in the North and in the South have been defeated in the recent elections. Today, two of the most liberal minded leaders since Independence are leading the country and the two main Parties, for the first time in history, have formed a National Unity Government and we have a Leader of the Opposition who is from one of the principal communities in this country and therefore I feel that this is a moment that Sri Lanka could hardly afford to miss and this is a window of opportunity which may not come our way again perhaps in our lifetime.

We must remember that if we are to move forward as a country, there is no way other than to come to terms with and deal with our past. The need of the hour, perhaps even the need since Independence, has been to defeat the forces of extremism who have, since Independence, attempted to make Sri Lanka a mirror which reflects their

fears and prejudices. The time has come for the moderates of our country to come together to build a new multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multilingual Sri Lanka where equality, justice and freedom prevails for each and every citizen.

Finally, let me also quote from the speech I made in Geneva on the 14 of September:

Let us design, define and create our future by our hopes and aspirations, and not be held back by the fears and prejudices of the past. Let us not be afraid to dream. Let us not be afraid to engage in meaningful dialogue aimed at finding solutions to problems as opposed to pointing fingers, heaping blame and scoring political points at the expense of future generations.

I would like to table* that document.
