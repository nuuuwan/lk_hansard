. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Speaker, may I, on behalf of the Tamil National Alliance, extend to you our warmest congratulations on your being elected to the exalted position of the Speaker of this august Assembly. You have thereby been elected as the guardian of the rights and privileges of the Hon. Members of this House and of the House itself.

With your rich political and administrative experience, there can be no doubt that you will discharge those functions in a manner acceptable to every Hon. Member of this House. You are assuming this high office at a very critical and a crucial juncture in the history of this country. The country had ended a long and cruel war, which should never have come about, if the cause of the conflict had been resolved between moderates much earlier. The result of the war was that the country suffered in several ways. The war became an excuse for many other wrongs to be committed in the name of the country.

The country wants to look at things afresh. That is the verdict of the people on 08th January and 17th August, 2015. The people of the country, particularly the people of the North and the East, have exercised their franchise with a sense of sobriety and righteousness.

This Parliament is going to have a crucial role to play. Amongst several issues that this Parliament must deal with is the framing of a new Constitution so as to restore democracy, pluralism, equality, equity and justice. This is fundamental. Sovereignty must be shared and exercised by all people in this country irrespective of any other consideration.

You will preside over all these deliberations and you have a crucial role to play. The dignity of this House needs to be restored. The dignity of Parliament was seriously eroded in the years gone by. The independence of several institutions, including the Judiciary, needs to be restored. This House has a crucial role to play in regard to all these matters and you, consequently, also have a crucial role to play.

I want to assure you, Hon. Speaker, of the fullest cooperation of the Tamil National Alliance in your tasks and we wish you the very best! Thank you.

[10.01 a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Speaker, may I take this opportunity to extend to you the wishes on behalf of my Party, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. On this occasion, I have no doubt whatsoever that your keen sense of impartiality would ensure that this House will have the leadership that is required to take this away from the unfortunate perception about the manner in which we conducted deliberations in the past. I am sure, our Prime Ministers objective of converting the Consultative Committees of Parliament into oversight bodies and through which to grant more powers to all Hon. Members on both sides of the divide is to exercise the bounden duty of being the watchdog of public finance of this nation.

Sir, it is also my fervent wish that you would be able, during your stewardship of this House, with the co-operation of both the Hon. Prime Minister and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, to do away with the culture, or rather the norm of observing the Standing Orders in its breach, or ensure that that would be done only in exceptional situations.

Therefore, it is my fervent hope, Hon. Speaker, at this important juncture in our nations history, now that you are in charge of this august Assembly through which all of us - Members belonging to different ethnic groups -

would be able to celebrate the diversity of this nation through the dignified manner in which we conduct ourselves during deliberations in this august Assembly.

Sir, it is once again my pleasure to wish you all the very best in your office which you have now been entrusted with.

Thank you very much.

ENGLISH TEXT OF THE ADDRESS TO PARLIAMENT BY HIS

EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT

Hon. Speaker, Hon. Members, it is a pleasure to convey the congratulations of the people of Sri Lanka to you, who spearhead the Representative Democracy of this country, elected at the most peaceful of all elections that was conducted in the history of our country and welcome you to the new Parliament.

I take this opportunity to thank the people of this country who have or have not voted for me at the Presidential Election held on 8th January 2015 in which I contested as the common candidate of the Opposition and won with the resilience acquired through the experience gained during my political career of nearly five decades, out of which representing Parliament for 26 years.

Hon. Members, this Statement of mine made before you in this manner reiterates yet another tradition of Parliamentary democracy. The purpose of the Statement made from the Chair which is termed, "Speech from the Throne" according to the British tradition and "State of the Union Address" in the American democratic system, is to outline the official statement of government policy to Parliament.

65 66

In my opinion, challenges as have never been faced by any legislatures in existence in the past, or representatives of any of them are brewing before you, who are peoples representatives legislating laws on behalf of the people. You are aware that already millions of Sri Lankans are using state-of-the-art devices capable of linking the whole world on to their palms. At the same time, the day on which our children will go to school carrying an i-pad, something which surpasses even laptops, in the same way as we went to school carrying a writing slate, may dawn even before the lapse of the term of this Parliament. I wish to alert you to the fact that it is in such a period of transformation that people have chosen you as legislators of this country. As such, we have before us the challenge of building the country in a futuristic way for the new era that is dawning and for the aspirations of the generation of that era while preserving our cultural value system, which binds us as the Sri Lankan nation.

First of all I must stress something which relates to the defence of our country. According to the Constitution of Sri Lanka, I bear the whole responsibility for the defence this country and its territorial integrity as the Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces and as the Minister of Defence. I assure you that I will fulfill this responsibility unstintingly and entreat you to extend your fullest assistance and commitment in that endeavour without treating its importance subordinate to any other matter.

I presume that this new Parliament marks an important turning point in the Sri Lankan political history. Since we gained Independence we had experiences only about coalition governments formed by one main party with the support of other small parties rallied around it. But many examples can be found throughout the world where main political parties renounce their political antagonism and form governments of consensus to overcome national crises. After the official abolition of apartheid in South Africa, the main political parties formed a government of consensus to eliminate ethnic segregation and to achieve a rapid development in the country. I firmly believe that the golden opportunity we could have formed such a consensual government was the first instance of the post-war period thereby to collectively face national and international challenges posed against Sri Lanka.

But due to the lack of experience on the part of the major political parties that governed this country during the war-torn environment that prevailed for a period of three decades, we failed to rule a peaceful country in a context of a democratic setup and were unable to establish a consensual political culture formed with the understanding between the two major political parties as against the antagonizing politics.

The main objective of the consensual government that is formed based on the concept of national government is

to build reconciliation among all the ethnic groups and achieve social and economic development simultaneously and achieve a high human development enabling us to face the new world that will dawn by 2020 and to face the national and international challenges in the similar manner.

When our country was entangled in a three decade long war, some Asian countries with histories similar to our country and some countries with weak socio- economic conditions compared to our country have achieved a rapid development during that period. Therefore we cannot ignore the fact that there is a huge gap in development between our country and those countries. I saw the necessity of forming a government of consensus with the support of the two major political parties as a basic strategy to minimize this development gap. I initiated the move to form a government of consensus as mentioned in my Presidential Election Manifesto -2015, Compassionate Government - a Stable Country with the intention to fulfill this need. This Parliament forms a government of consensus for a period of two years to fulfill that national need. I believe that it will be the beginning of a new developed political culture in this country.

In preparing the agenda of the government of consensus, my presidential Election Manifesto, titled "Compassionate Government - a Stable Country" approved by the people of this country, will provide the foundation. The election manifestos of major political parties representing Parliament - The Five Point Plan of the United National Front for Good Governance, A Certificate guaranteed for the Future of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance, The Accord of Conscience of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and the Manifesto of the Tamil National Alliance - are being studied in comparison to the policy framework based on the principles of good governance enshrined in my Election Manifesto A compassionate governance, a stable country, launched for the General Election of 17th August. Accordingly, I will make the necessary arrangements to formulate the policies of the new government of consensus by summarizing the policies conforming to the futuristic vision contained in my Election Manifesto A compassionate governance, a stable country.

Hon. Speaker, the identity of a nation or a country is based on its Constitution. That is why a Constitution is considered supreme. During the 60 years after Independence, we have adopted three Constitutions. Yet, it is unfortunate that we have not been able to adopt a Constitution which enables all of us to agree as a single nation. Since the promulgation of the 1978 Constitution, there have been many opinions and concerns expressed by various parties with regard to the Executive Presidency and the electoral system. I have paid special attention to this in my Manifesto A compassionate

67 68

[ ]

2015 1

governance, a stable country. Passing the Nineteenth Amendment to the 1978 Constitution is the fulfilment of one of the promises of my Manifesto. Now, it is up to this Parliament, in which you are seated, to decide whether we are to continue with the Executive Presidency and if so, what its nature should be. Another major election pledge given by me was to amend the Preferential Vote System which is an integral part of the Proportional Representation System, which has been cried foul of and desisted by the people of this country for nearly three decades. You are aware of the fact that the foundation for that has already been laid by the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution, which I proposed during the latter part of the last Parliament. This Parliament, in which you are seated, is also entrusted with the historic duty of formulating and passing the most suitable electoral system agreeable to all political parties as well as the civil society.

This Parliament in which you as Representatives of people are seated is also entrusted with the responsibility of taking the political decisions and effecting necessary reforms, which we have so far failed to take but should have taken if we are to rise as a proud Sri Lankan nation marching towards reconciliation, coexistence and development. You have become the stakeholders of the noble task of building the modern Sri Lanka replete with coexistence of all communities such as Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Burgher, Malay and Adivasis and harmony among all regions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity. I am dedicated as the President to provide leadership, guidance and assistance to all of you expeditiously towards this end. I reiterate that it will be the responsibility of this Parliament to elevate Sri Lanka as a lofty, exalted, democratic nation during this political journey.

Hon. Speaker, human resource is the most valuable resource of our country. I believe that the development of human resource in a unique manner is the foundation of the development process of our country. In the backdrop of the modern world achieving massive technological advancements, a country can move beyond the middle-income earning stage only by making trained labour freely available. Therefore, empowerment of Sri Lankan workforce or skills development is regarded as a key priority of my Government.

I would like to remind you that the 21st Century is the Century of Asia. It must be stated that we are fortunate to be naturally endowed with a geo-political location that enables us to derive maximum benefits in the context of Asia rising as the centre of global economy. One of the prime responsibilities of all of us is to design our future economic policies, plans and strategies to make maximum use of this worthy opportunity gifted to us by the nature.

There are many important areas neglected over a prolonged period in the process of formulating our

economic policies and a slew of problems associated with them. Informal economy based on self-employment and small-scale entrepreneurial industries are prominent amongst them. In consideration of the contribution made by the informal economy to our national economy, it is essential that we extend more State patronage and constructive help to this sector.

My Government will seek to give strength to the rural economy by giving a basic understanding of micro loans and financial management to small-scale entrepreneurs and the farmer community who do not have a fixed income.

One of the fundamental aspirations of the mandate given by the majority of the people endorsing the manifesto A Compassionate Governance with principles of good governance as the cornerstone is to eliminate corruption and protect State resources. Hence one of the main policies of my Government is the commitment for eradication of fraud, corruption and waste. I will not hesitate to further strengthen institutional mechanisms to fight corruption and take punitive action against those who are accused of misappropriating public funds irrespective of their status and without any bias towards them.

As you know, ours is a middle-income country. Our target should be to launch expeditiously and successfully, a basic economic strategy that helps to boost our income significantly during the term of this Parliament. However, we cannot call Sri Lanka a country that has achieved success in terms of economy, if the greater number of people in the country falls into the depth of poverty while only a few super-rich people enjoy the dividends of development. Therefore, while increasing the per capita income, we have to take action to expand the middle class of the country through minimizing the inequality in distribution of income.

Similarly, making development trickle down equally into all parts of our country is a responsibility of my Government. Especially, my Government has undertaken the responsibility of bringing equal progress to the entire country by bringing the dawn of development to the North and the East as well as the border villages that were direct victims of war and the very remote villages in the other parts of the country.

Many industrial countries in the world have achieved rapid economic development causing massive damage to the environment which could affect the entire human race. But those countries having identified the ill effects of their journey are now deviating from industrial economies and embracing concepts such as knowledge-based economy, innovation economy, green economy and sustainable economy. I wish to emphasize at this point that in the journey of Sri Lanka towards human development goals and socio-economic advancement, no

69 70

damage should be caused to the green environment, evergreen forest system or the wildlife that make ours one of the most beautiful countries in the world. I believe, to follow that path, we should adhere to the Buddhist economic fundamental which has been preached by Lord Buddha succinctly in "Santhushthi paramang dhanag".

The world is now realizing that sustainable development cannot be achieved by going against nature. Buddhist philosophy which has nurtured our country for 2,500 years, teaches us how we can achieve happiness and prosperity while being in harmony with nature by following the middle path. I consider the Buddhist economic vision held by our country is a great asset and an advantage in entering the modern age. Should we not endow this country upon our offspring, not as one consuming the highest amount of goods and services in the world, but as one inhabited by prosperous and content people who are able to achieve maximum contentment with minimum consumption?

Hon Speaker, we are living in a globalized new world trend. Every country in the world is important to us in that context. There is much we can learn from them and they can learn from us. Therefore, openness and goodwill will prevail as the basis of our foreign policy. I mentioned earlier too that we have reached the Century of Asia now. Accordingly, I wish to declare that from here onwards, my Government would concentrate more on following an Asia- focused foreign policy of the middle path.

I believe the word "Geneva" had been given greater space within our foreign policy throughout the past few years. From the moment that I was sworn in as the President on the 8th of January, the attitude of the international community towards us has been undergoing a change in a highly favourable manner. When we are faced with such a complex situation, consensus and co-operation are highly important. I have deep pleasure to state that within the past seven months my Government was able to change the situation which has prevailed up to now, in a manner which is beneficial to our country whilst improving the dignity and the good name of the country.

It is pathetic to note here that our country which was once called the Granary of the East has been tempted into importing even the food that could be produced in this country itself. It is not the agricultural policy of my country to go to the market to buy the things which could be produced in home gardens, to go to far away places to buy the things which could be grown in our own area and also to go to foreign countries to purchase the things which could be grown in our country. Instead I have already commenced to formulate a national food policy which is centred on home garden, village and the country. In fact, the main objective of the programme named, Api Wawamu-Rata Nagamu, which I launched when I held the portfolio of the Minister of Agriculture, was to promote local food production.

On this occasion, I recollect with great respect the agricultural vision of Rt. Hon. D.S. Senanayake, who took action to establish large scale farmer colonies having sighted six decades ago that agricultural development is an essential factor to provide a sustainable foundation for the future of the country.

It is a prime objective of my Government to fulfil the nutritional needs of people having produced healthy food locally by way of promoting the agricultural produce with main focus on paddy cultivation. Accordingly, my Government shall take action to fulfil the requirement of water for drinking and for agricultural purposes having constructed tanks such as Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga and also to introduce new technology into the fields of agriculture and livestock products. I have also taken action to launch a national programme to get rid of the menace of renal disease, which has affected the farming community who are the lifeline of our country.

Action will be taken to get rid of the protein deficiency prevailing in the country at present by promoting further the marine fisheries industry as well as the fresh water fisheries industry. We, as people who live in an Island State should strive without delay to reap the due benefits of the ocean which is a resource to us. Our oceanic area which is eight times bigger than the land area of Sri Lanka should not be restricted only for fisheries industry. Accordingly, my Government will take steps to obtain the contribution of oceanography for the development of our country in a more practical and broader manner than at present.

You are aware of the fact that a Government is not able to fulfil all the requirements of the people in the country in the context of the global trend. Hence the State sector, the private sector and the civil society have to be equally strengthened in order that the requirements of people could be fulfilled. It is essential to provide more privileges to the local industries when enhancing the private sector. Also, my Government will take action to provide necessary incentives and concessions to the private sector to attract local and foreign investments. In addition to that, my Government has paid its attention to the fact that the provision of privileges and concessions to the private sector employees.

Steps shall be taken to enhance the sectors such as free health service, free education and public transport which provide benefits to the whole population with a higher contribution of the Public Service in a qualitative and optimum manner. In this perspective my Government will place much emphasis on introducing the necessary reforms to enhance the quality and the efficiency of the Public Service. Accordingly, action will be taken by my Government to establish Consultative Committees in public institutions and to function them properly; to further minimize the salary anomalies in the Public Service; to introduce a merit-based recruitment and promotion system and to create a change in the perspective and attitudes of the public servants and the

71 72

[ ]

2015 1

public on the entire Public Service. In order to make all these a reality, arrangements will be made by my Government to establish national policies that do not change from one Minister to another, from one government to another, and from one President to another.

Further, especially, I would like to emphasize that I am committed to reinforcing national safety by further strengthening the facilities, privileges and welfare required by the officers serving in the three armed forces, Police and the Civil Defence Service who protected the motherland sacrificing their lives against the attempt to divide this country by the Eelam terrorism, which will enable them to render their services in a dignified and an efficient manner.

Although we have talked much about the youth and the young generation, it is evident through the youth rebellions which broke out in the country that as a nation we have done very little on their behalf. Our country has lost thousands of invaluable lives of youth owing to those rebellions. Only a few recommendations of the Commission on Youth Unrest of 1990 have been implemented even to date. My Government will take action to reconsider the recommendations of the said Report and make a programme which can be implemented in an opportune manner. In that, I emphasize the point that my Government will not make any kind of political interferences when providing employment opportunities or in other events where Government involvement is needed.

We need to pay more attention towards the groups of the society which are vulnerable to hazards very easily. Women, children, elders and the disabled play a major part here. Women who consist of more than half of the Sri Lankan population contribute massively to the national economy and the wellbeing of the society. All the development strategies of my Government pay a prioritized attention to the goodwill and wellbeing of these groups.

Children are the future of the country. I should state that the primary attention of my Government is focused on gifting them a better future and ensuring their safety.

There are many disabled people among us. Expeditious action will be taken to meet the responsibility of ensuring their safety without fail and to provide them the proposed monthly assistance without putting them into difficulty and in a manner that ensures their dignity by ever simplifying the stern regulations available at the moment.

Hon. Speaker, when looking at the unlimited opportunities available to a child born in this country as a Sri Lankan to win the world, his nationality, religion, domicile, descent, economic ability or any other aspect should no longer be an impediment to him. What is meant by me here is not the fact that the identity of a person should be weakened or dissolved. However, I must

regretfully mention the fact that remnants of certain conservative and backward beliefs that belong to the feudal era still plague our society, hindering our progress as a modern society. On many occasions, I have seen how some people are made to feel extremely uncomfortable when their surname is called out in public. It is my belief that making our fellow citizens use their surname in a manner that causes them embarrassment is a hindrance to creating a modern Sri Lankan identity. Therefore, if the surname is required in public places or documents, my Government will make arrangements for the owner of the surname to use it at his/ her discretion and allow people to use only the initials of their surname if they wish to do so. Thus, the right to use ones surname in public will not be infringed. Particularly, I consider this action as a step that will further the socio-democratic vision of the Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who lead the progressive social revolution in 1956.

When the world changes with time, new challenges are created, new social problems are created. We must prepare ourselves to respond to these new problems and challenges while safeguarding our value systems of civilization.

Sri Lanka has already become a country with excessive drug abuse. I must emphasize that none of our futuristic expectations will be fulfilled if we fail to protect our children from the drug menace. You know very well that drug abuse is not just a health problem and that it has become a social problem in our country. Already, a new islandwide drug prevention programme is being implemented under my guidance to minimize all types of drug abuse spanning from the use of tobacco and cigarettes.

Hon. Speaker, for some time, many intellectuals and experts have been denoting that it is necessary to create a new political culture in our country. I remind you that it is with the promise of dawning a new political culture that I came to power on the 08th of January. I wish to state that I am dedicated to creating a new political culture comprising of leaders who are disciplined, have decent images, possess great personalities and morals, which are qualities of ideal and exemplary politicians.

The foundation for creating a new political culture awaited by the general public of our country as well as local and foreign intellectuals and experts has now been laid. I respectfully invite local experts all over the country as well as the expatriates to contribute their knowledge and skills to build the country in this environment of consensus politics. Particularly, a special bureau will be established under my supervision to give a red-carpet welcome and coordinate the arrival of expatriate intellectuals who return to Sri Lanka in response to my invitation and serve their mother country. I would like to remind them the fact that time is ripe to work in unison towards the progress of the nation shedding political divisions.

73 74

Finally, I should lay emphasis on one fact. Since Independence, this country has been ruled by two political parties. One political party has ruled this country for 35 years. The other political party has ruled this country for 32 years. I make an appeal, with respect, in the name of progress of the country and the nation, to render your co- operation and commitment for the assiduous endeavour that I am engaged in, during my tenure, in the direction of building up a consensual political tradition, as opposed to rival politics putting blame on each other and referring to the deeds done in their own episodes of rule.

From now on, I make an appeal to all of you, with respect, to pay your attention, as to how the consensus-based co- operation of both the people's representatives and all the parties that represent Parliament founded on the collaboration of the two of major political parties could be utilized in favour of the progress and forward march of the nation in a way the proper political culture which is being developed is further established .

Thank you. May the Triple Gem Bless you!
