[1.33 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Speaker, we extend our warm and sincere congratulations and best wishes to His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena on his election as the President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. His election has resulted in other changes: the appointment of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe as the Prime Minister and the formation of a new Government. We also extend to the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the new Prime Minister, and his Government our warm and sincere congratulations and best wishes.

The Tamil National Alliance extended its unconditional support to His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena. We neither sought positions nor any other considerations in return for such support. We knew that efforts would be made to communalize the electoral process and gain electoral advantage by rousing communal feelings. We did not provide anyone with an opportunity to engage in such mischievous propaganda. It is a clear indication of the maturity of our electorate in the whole country that though some efforts were made in that direction, they were not successful.

This election, Mr. Speaker, was not fought on a level playing field. State resources were very extensively used from before the election and during the entire electoral process to support the campaign of the former President. It is to the credit of His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena that despite such extreme abuse of State power and resources, he was able to muster substantial support thoughtout the entire country and emerge victorious.

The Tamils and the Tamil-speaking people of the North and the East and in the whole country responded overwhelmingly to the decision of the Tamil National Alliance that they extend their wholehearted support to His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena, the joint Opposition candidate. We extend our very sincere gratitude to these people. Together with the people in the rest of the country, they have brought about a change in governance that would be greatly beneficial to the whole country in several areas outlined in President Maithripala Sirisenas 100- Day Work Programme.

The Tamil question needs to be addressed so as to evolve a permanent, reasonable, workable and durable political solution within the framework of a united and undivided Sri Lanka. It is the non-resolution of this question for over 60 years and its multifarious consequences that had been the cause of many ills the country has been afflicted with.

In the interests of the whole country, the Tamil question needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. We shall extend our fullest support to the achievement of this objective. We are confident that the vast majority of all Sri Lankan people will extend their support towards this effort.

Thank you. [.. 1.37]

, . Hon. Speaker, I would like to quote the press release issued by John Kerry, Secretary of State of the United States on the 8th of January, 2015.

It states: The Sri Lankan people deserve great credit on the successful conclusion of their elections. They turned out in great numbers to exercise their democratic rights and every vote was a victory for Sri Lanka.

Whether it is for the Government or for the Opposition, every vote was a victory for democratic rights in Sri Lanka.

It further states, I quote:

The United States applauds the Sri Lankan Elections

Commissioner, the security forces, Sri Lankan civil society, and the candidates themselves for making sure this election was not marred by unrest and for ensuring a significant drop in campaign-related violence. It will be important for that effort to continue in the coming days.

I commend President Rajapaksa for accepting the results of the

election in the proud tradition of peaceful and orderly transfers of power in Sri Lanka. His words tonight about accepting the verdict of the people and moving forward are important.

I look forward to working with President-elect Maithripala

Sirisena as his new government works to implement its campaign platform of a Sri Lanka that is peaceful, inclusive, democratic, and prosperous.

This is the message John Kerry, the United States' Secretary of State, issued soon after the election and it gives enough thought and enough advice to those who want to make unnecessary allegations about the democratic transfer of power by the ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa, accepting the verdict and going away. I know ex-President bid adieu to you, Hon. Prime Minister. I was there when you came to "Temple Trees". As a gentleman in politics and as a democrat, you came and discussed with him when he told you that he was ready to transfer power within a matter of minutes. These are facts which are stubborn. These may not be facts that you would like to hear. But, I am sorry to say that this is the stubborn truth that is being debarred from the media today. As you stated in your speech today, and as you have always stood when you were on this side of the House and when you were Leader of the Opposition, I appeal you to stand up for media freedom. I request the Hon. Prime Minister to give the media a free hand to report all what is going on in the country, not this one-sided mada pahara that is being orchestrated through the media today. We condemn that. That is not democracy. I am sorry I have to say that I condemn it because the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna always stood for the democratic freedom of media. We

have gone into political wilderness by going to protect the media freedom in the years that we have passed but we will stand for the important aspects of media freedom in a democracy.

. . Mr. Speaker, it will go into Erskine May as a new chapter on Parliamentary Affairs. I turned the pages of Erskine May to see whether there had been such a situation before. No, there had not been one before. So, Hon. Prime Minister, it is a big responsibility for you to overcome the uphill task of keeping this type of political marriage going, which had never taken place before. I do not want to comment on it more than that.

. . . , - , , . , .

I would like to quote, if you would give me a few minutes, Hon. Speaker, the online issue of "theguardian" of 10th January, 2013:

Private security companies guarding ships against Somali pirates are increasingly storing their weapons on so-called floating

armouries in international waters, to avoid arms smuggling laws when they dock in ports. About 20 ships stocked with assault rifles and other small arms as well as ammunition, body armour Then, it goes on to state:

..the Security Association for the Maritime Industry, said that "some armouries are effective and some are not".

The presence of armed guards on board ships has helped dramatically reduce hijacks by Somali pirates, .

Before floating armouries were introduced, security companies either went through the costly and complicated process of using a handful of officially approved onshore armouries or got round the problem altogether by buying guns illegally in Yemen and dumping them at sea when going in to dock at a port.

By using armouries private security companies are able to avoid the bureaucracy of local ports, save on port costs and not waste time deviating to ports to collect guards.

Avant Garde Maritime Services (AGMS), a Sri Lankan company that works in partnership with the countrys government, is one of the major operators of floating armouries. The companys chairman, Nissanka Senadhipathi, said there were thousands of weapons on his companys ships. AGMS charges US$25 a day to store the weapons and ammunition, with 800 to 1,000 movements on and off the armouries each month. I further quote:

Sri Lanka has established itself as a leader on the armouries, which are partly run by the countrys navy and have been approved by Security Association for the Maritime Industry. It is an international association. I again quote:

The armouries run by Djibouti and Sri Lanka are very professional'.

This has been recognized by the United Nations agencies too. But, what did you do? You slung mud without knowing the facts. You rushed and accused a company which is doing an operation not only for Sri Lanka, but for the entire Indian Ocean with the concurrence of the United Nations and international associations. Today, you have degraded our country. For what? I ask the Hon. Prime Minister.

. . , .

, . ? -2015.01.20- " " . I would like quote from its front page. It states:

"GR: 'Bank account allegation an attempt to discredit me' "

Who did this? Your Minister of Finance. ? ? ? . , , . , . .... .

, . . .

, Good Governance is a joke; that I have to tell you. I know His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena. We have been associating for over 30 years; we respect him. He is a man from the village; a son of the peasantry. If he does not take these matters seriously - what is happening around him - it will be too late and too sad for the President and the Prime Minister.

, a letter written by Gotabaya Rajapaksa to His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena regarding his bank account maintained at the Bank of Ceylon. It states, I quote:

It has been reported that I maintain a personal account with a balance of approximately Rs. 8 billion at the Taprobane Branch of the Bank of Ceylon. This is grossly misleading and appears to discredit my reputation.

As far as I know, an account of the Ministry of Defence is maintained at the said bank, which is used to finance the construction of the Defence Headquarters Complex at Akuregoda. This account was created with the approval of the Cabinet, from the revenue received from the disposal of land at Galle Face where the Army Headquarters was located.

Withdrawals were made from this account based on the progress of the construction work at the Defence Headquarters Complex for work undertaken by various contractors and suppliers. The account is operated by the Chief Accountant and other authorized signatories of the Ministry of Defence, It is not a private account.

".under the supervision of a committee of which I was the chairman in my official capacity - as the Secretary of Defence. Now, obviously, Mr. B.M.U.D. Basnayake holds this position. It further states, I quote:

"All cheques from this account are issued with two signatures upon the receipt of certified payment vouchers.

And, he goes on to state, I quote:

The names and signatures of the authorized persons are available with the Bank and the Chief Accountant of the Ministry. The

balance as at the last day of my holding office was certainly over Rs. 8 billion. The figures can be verified from the Treasury as the annual deposit balance is reported in Government accounts.

It comes before Parliament. There is nothing to hide. Why are you throwing mud at Gotabaya Rajapaska, who was the strength behind defeating terrorism in our country? If he has done wrong, go ahead; but if he has done not done wrong, apologize. Have the decency of a gentleman to apologize. You and I were in the same class in Royal College. Others who went to Royal College also should be able to behave as Royalists and say, I am sorry for the mistake done by making a wrong statement. People who now hold office cannot throw mud at every corner without any substance or verification. As an Hon. Minister, you must verify before making a statement. You are not on the pavement of a country to make a statement; you are holding a high office to make a statement. Finally, it states, I quote:

Therefore, there is no truth whatsoever in the claim that I have a personal account in the Bank of Ceylon with a balance of approximately Rs. 8 billion. I deny this completely and request the current Secretary to the Ministry of Defence to verify this matter with the Bank and the Treasury and to disclose the correct information regarding this account."

This letter has been signed by Gotabaya Rajapaska and it has been copied to you, Hon. Prime Minister, to the State Minister for Defence, the Hon. D.R. Wijayawardhana, and the Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Mr. B.M.U.D. Basnayake.

I am sorry that I had to bring this up today in this House, because it is an important day for you. But, it is also important that you are not misled; and also that you do not suppress the media in this manner and throw mud at people when they are not in office. There maybe wrongs done by people and they could be brought before the law. No one is going to say, No. None of us are going to say, No if there are some matters that should be brought before the law, but allow the media to report freely.

[3.01 p.m.]

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage) Mr. Speaker, Hon. Prime Minister, Hon. Leader of the Opposition and other Party Leaders, on this historic day when we are all united in pursuit of the lofty ideals such as good governance and a just society, I find myself at a loss for words to express the joy and relief with which the Sri Lankan citizens of all faiths greeted the election of His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena as our sixth President.

So, I shall borrow the words from Samuel Adams, a political philosopher and a principal architect of Republicanism as we know it today. He says, I quote:

It does not take a majority to prevail but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men. If men through fear, fraud, or mistake, should in terms renounce or give up any essential natural right, the eternal law of reason and the grand end of society would absolutely vacate such renunciation. The right to freedom being the gift of God Almighty, it is not in the power of man to alienate this gift and voluntarily become a slave.

Mr. Speaker, the verdict of our people expressed on the 8th of January, 2015 is neither a victory of one nor a defeat of another. It most pronouncedly represents a rejection of an artificial ideology of offering a united, unquestioned and unquestionable explanation of everything, including historical events. Any dissent or change would cause serious problems for the safety of the State. A majority of our people rejected that made-to-measure ideology.

The post-election consensus that emerged shows that those who did not agree with us are not opposed to our ideals, but perhaps did not share our sense of urgency in bringing in the much-needed constitutional reforms.

What we should celebrate today, Mr. Speaker, is the discovery that there are no perpetual minorities or majorities. Ours is not only a democracy, it is also a Republic. Our common endeavour is to ensure that the power of the State is limited by law. In such a State, minorities - religious, cultural or linguistic - need no special privileges or protection.

In such a Republic, patriotism will inspire and foster collective solidarity with fellow citizens and loyalty to the law. I pray that Allah, the most Merciful and Compassionate, will give us all the courage and wisdom to defend the rights and freedoms that a republican democracy guarantees by its basic law.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

[4.45 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha - State Minister of Higher Education) Mr. Deputy Speaker, as the former Chief Government Whip also said earlier in the day, it is an unusual pleasure to speak as the Leader of the Liberal Party in Parliament. In that capacity, I extend my congratulations to His Excellency the President on his strength of character in taking up what seemed an impossible challenge and the eminently civilized way in which he has worked after his victory. We also congratulate the Hon. Prime Minister for understanding political realities and thwarting the game plan of the former President by supporting a common candidate. It is salutary that, in addition to being the Prime Minister, he has taken charge of economic development, since I believe we need the careful planning and financial discipline that he will bring to this portfolio, which was singularly lacking in the last few years.

Sir, though the Liberal Party is a small one, we can take credit for having first identified the problems of this Constitution and this electoral system, which our Government is pledged to change. Though I know the parties of the Left objected to the 1978 Constitution, they did so on the basis of a return to the Westminster model. This was foolish - I am afraid the Left parties are consistently foolish on small issues sometimes - because they had been victims of excessive power in the hands of a Prime Minister under the Westminster system during the previous couple of years.

We, or rather the Founder Leader of the Liberal Party, Dr. Chanaka Amaratunga, was the first to clearly identify the dangers of excessive power and to explain the way in which checks and balances could be introduced. In this regard, I am sorry to say that I received very little support from other parties for the changes I proposed to the Standing Orders over a year ago. This Government is pledged to introduce changes and, I hope very much, that the changes I proposed will be discussed; they can, of course, be amended, but at least, it is a start. The Leader of the NLSSP - I am grateful to him - did raise a question on my behalf -

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) It is not NLSSP. It is " ".

( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) I am sorry, I confused you with Dr. Wickramabahu Karunaratne. My apologies.

The Leader of the DLF and the then Chief Government Whip tried valiantly to get some progress on that, no one else in authority seemed to care. In this regard, Sir, I hope that in introducing changes, we work in terms of principles rather than engaging in ad hoc measures. We should make sure that Parliamentary Committees are constituted as happens in the rest of the world, with no authority to Ministers, but rather ordinary Members of Parliament being the Chairs. This should be mandatory for Finance Oversight Committees and, while I am sorry that the TNA and the JVP are not in the Cabinet, I believe their commitment to financial integrity should find full play in the chairing of such Committees.

Hasty legislation was the reason for former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga not acting in terms of the Seventeenth Amendment and refusing to appoint the Election Commission suggested by the Constitutional Council. I am glad, therefore, that in getting rid of the Eighteenth Amendment, as to which I trust this House will be unanimous, we replace it with something based on constitutional practice in the rest of the world without blindly returning to the Seventeenth Amendment.

65 66

Similarly, Sir, with regard to electoral systems, the Liberal Party was the first, in the '80s, to suggest change and to advocate a mixed system. We were then accused of trying to introduce foreign customs. However, soon enough, all parties agreed on the need for the German System, though twice there were efforts to distort this. I remember discussing this in the '90s with the then Minister of Constitutional Affairs in this very Parliament and him admitting that there were slight changes; changes that, in fact, distorted the principles of the German System. Later in 2002, I urged the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya to act quickly because he had plans for electoral reforms as the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena also had, but they all delayed, and that Government was dismissed. I am glad, therefore, that the Hon. Prime Minister made clear our commitment to swift reforms in this regard.

Sir, in celebrating the need for reform, the Liberal Party can be proud that, alone in Government, it formally advocated reforms while sitting in Government for the last two years. I should mention here though, the debt owed also to the Hon. Vasantha Senanayake, who along with me drafted a formal letter to the former President at the beginning of last year about the need for reforms, and I am grateful to the Senior Ministers who signed that letter, which was quite brave of them at the time. Had the former President listened to him and accepted, even with amendments, the constitutional change he tabled, perhaps things might have been different. But, instead of taking advice from moderates in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, which I hope will return to its traditional moderation under its new Leader, he was led astray by extremists and those who thought the State was theirs to plunder.

Sir, the Liberal Party told the former President in writing in October that he should not have a hasty election, but instead, work on the reforms promised in the Manifesto on which the UPFA had won the election. We told him we could not support him in an election without reforms. I know that the Left parties had also advised him not to have a hasty election, and I am sorry that they, whose integrity I used to admire and which I still admire, did not also stand by their beliefs the way a few of us did. In this context, I should note that the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara was slightly misleading in the story he told me on the night of 8th January; he told me then that one of the reasons for the delay in releasing the results was, he had been told, that the present President had wanted it delayed.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Oh, my God!

( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) I know that - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Right now, how can you, the Leader of the Liberal Party, tell an untruth outright? I cannot think of it!

( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) I never told an untruth. Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, you told me that the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena had asked for the delay because he wanted to take office in the morning. You said that. If you have forgotten it - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) I said that the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena, the President-elect, had wanted -

( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Yes, that is what I said. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Then, with that, I agree. ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Exactly. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) But, I thought you said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) I did not. I said the "current President". ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, I would kindly suggest that you never again accuse me of telling an untruth because you know perfectly well that I do not tell untruths.

67 68

2015 20

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Yes, I know. ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) I do not even distort the truth. - [Interruption.] Thank you.

So, what I am saying is, the story you told the House was not quite correct.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Wrongly perceived. ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Yes. But, you claimed that the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena had wanted the results delayed, which was not true.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Falsehood; that is what I was told. ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Yes. But, you should have mentioned that in the House.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Yes, I had to. ( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Okay.

The other point I want to make is this. As you know, I have asked my friends in the Left why they did not stand by their principles and join the campaign of the Hon. Maithripala Sirisena. I do think that in 2015, this whole idea about imperialism, about the rich, is nonsense. I am personally very proud that I was not together with those people who had manipulated the stock exchange mercilessly in the last few years. I am sorry that people like you, whom I admire and who, I know, are not corrupt in the slightest, stood together with corruption and I told you that it was not correct to stand together with racists. You and I know, perhaps, the former President was not a racist, but the use made of such people was absolutely

shocking! I was deeply sorry that my old Friends in the Left were prepared to go along with that because I think you have a lot to contribute to the future of this country in terms of ideas. I hope that you will not stick to the old practice.

Finally, Sir, I was told that I was courageous, but as the former President once said, I was "someone without a political future". As a member of the Liberal Party, I had nothing to lose. The real heroes of today are His Excellency the President, the other members of the SLFP, and in particular, the Hon. Vasantha Senanayake, who spoke out so early, the Leader of the UPF and the other minority Members who left Government in that tumultuous week after the Presidential Election was called. In wishing the Government well, in hoping for the Opposition's cooperation now for reform, I salute them for courage, which I hope will never be necessary again in our political system after we get rid of the excessive authority of the Executive.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) . . rose. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Prime Minister, please. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) , . . . .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) What is wrong about it? ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I am just saying that he mentioned it and that those have not been removed. That is the position as of today. - [Interruption.] Hon. Sampanthan, you all have also taken up the question of resettlement of people and the Manifesto states that we will go into the cases of people in the whole country, whose lands had been taken away, and wherever possible in the vast majority of the cases, they will be asked to resettle in the lands. But, we have not removed any camps.
