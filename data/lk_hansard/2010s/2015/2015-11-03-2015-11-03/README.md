( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Niroshan Perera - State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) Hon. Speaker, on behalf of the Hon. Prime Minister, Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, I answer Question No.2.

(a) (i) Yes. Interest rates vary on products

depending on the customer categories, risks and cost of funds. Credits Cards are comparatively of higher risk and interest rates on Credit Cards are generally higher.

Banks charge relatively high interest

rates for Credit Card advances due to the following main reasons:

(a) Availability of interest free credit

period of up to 55 days, resulting in higher funding costs to banks as they do not earn any interest on interest free balances. (b) Higher credit risks due to the

unsecured nature of the product. (c) High infrastructure requirement,

including fraud detection systems to minimize frauds taking place locally and overseas, which provide a safe environment for payments. (d) Deferred and flexible payment

options made available to card holders. (e) Cost of benefits offered. As at end September 2015, 12 commercial banks including 2 foreign banks operating in Sri Lanka have issued credit cards and the outstanding amount stood at approximately Rs.60 billion. Currently, the interest rate on credit card advances is at a range of 18 per cent to 24 per cent. However the maximum interest rate is regulated at 24 per cent. (ii) No. Banks offer different interest rates for

various deposits and loan products for identified customer groups. If credit card dues are paid within the given period, interest is not charged. Therefore, it is not appropriate to state that the customers are adversely affected. (iii) No. Banks face different levels of excess

liquidity consequent to cash flow changes and such excess liquidity changes from time to time. However, the total liquidity in the banking system is regulated by the Central Bank under its Monetary Policy and excess liquidity is absorbed by the Central Bank to keep interest rates stable.

(b) (i) None. Currently, the interest rate on credit

cards has a regulatory ceiling of 24 per cent. Further, reduction may be considered if other market interest rates decline.

(ii) In March 2015, the Government implemented a special interest scheme on fixed deposits for senior citizens where persons over 60 years of age are entitled to receive an interest rate of 12 and 15 percent and there are various Government funded loan schemes with lower interest rates.

Interest rates will adjust according to the market forces with effect of the policy interests of the Central Bank. Policy interest rates are decided under the Monetary Policy to address the macroeconomic concerns.

(c) (i) No.

(ii) Not applicable

(iii) Not applicable.

(iv) Not applicable.

(d) Forcing the banks and financial institutions to

consolidate will be unfair. Therefore, the consolidation programme initiated by the former government was reviewed and discontinued. The consolidation will be considered as per the proposals made by banks and financial institutions on a case-by-case basis under the prevailing law.

QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

ATTACK ON STUDENTS OF HIGHER NATIONAL DIPLOMA IN

ACCOUNTANCY

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Thank you Mr. Speaker for granting me leave to raise a matter of urgent public importance. This relates to the attack that took place on the 29th of October, 2015 at Ward Place, Colombo 7, by the Police on the students of Higher National Diploma in Accountancy course.

I would like to briefly state what happened. We all saw on TV as the incident took place. We saw everything on TV, fortunately. The students were going along the road making certain demands. I believe they were following Higher National Diploma in Accountancy course and their demand was that success in that course of study should equate them with persons who obtain Bachelor of Commerce degree and that there should be some extension of the period of their study. I think it was a perfectly legitimate demand, which had been granted some time ago, but which had been withdrawn recently. The students were concerned that their entitlement in

23 24

2015 03

regard to that matter should be restored. There were males in that procession; there were females; I saw some monks. They were not armed in anyway. None of them were carrying sticks or bottles or stones or anything like that.

They were prevented from moving along the road because there were certain barricades. When they reached the barricades, I saw them attempting to remove the barricades. That is all they did, nothing more. They attempted to remove the barricades to be able to go further forwards, towards their destination. They were prevented from doing so. Water cannon was used and the students retreated - we saw them retreat; they moved backwards, not forwards. When this happened, the retreating students, both female and male, were attacked by persons in Khaki clothing, apparently, policemen with batons. Many of the protestors sustained injuries and some of them were, I believe, taken into hospitals.

I want to pose the question, why was this attack carried out on retreating students; on students who were going backwards, not moving forwards? This, in my view, was thoroughly unwarranted and totally reckless conduct on the part of the police. Those entrusted with enforcing the law were breaking up the law by beating up peaceful protestors. People in a democratic country have a right to protest, to give expression to their grievances. These young people had a grievance. That was that. They were given an entitlement some time ago, which had been withdrawn and they wanted that restored. They want their qualification to be equated to a similar qualification which would probably entitle them to better employment opportunities. That was a legitimate demand.

We are not living in a colonial country. We are living in our own country and our youth cannot be treated in this callous way. This is the antithesis of good governance. The miscreants must be identified and dealt with, including those in the command structure of the police unit who were on duty on that day, because when the policemen started attacking the students, a senior officer could have immediately stopped it. But no such thing happened. Non-repetition of such incidents must be ensured. This issue must be dealt with in a larger context.

Employment is a vital concern of youth in this country. We give them free education, but after their free education, they are unable to find employment. What is the use of free education if they cannot find employment? Youth cannot find jobs. In fact, recently, when I was talking to the Hon. Prime Minister, I told him that unemployment is a big problem in this country. The youth in the North and the East have been particularly discriminated against over a long period of time. Why do you not create hundred thousand jobs for the youth in the North and the East? Because everywhere you go, you see people protesting, wanting jobs. They are qualified.

Very unfortunately, even in the matter of creating jobs, our education does not seem to be employment-

oriented. We need to ensure that our education is employment-oriented, that people who are educated are able to find jobs with the qualifications they have. But, unfortunately that is not the position. All these matters contribute to the grave concern of the youth. So I think Sir, this is a matter which must be urgently addressed.

I repeat that the miscreants must be identified and dealt with and that the command structure must be looked at and if the persons who were in command at the scene had not taken action immediately as required, even they should be dealt with.

I think Sir, the Government should also address the question of youth unemployment because that is a very fundamental issue which can have grave consequences for this country unless addressed in time.

I believe Sir, my Friend the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake has also given notice of a similar Motion. I might mention that Sir, before I conclude.

Thank you.

. It is called the sleeping time of the rail" - the rail is sleeping. We have the rail; we have invested on it, but we use it, maybe, only for two hours out of the 24 hours. The rest of the time, the rail is not being used. It is underutilized. That is why we should increase the utilization of railways. For that, we have to have a coordinated programme of all services, which could work with the railways. . . . .

to an article in the Business Times section of The Sunday Times of 01st November, 2015 titled Traffic management specialists urge Government to implement Colombo metropolis master-plan. That is, along with the related services through a coordinated programme. . The article states, I quote:

With population in the Colombo Metropolitan Region (CMR) surging to reach 7.9 million by 2035 from 5.8 million today and city roads chock-a-block with traffic, Sri Lankan traffic experts are urging the Government to implement an already-presented, scientific road transportation master-plan.

So, this is what we have to give attention to.

. . . . . - - .

. . Check-in facilities, immigration facilities, all are available at one point - in the City centre. We just check-in there. . . . .

According to this article, the major transport issues identified by this Colombo metropolis master-plan are, I quote:

Congestion is a growing concern for both economic and social aspects within Colombo and its suburbs due to:

o Higher population

o Higher incomes lead to higher mobility (more travel)

o Higher incomes also lead to more private vehicle use.

Therefore, to remedy this situation an integrated transport policy has to be introduced.
