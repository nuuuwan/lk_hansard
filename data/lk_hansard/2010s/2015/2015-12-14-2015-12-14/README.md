This is what President Maithripala Sirisena has said in his manifesto:

In the recent past, racial and religious harmony has been challenged to unprecedented levels. I shall take measures to re-establish and promote racial and religious harmony. Thousands of people have lost their lands in the North, East and the South as a result of the war, as well as due to arbitrary actions of the Rajapaksa regime. My Government will take action to resettle all Sri Lankans who were arbitrarily deprived of their own lands.

. 1989 - . Loizidou . .. . .. 13 - - . 1998 28 . :

In July 1989, Titina Loizidou applied to the European Commission of Human Rights in Strasbourg by filing an individual application against Turkey. She had then started a long complicated and difficult legal process, which lasted nine years. Turkey was indeed the party responsible for the inability of the applicant to peacefully access and enjoy her property in Kyrenia. The Court found Turkey guilty of violating Loizidous's property rights according to Article 1 Protocol No. 1 of the European Convention for Human Rights and responsible for reversing such an illegality. Furthermore, Turkey was held responsible, according to the Court's July 28, 1998 judgment, for paying Loizidou pecuniary damages - just satisfaction - which amounted to Cyprus Pounds 300,000 and equal to US Dollars 600,000 (Case 13823.3.1995).

. ; , .

The non-pecuniary damages were estimated according to the Court's award to an amount of Cyprus Pounds 20,000, which is equal to US Dollars 40,000. The deadline for payment of this amount was 28th October, 1998. Furthermore, in July the Court ordered Turkey to pay her US Dollars 915,000 as damages when the second application was taken into consideration.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, we are discussing today the Votes on the Ministry of Lands, the Ministry of Agriculture as well as the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs. These are three important Ministries and I am pleased to have a few minutes to express my views. I believe I have 20 minutes so that I can go on till we suspend for lunch.

Sir, land in this country falls into two major categories. One is State land which is purely-owned by the State and the other is private land owned by individuals or non-State institutions. The issue of land, today, has become a very contentious issue and very much interwoven with the ethnic problem of the country. From morning, we had many Members of the House on both sides of the Divide speaking extensively about various grievances of their constituents relating to State land and the way in which they are administered today.

When it comes to privately-owned lands by individuals or non-State institutions, we find that either they are freehold or leasehold land. There are other lands by inheritance and there are illegal occupations of State land on long-term basis, which sometimes is converted to permit land and then, permits are issued under village expansion schemes and there are other LDO permits given out of land Kachcheris and then there are licensees et cetera.

As a matter of fact, the State itself is the largest land owner in the country. State land is administered through a variety of legal and administrative mechanisms based in terms of law and policy. We also find that the privately-owned land is governed by relevant public and private law. Since land is the subject matter of competing interests in the country, for a variety of political and other reasons, such as the demand for current and future land requirements, there are a variety of complexities that the State has got to deal with. This has figured prominently in all our political discourses as well as peace negotiations

during the several decades in the post-colonial history of this country.

Land is also inextricably interwoven with the rights of the people and certain fundamental rights recognized by the Constitution impliedly confer certain rights to citizens with regard to land. Research findings have revealed that the people in the North and East have been dispossessed of thousands of acres of land; privately-owned settlements, agricultural and other land, consequent to the conflict either by way of ethnic cleansing in certain areas or mass-scale and planned displacement that took place during the long and arduous period of the ethnic conflict in this country.

Since land is linked to livelihood, majority of the people depend on land for their sustenance. Divisions between the communities on the basis of ethnicity, religion, cast and gender reflect the broader divisions which come up during these discourses. Though the war has come to an end, the wounds, we must say, are certainly not healed and therefore, even after six years of relative peace in the country, the issue of land becomes a very, very contentious issue. In this context, Mr. Deputy Chairman, promoting non-violence means to deal with disputes and conflicts and building skills and capacity of local populations will lead to trust-building and opening up of new opportunities for co-existence and reconciliation which can serve as a decisive factor in the reduction of unrest among communities within volatile environments.

There was a particular Land Circular of 2013. My Hon. Friend, Sumanthiran is here, in the House. He was one of those people who was in the forefront of challenging this Circular which had a serious impact on issues of land distribution particularly that of State land, and also it had an impact on private land which I will come to later. Though the Supreme Court handled this issue, I must say, the Circular set out a certain process to be implemented in order to identify and address problems relating to State land in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. While the Circular set out the framework for issues surrounding State land, there was no indication by the Government regarding plans pertaining to private land. Therefore, there had to be a parallel process. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Order, please! This House cordially welcomes their Worship the Mayors and Delegates from several countries attending the 150th Anniversary of the Colombo Municipal Council, who are present in the Speaker's Gallery at this moment. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Mr. Deputy Chairman, I was referring to the issue of Land Circular of 2013 and I believe that there must be a

1873 1874

parallel process to address problems relating to private lands as well. During the conflict, the resolution of land issues unfortunately had to be put on hold due to security concerns and numerous other difficulties. Due to these reasons, detailed studies could not be carried out except for a few ad hoc enumerations covering certain areas in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Therefore, a credible and comprehensive database or study covering the entire issue of land and land distribution needs to be perceived. And this is something that I believe the Land Ministry must undertake as a matter of priority.

Now, coming to the Report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, this Report provides detailed observations with regard to the impact of land issues on the reconciliation process. One of the key recommendations of the Commission was to amend the Law of Prescription in order to prevent legitimizing of forced eviction and secondary occupation of private land during the period of conflict.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, when I was the Minister of Justice in the last regime, I attempted to draft legislation to amend the age-old Prescription Law of the country in order to accommodate these concerns. Unfortunately, because of some short-sighted interventions by the then Members of the Government we were unable to bring it to reality. I must congratulate the current Minister of Justice, the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, who was able to bring this once again to the Cabinet one or two weeks ago and the Cabinet has now given approval. I am sure this will now be enacted in the next term, may be in January or as early as possible. That would relieve the concerns of many of those people who have been affected due to forced eviction from their lands on which they were depending for livelihood as well as those people who are in secondary occupation of private land in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, in particular.

A case in point I would like to deal with, when it comes to the provisions of the Prescription Law, is the complaints received from paddy land owners. We came across a large number of residents of Eravur, who alleged that the LTTE forced them to divest such land to individuals nominated by them at a very low price. There were paddy lands that were situated deep inside some of the Tamil villages. At that time of purported divestiture of land, they had to virtually abandon these lands due to the armed conflict and they had subsequently no access to these lands. These are lands along Badulla-Chenkaladi Road - on both sides of the Road. There are large tracts of these lands which had unfortunately been seriously impacted on the livelihood of those people. My Friend, the Hon. Ali Zahir Moulana says that similar problems are encountered in the Eravur Pattu area also.

Purported land transfers had taken place during the period between years 1990 to 2006. More than 400 acres

of fertile paddy land had been divested and the LTTE had sent individual letters to land owners and threatened them with death unless the lands were sold to certain identified individuals. We have those documentations available with us and when this Law comes into being we propose to have access to courts and have those grievances addressed.

Several individuals who had defied their orders had also been subjected to serious difficulties and some of them were even killed. As the situation worsened, the land owners succumbed to the threats and divested the lands. They had to divest those lands at varying prices much below the market rate. Sometimes the transaction value was as low as 20 per cent of the market value at the time of the purported sale.

Disposal and dispossession of paddy lands had taken place under different conditions and circumstances. There were several methods by which it happened. There was formal sale of land where the owners were forced to sign documents purported to the sale at very low prices. Then, there was also informal sale of land where the owners were forced to sign a blank sheet of paper. Then, there were transfers through forged deeds. There were lands that do not fall into the above categories, but some owners have been prevented from even entering and cultivating those lands.

So, affected land owners alleged that after the defeat of the LTTE in 2009, they visited these lands to find that other individuals are in occupation. When they requested the land to be handed over to them, the occupants refused to give possession and claimed ownership. So, this new Prescription Law, when it comes into being, would give them an opportunity to assert their legal rights over the lands from which they had been dispossessed.

On an application made by affected families, the land disputes were referred even to the Mediation Board. There again, since the current occupants of the land had refused to appear in the Mediation Board, this dispute could not be resolved even through the mediation process. Again, there is a suggestion - since the Hon. Minister of Justice is here, I must say that there was an attempt supported by several members of the international community to set up special Land Mediation Boards. Because of the adversarial model in the courts sometimes it would take years and years to conclude a dispute relating to land. Setting-up of special Land Mediation Boards might be a welcome exercise and through that these matters, in the conflict-ridden areas which have now returned to normalcy, could be addressed.

The other important matter, Hon. Deputy Chairman, I would refer to is, the institutions of the National Land Commission which I believe is another important element which is missing ever since we had devolution in this

1875 1876

country. Before the introduction of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, land administration was centralized with the Land Commissioner Generals Department at the top. Now, after the the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, land administration continued to be influenced by the central authorities. Judiciary too interpreted the provisions of the Constitution relating to provincial land in favour of the central executive. With the absence of the National Land Commission, this issue is still left open.

The LLRC recommendations on the National Land Commission states, I quote:

The Commission is of view that the Government should expedite action on the establishment of a NLC in order to propose appropriate future national land policy guidelines. In formulating land policy, the proposed NLC should include Guidelines for the equitable distribution of State lands. The Commission regrets to note that although this is a requirement under the 13th Amendment, and a draft Bill has been framed, successive Governments have failed to get it passed through Parliament.

I reiterate,

.successive Governments have failed to get it passed through Parliament.

Therefore, Sir, this is something that the present Minister of Lands should focus attention on and fulfil this long-felt need of establishing the National Land Commission.

Then, coming to a few other outstanding issues, I would refer to the land dispute in Vaddamadu area in Ampara District. The total extent of land there is about 1,742 acres. It was previously situated within the Akkaraipattu Revenue Division and now falling within the Thirukkovil DS Division. There are 600 families that are involved in the cultivation of this land. The predecessors of the current farmers had commenced cultivation in or about 1970 and in 1974. Annual permits have been issued to them. Thereafter, permits have been issued to the farmers under the Land Development Ordinance in the years 1984 and 1985. These people continued to cultivate the lands even during the height of the armed conflict. But unfortunately in 1976, there was an attempt to declare 4,000 acres of land coming within the Akkaraipattu Revenue Division as pasture land and since then there had been a dispute between some of the local residents and these farmers.

The Minister of Environment decided to allow these farmers to use the land for paddy cultivation subject to certain conditions. This happened as recently as last year as well. But now there is a case filed in the Court of Appeal by the Co-operative Society in Alayadivembu seeking orders for ejectment of farmers from the land and to prevent them from cultivating. This case is still pending and this issue needed to be sorted out. I am sure we, the Members of the House on both Sides, who are representing these areas, should sit together and find a

lasting solution to this burning issue of land in which these 600 families have been cultivating. There are 2,800 individuals involved in this exercise and they have been very seriously affected because their livelihood is depending upon their cultivation. There are almost 1,000 school-going children in these families. Therefore, this is a matter that we should address as a matter of urgency.

Since my time is limited, Hon. Deputy Chairman, I would like to refer to another local issue concerning the Palliadivattai - Kirankovol paddy land in the DS Divison of Lahugala. Prior to 1984, the land was in the Pottuvil DS Division. Here again, there is an uncertainty in determining the actual boundaries between the two Divisions. These farmers who have been cultivating paddy in these lands from 1978 were forced out of that area after 1985 when terrorist activities - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, there is a case already pending in courts with regard to pastureland issue. So, let the court decide on that. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No. Let us discuss that. That is just a matter that we have to - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, no, we can discuss it. But - ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Of course these issues involve the court. But the court had subsequently lifted the Stay Order. Now there is no Stay Order. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) There is no Stay Order, but the matter is pending in court for determination. So, this matter is sub judice. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Since there was no Stay Order, the Forest Department and the then Minister of Environment permitted the farmers to continue cultivating. Because it resulted in certain altercations, police intervened and they had to abandon farming. So, we have to look at the pastureland issue too.

1877 1878

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We can discuss it among ourselves. But, since you are raising it in the House, I thought I must mention that the matter is sub judice in any case. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) That is sub judice. That is all right. I do understand. But, for the purpose of record, I thought of mentioning so that it will go in to the Hansard.

The then Government Agent also intervened and several times, we have had meetings with the cultivation committees of the area but then, no solution is at hand.

With regard to this particular issue of Palliadivattai, Kirankovai in Pottuvil area, the Government Agent sent a committee to explore the situation in which the former DS of Lahugala was also present during the visit. A land survey was conducted and it was decided to distribute the land among 250 farmers of Pottuvil. The farmers were permitted to continue their cultivation and they were told that permits would be issued in due course.

Once again, after September, 2007, the Forest Department had ordered these farmers to evacuate from the Kirankovai area as it belongs to the Lahugala DS Division and then there were certain protest from that area. Now, the Forest Department had put landmarks a few yards away from the cultivation area of the Muslims and therefore, Sir, this issue is a very burning issue which affects several farmers who have been clamouring to return these lands for cultivation. So, I had included these issues for the record, and I am sure, there are several other issues pertaining to this.

I would like, within the remaining one or two minutes, to quickly talk about the situation in Silawathura which is a matter of serious concern even for you, Hon. Deputy Chairman as this comes within your own district. A navy camp is put up in the old town virtually taking over the entire town. Large extents of privately-owned properties and lands have been virtually expropriated by the navy by setting up a camp there during the conflict period. Now, that the conflict is over and since the LLRC itself had urged the armed forces to gradually vacate from the privately-owned lands, it is an urgent necessity to evacuate the navy camp from the Silawathura town and take them out of the town as well as to shift the existing police station there. That too had been set up temporarily in an area where there was a health centre. Now, that too is sitting right in the middle of Silawathura town and should be moved out of the town. These two issues together with a variety of other issues in the Trincomalee District and, of course, in Jaffna and Kilinochchi Districts have got to be attended to when it comes to occupation of privately-owned lands in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I think, the Hon. Minister wants to say something. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Silawathura matter has already been taken up by me and I will take necessary steps very soon. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Thank you, Hon. Minister.

With those comments, Mr. Deputy Chairman, I wind up. Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Order, please! The Sitting is suspended till 1.00 p.m. , ..1.00 [ ] . , .. 1.00 . [ ] .

Mr. Chairman, I would like to place on record some facts on potato cultivation in the main cultivation areas of Sri Lanka. In Nuwara Eliya, during Season 1, from January to February, we produce 14,000 metric tons of potatoes in 700 hectares and during Season 2, from September to August, 3,200 metric tons in 200 hectares. Therefore, we produce 17,200 metric tons annually in Nuwara Eliya.

In Badulla, during Season 1, from November to December, we produce 19,200 metric tons in 1,300 hectares and during Season 2, from June to July, 35,200 metric tons in 2,200 hectares and the annual production of Badulla comes to 54,400 metric tons.

In Jaffna, annual production is 3,600 metric tons in 180 hectares. Therefore, the total annual production of these three areas comes to 75,200 metric tons in 4,580 hectares during the two seasons.

Potato cultivation has dropped from 6,300 hectares in 2002 to 4,580 hectares due to import of consumer

potatoes. Import of consumer potatoes has gone up from 40,490 metric tons in 2013 to 118,220 in 2014.

Our country requires about 150,000 metric tons of potatoes for consumption per year but we produce only 75,200 metric tons. When you import 118,200 metric tons, we will have a surplus of 43,420 metric tons and the farmers get a low price. That is why the production on extent has come down from 6,300 hectares to 4,580 hectares. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Minister, your time is over. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. V.S. Radhakrishnan) Please give me one more minute, Mr. Chairman. In order to get a good yield, we need to introduce new technology to potato cultivation. The Ministry can introduce new technology and import high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties of seed potatoes to farmers. We should encourage the private sector also to import good quality, new potato varieties and also we should avoid importing potatoes during our main harvest seasons from February to May and September to October.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) , 20 . [.. 2.53]

. ! , , . . ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . [.. 4.15] ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) , . I am happy to participate in the Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Lands.

, 1977 , . 1978 . , .

His target was to make this country self-sufficient by 1985 and the UNP Government was able to achieve this target by 1986. This whole country became very productive under the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Programme and he was able to ensure that the vision that was presented in 1977 by the J.R. Jayewardene Government was successfully executed.

When we look at this Budget, I think after many, many years we have got a Budget that looks at agriculture and the development of the country. There are some salient points in this Budget that I wish to refer to. One of them being, this Budget looks at self-sufficiency in agriculture in this country in terms of maize, soya beans, chilies, onions and potatoes by the year 2018. This Budget also looks at public-private partnerships in terms of agro-business ensuring that our food needs and the needs of the Asian markets are met accordingly. This Budget also looks at areas of drip irrigation and new technology. The Budget has allowed importation of machinery on a duty-free basis. I think, this is an absolutely salient point in terms of achieving the targets set out for the year 2018.

The other salient point that we are looking at is warehousing. This is something that my father got going by the year 1982. They built warehousing facilities to ensure that whenever there is an excess of paddy and other crops in those areas they are stored properly. The ultimate dream of agriculture through the Mahaweli was a scenario where the warehousing is properly done and thereafter the road network infrastructure was built so that finally the crops that are produced are stored, placed in a Free Trade Zone, loaded onto a train, sent to Trincomalee and exported to the world.

Now, when we are talking about exporting crops to the world, today, a lot has changed since 1978. We must look at crops that are needed in the world; that are in high demand. Again, this Budget looks at, in terms of public-private partnerships, developing those crops. Those ideas and sentiments expressed in the Budget are good for this country. I think, this Budget can and has the potential of ensuring this country will be self-sufficient once again by the year 2018. However, to implement the Budget Proposals we do require a plan and the Hon. Minister, I think, should present it to the Cabinet and to this House later this year as to what his plans are in terms of developing and making this country self-sufficient in agriculture.

Growing fruits, fish farming and animal husbandry are other areas that we need to look at. Under the Mahaweli Projet when agricultural areas were designated, they gave farmers necessary tools, money, required machinery to engage in growing fruits, fish farming or animal husbandry. Unlike growing rice, when you are doing things like fish farming and animal husbandry, you can actually increase your income three to four times.

1939 1940

One of the issues we do have in Mahaweli zones is, the plots have got smaller and smaller. In 1978 - 1979 they were given five acres of land. Today, after 20, 30, 40 years those plots have got smaller and smaller. They have divided that land into 2 or 3, according to the family size. As a result, these plots have got smaller and smaller. So, this is something that this Government must focus on and find a solution.

I think that this Government has to focus on the public-private partnership in terms of drip irrigation and new technology, and ensure that we are achieving the said targets that we promised this country.

The other issue that I do see is the involvement of youth in agriculture. We have less than 3 per cent of the youth getting involved in agriculture in this country. I think the Government must focus on this and have a concrete plan to ensure that the youth are part and parcel of the agricultural sector in this country.

I also request the Hon. Minister to look into the new technologies in countries like Japan and Canada, both of which have very harsh winters. Because of those winters, they do grow crops during the summer months and ensure that those are stored in proper conditions. So, when winter does hit they have enough grain and enough agricultural produce to feed their people and also for export.

Another request that I have is, with regard to the habit of sending officials abroad for observations. During the time of the Mahaweli Development Scheme, under the Maha Goviya Scheme", they actually sent farmers overseas - to places like Thailand, Japan - to study their agricultural methodology and they brought that knowledge back. Now, the officials go and come back, and later they give a report. On many occasions, those reports are in the cupboards for many years whereas if a leading farmer goes out he brings back that technology, that knowledge, and he will definitely talk about it and at least try to implement it in their own areas. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Mayantha Dissanayake) Hon. Presiding Member, please give me thirty seconds more. , . ..... .

I also wish to place on record that the young Minister of Agriculture has a tremendous task ahead of him. Actually about 74 - 75 per cent of this country is still based on agriculture. He will be in this Government for

the next few years. So, I wish him every success in all his endeavours. I am sure, like his father who was a tremendous pillar and a man who wanted to do things in the North Central Province and like his father-in-law also, in the next coming few years that he will really prove his mettle in terms of developing this country and setting about a new era of agriculture in this country.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . .

Hon. Presiding Member, let me commend the Hon. Rauff Hakeem for very eloquently and comprehensively explaining to the House with regard to the land issues prevailing in the North and the East and how to overcome those issues and how those can be resolved in distributing State land to the deserving people of the areas and further as the Hon. Rauff Hakeem mentioned that the farmers of Eravur are being ignored and deprived by Eravur Pattu DS in obtaining necessary permits for their land situated in the areas of Badulla Road. Let me describe to you today what is happening, particularly in my area, in order to suspend the wrong actions of Eravur Pattu DS with regard to land administration related works.

There are five Muslim GSO Divisions which are in the borderline of Eravur Town DS Division temporarily

1949 1950

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

attached to the Eravur Town Divisional Secretariat and day-to-day administrations are being carried out for the convenience of the people. But, unfortunately, land administration of these villages, like Meerakerny, Iyernkerny, Saddam Hussein Village, Michnagar, Thamaraikerny, Thalawai, et cetera is being handled by the Eravur Pattu DS Division and that particular Divisional Secretary of Eravur Pattu acts in a very unjust, unethical and improper manner towards these affected poor villagers and works against the peoples aspirations while regrettably discriminating these people. These people are victims of the thirty years of cruel conflict situation. These victims have not only lost their lands and properties, they have even lost thousands of their beloved ones as well. These poor villagers who live below the poverty line, who have been the owners of these plots of lands for more than thirty to forty years, are denied permits to own their lands by the Divisional Secretary of Eravur Pattu. This Divisional Secretary in a well-planned manner with vested interests, ultimately distributed thousands of their acres of land which are considered as State land to the particular Divisional Secretarys favourite people, certain politicians and also to some businessmen who are bribing this DS and the land officials for their personal gains. As a result, poor deserving villagers are deprived in obtaining their lands. On the contrary, the lands were not even maintained by the so-called influenced people to whom this Eravur Pattu Divisional Secretary has allocated these particular lands and this partial action of the DS of Eravur Pattu has to be curtailed and looked into and also a proper inquiry has to be carried out in this regard immediately.

Due to lack of time available for me, I am tabling* the request made by the Federation of Mosques and Muslim Institutions Eravur to the Prime Minister, Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, in this regard and request to suspend wrong actions regarding land administration related works of Eravur Pattu DS and this letter has to be included in Hansard.

, ... . 6 . [5.17 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you very much, Sir. As you all know, I am from Puttalam. The farmers in Kalpitiya Peninsula, in my

1959 1960

[ ]

2015 14

electorate, are cultivating a total area of 16,031 acres. They are cultivating cabbage, beetroot, carrot, chilli, onion and potato. The total production is transported from Norachcholai Economic Centre to Dambulla Economic Centre and to Colombo. Very unfortunately, the excess production goes waste or sold at a very low price.

According to the Budget -2016, Rs. 2,000 million have been allocated to establish cold rooms and warehouses. The Deputy Minister Hon. Ameer Ali has just left. Under the Ministry of the Hon. P. Harrison, there are five or six cold storages coming up. But monies have not been allocated for Norachcholai. My request, Hon. Minister, is either a warehouse or a cold storage must be set up in Norachcholai so that the excess production can be stored and used later on.

Further, Hon. Minister, the cost of cultivation is very high in Kalpitiya area because the soil is very sandy. Therefore, the farmers have to use more water, more fertilizer and more agrochemicals. The officials of the Ministry will have to look into this matter and attend to. The soil should be hardened by introducing compost and cow dung, so that the cost of cultivation will come down.

Hon. Minister, the biggest problem we face in this area is that there is no organized cultivation like in Nuwara Eliya. As you know, in Nuwara Eliya, in October-November the farmers start planting potatoes and by February-March it is harvested. So the Government knows that so many acres of potatoes are cultivated and the harvest will be so much. Then, the Government does not import potatoes during that period. Unfortunately, in our area, such a vast area, there is no organized cultivation; it is not organized like the kanna system. Hon. Minister, it is only today I met your Additional Secretary. He is also from Puttalam. We have to organize our cultivation in such a way, like the kanna system, and we should cultivate one item in each village.

Hon. Minister of Agriculture, I started my political career with your father and father-in-law. Your father-in-law, the Hon. D.M. Jayaratne, was very interested in this and he came to my area. We tried to start that, but unfortunately I did not get the cooperation from the officials concerned. Therefore, cultivation must be supported in this area. For that, I need your support along with that of your officials. If we do that, I am sure, all those farmers will be benefited. In addition, more produce can be supplied to the market.

Sir, according to the Minister of Finance, I think the Government is going to formulate a new agricultural policy to make the country self-sufficient by 2018. It was mentioned in the Budget Speech that our agricultural imports amount to around US Dollars 1,000 million. I think the farmers in our area should be helped by providing them with agricultural subsidies. They need insect-proof nets which they do not have at present. They do not have net houses, or sprinkler systems. If we can help those farmers by providing them with these items at

a concessionary rate, the cost of cultivation will definitely come down and more produce can be supplied to the market. As a result, the expenditure on imports will definitely come down. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Sir, give me two more minutes, please. Further, there are many fruits like mangoes, papaw and oranges in our area - especially in Anuradhapura and Puttalam. But, during the season they find it very difficult to sell those fruits. So, they need a fruit processing plant in this area. I have already spoken to my leader, the Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen, Minister of Industry and Commerce with regard to this and I request you too to have a discussion with the farmers in the area and take necessary steps to establish a fruit processing plant so that the farmers can make the best use of the excess fruit produce.

Unfortunately, I was unable to explain this matter earlier. So, I invite our young Hon. Minister and the Hon. Deputy Minister to visit our area, look into these problems and solve them by which a massive amount of foreign exchange could be saved.

Then, I would like to refer to land issues in my area. Our Hon. State Minister of Lands is here, unfortunately the Hon. Minister is not here, I hope he will get well very soon. There is a big problem in Eluwankulama in the Puttalam District where the Cement Corporation is occupying 4,500 acres of land by which all those villagers are inconvenienced. I have been telling this to all politicians earlier but they were not at all interested. In addition to those 4,500 acres, the Department of Forest is also acquiring land. So, people in two or three villages have lost their land. I request the Hon. Minister and the Hon. Deputy Minister to look into this matter and solve this problem.

Hon. Presiding Member, finally, I will come to the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs. I am very happy that the Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen spoke this morning about the present rehabilitation problem in Mannar where people are suffering. He finally requested the Hon. D.M. Swaminathan to have a discussion with all related parties and solve this problem to which he agreed. I must tell you that this problem exists not only in Mannar but also in Puttalam. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister to summon the Hon. Ministers and the Members of Parliament from the Government the Opposition in that area and have a discussion and solve this problem once and for all.

Thank you.

Mr. Presiding Member, the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs is mandated with the responsibilities of undertaking resettlement and rehabilitation programmes especially in the war-affected Northern and Eastern Provinces. The Ministry also has a wider mandate to reform the prisons and convert those into rehabilitation and correction centres. Further, this Ministry is also responsible for preserving, promoting and propagating Hindu religious activities island wide and enhancing spiritual development, peace, harmony and social integration of the community.

The Ministry maintained welfare centres for the internally displaced people who are commonly called IDPs, and supported resettlement of IDPs and refugee returnees by providing temporary shelters and resettlement allowances. Dry rations were provided with the support of the World Food Programme. The Government of Sri Lanka provides a resettlement allowance of Rs. 38,000 per family. In 2015, resettlement allowances were provided to 1,552 families.

The Ministry also resettled the conflict-affected people in their original places of living with their consent and gave priority for safety of resettlers by ensuring landmine-free resettlement programme. The Ministry has resettled 157,000 families in the Northern Province and 76,000 families in the Eastern Province up to 30th of September, 2015. There are 13,217 families consisting of 43,977 persons still in welfare centres with their friends and relatives who need to be resettled. His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister are committed to accelerate resettlement of these families in 2016.

As soon as the 65,000 houses will be built by my Ministry, I will be giving the first preference to these

families in the IDP camps and I will resettle them in accordance with the directions given by Ministers and Members of Provincial Councils with the help of the Hon. Members of Parliament of TNA who represent these areas.

With regard to the refugee returnees, in 2015, 429 refugee returnees have returned to Sri Lanka from Tamil Nadu, India. According to the UNHCR Report, over 100,000 refugees are still in welfare camps with their friends and relatives in Tamil Nadu. Here again, Sir, we have to provide proper salubrious conditions when they return. They should have a place to live. Without that, it is really not prudent to call or invite them to come. But in any event, if they do wish to come, we will provide them with all amenities.

The conflict-affected families who lost their properties, business undertakings, kith and kin and who suffered injuries are being compensated through an approved scheme implement by the Rehabilitation of Persons, Properties and Industries Authority - REPPIA. Through this scheme, 545 government servants and 717 general public were given property compensation ranging from Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 150,000; 1,446 persons were provided with compensation for deaths and injuries in 2015; 259 places of religious worship were given compensation for damages; housing grant was given to 760 persons and housing loans and self-employment loans were also provided to persons in conflict-affected areas.

Here I wish to inform this august Assembly that the compensation that was paid to them was not sufficient. I agree, because at that time our Ministry was not given much funds for rehabilitation activities, but in future with the consent of my Secretaries, I will design what sort of compensation should be given to these people who have been affected by this war.

Sir, about 8,000 acres of private lands are still under the control of forces and those will be gradually released for resettlement. The Government is in the process of releasing lands as a positive major step forward to ensure resettlement of IDPs and refugee returnees in their original places of living. Thousand acres of lands from Jaffna, 500 acres of lands from Kilinochchi and 1,000 acres of lands from Sampur, Trincomalee and other small parcels of lands were released by the State for resettlement purposes. Similarly, the Government is committed to release lands on a phase-out basis which military troops are occupying in the Northern and Eastern Provinces to facilitate the resettlement of displaced people.

I think the Hon. Members have spoken very clearly on this issue where the armed forces are in occupation of private lands in the war-affected areas. I do not know why the armed forces are in possession of private lands. Those private lands can be given back to the people and if the armed forces want lands, they can occupy any State

1967 1968

land they wish. That should be the procedure of the Government and I am sure His Excellency the President with the directions of the Hon. Prime Minister is very keen on doing this.

The Ministry also supports conflict-affected people, refugee returnees with durable solutions which include provision of water supply and sanitation facilities, housing programmes and other basic infrastructure facilities, compensation packages for war-affected families and livelihood facilities. There were no adequate budgetary provisions for supporting durable solutions during the past years. However, I am very pleased to note that the Budget-2016 has provided Rs. 14 billion for the development of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces that were affected by conflict. Further, the Budget-2016 also emphasizes strong focus on resettlement of IDPs, refugee returnees, programme for 20,000 housing units and livelihood and income generation programmes. Also, the Budget-2016 proposes to convene a Special Donor Conference in 2016 to generate support from bilateral and multilateral agencies to enhance rehabilitation of the North and East.

The Cabinet of Ministers also granted approval to undertake the programme for 65,000 housing units with concessionary financing arrangements to the displaced families. This is going to be a novel housing programme where prefabricated houses are going to be built. This is going to be of international standing. We will be giving them solar power; we will be giving them furniture; we will be giving them toilet facilities and we will be giving them water facilities. We hope that this project will be a great success and the people of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces will be very happy on this project.

Moreover, the Indian Government has also supported 46,000 housing units under its grant assistance programme which will be completed by the end of this year. Further, assistance has also been provided by the Government of Pakistan and Bahrain for over 500 houses in the Mannar District which are in various stages of progress. Under the European Union grant programme, 3,400 housing units are to be provided and livelihood and income generation support is also to be extended to the conflict-affected families.

The Ministry undertook several relocation programmes and provided alternative locations to displaced families as a result of military occupation in private lands. The Keppapilavu Relocation Programme in Mullaitivu District with 287 houses including infrastructure facilities is an example of relocation programmes that have been implemented. Even in Vavuniya, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu areas, there are many families who have no proper facilities to live in. They have no facilities and we, as the Ministry, are really looking into this matter and providing facilities to whoever is in need.

Here I wish to bring up the question that was raised by an Hon. Member of Parliament regarding an Accountant

of the Northsea Limited. In fact, I have just discussed this matter with officials of my Ministry and I think, he had been interdicted without an inquiry. So, I told them to stop the interdiction immediately and to have an inquiry and consider his position and take appropriate action.

In November, 2015, based on a Cabinet Paper submitted by me, the Government has allocated additional Rs. 2,000 million for High Impact Ten Special Projects which have been jointly identified by the provincial authorities and the Central Government. This High Impact Ten Special Projects include construction of bridge and causeway across the sea between Kayts and Karainagar town; construction of new passenger boat with 100 passenger capacity like "Kumudini" boat; construction of jetty in Delft and rehabilitation of jetty in Elluvaithivu, Kayts; renovation of roads from Velanai to Kayts; establishment of clinical waste management system in five Districts of the Northern Province; establishment of the disposal system for human excreta in Vadamarachchi, Thenmarachchi and Valikamam in Jaffna District; systematization of collection and segregation of solid waste in Jaffna Municipal Council area; seaweed farming in the coastal areas in the Northern Province; livelihood and income generation projects covering value addition and marketing of milk products, Vathiri leather industries and Kamachchi Ambal light engineering industries in Kopay. These projects will be implemented through a novel modality where Central Government and Provincial Council will closely collaborate with the joint steering and implementation mechanism. This will be done in the early months of next year. We have got a Cabinet Paper for relocation. The Cabinet has given us Rs. 2,000 million for these Projects and I hope to go ahead with these Projects as early as possible.

With regard to livelihood and income generation opportunities, Palmyrah Development Board has implemented many development projects in the Northern and Eastern Provinces such as handicraft village in Batticaloa, handicraft village in Ampara, handicraft village in Trincomalee and jaggery plant programmes have also been implemented in Kodikamam. In 2016, Rs. 200 million has been set aside for palmyrah sector development to improve the livelihood activities of the conflicted affected areas. Here again, I want to assure the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah that there will be no discrimination or personal grievance. We are only trying to bring life back to the Palmyrah Development Board and with regard to that I will give all the assurances necessary as the Minister.

Further, to strengthen the livelihood of the coastal community, the ADB is formulating a project to the value of US Dollars 68 million to support and strengthen the fishery harbours and anchorages, aquaculture development, seaweed farming and related development in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.

1969 1970

Moreover, with a view to ensuring reconciliation, the Government is committed to release remand prisoners who have been detained for a long period without any charge sheet or for minor offences. Already, 39 remand prisoners have been given bail. Release of other prisoners is being examined by the Attorney-Generals Department. Here, I wish to say that the Attorney-Generals Department is delaying this programme. If they have any reasons for not releasing these prisoners, then they should give that in writing, so that I can inform the parties concerned why those prisoners cannot be released. So, I take this opportunity to make that remark on the Hon. Attorney-General, because I have to answer the public; the Hon. Members of Parliament will have to answer; the Hon. Prime Minister will have to answer; the President will have to answer. I think the responsibility of the State is to see that there is proper functioning of the judiciary and if they cannot carry out their duties, they should give reasons explaining why they cannot carry them out.

With regard to the prison reforms, the Government has emphasized the importance of upgrading traditional prison systems and looking at prisons as rehabilitation centres and correction centres. Various reform efforts on prisons including relocation, reducing congestion, involving detainees in development, open air prison camps, improving of infrastructure facilities, improving of health conditions of prisoners and integrating prisoners into society are being seriously considered for implementation.

Shifting of prisons of Welikada, Badulla, Tangalle and other prisons from heavily-populated and commercially fast-developing cities to areas away from these cities as part of the prison reforms agenda is being implemented in an accelerated manner. We are trying to bring our prison system to a system which is very close to that of the Malaysian prisons because the Western system will not come through in our country. Therefore, together with the Hon. Prime Minister, we are considering whether we can bring our prisons to the Malaysian standard, to some extent, so that the prisoners themselves will be rehabilitated and have a mode of life. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Mr. Presiding Member, please give me another two more minutes. The ICRC guidelines will be used for the design of new prisons to ensure international standards. The Bogambara Prison has been shifted to Pallekelle and the Tangalle Prison is also to be shifted to Angunakollapelessa.

I have directed my Ministry to have drug detector dogs. They will be used to keep prisons safer and free of drugs. The dogs will be trained to sniff out drugs to ensure that all our prison are safer. We are trying to get Police dogs or private parties so that we can minimize the question of narcotics in prisons which is a very important factor to be considered.

The Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs extends support for the Ministry for promotion of spiritual development through rehabilitation and upgrading of Hindu temples, conduct of religious schools, promoting religious and cultural activities to establish a spiritually and morally advanced society. Five hundred and forty religious places of worship mostly affected by conflict have been renovated and the amount spent was Rs. 85 million.

The Government of India has entered into an agreement to establish a Cultural Centre in Jaffna at a cost of Rs. 1,200 million. The Ministry, with close collaboration and support of the Indian Government, has facilitated gratis visa for over 450 Ayappa Swamy devotees to participate in the "Darshan" at Sabarimalai. The Ministry is also supported by implementation agencies such as Rehabilitation of Persons, Properties and Industries Authority, Resettlement Authority, Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation, Department of Prisons, Department of Community Based Corrections, Youth Training School, Northsea Limited, Palmyrah Development Board and Department of Hindu Religious and Cultural Affairs which play a significant role in achieving vision and mission of the Ministry to meet the Governments' national development policies and strategies.

I wish to specially thank His Excellency the President Maithripala Sirisena for the leadership provided and Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Prime Minister, for his guidance and direction to achieve national development goals and expectations. I also wish to thank our Finance Minister, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake for supporting in all possible ways to implement the resettlement programmes of the Government. This Ministry also very closely works in partnership with the office of the National Unity and Reconciliation which is headed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. Further, we also very closely work with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera to win confidence and trust of the international community. I also wish to thank State Minister, the Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah, Mr. Bradman Weerakoon, my Advisor, and the Secretary to the Ministry, Mr. V. Sivagnanasothy and all the members of the staff for their support and cooperation extended to me. I also wish to seek the advice of the Members of Parliament on any particular measures that this Ministry should take to enhance its objectives in the future. Your suggestions would be most welcome.

Thank you very much, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me time.
