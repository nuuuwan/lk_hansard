QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

I DECREASE IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES OF CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva - Leader of the Opposition) , .

124 - 16.3- , , 132.90 . 10 , , , -Primary Dealers- , ? 1. 124 ? 2. 124 ? 3. 124

? 4. ? 5. - Primary Dealers - , , ? 6. 124 , ? 7. ?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) No funds have been released to the Government from the Foreign Exchange Reserves of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. We have not released US Dollars 124 million, as you mentioned. The Foreign Exchange Reserves of this country as at 13th March were US Dollars 6,175.3 million. The Primary Dealers have already been given an appointment on the 23rd. I think someone has misled you and, I do not think that we should be getting appointments from the Primary Dealers.

. I insisted on a public auction because private placements have led to corruption and lack of transparency. Previously, parcels of Government Bonds were handed out to selected individuals on a favoured basis through a system of private placement. It took place outside the normal auctions of Government Bonds. These are what the Primary Dealers are saying. You must look at the facts. . , . Private placements were usually as large as ten times bigger than the amount of Government Bonds sold through the auctions. private placements . . This led to an unhealthy link between some of the officers of the Central Banks Public Debt Department, Primary Dealers and large corporations who benefited from such private placements. This practice only enriched a handful of cronies of the previous Government. ? public auctions private placements . . . Records confirm that private placements had become a norm rather than an exception. In just one instance in 2013, Rs. 16 billion worth of 5-year bonds were sold through auction at a yield of 10.9 per cent. Thereafter, Rs. 76 billion worth of the same bonds were sold through private placements at a higher yield of 11.42 per cent. Who stood to benefit from such acts? The answer is obvious. These Primary Dealers, who are giving all these information, forget the tricks that they have been up to. This may be a fight between rogues.

There are a number of allegations of violations of the Colombo Stock Exchange market rules and the Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. Under the last Government, there were a large number of allegations. The minor ones were compounded and 13 large cases were abandoned purportedly on the lack of evidence. They were not investigated nor settled when it should have been probed further. The Members of the Securities and Exchange Commission was providing power for these people. I would like this to be recorded in the Hansard. I have requested the Securities and Exchange Commission to go into these cases. If necessary, I will bring legislation to permit such inquiry. I am also seeking for the appointment of a Parliamentary Select Committee to inquire into these transactions. . , - and what are the laws necessary to control this market. They played hell out of our economy - . Since some of the issues raised are under consideration by the Committee, I prefer to give an elaborate answer after the report is submitted. , . . It is a technical report. . .

, . . , .

. . , . .

Now, I would like to cite some of these instances. Take the case of Nimal Perera. There were large numbers of surveillance referrals made to the Colombo Stock Exchange. Nevertheless, you allowed him to head the Pan Asia Bank. - [Interruption.] He is not fit and proper. That is what I have to go into. You put two ex-Central Bank employees to head two commercial banks - Ranee Jayamaha and Dheerasekara - thereby having it under the control of the Rajapaksa regime. You put ex-employees, with an additional retirement pension like in Avant Guard. Avant Guard , pension . .

The National Savings Bank purchased 13 per cent of the Finance Company shares at Rs. 50 per share. That is Rs. 20 above the market value. The masterminds behind this were Ajith Devasurendra and Dinal Wijemanne. Today, the Finance Company has recorded accumulated net losses of Rs. 16 billion. This is what I want to stop.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Still, the case is pushed down. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Whatever it is, we have to take action. We can even bring laws or appoint a Select Committee. Let us go into this and stop it once and for all. We do not like it. . . Hon. Eran Wickramaratne, who was asked to retire from the National Development Bank - was it Russell de Mel?

(, ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne - Deputy Minister of Highways, Higher Education and Investment Promotion) Yes.

Take for example Dilith Jayaweera. His roles in the Colombo Land and Development Company and the Reef Comber have to be probed by the authorities. Another example is Scott Newman and Kosala Heengama. Their roles in Environment Resources Investments require very close scrutiny.

Then, I will give you another example, the SriLankan Airlines. The Cabinet approved, by decision 11/1459/545/009 of 4th August 2011, the investment of US Dollars 520 million of equity into SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka over a five-year period. A sum of US Dollars 230 million was required for re-fleeting. The other requirements being the repayment of bank overdrafts/loans - US Dollars 52 million; repayment of outstanding creditors - CPC - US Dollars 28 million and others US Dollars Rs. 15 million; funding of working capital (maintain adequate cash reserves) - US Dollars 94 million; investment in infrastructure/fixed assets - US Dollars 81 million (includes investments required in Mattala and Ratmalana Airports to provide ground handling services); Mihin Lanka: re-fleeting - US Dollars 10 million; funding of working capital (maintain adequate cash reserves) - US Dollars 5.5 million; repayment of previous outstanding creditors - US Dollars 4.5 million. The airline has received a total of US Dollars 375 million from the previous Government. Out of this total, US Dollars 50 million was spent on re-fleeting and the balance was utilized to cover the losses. Only US Dollars 50 million. Just imagine! As a result, SriLankan Airlines does not own a single aircraft. But, we have some air-conditioned buses and some cars.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Shame! ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) You all did not know what happened. This is why I say that Parliament must be given the financial authority.

As a result of past misdeeds, the Central Bank has now been forced to embark on the task of re-building their credibility and standing as the countrys most credible financial institution. This is no easy task, since the spin masters have turned the institution into a wasteland. They left behind a legacy of mismanagement and misrule. They have been adopting a system of private placements of bonds. The criteria they adopted allowed the Central Bank to cut deals with the Primary Dealers.

Rebuilding international confidence and credibility has become an uphill task. Who are the people who are responsible for this mess? We may have half a trillion to a trillion rupees worth of commitments made mainly on highway projects and we will have to cut down on some of them. We just cannot go on. I want to have the whole amount disclosed to the House in time to come because the House must decide as to what has to be done. That is why I want the Parliament to be a Government. These are the problems that we are facing. You will also have ideas. You were in the Government and you saw what was happening from inside. .

.

73 74

. . Even I have no confidence in the private sector, these big businesses. I am calling on the Primary Dealers and the big businesses to say that they have to fall in line with what is happening and be ready for a transparent society. , . . Now, you all must decide. You all have complained about the Central Bank and I appointed a Committee. So, you in the private sector, tell me about all the other people you have been associating with. Do you want me to clean it up or are you going to clean it up? That is what I want to ask.

The Associate Editor of the Daily Mirrorcalled on Arjuna Mahendran to resign. But, long ago, Kesara Abeywardena ran an article asking me to resign as the Leader of the UNP. Fortunately, I did not take his advice. So, I cannot be advising anyone to follow Kesara Abeywardenas advice. Mr. Kesara Abeywardena was a lackey of the Rajapaksa regime, who is guilty of covering up blatant attacks on media freedom. Such persons of questionable integrity preaching morals to us is not only reprehensible but also abhorrent. His colleagues are calling on him to go in the name of God - go. If he resigns, then he can set an example for Arjuna Mahendran to resign.

Has the media not been irresponsible? The Sunday Leader owner, Asanga Seneviratne, runs a business that has made losses from the inception. How is it that he has so much money to pour in the business of creating public opinion? Where does that money come from? From where are the funds? These are all those who benefited from the Rajapaksas. I am sure Members of this House are aware that one electronic media outlet has made me a target. Hardly a day passes without a campaign of misinformation and character assassination; all because I am not prepared to dance to the tune of the owner and meet his demands. I must confess that I am emboldened by what they are doing. It has given me courage and strengthens my resolve to expose their sinister motives. There is also an ugly side to it. Innocent people are being misled but such numbers are dwindling. Their performances have ruined their credibility and lost them the trust of the public.

One reason for this is that Indian Companies are looking for oil and gas in the Palk Strait. They are exploring for natural gas. There is one company with strong media connections that wants to partner with one of these Indian Oil Exploration Companies. However, the only credible partner for Indians in Sri Lanka is the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. No one else has their expertise. So, I have said that I will not allow collaboration with any other Sri Lankan Company. You go by yourself or come with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. Naturally, they must be annoyed with me.

This is just money for nothing. Why should I give money for nothing, the money that should come back to the people. I am not prepared to do this. I am for the private sector, but not for this type of private sector. , . . . .

I also want to state that there is an imperative need in Sri Lanka for an Independent Broadcasting Authority. This is like the one existent in the United Kingdom to ensure ethical and fair conduct. Some institutions at present have become tools in the hands of their owners, who have to protect not only their business empires but also, more importantly, their secrets and sinister ambitions.

In fact, I have a letter sent to me by Mr. Arjuna Mahendran of today's date, 17th March, 2015. It states, I quote:

"Television Reports relating to Good Governance

Regarding allegations made by the Sirasa Television Network that I had stated there was a lack of good governance in the recent auction of Treasury bonds, I wish to state that no such comment was ever made by me. This Television Station took a voice cut of my conversation in which I stated that the Central bank advertised the sale of Rs. 1 billion worth of Treasury bonds on 26th February, 2015 because it could not foresee how much could be raised through the same auction. These comments cannot in any way be construed to imply that there was a lack of good governance.

It is only after we assumed office that the Central Bank adopted a more prudent system of calling for competitive bids. As a result, the Government is able to raise funds at the most competitive rates. This would ensure that the Government is able to raise money at the most competitive rates. The way the bond markets behave and how the secondary market works can be complicated and not many would understand the complex nature of the transactions. But, we can compare the latest 30-year bond issued under this Government and the ones that were issued under the previous one. The 30-year bond of June 2014 was issued at an average interest rate of 11.75 per cent. The latest bond was sold at 11.73 per cent, slightly lower than the rate paid last year. This means, we were able to raise just over Rs. 10 billion at a rate cheaper than what the previous Government paid.

Furthermore, there are several previous instances of the Central Bank accepting much higher volumes of bids than what were advertised. On 14th February, 2014, Rs. 1 billion worth of Treasury Bills was offered and over Rs. 11 billion was eventually sold. On 14th November of the same year, Rs. 2 billion was offered and over Rs. 13.5 billion were sold. What our Government and the Central Bank have done is to raise money for the Government at the best possible rates through a competitive bidding process instead of using private placements. But, I also want to see in this instance whether there were any shortcomings, whether there was any fraud, whether there

75 76

[ ]

2015 17

was insider trading, just to make sure. So, that will be in the report you will get and you can debate that in the House.

The House would agree that it is not a healthy practice to allow private placements when we could get better terms by opening up to a competitive environment. By resorting to a traditional transparent auction of Government Bonds, the Central Bank has already made significant progress in raising funds for the Government. You all say the auction was not transparent. So, that is what we are looking into, to keep the House informed. Just last week, a record of Rs. 100 billion was raised in four auctions to repay Rs. 79 billion of bonds coming due this week and to keep funding Government projects. This is all money that we need for all the issues that the Hon. Shantha Bandara raised after he became the head of the SLFP Youth League. We wish him all the best of luck. The most important aspect of the entire issue is the transparent manner in which we responded to the criticism directed at us from various quarters. We never stifled any voice of criticism.

The media, the civil society, and political parties were given total freedom to voice their opinion on the bond issue. There were no white-vans at the doorsteps of those who criticized the Government on this matter. Secret units did not tap their telephones. No one received threatening telephone calls after voicing their opinion on the bond issue at public forums like they did in the past, under the watch of the Rajapaksa regime. The people, the Legislature, the civil society and the media were either hoodwinked or intimated when it came to problems involving public money. That is the main difference of the present Government. It acts in a responsible manner and is accountable to the public as well as to Parliament. When I raised a question about the Colombo Port City issue in Parliament, the previous Government said that documents of the deal should be brought to Parliament in lorries; not even on a bicycle. That was the manner in which they responded to allegations levelled by the Opposition. If those documents were brought, we could have avoided some of the steps that we are taking today.

Two Directors-General of the Securities and Exchanges Commission - SEC - were forced to resign when they tried to investigate allegations of corruption. Journalists were not even allowed to write about the circumstances under which the Directors-General of the SEC had to leave their positions. We have acted in a totally different manner, demonstrating that we are a Government that is accountable to Parliament.

() () PERSONAL EXPLANATION BY HON. (PROF.) RAJIVA WIJESINHA

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am very grateful for this opportunity to explain my position, following the question

raised about this in the House two weeks ago. But, I am also very sorry because I had hoped that it would not be necessary for me to explain what occurred, which led to my resignation.

I am compelled, however, to speak, given what seems to have been a misleading account to the House. The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, who raised the question, spoke to me the next day and indicated that the response was nothing has changed. I spoke to the Hon. Prime Minister about this, and said that it was wrong for him to imply that I was still a State Minister. His answer was that my resignation had not been accepted. But, as he should know better than me, such acceptance is not relevant. The Constitution is very clear that a Minister shall continue to hold office unless he resigns his office by a writing under his hand addressed to the President. To confirm my resignation, I would like to table* my letter of resignation. It is both in Sinhala and English, and I would like both versions tabled.

It is clear, Hon. Deputy Speaker, that I have resigned with effect from 17th of February, a month ago. The Ministry accepted that fact in taking back the cheque for my salary for the whole month and sending me instead a cheque for only half a month. My resignation was because the Cabinet Minister, having first told me that I would have to do all the work because he had to concentrate on the election, then took decisions without consulting or even informing me. I told him once that this was unethical, when he ordered the Secretary to the Ministry to look into matters pertaining to the activities of the earlier Minister. But, then he went further, and instructed the members of the University Grants Commission to resign, without bothering to inform me. He told me when I inquired that this was under pressure from the FUTA. But, FUTA itself has gone on record with regard to the charges it made against the Chairman of the UGC to say that If the Government wishes to inquire, we would most certainly welcome such a move. But, in reality, the Minister and the Prime Minister made a decision to act at the meeting held with FUTA on 27th January and ignored all principles of decency in going through with their decision.

The FUTA record of the meeting - which I table* - noted that the Prime Minister said that the UGC Members would be requested to resign.

Request letters should come through the Secretary to the President which is the legal position. The Minister, Hon. Kabir Hashim, said that he requests all Council members to resign.

On that very day, 27th January, the Cabinet Minister wrote to the President in a letter, which I also table,* to say, "We, therefore, request permission of Your

79 80

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

2015 17

Excellency to request the Chairperson and Members of the UGC to tender their resignations.

But, when he received no response, he took matters into his own hands. Though the President told me very clearly on the morning of 12th February that he had not ordered her removal, the Cabinet Minister had written a letter to the Chairman of the UGC informing her that the President had directed him to obtain her resignation, which letter I table*.

That was not correct. We came into office, Hon. Deputy Minister, on the promise of good governance. This is not good governance. You do not tell untruths and take the name of the President in vain. I must also report that neither the Prime Minister nor the Minister kept any of the promises they made to me subsequent to my resignation.

On 12th February, the Cabinet Minister said that he had been asked by the President to resolve the issue, and he pledged that henceforward I could take decisions. His interpretation of this was that I could choose members of the UGC from lists in the Prime Ministers Office. The Prime Minister has no business to have such lists. He has no business to interfere with the University Grants Commission unless he believes that the Constitution has already been changed to allow him to take all executive power into his own hands, without being elected to such authority. The Constitution has not been changed. He must respect the President.

The Cabinet Minister realized the situation was untenable and told me that he would inform the Prime Minister to appoint me to the Cabinet portfolio. He failed to do this. The Prime Minister called me on Saturday, having been told of the problem by the Hon. Niranjan Deva Aditya, and promised to get back to me, but he did not. The Cabinet Minister reiterated his view on Monday, the 16th. That evening, the Prime Minister called me and said that he had to consult former President Chandrika Kumaranatunga. He promised to call me the next day to let me know the situation, but did not. His lame excuse when we spoke after his misleading statement in the House, was that it had been impossible to get in touch with her because she was in England. It seemed to me, as I told him, that that was no way to run a government. He merely shrugged.

All this makes clear, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that I need to confirm that I am no longer a Minister, and must be treated as a "Private Member". As you may be aware, I have proposed two Constitutional amendments, one in fulfilment of the pledge in the Manifesto to reform the electoral system, which I table*.

The Secretary-General told me that I could not bring this forward since I was not a "Private Member". But, I trust he will recognize that with my letter tabled, there can be no question of my being a Minister. I am definitely a "Private Member". As my letter of resignation makes clear, I am happy to continue as a "Private Member" and work towards fulfilling the principles on which this Government was elected. I am sorry for the students though, because nothing seemed to have moved in the Ministry after I left, contrary to what was said two weeks ago.

Last week I was sent about 50 unopened letters addressed to the State Minister. None of them had been looked at. I wrote to the Cabinet Minister to say that it is important that the Government responds to the public. I believe he should be concentrating on winning the election in which his party is trying to dragoon the country far sooner than it should be held and he finds it difficult to multi-task. But, this must be done, assuming the Government is serious.

To show how much can be done with concentrated effort, I am tabling* some of the work done during my brief tenure at the Ministry, which included a new draft Act, which I was able to prepare in six weeks with the support of former Vice-Chancellors, and also two draft Cabinet Papers on Divisional Level Language Centres and a University Press.

I do hope these are taken forward. I would urge the Deputy Minister, who has been asked to undertake the job and, who I know is capable of multi-tasking, to please work on these.

For my own part, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am content to leave all this to an effective Minister, and I will now work on the reforms to which we are pledged. But, the exception is abolishing the Executive Presidency, as opposed to cutting down on its powers. Replacing an Executive President with an all-powerful Executive Prime Minister would be an enormous mistake, given the manner in which this Government is behaving. I am deeply sorry that the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which was gazetted has ignored the decisions taken at the meeting of Party Leaders on Sunday. The Gazette of the Nineteenth Amendment is a disgraceful performance because it violates the commitments that were entered into last Sunday.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, the blatant manner in which political appointments are now being made, the recall to the mast of septuagenarians who cut their administrative

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

teeth a third of a century ago who have no good reputation and more, the failure to keep so many of the promises of this Manifesto that are in the peoples interests as opposed to that are of politicians, is frightening.

Sir, we need to entrench systems of good governance and accountability. This is not difficult, as you can see from the swift progress of the Committee on Standing Orders, the Minutes of which I would like to table*, even though the Prime Minister wanted to postpone this.

I have also put forward a Motion to introduce a Bill of Rights, which I will table* which was prepared through the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights over five years ago.

I am sorry the last Government, despite my urging the then President did not wish to table this. I hope this Government will do so because entrenching fundamental rights in the Constitution - not only the Right to Information but the Right to Life - is vital.

I have also proposed yesterday an amendment to the Constitution to strengthen the Public Service, which has been grossly neglected in the discussions thus far on measures to reduce the powers of the Executive. Mr. Deputy Speaker, if we are to reduce the powers of the Executive, it has to be through building up alternative institutions - Parliament, the Judiciary, the Public Service, the Media - and not by simply transferring power from President to a Prime Minister. We need accountability.

To do all this, however, requires freedom of action. To maximize my contribution in the short period that remains to this Parliament, I must, therefore, make clear that I am no longer in the Executive Branch of the Government. This afternoon, Sir, I found it very difficult to find a seat. I do not wish to sit amongst the Ministers any longer.

My commitment to His Excellency the President is absolute and, I believe, he is the best hope for good Government and systemic change in the future. But, in order to make my position absolutely clear, I think it is only correct for me now, at this stage, to cross the Floor of this House.

Thank you.

, . , . , . , . [3.22 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, as I rise to speak on this Order that has been placed for approval, I cannot but recollect the time when the Hon. Minister of Justice and Labour Relations himself, seated on this side, opposed the extension of this Order when it came up two years ago. In fact, that Order had lapsed before it came up for extension and it was he, who pointed out to the House, that that Order could not be extended because it had lapsed and the Order had to be remade and that is why a bill had to be brought again, the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act, No. 2 of 2013. The original Act having lapsed, the Hon. Minister, the person who pointed it out rightly at that time from the Opposition Benches, today is propounding the extension of this illogical and draconian provision. This is another one of those ironies that we are faced with of a Government that was established for good governance.

Twenty four hours time is the limit before which, under ordinary laws, a person must be produced before a magistrate, only to be produced before a magistrate. If he is suspected to have committed an offence that is non-bailable, as it is called, then the magistrate would remand the person, certainly at least for the first 15 days and thereafter, take over the directions of the investigations and under Section 115 of the Criminal Procedure Code, I believe, a magistrate would direct the investigations. That is the safeguard that our country is used to.

The Hon. Minister himself said that merely extending it from 24 hours to 48 hours is not going to aid the investigation to be completed within 48 hours; nobody expects the investigations to be completed by 48 hours. If that be the case, what is the necessity for a person to be retained in the custody of the police when we have so much of evidence of abuse by the police of persons who are in their custody? The Prevention of Terrorism Act has an exceptional provision to the ordinary law, Section 25 of the Evidence Ordinance, that a confession made to a

89 90

police officer maybe admissible in evidence if it is made to a police officer not below the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police and subject to an inquiry by court if its voluntariness is challenged. That has been pronounced as a draconian provision and we know how that particular provision has actually impeded good investigations. Today, we have people convicted of offences purely on their supposed confession extracted through torture by the police whilst the actual offenders are, at large, roaming the streets. That is what the PTA resulted in. I think this maybe an opportune moment for me to urge the Government to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The Hon. Minister was heard to say that this is only a temporary provision, - Special Provisions - and that it will lapse in another two years. The Prevention of Terrorism Act was brought as a Temporary Provisions Act for a period of six months in 1979. But, for how long has it remained? In 1982, it was amended to remove, "Temporary Provisions" and it was made permanent and it has stayed in our statute books to the detriment of the country, to the detriment of several crimes being properly investigated and, at least, with the knowledge, with the good knowledge, of these facts, I am saddened that the Hon. Minister of Justice and Labour Relations is moving for the extension of this Order.

Talking of investigations, I would also like to raise another important issue today, and that is with regard to the Commission on Missing Persons chaired by Mr. Maxwell Paranagama. Missing persons or enforced disappearances is a scourge and an atrocity that we have committed on each other for quite a long time in this country. This is the most insidious and cruel act. It is also a crime that has not spared any corner of the country. We saw this spectacle in other parts of the country in the late 1980s. We must all, therefore, be united in the pursuit of remedies for those who have disappeared, for we are all witness to the desperation and trauma it has unleashed on all sections of our people.

We are mercifully, only now, beginning to emerge from the shadows of the white-van culture and I appreciate what the Hon. Prime Minister said this afternoon that there is certainly a space that has opened up: people who are complaining about various misdemeanours and misdeeds are not getting threatening calls, white vans are not appearing at their doorstep, and that is to be acknowledged. Still, - the persons who are responsible for having committed - this dastardly act of disappearance of loved ones is continuing. No proper investigation has taken place for the disappearances that have taken place for the last several decades.

It is in this background that this Commission on Missing Persons was appointed and I wish to categorically state that this Commission, the Paranagama Commission, has been a farce. I have been to the hearings of this Commission at least twice and I have raised some issues. The Government, and particularly the Foreign

Minister are well aware of this because we have heard the Hon. Foreign Minister speak about this when he was on this side of the House. This Commission has received nearly 20,000 complaints, but there is a great selectivity in the way that witnesses are called to give evidence here. I have seen personally, the moment a witness comes close to identifying the perpetrator in her evidence, immediately, the Commission intervenes and stops that evidence and starts asking about whether they have received some chicken or some goats for their livelihood, and invariably the mothers of the disappeared scream and say, "I do not want a goat, I want my son back because I handed over my son to the security forces. I am an eye witness to this. I, myself, handed the person over. I do not want your chickens, I do not want your goats". That is the pain that they suffer and this Commission has done more to inflict pain on them than it has done to ease it. This is one of those issues.

Now, there is another aspect to this. There was an expansion of mandate given to this Commission, an eminent group of advisers or they were so-called, appointed to advise this Commission. Sir Desmond de Silva was the Chairman of this Panel, of these advisers. This House will note, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, that the expanded mandate of inquiry that Sir Desmond was to advise included the question of whether such loss of civilian life - loss of life during the final stages of the war - is capable of constituting collateral damage of a kind that occurs in the prosecution of proportionate attacks against targeted military objectives in armed conflicts and is expressly recognized under the laws of armed conflict and international humanitarian law, and whether such civilian casualties were either the deliberate or unintended consequences of the rules of engagement during the said armed conflict in Sri Lanka.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I state with responsibility that Sir Desmond de Silva was previously retained by the then Government of Sri Lanka to provide it with an opinion with respect to the legality of the conduct of the Government forces during the last stages of the war. On 23rd February, 2014, five months before he was appointed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to chair the Advisory Council to the Commission, he provided his client - the Government - with a legal opinion stating: Based on my instructions, my analysis of the relevant law, from the factual matrix made available to me and other research, my opinion is that great mass of civilian deaths which occurred in the final stage of the conflict were regrettable, but permissible collateral damage.

Sir, this is the most serious matter. What this means is that when Sir Desmond de Silva was appointed as Chair of the Advisory Council to the Commission of Inquiry - a Commission under our law is supposed to function independently and impartially - Sir Desmond de Silva had already come to a conclusion on, at least, some of the questions the Commission he was asked to advise, was

91 92

[ .. ]

2015 17

mandated to investigate and had communicated this position to the Government of Sri Lanka. In other words, the Government appointed a person who it already knew, had formed an opinion on the question to be investigated by the Commission, to advise that Commission. What then, is the independence of this Commission? In fact, the framing of the expanded mandate of the Commission suggests that the questions may have even been drafted, based on the opinion provided by Sir Desmond de Silva. This is the most perversion of justice and I demand that the new Government immediately constitute an investigation into the conduct of Sir Desmond de Silva and the previous Government, in conspiring to undermine the independence of the Commission of Inquiry. I also demand that His Excellency the President immediately rescind Sir Desmond de Silvas appointment to the Advisory Council as a matter of urgency in order to secure the Rule of Law and Good Governance. But, that is not the end of the matter.

Sir Desmond de Silva was clearly retained by the Government prior to his providing the Government with the opinion on 23rd February, 2014. There was, therefore, an attorney-client relationship between Sir Desmond de Silva and the Government on questions of liability pertaining to loss of civilian life during the last stages of the war. It was in the context of this prevailing relationship that Sir Desmond de Silva was appointed to chair an Advisory Council to a supposedly independent Commission that would inquire into the guilt or otherwise of the Members of the Government - his client. This is a clear case of blatant conflict of interest and on this count too, I demand that the new Government of Sri Lanka, not only immediately rescind Sir Desmond de Silvas appointment but also forward a complaint to the Bar Standards Board of the United Kingdom against Sir Desmond de Silvas patent professional misconduct. I also urge other interested parties to do the same. This behaviour must not be tolerated by this country or by the Bar of which Sir Desmond de Silva is a Member. What then of the Commission of Inquiry that has been stripped of any independence in this way? I do not understand why the Government continues to let this Commission of Inquiry to function.

I propose that the existing Commission be discontinued for it is too flawed for any good to come of it. Instead, I propose that a fresh investigation with real investigative powers be constituted to actively seek out the fate of the disappeared. The complaints and proceedings of the Paranagama Commission can be used by this new investigation, if necessary. That body should have the power to search, seize and even detain, if necessary. They should be mandated with bringing victims, sons and fathers, back.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, this is a very serious issue with regard to inquiries. This Government, in the latter part of February, has given a written undertaking to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights that it will set up a local mechanism with

technical assistance and advice from the OHCHR. But, in fact, what it has done is that without discontinuing with this flawed Commission, has allowed this Commission to continue and that is the reason why when this Commission had sittings in Trincomalee, first time after this new Government came into being, there was widespread protest. The protest was not about inquiring into the fate of the disappeared, but it was about the Paranagama Commission and how flawed that was and despite this Governments own undertaking that this would be rectified and a new mechanism put in place with international supervision and assistance, this flawed Commission was allowed to continue with the so-called experts in international law, the Chairman of whose panel, Sir Desmond de Silva, became most unsuitable to function in that post due to his attorney-client relationship with the Government of Sri Lanka five months prior to his appointment to this Advisory Council, in addition to several other flaws that I have explained.

This Commission continuing to function in this way would be blatantly in violation of the undertakings given in writing by this Government to responsible international actors - to the UN Human Rights Council, to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights - and I urge that you put these things right at the beginning itself, because if you start going down this wrong path - it is only the beginning - you too will end up like the Rajapaksa regime and that is not something that we want to see.

You have clearly articulated and very bravely declared - even today, the Hon. Prime Minister made a very bold speech in this House and we welcome that - but, if your words are to translate into actual actions, we would like to see some of these things properly rectified. Please do not go down that same path. You are extending the Order made which was flawed, even according to you, Hon Minister, when you were seated on this side and you are doing that today. I gave you another example of the Paranagama Commission and the Panel of Advisers. I urge that you do not continue with that utterly-flawed system, the system that was an eyewash to the world. Rather, I most respectfully urge you: be transparent, be sincere, face the truth, because that is the only way in which we can all together retrieve this country from the mess that it has got into.

Thank you very much. [.. 3.42]

[4.27 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today, the Hon. Minister of Justice has brought in an Order under the Criminal Procedure Code to detain people for more than 24 hours in a police station. I have always been against this right from the beginning. In 2002, the then UNP Government brought this Bill before Parliament and it was discussed at the Consultative Committee. The then Minister of Justice, the Hon. W.J.M. Lokubandara permitted us to criticise this Bill. I made representations: I said so much of power in the hands of the police is a danger to the public, the law-abiding public, because any person when arrested by the police can be accused of any grave crime even without evidence and that can be used to hold the person for 48 hours in a police station. We have known that the police in this country, up to date, are not a disciplined force, not a properly trained force and they have acted arbitrarily against citizens without proper reasons. Several deaths have taken place in police cells. Even recently, such deaths have taken place. People who were taken out in search of evidence have been shot, killed, and no questions asked. People who were taken in handcuffs are said to have jumped into rivers to escape and they had got drowned. All these things are happening under the hands of the police. So, to give more powers to the police is totally unreasonable and unwarranted.

At that time, the Minister of Justice, Hon. Lokubandara withdrew the Bill and it never came up again during the UNP regime of 2001- 2004. Subsequently, under the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government, this Bill was brought and we all know that last time when it came up here - [Interruption.] No, it came after 2006, and when it was brought last time we took a technical objection because the Bill had lapsed and the Regulations were brought here without the Bill being valid. So, the then Minister of Justice had to bring it as another Bill and the Regulations. We did oppose it; we voted against it. It is unfortunate that our Government has brought this up today. I raised this issue this morning

111 112

[ ]

2015 17

at the Government Group Meeting. The Hon. Prime Minister has given an assurance that this is an interim measure; this has been in the statute for some time now and the police are insisting on having this and this would be the last time that this extension of two years is coming up in this House and that within a year, a Committee of Members of Parliament would sit and decide on what nature of legislation is necessary for police to conduct inquiries on grave crimes.

There were suggestions that within 24 hours the accused be produced before a court so that the court is sure that the person who has been taken into custody has not been tortured, assaulted or harassed in any manner and then give 24 hours more for carrying on investigations further. That may have been a good thing. But, today we are not amending the law, we are only bringing in an Order to extend the law for a further period of two years. So, it is not possible to move that amendment or anything today. This will be the last time, the Prime Minister has assured, that this would be coming up before this House, so we have to debate this. It is very unfortunate, but it has become necessary, I am told. But, even now, I regret that the Government, in which I am a backbencher is bringing this up in Parliament today.

Why do I call the police "irresponsible"? We have seen certain incidents. I just like to quote two incidents in this House. On 31st January, 2015, a youth in Talawakele was chased by the police and he had got so scared of the police that he jumped into the Upper-Kotmale Reservoir in Talawakele and he died. I wrote a letter to the Hon. John Amaratunga. I said that this incident seemed like the boy was chased for some reason. We still do not know what the reason is. Even in the reply given by the IGP, the reason for that boy being investigated into was not given. However, that boy had jumped into the reservoir.

This was similar to an incident that took place in the Bambalapitiya beach, where a youth who was mentally retarted was chased by two policemen into the sea, to an extent that he could not stand on the sand but got drowned. Knowing very well that he was getting drowned, nobody attempted to save him; they let him die. So, those policemen were irresponsible. If they wanted to take him into custody, they should have found a way to take him into custody alive.

Similarly, in Talawakele, when that boy was being chased, to escape from the police he jumped into the reservoir. The IGP appointed the Senior DIG of the Central Province to inquire into that and he says that the report revealed that the deceased Marimuttu Manoj had committed suicide having jumped into the reservoir on seeing the police officers approaching him. How can you believe that a young boy will commit suicide seeing the police approaching him? There has to be a cause for suicide. Unless you are in distress, you do not jump into a

river to commit suicide. But, the Police Chief, N.K. Illangakoon stated that the Senior DIG, Central Province, had reported that he jumped into the river and committed suicide when policemen were just approaching him. How unbelievable it is! How can a boy in fear feel that it is more dangerous to get caught to the police than to jump into the river and commit suicide? So, who forced that suicide? It is the policeman who did this. So, the investigations revealed nothing. They said this boy committed suicide. He goes on to say, During the course of the postmortem, the Judicial Medical Officer had confirmed that the death occurred due to drowning. We know he jumped into the water. There is nothing to find out that he got drowned and the IGP shamelessly writes a letter as a reply saying that this boy was drowned. The cause of committing suicide or the cause for drowning is nothing but the police, and the police should be accused of having killed this boy due to excessive violence or excessive threats or putting him under duress. These policemen go off scot-free today. So, what is the message the police is getting? The police will think that even if they kill somebody, nothing will happen.

This happened during Mahinda Rajapaksas time. When criminals were arrested, they said that while they were in handcuffs, when they went in search of further evidence, they tried to throw grenades at the police or they attempted to escape by jumping across a river in handcuffs and they died, knowing very well that they cannot swim with handcuffs on. No investigations were done. Nobody was accused of having killed those criminals even if they were criminals. Even criminals are entitled to protection of the law. They have to be prosecuted, proved guilty to be given a sentence. But, you killed people who are accused of crimes without any reason and the police got away with it very easily. It happened during Mahindas time. I hope it does not happen during Maithripalas time or under the rule of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe as the Prime Minister of this country. I am disappointed; I want to state it very openly in this House.

Similarly, there was another incident in Ratnapura. Hon. John Senewiratne, you must be aware of this. There was a woman who had been assaulted in public by a policeman with a stick. It was captured by somebody on a mobile phone and it went viral on the web. Everybody saw it. Until it came on the web nobody knew about it. The people of Ratnapura who saw this happening never reported it, except for one person who recorded it on his phone and sent it viral. The services of the policeman was suspended for a while; inquiries were held and he was reinstated. In the letter to the Minister, Hon. John Amaratunga, I mentioned the case of the policeman who assaulted a woman in public, that went viral on the internet must also be reviewed since violence against women cannot be just condoned, especially by a policeman, and that too, in public. As this policeman was reinstated, I asked this question, in front of the Minister,

113 114

Hon. John Amaratunga, from the IGP when he came to receive this letter that I wrote regarding the Talawakele incident.

On the day I went to meet the Minister, the IGP was coming there and he asked me to stay and explain. The IGP told me that this woman was a woman of bad character. A woman being of bad character alone is no reason for a policeman to assault her in public. In a country which we abhor violence against women, this type of thing being done by a policeman and his being totally found not guilty and reinstated, is totally unfair. The reason given by the IGP is that there were reasons and there was cause for the policeman to act in this manner. I asked him, what is the cause and he said that within three days he will send me a report as to why this woman was assaulted in that manner and why it could be justified for reinstating the policeman. Up to date, I have not received a report from the IGP.

I have interacted with Mr. Ilangakone when he was the senior DIG in Colombo. I found him to be a good gentleman; he upheld the law; he was very honest; he also went into certain crimes, where he found the perpetrators and brought them to book. One of them was a Rs. 200 million robbery at Lalitha Jewellers in Duplication Road. He found the robbers and he also recovered the jewellery. Such a fine policeman! As the IGP under the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, I feel he has thought that it is more important to defend the policemen and the regime rather than bring people who act wrongly to the book, including his own police officers who err knowingly because they know that the IGP will protect them and they can get away with any crime.

I wish to use this opportunity to speak about an issue the Hon. Sumanthiran raised regarding the Commission on Missing Persons. This Commission does not have the confidence of the Tamil people. So, carrying on this Commission, as the Hon. Sumanthiran mentioned, is irrelevant to the good governance that the UNP has promised.

The Hon.Mangala Samaraweera went to the UN Human Rights Council and convinced the Council not to release the Report of the Committee appointed by the UNHRC until September, because we, ourselves, were going to set up an independent commission to inquire into the issues that were raised by the UNHRC. But, we are continuing with this so-called Paranagama Commission, which should be wound up.

Talking about Commissions appointed by Mahinda Rajapaksa, I would like to state that a Delimitation Commission was appointed to demarcate wards for Local Government Elections. There was a Chairman appointed to that Commission. This Chairman was a guest at the

opening ceremony of the SLFP election office for Mahinda Rajapaksa. He had been appointed as the Chairman of a Delimitation Commission to decide on electoral wards for Local Government Authorities. If he was a man who had a political background, if he was a supporter of the Government, he should never have been appointed. So, the commissions appointed by the Government earlier are commissions which had no credibility. So I feel it was unreasonable.

Similarly, the electoral reforms proposed and are in public today are electoral reforms that will eliminate not only minorities from this Parliament but also all small parties will be eliminated. We have to be vigilant. It maybe advantageous for the present Opposition to go for elections after one year, but do not make this an issue for changing the electoral system in a hurry and denying democracy to the people of Indian-origin, who were denied of it once in 1948 and restored only in 1988.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) After the Nineteenth Amendment, - ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Are you asking me about the Nineteenth Amendment? The Nineteenth Amendment -

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) What I am saying is, after the Nineteenth Amendment, the police will have a greater degree of independence.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) True. Very good. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Now, I must tell you about that also. You were talking about the Seventeenth Amendment. It was voted by all of us, you and I, in Parliament and that Bill was drafted hastily. There were a lot of shortcomings and loopholes in that. You know, there was a time when the minority parties in the Opposition could not agree on their representative; that is, the JVP and the TNA could not agree on that.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Chief Opposition Whip, your time is over.

119 120

[ ... ]

2015 17

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) So, what happened was, they could not nominate a member for the Constitutional Council. As a result, the Constitutional Council could not sit for one and a half years. That was a fault made in drafting the Bill because there was no alternative for that; there was no solution to such a situation.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Member, we also agree that there were a lot of shortcomings in the Seventeenth Amendment. But, do you think that the abolition of the independent Commissions was the answer or it should have been rectified?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) That should definitely have been rectified. I think such situations should not exist.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I am sorry, Hon. Chief Opposition Whip, your time is over.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) So, those have to be rectified. I think we would be able to do that.

In any case, we have agreed to support the Nineteenth Amendment. The establishment of the Commissions is welcome and we will support it. So, I hope that at least after that Amendment, this type of transfers would not take place. When the earlier Police Commission was functioning and when complaints were made by police officers, it took a very long time to resolve their matters and grant relief. That was also a complaint prevalent at the time when the Police Commission was in existence. But, I hope that that type of complaints would not be there after the establishment of those Commissions this time.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Also, you were talking about changing the electoral system.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I am sorry, your time is over.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne) Sir, kindly give me one more minute.

It is true and I agree with you that the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena was appointed as the Chairman of the Select Committee on the electoral system during the UNP Government. In fact, I got it clarified and I was told that it was the UNP Government which appointed that Commission. I am sorry, I was mistaken about that; I was thinking about the appointment of the Hon. Mangala Moonesinghe.

By that Select Committee, there were some recommendations made. I agree with you that our Government failed to implement those. In fact, that request was made to our Government. It is unfortunate that the high-up of the Government did not implement the recommendations of the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena's Committee. So, we are demanding that it be implemented at least now, because if we do not implement it at this juncture, we might never get the opportunity to implement it again. That is the reason why we are insisting that it be coupled with the other amendments to the Constitution and then be implemented. Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Chandrasiri Gajadeera. Before he starts, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. R. Yogarajan to take the Chair?
