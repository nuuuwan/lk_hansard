( ) (The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane) , . , , . ? . An article titled Research house gives gloomy outlook for economy in 2016 published in the Daily Mirror of 14.12.2015 states, I quote: Economy to slow down to 5.9% Budget deficit to reach 8% of GDP Interest rates to rise over 200bp Inflation to reach above 7% Rupee to collapse to 154/US $

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) ? ( ) (The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane) - ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, asking his first Supplementary Question, the Hon. Member quoted from an article in the

Daily Mirror, which refers not to an IMF report, but apparently to a report from somewhere else. It basically tries to show the economy as gloomy, but we must say that there is no such thing at all. The balance of payments is strong.

The world economy is experiencing a turbulence because both China and India have devalued their currency and I am informed that China is looking at devaluing it again owing to the fact that the Yuan is going to come under the Basket of Currencies. So, we do not know, as a result, what the external turbulences would be. But, as of this moment, we are not dictated by IMF policies. We will pursue what the Government of Sri Lanka deemed fit or thinks best for the citizens of our country.

So, at this moment, the particular devaluation process has nothing to do with dictates of the IMF, because we have not taken a single cent from them. The only important thing is, we have to be realistic about the external threats: threats by the ISIS and so on. We are very conscious of these facts and we will ensure that everything is looked after. You could see that there is an inflow of Dollars after the Budget as we wanted foreign remittances to come in. We are encouraging them to bring their deposits into our country, on which we entertain about a 2 per cent return and we see a positive trend taking place. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Speaker) .

Sir, with the limited time available, let me now come onto the Chronic Kidney Disease. The Chronic Kidney Disease has become a major health problem in rural Sri Lanka. Previously confined to the North-Central and Uva Provinces, it is now prevalent even in the North-Western, Northern, Eastern and the Central Provinces. Many of the victims are male farmers and agricultural labourers. A growing numbers of cases, however, are being reported among women and children as well. According to the World Health Organization, more than 15 per cent of the population aged 15 to 70 years in the North-Central and Uva Provinces are affected with Chronic Kidney Disease. Over 22,000 deaths from the disease have been recorded in the Anuradhapura District in the North-Central Province since CKD was first identified in 1991.

I must thank His Excellency the President for chairing a Special Task Force aimed at eradicating this menace and supporting our Ministry as well as the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine in implementing programmes to combat this serious disease, which we have got to quickly eradicate. Now, we have looked at various remedial measures which include pipeline extensions, supply of treated water to community tanks by bowsers, supply of water through Reverse

2333 2334

Osmosis Plants - RO Plants - and rainwater harvesting. In this regard, we have implemented many projects. I do not want to enumerate all of them today due to the limited time I have.

Sir, during the period 2016 to 2020, a new water supply and sanitation improvement project, which will be undertaken with the help of the World Bank, will be implemented to cover the following areas: Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi Districts in the Northern Province; Nuwara Eliya District in the Central Province; Badulla and Monaragala Districts in the Uva Province and Kegalle and Ratnapura Districts in the Sabaragamuwa Province. This project, after the rehabilitation schemes, will provide safe pipe-borne water to 426,000 people in seven districts, 65,000 households in rural areas, 30,000 households in urban towns, 15,000 households in estates and another 26,000 households.

Sir, I would like to wind up with a small quotation by Margaret Atwood in "The Penelopiad".

Water does not resist. Water flows. When you plunge your hand into it, all you feel is a simple caress. Water is not a solid wall, it will not stop you. But water always goes where it wants to go, and nothing in the end can stand against it. Water is patient. Dripping water wears away a stone.

Remember that, my child. Remember you are half water. If you cant go through an obstacle, go around it. Water does.

Sir, I table* the rest of my speech to be included in Hansard. Thank you, Sir. : :: Rest of the speech tabled:

Sir, it gives great pleasure to speak at today's Committee Stage at the Budget in respect of the Ministry of City Planning and Water Supply.

Sir, as the Minister in charge of City Planning and Water Supply, meaningful steps are being taken by me to fulfill the aspirations of the people very clearly stated in the policy statement of our Government declared to the people by His Excellency the President Maithripala Sirisena and the Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.

Sir, the Ministry of City Planning and Water Supply together with the National Water Supply and Drainage Board and the Department of National Community Water Supply have made progress and meets the sustainable development goals and the millennium development goals with;

* 84.7% and of the population presently having access to safe drinking water

* 86.4 % of the population presently having sanitation facilities

Water Coverage and Sanitation

* 85 % of safe water coverage (45 % pipe-borne water supply)

* 86 % sanitation facilities coverage (84 % on-site sanitation facilities)

Sir, I would now like to inform this august Assembly that there are 95 ongoing projects being implemented countrywide in the provision of water supply and sewerage which would provide about one million of new water connections by the year 2020. The above 95 projects includes 27 large-scale projects, 56 small and medium-scale projects and sewerage projects and community facilitation projects.

There are about 3,500 community based organizations of which 2,219 such organizations have been registered under the Department of Community Water Supply. The Department of Community Water Supply under my Ministry provides a yeomen service very specially to the rural poor on an islandwide basis. It is my intention to further develop their activities to cover a wider area in the ensuing years.

1.92 million pipe-borne water connections have been supplied by operating 331 water supply schemes throughout the country.

It is also scheduled to reduce Non-Revenue Water Supply up to 26% at national level in year 2016.

Sir, may I now list out some of the Special Projects and Programmes.

Chronic Kidney Disease

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a major health problem in rural Sri Lanka. Previously confined to North-Central and Uva Provinces, it is now prevalent in the North-Western, Northern, Eastern, and Central Provinces. Many of the victims are male farmers and agricultural labourers. Growing numbers of cases, however, are being reported among women and children. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 15 per cent of the population aged 15 to 70 years in the North-Central and Uva Provinces are affected with CKD. Over 22,000 deaths from the disease have been recorded in the Anuradhapura district in the North-Central Province since CKD was first identified in 1991.

Remedial Measures

* Pipeline extensions

* Supply of treated water to community tanks by bowsers

* Supply of water through RO Plants

* Rainwater harvesting.

Position up to October 2015

Water Supply and Sanitation Improvement Project (WASSIP)

Sir, during the period 2016 to 2020 water supply and sanitation improvement projects will be implemented to cover the following areas:

Category Description

Large RO Plants 68 Nos.

School RO Plants 165 Nos.

Bowser Supply 618 GNDs

* Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi Districts in the Northern Province

* Nuwara Eliya District in the Central Province

* Badulla and Monaragala Districts in the Uva Province

* Kegalle and Ratnapura Districts in the Sabaragamuwa Province

The above project will provide safe pipe-borne water supply to;

* 426,000 population (110,000 households) in seven districts

* 65,000 household are in rural areas

* 30,000 households are in urban towns

* 15,000 households in estates and

* the 26,000 households will benefit after rehabilitation of schemes

The above projects in respect of sanitation will provide:

* Sanitation programs that will benefit approximately 43,000 families in rural and estates sectors to build individual toilets. Rs.35,000 will be given to each family.

* The project will finance the construction of strategically located septage treatment facilities in each of the project districts and supply of gully bowsers to the Local Authorities who opted to maintain this facility.

This will improve sanitation for people in towns and the environmental conditions in the catchment area of these facilities. Management and disposal of septage thereby leading to decreased environmental pollution.

Sir, Rs.3,000 million for each district has been allocated for water supply and sanitation activities.

There will be about 60,000 population that will be benefitted by getting clean, safe water supply and about 25,000 population benefitted by getting toilet facilities in each district.

Sir, a booklet containing a detailed description of the financial and physical progress for the year 2015 and the Development Programme for the year 2016 published by my Ministry, I understand, is now with every Hon. Member of Parliament right now for easy reference.

Conclusion

Sir, may I take this opportunity to thank His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena, President of Sri Lanka and Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister of Sri Lanka for their progressive leadership and guidance given to the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, Minister of Finance to provide Sri Lanka with a well-balanced Budget for the year 2016.

I also wish to thank the Hon.Speaker, my Hon. State Minister, Hon. (Dr.) Sudharshini Fernandopulle, the Members of Parliament of both Government and the Opposition for patiently listening to my speech and for their words of encouragement to fulfill my responsibilities to the Government and the people of Sri Lanka as their Minister of City Planning and Water Supply.

Sir, last but not the least, may I also take this opportunity to thank the Secretary to my Ministry, Additional Secretaries, Chairman of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, the General Manager of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, all Senior Officers of the Department of National Community Water Supply, Officers of my Ministry, Officers of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board and everyone else who extended their wholehearted support for me to deliver the services required by the people of Sri Lanka.

It is titled Water for Jaffna by D.L.O. Mendis. It covers not only Jaffna, but the entire irrigation network of our country - the entire water resources and the river basins - and how it could serve the entire nation.

Now, as Minister of City Planning and Water Supply, you are connected with Megapolis development. The development of the Megapolis of the Western Province will depend on how we supply water and sanitation to the people. So, both Ministries will have to work together. There is a tremendous demand growing for pipe-borne water in the Western Province, which has not been fully met and which has been planned for, but is being delayed.

One example is - the Hon. Minister is here - the Matugama Water Supply Scheme. It is one of the major schemes which has not been put into operation - [Interruption.] I know what you are trying to say, Hon. Minister. Let me finish first. I know what you are trying to say; you are trying to say, It will be done. The thing is, you have given the award letter, but you have not signed the bank agreement with India. You all have not signed a single bank agreement with India.- [Interruption.] No, Wait. You had the whole of 2015, Hon. Minister. You all are accusing us of signing agreements with China. But, you all have not signed the bank agreement on one of the major schemes for that Megapolis, which is the Matugama Water Supply Scheme.

The second one is, the Kundasale Water Supply Scheme. You all have not completed the bank agreement. And you come and say, It will be delivered. The Hon. Prime Minister is also here. I hope he will take up this matter. I remember mentioning this to the Hon. Prime Minister to be take up when Prime Minister Narendra Modi came here so that these two projects will move on with the Indian credit that was agreed upon.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) ! ( ) (The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam) Sir, there is no proper interpretation. The Hon. Minister is unable to understand what I am saying. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) . Hon. Member, can you say it in English? ( ) (The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam) Okay. Hon. Minister, I have been speaking about 36,000 houses that have already been built in the estates. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) By whom? ( ) (The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam) By the Government, through the NHDA.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Is it thirty-six thousand houses? ( ) (The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam) Yes, 36,000 houses. During the last regime, we were able to hand over the deeds to the estate workers, but unfortunately it was stopped due to the election campaign. However, Hon. Minister, I hope you will do it. The deeds need to be given to them because the money has already been paid by them to the NHDA. All dues from the Government have been paid to the Ministry.

200 . 200 200 . For this year, the allocation for the housing in the Estate Sector is Rs. 200 million, by which we will be able to build only 200 houses. If we go at this rate, it will take another century to build all the houses in the plantation sector. Therefore, there must be some special arrangement to put up at least 5,000 houses per year for estate workers.

We were able to talk to the Indian Government two years ago and we got an allocation to build 400 houses for the estate sector. But unfortunately, for want of deeds it was delayed. When the Indian Prime Minister, Hon. Narendra Modi came to Sri Lanka, we were able to talk to him and we asked him to expedite the matter. He said that he will be able to finish it and in addition, he said that they will be able to give some more houses to the estate sector.

. 1992 ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Member, can I reply to that? ( ) (The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam) Okay. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) I have just inquired from the relevant officials with regard to the handing over of deeds. The National Housing Development Authority is unable to provide the estate community with deeds because the land is owned by the said companies.

( ) (The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam) But they have paid the money. Those lands belong to the LRC. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) But, the NHDA can provide deeds only as long as those lands belong to the NHDA. Can you understand, Hon. Member? It has not been vested. ( ) (The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam) But then you will have to speak to the LRC and get it done. Something has to be done. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Yes, something has to be done. ( ) (The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam) Because they have already paid for the houses. Anyway, I will personally come and meet you. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) I recommend you to meet the Chairman of the NHDA and talk it over. We can solve it. ( ) (The Hon. Muthu Sivalingam) Okay. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Hon. Member, you made certain observations with regard to the Ministry of Housing and Construction. I have proposed that we have a comprehensive meeting with all the Members representing the North and the East in January and we will discuss all these issues with regard to housing and attend to them immediately. So, in the month of January, we will have a comprehensive meeting. And, you should also understand that the issue of housing and resettlement of people in the North and the East is handled by the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, which comes under the purview of the Hon. D.M. Swaminathan. . ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) What I am suggesting is, we want a coordinated programme, not a programme alone by your Ministry or any other Ministry. We all should get together and work under one programme and one plan. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) We should get together and work. That is all right. But the subject of housing has now been subdivided into various Ministries. The Ministry of Disaster Management is handling housing destroyed by disasters, so on and so forth. . ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Okay. Thank you very much, Hon. Minister.
