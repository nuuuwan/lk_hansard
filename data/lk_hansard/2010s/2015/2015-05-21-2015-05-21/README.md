. , . . . , . . , . ( ) (Mr. Speaker) Yes, Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Hon. Speaker, having read the Report of the Committee, I think it is absolutely essential that this be debated thoroughly in Parliament. It makes some very startling comments and, in fact, suggests the need for much further inquiry and specifically states, "... there is no impediment for the Government and or Parliament and or any Organization with public interest to engage in necessary mechanism in establishing the loss to the Government ...". I do not think it is an adequate Report but, at least, it has not attempted a complete whitewash. Given its recommendations, I would have thought that any responsible Government anxious to oppose corruption as this Government claims it is, would have immediately instituted the investigations that are recommended even by their own Report. So, I find it absolutely sad that so much time has passed without the necessary action being taken.

As you know, Mr. Speaker, several of us wanted a change and we wanted a change so that the victories of 2009 would be strengthened but, in a pluralistic fashion that there would be less authoritarianism; that there would be less corruption but that development would continue. And, as you can see from the Manifesto of His Excellency the President, there are many pledges which remain to be fulfilled.

Sir, I do not know whether "Hiru TV" cited the Hon. Prime Minister wrong but it seemed to indicate that he

said, "We no longer have a programme; there should not be a Government; it is time for an election". That may have been a mistake and I think there is a lot of work to be done. Unfortunately, the strengthening of the victory of 2009 and the development seems to have stopped; the corruption and the authoritarianism are continuing but in a much more sophisticated fashion that was started by the first Executive President of this country. I am afraid that tradition is something that we must stop. The way to stop it is through strengthening Parliament .

I listened with interest to your Ruling yesterday but I also think, Hon. Speaker, that you must take cognizance of the fact that hardly any Committees of Parliament are functioning. I got a schedule yesterday from the Committee Office and despite the pledge in His Excellencys Manifesto to strengthen the committee system, only four meetings of Consultative Committees have been held over the last 125 days. This is appalling. It has never happened in a Sri Lankan Parliament before; the consultation of Members of Parliament has never been treated with such contempt.

I had the sad occasion yesterday of attending the Consultative Committee on Education where, what the officials said about the Bill to be presented today, was completely wrong. The Secretary said that the Bill to abolish the NATE arose because the NATE had been established for teacher education and then the NIE was established, and because they were in opposition to each other, this had to be got rid of. As you know, I have been engaged in education for the last 30 years and I do think there is no collective memory in the Ministry. Let me be complimentary. The Hon. Prime Minister in one successful effort of his political career was a good Minister of Education. - [Interruption.] I am talking. Let me finish, please.

( ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage) . () ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Hon. Speaker, I am talking about the fact that the Consultative Committees had not met. When we met yesterday, we were completely misled. The Hon. Minister had the grace to say that neither he nor his secretary knew anything about the subject. But, if you are the Minister, you must learn about it. You cannot come there and say that you know nothing when a Bill is being presented. If the Consultative Committees are not meeting, Sir, - while I can see the point of your Ruling yesterday, - you must ensure that these Committees meet.

The COPE has not met for four months. So, Hon. Speaker, I think a two-pronged approach is necessary: firstly, an immediate discussion of this absolutely-

161 162

startling document, even though it was not of a Select Committee but a report of UNP lawyers; secondly, on the Motion put forward with regard to the Governor of the Central Bank, the poor man maybe a fall guy for more subtle forces making money but that too should be debated. Please ensure that the committees you have suggested meet immediately and present a report to Parliament, so that it can be debated on the 9th of June.

Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .. . ?

Hon. Speaker, I think the reference made by the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris was in regard to this Report and the Treasury Bond issue, which I said, should be discussed in the House. I think the Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha confused this with the National Authority on Teacher Education (Repeal) Bill that was presented. I have no intention of referring to anything about that Bill, but I must say that only recently the Consultative Committees were appointed and, I did assure this House, that I would summon the Consultative Committee on my Ministry to discuss this Report, in addition to whatever directive the Hon. Speaker has given. Yesterday, he had asked the Committee on Public Enterprises to go into it. Similarly, before referring to the issues that the Hon. Bandula

Gunawardane raised, I would like to say that, as far as this Committee is concerned, the officials have found that the Bank has said that there had been no loss to the Treasury .

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , , . . If you are genuine, please agree at the Supreme Court to pay this saying that this is your repayment plan. So, what we want is for you to ensure that what you say here is put into a legal bond before the Supreme Court without pressurizing the depositors to withdraw the case.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) ? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . , . - [ ] If required, we will give it in writing to the Court accepting that, because Chief Justice K. Sripavan had mentioned, That is a very fair settlement. Please go ahead with it. What was expected was a letter from us. But, the Attorney-General told us to give that letter at the time when consent would be given to withdraw the cases, because previously, 29 cases were to be withdrawn and they later duped; they had told one thing and did another. So, that was the instruction we have been given by the lawyers from the Attorney-Generals Department. - [Interruption.] We have no problem at all. As a matter of fact, after the depositors -

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) What you mentioned here in this House will be a part of the settlement in the Supreme Court. Is it?

175 176

[ ]

2015 21

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Absolutely! It is not necessary even to say it in Parliament. As we said at the Ministry of Finance one week ago, it was legal from then, because our President and the Prime Minister gave us instructions and I am complying with the Government requirement. It was not a fanciful voyage of discovery by me. So, as you quite rightly said, I will even take the recommendation you gave and give it in writing to the Court that this is the repayment plan. Is that okay, Hon. Leader of the Opposition?

[.. 5.28]

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) , :

"In terms of Standing Order 17(2), we give notice of a Motion for the Adjournment of Parliament, for the purpose of an urgent Debate on the Report of the Prime Minister's Panel of three lawyers on the Central Bank Bond issue, submitted to Parliament on Tuesday, 19th May by the Hon. Leader of the House.

We urge that the Debate takes place immediately because of the continuing and aggravating loss to the nation, for the mitigation of which Parliament is under a duty to act in furtherance of its responsibility for public finance under Article 148 of the Constitution.

We would also point out that the Hon. Prime Minister gave the assurance on the Floor of the House that the Report would be fully debated in Parliament, once the Report is submitted."

, . .. . Dr. G. Usvattearachchi, Dr. A.C. Visvalingam and Mr. Chandra Jayaratne . . .. , . . . I shall read it. Sir, the article captioned, "Supreme Court dismisses FR case against Treasury Bond fiasco" in the "Daily FT" of 14th May, 2015 states, I quote:

The petitioners though instructed by court to show any illegality or irregularity on the bids by Perpetual or the auction, were unable to point to any violation of the rules or statutes governing the issue of bonds

, " , , ." . . . ? , " 30 - Private Placements- . . , , , . . . .

30 . It further states, I quote:

However, it was submitted by the counsel for Perpetual, with facts and figures obtained from the Central Bank, that out of the six 30-year bond auctions, this particular bond auction came at the lowest cost to the Government, ...

. . , " 30 ." . . , . .

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) What are you reading from?

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) This is the judgment. This is what I say. . This is part of the judgment - [Interruption.] They refused because the petitioners could not prove a single thing they averred in the petition. [Interruption.] Why? The petitioners, Dr. G. Usvattearachchi, Dr. A.C. Visvalingam and Mr. Chandra Jayaratne, were asked to point out any irregularity, they could not; they were asked to point out any illegality, they could not; they were asked to point out a loss, they could not.

So, this is what happened in the Supreme Court. You are doing the same thing that they did. They were making wild allegations and the Supreme Court said, Prove the allegations, but they could not. You read the judgment.
