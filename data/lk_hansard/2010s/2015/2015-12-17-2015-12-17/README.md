I will give you an assurance that we will be coming there in January. I will let you know the exact date, I cannot tell you now. I could not go to only four districts. I have visited other areas and worked out schemes and I will be implementing them. I will come and arrange electric fencing. Hon. Member, you must be knowing that the people in your area cut the electric fence also for fuelwood. Elephants are also very shrewd, smart and they know how to trample the electric fence. We have started planting lime, hana, jute and palmyrah so as to create fences. I took 250,000 palmyrah seeds from the Jaffna GA for that purpose. Also peoples committees have to come up in the area. Villagers must also take over the responsibility. So, we will work it out. I will give you that assurance. ( ) (The Hon. Gnanamuthu Srineshan) Thank you very much for your assurance.

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) Hon. Member, I will be staying in your area - Kumana, Batticaloa and Ampara - on the 29th and 30th because as you know, there is also a cattle problem, not only elephant problem, in those areas. ( ) (The Hon. Gnanamuthu Srineshan) Okay, thank you. We have two problems; elephant problem and the cattle problem. ( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) You can also make suggestions. There are no pastures for elephants in national parks. So, you can tell us genuinely how many cattle you use for dairy purposes. This is the biggest problem. ( ) (The Hon. Gnanamuthu Srineshan) Yes. ( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) There are 35,000 cattle in Maduru Oya area. So, we have to decide on it and take some action. You can tell us your recommendations when I come there on the 29th and 30th. ( ) (The Hon. Gnanamuthu Srineshan) Okay. We will discuss and find a solution.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) You were given five minutes extra. But that time is almost over now. ( ) (The Hon. Gnanamuthu Srineshan) I will take only two more minutes, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Then we will have to reduce that time from one of the Members of the TNA. Go ahead.

Saravanapavan) I read the programmes of the Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs for the Eastern Province: Trincomalee, Batticaloa et cetera. But, I do not see much towards the North. Are there any programmes for the promotion of tourism in the North? ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Now, the present position is, at the moment all the Colombo hotels are full. You cannot get a room. So, the overflow will now come towards Trincomalee.

The second is, we are now targeting the internal air transportation, which is very important in order to attract tourists to those areas. Maybe Trincomalee itself will be developed as another airport in order to get the flights that are bringing in tour groups. So, these are the things that we have to develop. Unfortunately, in the past, no such

consideration was made. But, now it is in the pipeline and I can assure you that your areas will be patronized by more tourists in future than the number of tourists present at this moment. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) From Point Pedro to Dambakolapatuna, where Sangamitta Theri landed, is a tourism area now. But, the roads are blocked. So, you will have to take immediate steps to clear those roads. So that the tourists can go from Nagadeepa to Dambakolapatuna and Point Pedro along the coastline road, which is very beautiful. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Member, I am very thankful to you for having pointed that out. We have to take some meaningful steps in order to provide easy accessibility to those areas. One such thing that we have in mind is to develop the internal air transportation, so that they can travel by air rather than getting blocked half way and wasting their time on the way. What you mentioned is very important and I appreciate your contribution. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Hon. Minister, you have four more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) , . .

Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation) Mr. Deputy Chairman, seven minutes is not enough, because this is the Votes on my Ministry that are being discussed. You should have given me at least 25 minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) There are so many speakers in the list and each has been allotted seven minutes. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Maybe so. But, this is my Ministry. When the Votes of a particular Ministry are being discussed, the Minister concerned has to be given more time. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) There are nine Ministries to be discussed today. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) At least, give me 12 minutes and I will table the rest of my speech, so that it could go into Hansard.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, with the cessation of hostilities in Sri Lanka in 2009, there arose in the minds of all Sri Lankans, great hopes for a lasting peace and national harmony, after issues that had bedeviled this country for a considerable period of time. A golden opportunity has arisen for Sri Lanka to regain its glory that had been recently lost within the country and among the international community and to forge ahead as a fast-growing nation in the world. Though some of the infrastructure built in the war-torn areas has helped material development, however very little has been done in healing the wounds of war or nurturing the minds of the affected civilians who hope for peace and reconciliation. This has been reportedly pointed out by local concerned groups and the international community. Even six years after the conclusion of the war, no serious efforts or activities have been initiated to win the hearts and minds of the Sri Lankan community as a whole.

With the defeat of the LTTE in 2009, the armed conflict came to an end. However, the root causes of the conflict remain and have to be addressed in order to prevent the recurrence of the past in whatever form. Further, the war caused additional negative fallouts such as physical destruction of infrastructure, an amplification of socio-economic deprivation in the war-torn areas of the country. It also led to increased suspicion and resentment amongst the three main ethnic communities in the country and widened the gap in trust and understanding.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, with the January 8th Revolution, there is renewed hope for peace and reconciliation under the leadership of His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe. For example, Rev. Maduluwawe Sobitha Nayake Theros untimely recent

2519 2520

passing away rekindled these hopes. Pope Francis called for reconciliation during the visit to Sri Lanka immediately after the Presidential Election early this year. He referred to the evil conflict that tore open the countrys heart and called on all people in the area to work together for reconciliation, justice and peace. Leaders of all faiths have reaffirmed the need to realize these objectives.

Sir, it is with this urgent need in mind, the present Government created a separate ministry called the "Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation" under the leadership of the President himself. The vision of this Ministry is to build a strong integrated Sri Lankan community whilst respecting and nurturing the several value systems that are unique to various communities such as Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Malay and Burgher and the followers of religions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity.

Sir, the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation is in its formative stage. Studies are underway to kick-start the following key functions:

(1) Promotion of national integration and reconciliation and durable peace in the country;

(2) Formation of a national policy for national integration and reconciliation;

(3) Formulation of programmes and projects for the promotion of reconciliation and for creating national unity by building an inclusive society;

(4) Monitoring and evaluation of relevant programmes and projects being implementation at field level;

(5) Identification of constraints to national integration and taking corrective action based on discussions and consensuses with the relevant stakeholders;

(6) Collaboration with Ministries, Departments and Institutions dealing with matters relating to reconciliation, peace-building resolution of inter-ministerial and departmental issues if any;

(7) Review various strategies that are being implemented, and are due to be implemented with regard to national integration and reconciliation, and intervene in settlement issues.

(8) Intervene where necessary, in matters relating to implementation of recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry on Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation. (9) Advise Government authorities- (a) on required policies and actions for reconciliation and building a lasting peace. (b) on issues that may emerge in the process of peace building and reconciliation and ( c) propose solutions for the issues.

Sir, we recognize that there lies ahead of this nation a series of challenging tasks. Without national integration and reconciliation, this country cannot create a Sri Lankan identity to move forward in the world as a proud nation. We cannot integrate with respecting diversity. But, what is common in the areas of diversity needs to be identified as the foundation for integration, if national integration is to blossom out at its pinnacle. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Hon. Minister, please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Sir, you have given me only a few minutes. How can I speak on my Ministry in a few minutes' time? ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Only seven minutes have been allotted to you. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) It is very unfortunate. This is a very important Ministry and I believe that the TNA will object if no proper response is given to the country. So, please give me another five minutes. Shall I continue my speech? ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) You may table it, Hon. Minister. Only seven minutes have been allotted to each Hon. Member. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Then, I table* the rest of my speech. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) 7 .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie) Ministry. . I am sorry. Anyway, speech table* .

Thank you, Sir. : :: Rest of the speech tabled:

We cannot ask the affected people to think as Sri Lankas without healing their wounds.

2521 2522

[ ... ]

2015 17

We cannot ask people to work towards a Sri Lankan identity when the very same people are denied their basic rights only because of their group identity.

We cannot ask people to rally round the national identity or live as one nation so long as we treat them differently or serious mistrust among communities continues to be propagated in public discourse.

To bring about a positive change, all the communities and ethnic groups must be willing to make sacrifices, give into the common cause, rise above prejudices, and handle transparently issues of discrimination and other grievances. These are some of our challenges.

It is a well-known fact that any policy or process without consultation with the very people who are at the receiving end, will not succeed! Therefore, we need to take every citizen of this country into confidence and initiate the process of policy-making on national integration and reconciliation.

We have identified several groups of stakeholders and we propose to have a wider consultation and identify the impediments to national reconciliation and make recommendations to overcome them.

We will have inputs form religious leaders, war-affected and the displaced, the NGOs and INGOs, the academic community, the business community, professionals, trade unions, security forces, media and independent opinion makers and other concerned parties.

We will analyze the inputs and identify the gaps and impediments in promoting national integration and recommend policies and action plans to the government and relevant Ministries and departments taking also into consideration the recommendations of the LLRC.

Hon. Speaker, our objectives cannot be achieved without the support of the Ministries, departments, institutions and individuals who can make a voice. This is not an easy task. We need not wait until some outsiders come and tell us what is appropriate for us to do. It is our task to bring the people together, it is our duty to heal the wounds of the affected. It is our mandate to create a united Sri Lanka in which every citizen of this country can live in peace with self-respect and dignity.

I want to record here that some will try to sabotage our efforts, putting the nationalistic patriotic cards in front to mislead the people and get petty political mileage, like a pauper scratches his wounds to make a living, we need not to be discouraged. This beautiful island will be really a paradise if we bring peace and harmony among all communities.

My sincere belief is that without addressing the basic issues and problems, reconciliation is impossible, His Excellency the president, I therefore, request our Hon. Ministers, Hon. Leaders of political parties and all Hon. Members of Parliament to support us in resolving this burning issue and strengthen our efforts to promote national integration and reconciliation in the country.

I thank you.

, , . . [2.20 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Angajan Ramanathan) Hon. Presiding Member, with the end of the war, we now have a vast area of land, which was previously not available for tourists and tourism and also have access to the entire Northern and the Eastern coastline and plenty of historical places. In my opinion, the place is ready, but our tourist promotion towards the North is not enough. Therefore, I would like to strongly propose, first, to update our tourism inventory including the North and the East and then identify what we have from places to events, to pageants to beaches and everything else.

Hon. Presiding Member, Jaffna and Killinochchi Districts have faced extreme weather conditions as a result of recent climatic change. Drought and flood conditions were reported. Most of the people in these areas have been adversely affected by floods which has increased in frequency and intensity during the past years. The Disaster Management Centre unit has provided a very good service during the time of need. However, the biggest shortfall that everyone noticed was the lack of emergency response teams available to provide emergency relief.

There have been many reasons for this. There is a shortage of cadre in the DMC at divisional level

throughout the Northern Province. The DMC Committees at village level are informal committees and are unable to be registered. So getting their commitment for emergency relief work seems to be difficult.

The emergency response team of local councils is neither trained nor equipped. Having them trained to coordinate with the DMC staff could be an option to solve the problem. Unlike other provinces, lack of coordination with the armed forces is also a reason.

The Disaster Mitigation Fund of Rs. 120 million was funded continuously for a three-year project and has helped four villages to come out of flood. Drought Mitigation Fund of Rs. 80 million has helped renovate Semmani bund, Naranthanai bund and other projects. I must thank, at this juncture, the Hon. Minister of Disaster Management for encouraging our recovery.

The land in the peninsula is fairly flat. There is a tendency for seawater intrusion into the land in certain areas where the land level is lower than the sea level. Similarly, Navanthurai has been deeply and repeatedly affected by floods and it needs earth filling. Alliyavalai to Iyakatchi evacuation path is one of the important mitigation projects required since we had lost nearly 830 lives during the tsunami for not having an evacuation path and it will be a direct benefit for Killinochchi and Jaffna Districts. So, I hope to bring these crucial projects to the notice of Hon. Minister.

Hon. Presiding Member, decades of political rancour, rhetorical wars and unrest is of past. Now we are entering a new era where Sri Lanka is under one administration from North to South consisting of multiple races, languages and communities co-existing in harmony. Integration of people into the system from past is of vital need now. The role of the Ministry of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages is very crucial and its one of the necessities for us is to further create harmony and reconciliation. I would like to appreciate them for the service they are providing to this nation that has been carrying wounds for decades. We have been speaking about these solutions for decades, but now it is about time that we get more serious and have increased budgetary allocations for these projects. The allocations are not enough when they are divided by the number of public servants to be trained. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. ( ) (The Hon. Angajan Ramanathan) Hon. Presiding Member, please give me two more minutes.

2587 2588

As to the Key Performance Indicators of these projects, quantity of the programmes conducted cannot measure the quality of the output. KPI should not and cannot be the number of programmes conducted, but outcome of the training. A measure of the effectiveness of the solution is needed to monitor progress. I believe the objective is for not everyone to speak Tamil and Sinhalese but to enable the citizens to get their daily necessities done in their comfortable language. We are a country where multiple races live next to each other. An ideal situation for government institutions from any part of the country that are facing general public would be having at least one multi- lingual officer or a counter to handle concerns and issues of people speaking languages other than that of that region. However, as English is becoming a global language and since it is important for us as our bridging language, an increased significance should be given to it in the future.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Mohamed Navavi. You have seven minutes.

[3.42p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity to speak a few words regarding tourism. In the Kalpitiya Peninsula of my Electorate, a lot of tourist hotels have come up and are almost full every day. The middle-class tourists are coming to our area. We must thank the Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife, for helping us to open an entrance to Wilpattu from our area. In addition to this project, he is also organizing boat services from Kalpitiya to Wilpattu. Apart from that, we were able to get the Hon. Nimal Siripala De Silva, Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to reopen the Palavi Airport. So, we are doing all these things to develop tourism in this area.

Unfortunately, there are some shortcomings too. The roadways to these hotels as well as the electricity supply are inadequate. The Kalpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha, which is one of the largest pradeshiya sabhas in the country, cannot afford to provide all these facilities. Therefore, we have been requesting the authorities to repair these roads and supply adequate electricity to the hotels so that the facilities in tourist hotels can be increased and we can bring in more income to our country. But, so far, we have not been successful. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs - he is not here, but the official are there in the Officials' Box - to consider developing these areas more so that these tourist hotels will have adequate electricity in the night. After doing that, I think more and more hotels will come up.

In fact, next week the Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera and I are going to visit the Kalpitiya islands. He is very much interested - he is also from Wayamba and this area too comes under Wayamba - in improving the standards of these hotels and the facilities in the area so that more and more tourists can come.

2611 2612

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) Not only Wayamba, I will be developing the other areas also. When you say that the others might think that- ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) But, you are a leader from Wayamba. So, it comes first.

Sir, we will have to improve the standard of the hotels in that area. When we talk about tourism, we always talk about the South. But there are also areas, as pointed out, in the North-Western Province to be improved as tourist attractions. We can do that. Therefore, I request the Hon. Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs to help us.

Then, I must tell the Hon. Minister of Disaster Management that just two or three weeks back, we had one of the worst floods in our area. I think for the last 25 to 30 years, we have never had floods like that. My area, from Kalpitiya to Udappuwa, was completely under water. As you are aware, people were stranded and more than 10,000 acres of cultivation went under water. We thank you for the action you took in providing backhoes to clear that area. But, very unfortunately, Hon. Minister, the houses in that area - I visited the area and I can show you pictures - were almost 2 to 3 feet under water. People were living amidst difficulties for several days. So, my request to the GA and the AGAs was to provide these people with dry rations for a few days. Unfortunately, that was not done. But, I thank you as you were able to send the allocations straightaway within 24 hours and we were able to get backhoes to clear the area. All the Grama Sevakas, officials, AGAs were very helpful to the people during their difficult times. So, I request you to consider giving these people dry rations, even though it is too late, to carry on their living.

We must thank the Hon. Minister of Post, Postal Services and Muslim Affairs also. Regarding the Hajj pilgrimage, we were having a lot of problems in the last four to five years. In fact, even the Minister was taken to court four - five years ago. But, after the Hon. Abdul Haleem took over the Ministry of Muslim Affairs this year, we performed the Hajj pilgrimage without any problem. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Sir, please, give me two more minutes.

So, we must thank him and the officials for doing this good job of work. I hope that they would continue this in the future also.

Sir, I am actually very hurt about the statement made by the Venerable Gnanasara Thero regarding our Holy Quran. I must tell you that this same thero had created enough problems in the country in the past four - five years. But, after the Presidential Election, during this year, there were no such problems. But, very unfortunately, he has started creating problems again. This is a peaceful country. We, from all religions, are living together; we have had no problem whatsoever among the religions. We, the Muslims, as much as we respect our religion, we respect all the other religions more. So, please, keep that in mind. I request the Hon. Minister to have a discussion with His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister and see that this is put to an end because things like this only created problems last year. Please see that this is not carried on. This must be stopped straightaway because we want to live peacefully. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Sir, please give me just two more minutes.

I can remember that the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen took steps to initiate a Technical Training Centre in the Puttalam Electorate. Look at the number of youth going abroad for foreign employment from that area. Most of them go abroad as minor employees like drivers, hospital cleaners and so on. If all those educated youth can be given technical training, in future they will definitely be able to go for higher jobs and earn more. Construction work of that Technical Training Centre was started some time back and I request the Minister, the Hon. Palitha Range Bandara, though he is not here, to expedite that work, so that our youth can go abroad with higher qualifications to earn more.

Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Muhammad Ibrahim Muhammad Mansoor) Sir, the Hon. Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera is here. I think he would take steps to prevent the elephants from entering the paddy fields. The farmers have already taken a decision not to cultivate the paddy fields because of the destruction caused by elephants. So, in order to prevent it - ( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) Hon. Member, please give me 30 seconds. Today, we have announced a compensation scheme which would cover all the crops. For example, if you have cultivated one acre of paddy, maize or whatever other crop and if the agrarian officers report that so much of damage has been done by the elephants to, say, a quarter of an acre, we would pay compensation. This is a new scheme that my Ministry has worked out. So, they will receive compensation. Even the destroyed houses, the Hon. Sajith Premadasa will take steps to put up again. Today, I am going to announce this new scheme, a scheme where the Hon. Minister of Disaster Management and we are going to work jointly. ( ) (The Hon. Muhammad Ibrahim Muhammad Mansoor) Thank you very much, Hon. Minister. I do not think the compensation scheme that is going to be implemented by your Ministry would be sufficient - [Interruption.]

Sir, 193 countries adopted the Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable development". It includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals with 169 associated targets. They have to be achieved by my Ministry also. So, this is a target. I am telling all of you that I will achieve that target. I will work with my colleagues and give the result. I have given the results earlier too. So, it is a humble way of doing that. A professional team will be there in the operational room. There will also be a Sustainable Development Council comprising all the relevant Ministries, like the Ministry of Tourism Development and so on. That Council will be monitoring, evaluating and issuing guidelines relating to sustainable development. I am happy to say that I will give the start. I must thank His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister for supporting this task. This Government comprises all the political parties. We will create a middle-class society in this country. We will see that, through tourism, more foreign exchange comes into the country. We will see that development helps to alleviate poverty. Even in the Brundtland Report poverty alleviation is mentioned. It was President Premadasa who started the poverty alleviation programme. His Programme was taken as a model by the world. We are proud to say that. I noticed that alleviation of poverty was the main item in President Premadasa's vision. So, as a country, we will do it together.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . 12 .
