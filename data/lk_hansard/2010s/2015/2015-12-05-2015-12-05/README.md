I know, Mr. Chairman, that you are also very keen on this subject. So, please give me two more minutes to wind up.

We have to educate our children about the health sector - nursing, patient care et cetera - the hospitality industry, the IT industry including software development and also other related fields where there are a lot of job opportunities. For that, we need to develop a knowledge-based economy in this country. To develop that, we will have to understand where we stand today. The world accepted indicator for that is the Knowledge Economy Index. So, our Government has done our bit and because of that, Sri Lanka has been placed at the 65th position out of 145 countries in the Knowledge Economy Index. What is important here is to consider, without any political bias, the parameters that they have taken into consideration. That is: firstly the universal access to education which includes primary and secondary education; secondly the computer literacy; thirdly the

517 518

research and innovation and fourthly the use of such innovations and new products to develop our economy. We have done our bit in this regard. We have provided primary and secondary education to 98 per cent children in the country; computer literacy has gone up to about 35 per cent during the last ten years. It is the duty of the current Government to ensure that more Sri Lankan students will get computer literacy. At least it has to be increased up to about 95 per cent by 2020.

The Minister of Finance mentioned in his speech that the Government is going to initiate Wi-Fi zones in all the universities. I commend that. Also they have initiated Wi-Fi zones in some of the urban areas. We highly appreciate that. But, what we lack in this country is the research side. Therefore, I suggest the Hon. Minister to have an education and research institute affiliated to the Ministry of Education so that they can do their homework. Then, they can go ahead and stimulate students at the school level to ensure that students also get into the research sector. If we do our researches and if we encourage students at the school-level to innovate, to do researches in order to develop products, we will be able to produce such things for the Sri Lankan market. Then, we should be able to expand our economy and we will be able to increase our Gross Domestic Product so that we can develop our economy. I hope the Hon. Minister, as a young Minister, has the political courage and the will to do that. I wish him all the best!

I thank you, Hon. Chairman.

It is not just the tangibles, but the intangibles that we must measure particularly in education and in the teaching profession. What contribution the teacher makes cannot be measured only by the pass marks or the grades that the students get, but by the behaviour of the students.

It is attitudes that matter. They say that without attitudes you cannot think about altitude and therefore, attitudes matters. When we are talking about education, moulding the attitudes of the younger generation is critical.

[6.35 p.m.] ... ( ( ... - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation) Hon. Chairman, I thank you for the opportunity given to me to say a few words on the Votes of the Ministry of Education.

I am happy that this most important Ministry is given to a young and dynamic Minister, Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, who has already shown efficiency in building up a vibrant and educated community of men and women who will be able to build a strong and united country as envisaged by the "Yaha palanaya".

Education takes a very important place in Islam. The Holy Prophet enjoined his followers to seek knowledge even from China, a distance country far away from the Arab World. Although our community lagged behind other communities in acquiring knowledge, credit goes to great men like M.C. Siddi Lebbe, Egyptian exile Orabi Pasha, Wapche Marikkar, I.L.M. Abdul Azeez, Dr. T. B. Jayah, Sir Mohamed Macan Markar, Sir Razik Fareed, Dr. Badi-ud-din Mahmud and several others of that calibre for the inspiring leadership provided by them.

Today Sir, the Muslims have begun to give serious attention to provide a good education for their children. There are good schools right round the country. I should mention that as a Parliamentarian representing the people of the Colombo District for the last 22 years, it gives me concern to mention many shortcomings prevailing in Muslim Schools in the city of Colombo. Schools in Colombo today show a sharp decline in the provision of educational facilities while the rural areas show a sharp development in education. Schools in the capital city did not receive proper attention by the governments in the past.

There are 32 Muslim schools in Colombo, which need immediate attention of the Minister of Education in order to upgrade facilities. The buildings are in a dilapidated condition and the shortage of teachers, facilities for Science and Technological streams are most wanting.

In this connection, I should refer to some of the good-hearted individuals who have come forward to generously contribute funds for the construction of school buildings and providing other facilities. For instance, I must make special reference in the House to the munificence shown by Alhaj Z.A.M. Refai, Chairman of Zam Gems, a well-known philanthropist, for donating Rs.100 million to put up new buildings at Fathima Muslim Balika Vidyalaya and Khairiya Muslim Girls' School. He is also generously donating funds for the improvement of schools in the

Kalutara District and in many other areas throughout the country. His act of charity could be well-followed by the rest of the business community, not only the Muslim schools, even the Sinhalese and Tamil Schools could benefit in the future.

One of the oldest schools in Colombo is Hameed -Al-Husseinie Muslim Maha Vidyalaya in the Hulftsdorp area. I have been able to provide much aid and assistance to this educational institution, but a lot more has to be done to improve the quality of education in all spheres.

I welcome the move made by the Minister to restrict 35 students to a classroom with a view to providing quality education to all students. But I must stress that this programme is too early to be introduced. It should be done only after putting up adequate school buildings to achieve this goal.

Another aspect that should receive attention of the Minister of Education is the shortage of Moulavi teachers in Government schools in both Tamil and Sinhala media. Religious education is suffering in the absence of Moulavi teachers. The All Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference and other educational bodies have been consistently making appeals to the Ministry of Education over the years for the appointment of Moulavi teachers. I hope that the Minister will allocate necessary funds for the recruitment of these religious teachers at least this time.

I am happy about the present progress made by Zahira College, Colombo known as the "Radiating Centre of Islamic Culture and Thought" in providing better education for the children. I must make particular reference here to the address delivered by His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena as the Chief Guest at the recent prize giving day celebration of the College. It was an inspiring speech well-received by teachers, students and parents. The President also promised to grant permission to put up a Primary Zahira on the land donated by the great philanthropist Alhaj N.D.H. Abdul Caffoor at Maharagama, abutting the Gafooriya Arabic College. It was received with much acclaim when the President, with the consent of the Minister, declared that a Technological Centre will also be given to Zahira College.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Thank you very much, Hon. Minister. The next speaker is the Hon. Imran Maharoof. You have seven minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) You go ahead. I will sort it out. [7.09 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Sir, I am really happy that a young and energetic Hon. Member from Wayamba has been appointed as the Minister of Education. I am sure the future of education is in safe hands.

Since I am short of time, I have to cut down my speech. Hon. Minister, in the Puttalam Education Zone there is a shortage of about 2,100 teachers - 844 in Tamil the medium and 1,219 in the Sinhala medium. For the last ten years had they appointed at least 300 - 500 teachers per year, I do not think we would have faced this problem. But, very unfortunately, the students in my area -

( ) (The Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam) We are going to recruit more teachers.

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Thank you, Hon. Minister.

Also in recruiting teachers, during the last few years, what we found out is, applicants from other districts also come for the examination. They get appointments and after, say, one or two years, they go back. So, this has been going on for ages. Therefore, Hon. Minister, I request you, when you recruit teachers in the future, see that they are recruited from that particular district only. If that is done, I think we can solve this problem. Earlier, they have been appointed through the Provincial Councils, but there are problems. So, I think you must take this matter into your hands and see that it is solved once and for all. Otherwise, however much we try to appoint them, in a few years time, they go back. So, please take this matter into consideration and see that these appointments are made directly.

Sir, when I was in the Provincial Council about 10 to 12 years ago, along with the Provincial Director - I think he is here today - we started teaching in the Sinhala medium in a Tamil-medium school named Fathima Muslim Girls School. Today, in that particular school, they have classes in the Sinhala medium up to A/L. Last year, five Tamil-speaking students studying in the Sinhala medium sat for the A/Ls and got through. It was a very good experiment we tried and we have been successful in that. Therefore, Hon. Minister, I request you to try this in every Tamil medium school because always that difference is there - the Tamil-speaking students do not get familiar with the Sinhala medium. So, for me, this has become a success and I think, in future, we can try and implement this programme right throughout the country.

Further, there is a playground being built in the Zahira College, Puttalam, started by the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, which is half complete. It is a National School. Therefore, it will be very useful if you could complete that.

Hon. Minister, we have got three National Schools in my area, but in all those schools, we have a lot of problems. Hon. Minister, I have already requested you along with my leader to visit this area so that we also could have the same facilities the schools in Colombo have.

Now, people are speaking about school uniforms. I am sure it is a very good idea because I can remember, when I was the Chairman of Salu Sala some time back, that we got a big quota, one-fourth of the entire requirement - to supply material for school uniforms. I have to tell you, we made a profit of 8 to 10 per cent out of it. Therefore, I think it is a very good idea.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Member, you time is closing up.

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Give me two more minutes, Sir.

In addition to that, I would also like to thank the Hon. Minister of Higher Education and Highways. In the last four - five years, even though they have been speaking of carpeting internal roads, it was only main roads that they carpeted. But, this time, they have promised to do the interior roads.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Thank you very much, Hon. Member.

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Sir, just give me two more minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) No, you have exceeded your time. I have given you more than the four minutes allocated to you.

( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Sir, I will wind up.

The Hon. Minister of Higher Education and Highways has promised to tar the internal roads.

In addition, I would also like to make a request regarding a main bridge in the village of Udappuwa, which causes people a lot of difficulties during every rainy season. So, I request you to do up that bridge in Udappuwa and also to open up the Puttalam-Mannar Road, where we have to carpet only 26 kilometres. Once that is done, it will shorten the distance between Jaffna and Colombo by many kilometres.

[7.20p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ali Zahir Moulana Seyed) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Mr. Chairman, on the 30th of November, 2015, I was honoured to speak on the Second Reading Debate of the Appropriation Bill, 2016, presented by the Hon. Minister of Finance, in relation to and with specific considerations to what is considered the most vital and underlying factor existent in the context of the Sri Lankan polity - the education sector.

Since Independence, all successive governments in power have proposed and implemented many policies pertaining to the education sector. However, a concerning note is that over time, there has been a downward trend in investment in the education sector by these successive governments. But, I am happy to proclaim that this Government has aptly identified the necessities of reversing, implementing and charting a new course of effective reform in the current education system, to allow the human capital to sustain the growth momentum of the economy, and moreover, readily avail the generations the opportunity to consistently cope and overcome the challenges of continuous globalization and social development.

Sir, at this juncture, I am pleased to note that the Government will be looking to create an even or a level playing field for all educational institutions, thereby effectively countering and combating social imbalance between the urban and the rural areas and promoting equal opportunities for all students in Sri Lanka. In

637 638

addition, I am pleased to share the view of the Government that it is essential to realign the education system to move away from an examination-centric, content-based curriculum towards a competency-based curriculum, helping children to gain vital life skills and to encourage independent thinking.

Sir, as you know, I was elected to this House by the people of Batticaloa, one of Sri Lankas economically-starved districts within the equally economically and socially-deprived Eastern Province. I wish to highlight specific issues in the education and higher education sectors that directly affect schools and universities in that area and how they can be incorporated into the Action Plan of this Appropriation Bill for 2016. The Eastern Province provides an adequate representation of the case at hand where the schools not only require a regeneration of the system of education, but also a mass upheaval of simply the quality of education provided. If you travel to the Eastern Province, you will find many of those 1,360 schools, that were mentioned by the Hon. Minister of Finance, that have been neglected from any assistance from the Government in the past and are in dire shortage of basic facilities to operate even at its bare minimum capacity.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Ali Zahir Moulana Seyed) Sir, the Aligarh National School in Eravur, for instance, even though have been upgraded to a National School way back in 1996, does not have one single computer for the use of its students, nor does it have adequate room for expansion as its adjoining land is being held by the Sri Lanka Police for its use. Other schools in Batticaloa and in the Eastern Province as a whole are subject to even more dire circumstances, as mentioned earlier.

Hence, Hon. Chairman, these schools, if further neglected, would create a vicious circle in which social imbalance and inequality in Sri Lanka shall continue to prevail, even if other sectors are targeted for growth.

Therefore, Hon. Finance Minister's proposal for an allocation of approximately Rs. 65,000 million of public investment through this Appropriation Bill towards increasing teacher training, developing or expanding neglected school buildings, providing or improving electricity facilities through renewable energy or connection to the national grid to all schools et cetera reflect significant development in the education sector.

Having said that, Sir, a case in point is the ongoing issues prevalent in the Engineering Faculty of the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka. Sir, I wish to bring to the

attention of this House that the South Eastern University, a pioneering beacon of higher education in the Region, commenced its Engineering Faculty with its first intake of students in May 2013.

( ) (The Hon. Chairman) You have to conclude now, Hon. Member. ( ) (The Hon. Ali Zahir Moulana Seyed) I was given six minutes, I was told. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Yes, six minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Ali Zahir Moulana Seyed) I barely spoke. It seems only two, three minutes have passed. Give me one more minute to conclude.

Sir, the formulation of its curriculum, complying with all components of the IESL standards and guidelines and the requirements of the Washington Accord, was done under the guidance of senior tenured professors from established Engineering Faculties around the country. I will also table* the letter from the Vice Chancellor of the South Eastern University addressed to the Secretary of the Ministry of Higher Education highlighting the capabilities of the Engineering Faculty for reference purposes.

Mr. Chairman, since I have prepared my speech, I wish to table* the rest of my speech. Thank you.
