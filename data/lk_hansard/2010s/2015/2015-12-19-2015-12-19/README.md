( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of City Planning and Water Supply) Hon. Speaker, as you told the Hon. Member at the very outset, today being the last day of the Budget, we have to be mindful of time. An extensive Question directed at three Ministers has been asked today.

Sir, I must, at the very outset, say that the Hon. Member may be abusing the process of Parliament, because he had raised a similar Question in a different formulation previously and I answered it. But since there are other issues which are connected with the same issue that has been raised today, I am prepared to answer. But, it is going to take time.

In any event, I must assure him that the Government is fully possessed of the issue pertaining to drinking water in Chunnakam. No less than the President and the Hon. Prime Minster themselves have got involved with all the agencies concerned in this regard and we are taking all remedial measures that need to be taken so that the people in the Jaffna Peninsula will not be forced to drink unsuitable water. So, regarding that, we are taking a variety of steps.

Also in the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of my Ministry, I have explained the background relating to what alternative action we are taking. Most of the Hon. Member's questions are directed at various other agencies like the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Ministry of Health Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine as well as the Provincial Ministry of Agriculture of the Northern Province. But, in any event, I must tell him that the National Water Supply and Drainage Board has taken steps to examine the wells in the Chunnakam area and we have found that out of the 375 wells we have checked, the water in 225 wells is beyond the tolerance limit for oil and grease contamination according to SLS standards and therefore, is not suitable for drinking. So, we are now supplying water through bowsers to all those areas covered by those contaminated wells.

This issue relates to the earlier arrangement of private electricity supply through the Northern Power Company Pvt. Limited, a private company and the contamination of the aquifer in that area. So, since the groundwater is contaminated in that area, we have taken suitable steps as an alternative measure. The Government has requested the Governor of the Northern Province to summon the GA, the Divisional Secretaries and all the stakeholders and have extensive meetings. That also resulted in the abandoning of the hunger strike by the students. So, all that was being attended to.

We have spoken to the ADB. The ADB has now given a US Dollars 250 million facility for us to go for a desalination plant. But, I have explained in my speech

during the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of my Ministry that desalinated water is ultimately going to be very costly to the consumer. The only alternative is to go for the Iranamadu Water Supply Scheme. There again, we face problems with the farmers and that issue has to be resolved by the politicians of the area. So, I proposed to convene a meeting of all the political leadership in the Northern Province to amicably resolve these issues pertaining to long-term solutions to the problem. My Ministry and our Government has taken all necessary steps towards this matter, I must assure the House, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Thank you, Hon. Minister. Hon. Douglus Devananda, are you satisfied with that assurance? ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) Hon. Speaker, but still the issue is prevalent. They have been supplying water free of charge but because of the decision of the Provincial Council, they have stopped it from yesterday. So, still, the issue is prevalent. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) But, now the Hon. Minister has given the assurance that he will take adequate steps. ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) Also, Sir, I wish to point out that I am not misusing nor misleading the House. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) Sure. ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) So, it is wrong to say so. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) What I am saying is, the same Question had been asked in a different form earlier and I have replied. ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) But, so far, nothing has happened. That is why I asked it again. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) We are supplying water by bowsers to all the affected areas. We are incurring heavy losses towards this.

3001 3002

( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) Yesterday itself, your Ministry announced they would not supply water because of the Provincial Councils decision. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No. The Provincial Council and you have certain problems. I have nothing to do with that. But, of course, I must admit that the decision of the Provincial Council and the Central Government is at variance on this issue. I agree with that. ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) The only thing the people want to know is whether they can drink the water or not. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) We will summon a meeting in the North. I will come there personally, have a discussion and explain to the people what steps we are taking. But, I am thinking - [Interruption.] No. In this case, you are abusing the process of the House- you have asked a similar Question earlier. That is what I am saying. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) The Hon. Douglas Devananda has raised the issue on behalf of the people; the assurance from the Minister is there. So, let us proceed with todays Business. Thank you very much.

, . [12.50 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama - Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade) Sir, for many years we have been using the slogan, export or perish. Despite this, our export performance remains disappointing. Sri Lankas share of global exports has been declining and our goods exports have declined from 32 per cent in 2000 to 14 per cent last year. Our services exports is another 5 per cent which means that total exports are only about 19 per cent of our GDP. The corresponding figure for countries like Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand exceed 70 per cent of GDP. Even Bangladesh exports over 25 per cent of GDP. Our lackluster export performance is one of the main reasons why we have fallen behind. If we compare our development record with that of the successful countries of the East and the Southeast Asia, arguably, the biggest difference is in export performance. We need to ask ourselves why this has happened.

One important factor has been our inability to live within our means. This is reflected in the excessive budget deficit which has persisted for several decades. For over 20 years, the Governments Recurrent Expenditure has exceeded revenue. This has meant that every year - for over 20 years - we have borrowed to meet our current expenses. If a family had done this, they would have become destitute a long time ago.

Sir, we have a very little scope to continue borrowings as we have done in recent years. We have to earn, rather than borrow, the foreign exchange we need to pay for the imports we require as well as to service the foreign debts we have incurred. The country will have to rely on our

exporters to play a major role in driving forward the development programme of our country. Unless we improve our export performance, we will run into serious difficulties.

The Hon. Prime Minister had spoken of creating a million jobs over the next five years. Export expansion will have to make an important contribution to creating descent employment and improving the incomes of our people. In this regard, we expect to set up economic zones throughout the country including the North and the East - Trincomalee, Jaffna, Kilinochchi - as well as in the South and we will certainly discuss these issues with the MPs of the North and the East as well.

If one looks around the world, it becomes very apparent that attracting FDIs has played a very important role in boosting export performance. FDIs bring in not only much-needed capital but also markets, technology and know-how. Countries ranging from China and Vietnam to Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand have followed route.

You can imagine what Chinas situation was when Chairman Mao and Prime Minister Zhou Enlai were in charge of the country. It was a closed economy and China was one of the poorest countries in the world. Fortunately, Vice Chairman Deng Xiaoping came out with a new vision and in spite of all the obstacles that he had to face - and in the end, he even had to go in a wheelchair - he saw to the economic reforms and China is now one of the leading countries in the world, second only to the United States.

Let me now address some of the things that the Government is doing to assist our exporters. A number of initiatives have been introduced through the Budget targeted at boosting exports. We are attaching high priority to increase market access and leverage FDI through a series of bilateral agreements. Widening of our economic cooperation with India is currently under negotiation through the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperative Agreement between the two countries.

In this regard, we have had discussions with all the State chambers, the professionals and the trade unions and I am very pleased that we even had an opportunity of discussing this issue with some Hon. Members of the Opposition including the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane and a few others. I do not want to say that they are Members of the Opposition, because they all are Members of the UPFA.

I do not know whether they are in the Government or in the Opposition but we had very good, very cordial discussions and I agreed that we will continue with the discussions and keep them informed of the progress as we go on.

3061 3062

( )r (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Is it CEPA? ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) No, there is no CEPA. It is a new Agreement. You are well aware of that. I did not think that my classmates will act like that. They are not used to lying. -[Interruption.]

A Free Trade Agreement is also being negotiated with China. Other such bilateral pacts are under consideration as is an assessment of benefits in joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. We will not sign CEPA. As the Prime Minister had already mentioned we will invite all stakeholders before the final agreement is signed. We will discuss and even present the final agreement to Parliament.

The Export Development Board under our Ministry is in the process of finalizing an export strategy. This will provide a coherent framework for our work in the area of export promotion. An agency for international trade will be set up to coordinate all trade promotional activities. Our Ministry is also focusing on improving investment policy, ease of doing business, trade policy and trade facilitation. One Stop Shops are being established in the Board of Investment and the Central Clearance Unit of the Sri Lanka Customs. These should be fully operational within two to three months. We have also established task forces to improve our performance on each of the pillars of the World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index. In addition, all laws and regulations related to investments are being reviewed to speed up processes and procedures. Priority is also being attached to looking into our system of tariffs and para-tariffs to make them more export friendly. We are also looking into ways of upgrading the competitiveness of SMEs to strengthen the capacity to penetrate export markets.

I must also point out a major challenge that confronts us politicians if we are to create an export friendly policy environment. Our populace policies have led to large budget deficits. The successful countries in the East and Southeast Asia have low budget deficits, low inflation, low interest rates and a competitive exchange rate. This has given their exporters a significant advantage over ours because we have had high interest rates and overvalued currency because of the excess demand created by our large budget deficit. In fact, our exporters have been asked to run hundred and ten metres in a hundred-metre race.

So, it is imperative that as a country we need to understand that we cannot go on living beyond our means. We need to give priority to fiscal consolidation. The Prime Minister in his Economic Policy Statement has set a target for the budget deficit of 3.5 per cent of GDP

by 2020. We need to achieve that in order to have interest rates and an exchange rate which will assist our exporters to be globally competitive. There is plenty of evidence of our capacity to compete in global markets. ( ) (The Hon. Deputy Chairman) Hon. Minister, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Malik Samarawickrama) Sir, please give me two more minutes.

We have world-class apparel exporters, ICT-enabled services and several niche exports which earn valuable foreign exchange to our country. However, we need to do very much more. In endeavouring to do so we need to understand that the modern world is characterized by production sharing networks. We have a negligible presence in regional and global value chains. We need to change this.

I have every confidence that if we are able to achieve strong macro-economic fundamentals, improve the investment climate and boost trade facilitation, our exporters will rise to the challenge. It is our intention to work hard to create the right environment for exporters and investors both local and foreign. Our future prosperity depends on this. The country cannot achieve an accelerated path of growth and development without a transformation of our export performance.

Finally, I call upon all Members of this Assembly to join us in our efforts to increase our exports in attracting investors which in turn will help to improve the living standards of our people.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, may I take this opportunity to thank the officers of my Ministry and the officers of the BOI and EDB for their kind cooperation.

Thank you.

It does not bring stability; it does not bring confidence; it will not generate confidence internationally to our economy. Already your masters, the IMF, has said that the Budget is failing. Now I do not have time to go into this, but I would like to mention about the press release made by IMF captioned, "IMF Executive Board Concludes Fourth Post-Program Monitoring with Sri Lanka" dated 09th December, 2015, which clearly shows that we are going into a crisis and the crisis has to be accepted by the Parliament. The Parliament should know what we are going in for in 2016. We may pass expenditure, but we will not be able to use it, Hon. Chairman. We will face inflationary problems; we will face a crisis of printing money, perhaps once or twice, but you cannot be printing money always. This is what happened to the countries that collapsed. So, let us learn from these things.

So, the Hon. Minister of Finance has failed. I am sorry to say that the Government has failed in presenting a stable Budget that can run through the year 2016 and give new confidence not only to Sri Lanka, but to all those who are trying to work with Sri Lankan economy in its development. I would like to bring to your notice that the Budget has crashed. In simple language, this is what has happened.

We know in the last few months, after you came into power, what the Rupee fetched against the Dollar. We have gone through a devaluation, Sir. Devaluation means that every import goes up in price. If you do not catch up by exporting more than what we exported, we do not get the foreign exchange that we earned before the devaluation. This is one simple issue that will not be solved in 2016. Therefore, our foreign exchange earnings will start dropping. There will be a balance of payment problem and this is the key issue where the Hon. Prime Minister, though his slip of the tongue, mentioned ten days ago that we shall go in for a standby loan with the IMF. The IMF is not just going to give you " ". The IMF has its own way of working on programmes and you will have to cut down on what you all have agreed - the fertilizer subsidy, the pension schemes such as the EPF and the ETF . .

, , , they have raised their interest rates. It is going to hit the world over. If the Hon. Minister of Finance is going to say no, let him also say, if it hits our economy, I am going to resign. That is the honourable way of promising the House, but you should not to mislead the 225 Hon. Members of Parliament and our countrymen who will face an economic crisis at this rate. Hon. Chairman, I would like to tell you that US Dollars 2.8 billion worth of Sri Lankan bonds that have been invested, is collapsing. Yesterday, in the New York Stock Exchange, two massive hedge funds collapsed. Is the Hon. Minister of Finance aware of this? Can he tell the House what the amount of Sri Lankan funds involved in this collapse? This has happened after the Federal Reserve Bank of America raised its interest rates. This is what we are being told. '' , '' .

, 2016 , , . ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) , . . ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , . . . [4.15p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity given to speak at the end of the Budget Debate and the Committee Stage Discussion. As I indicated when I opened the Debate on the Second Reading, this Budget has in fact been quite different and I enumerated the reasons why we looked at it as different to the previous several years.

A Budget Proposal is not merely a reflection of rupees and cents that one intends to spend for the ensuing year and the means by which revenue is to be collected. It is far more than that. A Budget actually reflects the actual policy of the Government. For any institution, the Budget will reflect the priorities of that institution. Even for a family unit, if you intend buying a house or sending your children abroad for education, which involves some

3129 3130

money, your budgetary allocations - how you plan - will reflect that. If you are planning to spend your money on holidays or gamble and drink it away, your spending; your rupees and cents, will reflect your priorities.

This is more so when it comes to a countrys Budget, because, you can say all you want as your policy. You can say, These are our priorities". This is a new Government. Being a new Government, this Government has declared certain priorities; this Government has come into office on the promise of certain stated priorities. Now, how does one check whether the Government actually means it? When people talk too much, one says, Let us see whether you put your money where your mouth is. So, the Budget Proposals really are a test to see whether you are actually putting your money where your mouth is. So, this is a good test. This is a good test, because, this is the first Budget of this new Government; the Government of National Unity that was formed just August this year. All the promises that were made as to national priorities should then reflect in the Budget Proposals that are being made. That is when one sees whether talk is being converted into actual realization.

To a certain extent, that shift is seen in the Budget Proposals. There was a statement on the Governments Economic Policy that the Hon. Prime Minister made prior to this Budget and that clearly laid out how the economy is intended to be handled by this new Government. I must say that the Budget Proposals are also in line with that stated policy. Except that, as has been stated in this House, moments ago, by both sides, there have been significant changes made to the original Proposals that were enunciated by the Hon. Minister of Finance.

Now there is a good aspect of this as well as a bad aspect. The good aspect is that changes being made is a good thing, because that is the whole purpose of having a Debate. The Hon. Minister of Finance makes a Proposal. Then the House goes into debating those Proposals. Then, we adjourn to sessions in Committee, either the Committee of the whole House or a Select Committee and detailed discussions take place. If no change is ever made at the end of this long drawn-out discussion, that is not a good thing. So, changes must be made. I think, from that perspective - the fact that what we are looking at today is not exactly what was presented as the Proposals by the Minister of Finance - it is a good thing, except that, I do not see any of the changes that have been now, were made arising out of the Debate in the House. Those changes seem to have been made ad hoc by various pressures that have come from outside.

Everyday, it was difficult for us to travel to Parliament. It seemed almost like there was a timetable that had been agreed to by various different sectors as to who takes which day to demonstrate. There were other

pressures that were brought. In deference to those pressures - I am not saying that in a negative way, in a democracy that is possible, that can be done - but that is how the changes have been made, not really through a process of enlightenment as a result of a Debate in the House. I am saying this also for the reason that we - when I say "we", the Tamil National Alliance representing mostly people from the North and the East war devastated areas - raised several concerns in this House. We raised them at the Debate. Our people did not come and block the road to Parliament. Our people did not come and march to Temple Trees. We raised very serious concerns; but those concerns are still left unattended because they were raised only at the Debate, in a civil Debate in the House and not at a demonstration on the road. To that extent, I am sad that the Government has not adequately taken heed of our voices, the voices of the representatives. We raised serious issues and at the end of my speech I will say how serious they are.

In the Economic Statement and the Proposals that the Minister of Finance made, there are shifts that you can see. I am not saying those shifts are bad. I just wish to identify those shifts and raise certain concerns and those concerns are very similar to the concerns raised by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena a moment ago, except that I am not predicting doom, I am only raising them as possible consequences that the Government must address, and if not addressed, can result in the scenario that he just laid out for us.

One is the shift in financialization - how we propose or rather the Government proposes to deal with, for example pensions, ETF, EPF et cetera. There is a heavy accent in this Budget on inviting foreign capital. That is a good thing. You need that. Particularly after the finances of the country have been bungled away, even to recover, you need that. But with that will come various dangers and I think the Government ought to be aware of that and as a responsible Opposition it is our duty to sound those notes of caution. Otherwise the country can become bankrupt. The conditions imposed or, rather in order to be foreign-investment friendly, the restrictions that we have had hitherto being relaxed, can open the way for rogue investors, not necessarily rogue investors, but even others who can come with the liberty to take their capital and their earnings out of this country in short periods of time rather than long-term investment. If that happens, we will certainly be forced to borrow again from the IMF et cetera and then those will not come without conditions. Those will necessarily come with conditions and that will affect ordinary people of this country.

The second example is land. This can be seen in the way that Proposals have been made about land. Foreigners ownership of land has now been made easier. So, what is the kind of investment that is being sought? Is not investment that comes to create jobs for our people? There will be that as well. But we, by relaxing this

3131 3132

[ .. ]

2015 19

regime, are inviting real estate investment. By real estate investment, the ownership of land which rests with the State and the citizens of this country can change hands. Then, if the investor pulls out or the investor is permitted to go, those may sometimes be the conditions of the borrowing or the conditions that you have to comply with in order to be investor-friendly, then we can get to a stage where the country or large portions of it no longer belongs to us.

This can even come through granting people freehold rights to land that they occupy now, which is one of the Proposals - that lands on which people live on permits will be given to them. That is a good thing, but also can be a danger. You give freehold land. Why? Because then people can use that as a commodity - people can mortgage that land; people can lease that land; people can encumber the ownership of that land and with foreign investments coming in, land rights can even change hands through this process, which we welcome, because the landless must be given lands. But we have seen the impact of this even in the Indian Housing Scheme that was implemented in the North and East, where people had to own lands in order to get a House. But the model that was given being the owner-driven model, if they wanted to add a room, a verandah or something they borrowed from the banks. And when they borrowed from the banks additionally to what they were getting, they mortgaged that very property to the bank. So now, they are unable to pay back the loans. So we have a situation of this debt trap in the North, where you have got a house free - not free but perhaps 75 per cent free- but you no longer own the land where the house stands on. So, this is I think in a small way an example of what can happen to the whole country. FDIs are good, but they must result in jobs, not merely financial gains only that results in greater profit for the investor who takes it back.

Then, there is the issue with regard to the labour regime. Although nothing has been said, this is definitely one of those demands that will be made by any foreign investor who comes and invests in industries that will create jobs - to relax the strict labour regimes that we have. Now, that is again a threat for the security of tenure of employees although there is social legislation that we brought in, in the early 70s. Labour regimes might have to be relaxed. Now, all that can happen, but what is the net that we can provide for people not to fall below? Unless we create that, merely relaxing these security measures can result in a disastrous situation.

The Opposition has been hamstrung for several years, this year as well, in participating properly in a Debate. As the Hon. Minister of Finance might know the Open Budget Index for this country has fallen. That means, we have not had the adequate information necessary to actually participate effectively in these Discussions. But I must congratulate the Government for the new proposal to have a Parliamentary Budget Office. And I think that is

the way to go. You have taken the steps to rectify this so that from the next year perhaps before a Budget is prepared even, as a Pre-Budget exercise, all the Members can actually participate in these discussions even in the preparation and certainly at the time of the Debate with adequate information being available to them.

I would like to ask the Hon. Minister of Finance, why the banks are being told that they cannot involve themselves in leasing and pawning business and what the rationale for this is. Because certainly they lend at a much lower rate than the leasing companies. They are able to lend at a much lower rate because they are able to do that with a broader capital base. Particularly, when you want to encourage SMEs - Small and Medium Enterprises - [Interruption.] Yes, Hon. Minister - ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake - Minister of Finance) Hon. Member the reason is, core capital is being used on things like pawning and they are charging excessive amounts. What we want is for them to go into core banking. But, as there were suggestions made on the Floor of the House and some coming from the banking sector, the Hon. Prime Minister was telling us, Let us look at the positive aspects of those." All the private banks have basically accepted it, but we will give a rationale to it. The reason why we are basically allowing others to go into leasing in different areas is because they create another industry and create more jobs. Their capital is not more than that. What we have seen is, 94 per cent has been in the private sector. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) So, are you saying that if the capital that is being employed for these is not above a particular percentage of its overall portfolio and if it does not affect its core banking activities, then that is permissible? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Absolutely! Hon. Member, when you issue a banking licence, it is for banking. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is understood. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Core banking is being neglected and they go for pawning and leasing when the core capital should be given for SMEs, to youth, women and for agriculture. That is what we want the banks to do.

3133 3134

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) But, we have looked at the figures. Except one bank, which has something like 27 per cent of its capital going in for this business, most others keep it below 10 per cent. The average seems to be about 5.7 per cent. ( ) (The Hon. avi Karunanayake) That is exactly how it should be. The majority should be 5 per cent. So, we have pegged it at 5 per cent. There would not be any effect at all. There is only manipulation. So, it is a misrepresentation of facts. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Then, would you consider putting a slab on the percentage of the capital that they can employ for this so as not to affect the core banking activities rather than prohibiting this business entirely by the banks? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Certainly. We are not prohibiting any of them. Only leasing was restricted. But, we are also looking at it more compassionately. We are not going to be rigid by putting a limit. We are only putting a qualitative limit. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you.

Sir, the Economic Policy enunciated by the Hon. Prime Minister talked about one million jobs, but these are some gaps that you see. The Budget Proposals really do not have a plan. I am not saying that that must happen in the first year, but surely, there must be some plan, some initiation to start creating those one million jobs. I am sad to say that from what has been presented, that is not very clear - the pathway that will end with one million more jobs is not clear at all from your Budgetary Proposals. Job creation which is essential for the whole country, but more essential for us from the North and the East because of the situation that those areas have undergone over the last several decades, there does not seem to be concrete moves or proposals in the next year for that and it is not clear what kind of money allocations the Government has made. Inviting the private sector and foreign investment is one thing, but how much of your money is going into creating those jobs is not clear.

Then, with regard to education and health, we are glad that there is an increase in the amounts of allocation. Addressing the infrastructure needs like schools and all of that is well and good and we welcome those proposals, but we would like to see investment in other areas, not

merely in infrastructure, but also in crucial areas like teacher training, policy-making and so on. That is something which is absent. Sure enough, buildings are necessary; roofs are necessary; toilets are necessary in schools, but that alone will not make it a school. You need to impart knowledge; you need to impart education and for that, you need teachers and investment in that is essential. There again, I would like to emphasize the specific need that we have in the North - particularly more than in the East - and also in the East, in the estate sector and various other parts of the country; in those areas, there is not enough teachers, particularly in certain areas of discipline.

The other thing is, we are basically an agricultural society. This shift to being a financial hub seems like it has affected the spending towards agriculture, fishing and industries such as animal husbandry and things like that. If you look at the percentage allocation for improvement of those sectors, it is minimal. So, as much as you can make an effort to create this country a financial hub and create jobs and create wealth by those means, the foundational industries that our people live by must also flourish. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Member, this time, for agriculture and fisheries, Rs. 83,000 million has been allocated. It is almost three times the allocation made last time. The Colombo International Financial Centre - CIFC - has attracted a direction of only Rs. 3,000 million for a building. So, we are only showing a pointer that we require. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I agree. So, what is the percentage of your overall spending for agriculture and fisheries? It is only 0.3 per cent for fisheries. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But, it is a humongous expenditure. If you look at the allocation last time, we have made a 200 per cent increase this time. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It is only 0.3 per cent for fisheries. When you have the sea around this Island and so much resources, the Government's allocation of only 0.3 per cent for fisheries certainly shows the kind of priority that is being given to that sector. It may have been increased from last year, but

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Member, if you spend 40 per cent for debt servicing and 3 per cent on education and health -

3135 3136

2015 19

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Those are your excuses and I am not dismissing those excuses. But, I am stating a stark fact. So, that reflects the priority. I am urging that fishing, agriculture and animal husbandry also need infusion to develop for people who are still engaged in those industries to flourish. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Member, I challenge you to give some good proposals as our fish die of old age, not by being caught. So, you come up with any proposal and my Government and I will ensure that you get the money to implement them. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) One of the biggest problems we have is bottom trawling in the Northern seas. That must be banned. The Government does not take any step to ban bottom trawling. Therefore, I had to move a Private Members Bill - that has been gazetted just two weeks ago - to make an amendment to the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Member, you have only three more minutes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) As I am short of time, I will quickly wind up.

The other issue is the shift to Megapolis. I understand that there is urbanization going on. You put emphasis on that - to create infrastructure and strengthen your urban cities, but you certainly neglect the rural economies which ought to be strengthened. People should continue to live in their localities and not keep coming towards urban cities. Coming towards the urban cities maybe a feature that you cannot avoid, but as much as possible, you need to strengthen the economy in the rural areas so that people will continue to live there. The facilities for education in those localities must be good; the schools there must be improved and jobs must be created in those areas. So, there needs to be great emphasis laid on that. I am only sounding notes of caution.

Sir, Investor confidence has another aspect to it. It is not purely financial and I want to end with that. That confidence comes when the investors around the world think that this country has actually taken a turn for the better. That promise has been given to them and they can see that happening this year. But, it must solidify; it must be made firm. And that can happen not merely by

spending money or showing your economic policies, but by making other moves like reconciliation become real. For that to happen, the Governments proposal for a new Constitution next year is excellent. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Member, your time is up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will finish, Sir, with this comment.

Even for economic stability, it is important that the long and protracted conflict that we have had in this country since Independence must be brought to a satisfactory end for all peoples of this country so that the country can actually go in the path of prosperity.

Thank you.

Hon. Sumanthiran mentioned that only a trickle of the total amount was allocated for areas such as fisheries. Sir, it is Rs. 83 billion this year, which is almost 200 per cent over the allocation the last year. We are a humble Government and if any Member can bring in any development-oriented projects, Hon. Prime Minister and our Government are willing to consider that very favourably. It is the instruction given by His Excellency the President as well. You could see that this Budget is very flexible.

Hon. Members, the reason being that our revenue to GDP has reduced from 16.7 per cent in 2005 to 10.46 per cent in 2015. So, this is a very serious erosion that has taken place and we need to correct this as soon as possible.

I guess that it is a serious situation for the stock brokers who are not effectively playing the role that they are supposed to play and as a result, it is a considered opinion that we will call upon them from 01st of January, 2016 to show their commitments towards the responsibility that they have been given and a minimum turnover must be applicable, at least the average, and if we find that this is not happening, we will have to reluctantly tell that new brokers to be brought in and the existing people, who are lackluster in their attitudes, will have to be substituted. This is the clarion call to them to open up themselves because the market is opening up for them. I can see a slight increase and I would appreciate that this is followed.

So, it is a contributory fund instead of a natural debit. As the Hon.Prime Minister informed this House very categorically, that is the system that we have got to follow. We have to ensure that there will be a sustainable economy instead of the irrational basis that has been maintained today. I must mention with responsibility that this was something which the Hon. J.R. Jayewardene mentioned in 1948 - Hon. (Dr.) N.M Perera and the Hon. Ronnie de Mel, all of them have mentioned this in this

House. I think it is necessary to show the pitfalls that are there. It is our responsibility to take it in the correct direction.

We are trying to capitalize the undercapitalized banks which is one of the serious drawbacks since the Basel Convention. So, we are supposed to ensure that the capitalization needs to be done. As a result, we intend savings on reductions of expenditure and the increases in the savings that we will get with the private sector would be used for capitalization of the banks. So, it is a step in the right direction.

There is an economic turbulence taking place in the world at the moment. China is devaluing their currency, which has not taken place during the last 30 years. I am sorry to hear the misrepresentation made by my good Friend, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, saying that we castigated China. I want to say that we have taken over the economy from the previous Government, which castigated the Americans, the Europeans, the Indians, the Japanese and the Koreans. Can you tell me a friendly nation that you had dealt with? What we did was, we refocused that. We never told China not to do anything, but all we did was we told China, Do in our country what you are doing in your country. That is the only difference. You are saying that we are privatizing these institutions and giving them to foreigners.

Then, the Hon. Sumanthiran mentioned that he was not satisfied with the allocations. I was listening to the speeches made by all 14 Hon. Members of the TNA. I realized that it was with a sense of trepidation that they asked, Can we spend the monies that have been allocated? We have certainly allocated the monies on the basis that those need to be spent and would be spent on the necessary development projects. But, we have fear that the necessary capacity may not be there in those areas when it comes to spending the money. So, that is why we call upon them to ensure that public sector - private sector participation takes place. All the Hon. Members from the North and the East would be given a certain allocation to be spent. I state this with authority because all of you have been saying, "As Sinhalese Governments, you allocate money for yourselves and ensure that these things are done, but nobody looks after the North and the East". Hon. Sumanthiran, I will spell out what you want developed in those areas, as stated in your letter dated 09th December, 2015 addressed to me so that it would go into Hansard:

3145 3146

"Roads in order of priority:

1. Point Pedro - Maruthankery Road

2. Valukaiaru-Punguduthivu-Kurikadduwan Road

3. Jaffna-Manipay - Karainavgar Road

4. Puloly-Kodikamam-Kachchai Road

Industries:

1. Northern Salt

2. Paranthan Chemicals

3. Cement Factory at Kiranchi, Ponnaveli area in the Kilinochchi District

4. Paper Factory, Valaichchenai

5. Tile factories in Mandur and Oddusuddan

Bridges (Batticaloa):

1. Naripulthoddam-Pankalaveli

2. Santhiveli-Keerivettay

3. Kinnaiyady (Sathurukondan)

4. Thuraineelavanai."

Everyone was talking with a sense disappointment, but now we have allocated the funds and now the challenge is for you all. His Excellency the President and the Hon. Prime Minister instructed me to explain this. So, now I challenge all of you to ensure from the 01st of January that every single cent allocated is spent, because the money is meant for spending. Therefore, all we could say is that our spirit is focused on the right direction and I hope that our conviction would carry it through to the level that you expect.

Sir, let me also say how we lost the opportunity to join the ASEAN long ago. The Hon. Dudley Senanayakes close friend, the first Prime Minister of Malaysia, the late Hon. Tunku Abdul Rahman had insisted that Sri Lanka becomes a member of the ASEAN. The Hon. Dudley Senanayake had reached the Airport to embark on a flight to take him to the Conference, yet, faith decreed otherwise. The Conference was held back for six hours thinking that his flight got delayed. But, the Hon. Dudley Senanayake did not attend it and that was the end of the ASEAN dream for Sri Lanka. That was the tragic history.

Sir, I thank you very much for giving me this opportunity.

I also thank His Excellency the President, the Hon. Prime Minister, the Cabinet of Ministers and Members of the Government and the Opposition. Let us work together. Together we can make a difference.

I must make a special mention of the Secretary to the Treasury, (Dr.) R.H.Samaratunga, the Deputy Secretories

3149 3150

to the Treasury and the Directors who nearly for four-and-a-half to five months worked really tirelessly and showed the talent within them. They were suppressed; they were stymied, but today, they have shown that they are able to withstand any pressure locally and internationally.

With this Budget, I am sure we will be able to take Sri Lanka to a new direction. Therefore, I call upon everyone of you to please help us. Do not look at this as an individuals Budget. This is Sri Lankas Budget and together, we can make that difference.

Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Thank you.

, . , , . , . ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, may I say a few words.

We are perhaps in the last few minutes of the Sittings of Parliament for this year. We have had a long Session in recent weeks with the Budget Proposals being debated and eventually being adopted.

Significant developments have taken place in this country this year. We have had a Presidential Election and a new President has been elected. Consequent to his election as President, there had been the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution. It was again a very significant piece of legislation that transformed the governance in this country to a very substantial extent and, I think, gave this country a true realization of democracy and democratic values. Consequent to the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, a new Government was elected to office. The new Government has assumed office and has presented this Budget to Parliament.

It is expected Mr. Speaker, that in the course of the coming year, this Parliament will be transformed into a Constitutional Assembly and that Constitutional Assembly will be entrusted with the performance of even more important functions to ensure that democracy in this country is preserved, that the Executive Presidency in this country does not continue in a manner in which it was existed for a considerable period of time; that there are electoral reforms that will ensure that there are elections that are truly democratic, free and fair and just by all the people to live in this country and that there are constitutional arrangements for the sharing of powers of governance in such a manner that everyone will be able to be beneficiaries of democratic verdicts, being able to exercise some powers of governance in different areas of competence, in different territorial units of power sharing which has been something that this country has not been able to achieve thus far which is not contained either in the 1978 Constitution or in the 1972 Constitution. We hope that this new Constitutional Assembly which will enact in the course of the coming year will bring to an end this totally, unsatisfactory, unhealthy situation that has prevailed in this country for a long, long time. We are confident that all the Members of this House, whichever party they belong to, will transcend the barriers of party politics and come together and take steps that will be in the best interest of this country and will give this country and all the people in this country a sense of belonging to the country and also a sense of essence that the country belongs to all of us and that we will together march forward.

Mr. Speaker, before I conclude, I wish to thank you, Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Speaker, the Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Secretary-General of Parliament, the Deputy Secretary-General, the Assistant Secretaries-General and the entirety of the Parliamentary staff who have worked hard to enable the Members of this Parliament to function. I wish to thank the Hon. Prime Minister, the Cabinet of Ministers, all the Member of

Parliament of the Government, all the Members of Parliament of the Opposition for all the co-operation that they have extended to make these sessions of Parliament successful.

Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. ( ) (The Hon. Speaker) , .
