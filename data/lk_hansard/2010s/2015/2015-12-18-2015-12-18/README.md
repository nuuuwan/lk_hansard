asked the Minister of Prisons Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs:

(a) Is he aware that -

(i) 312 families have been resettled in Bogaswewa zone in Vavuniya District under the programme to resettle those displaced owing to the war;

(ii) they were to be provided one acre of dry land and one acre of paddy land under this programme;

(iii) no provision of land in the said manner has been done, even though three years have lapsed by now; and

(iv) they have been rendered utterly helpless due to loss of their livelihood?

(b) Will he inform this House -

(i) whether speedy action will be taken to remedy this situation; and

(ii) if so, what that measure is?

(c) If not, why? .. ( , , ) ( .. - , , ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan - Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs) Hon. Speaker, the answer for Question No. 2 is as follows:

(a) (i) 165 core families who have been displaced due to war and 147 extended families have been resettled.

(ii) One acre of highlands has been provided for each resettled family. The allocated lands for paddy cultivation belongs to the Department of Forest and the land will be provided to the resettled families after it is released by the Department of Forest.

(iii) Request to release the land has been made by the Divisional Secretary to the Department of Forest. Action is being taken to submit the documents to the Department of Forest after obtaining the approval from the District Land Committee to be held on the 21st of December, 2015.

(iv) Some facilities have been created to improve their livelihood, but it is not enough for all the resettled families. The International Rainforest Conservation Organization Programme and the Divineguma Programme are also implemented to improve livelihood facilities.

(b) (i) Speedy action is being taken to provide paddy cultivation land for families with the consent of the Department of Forest to rectify this situation.

(ii) The Vavuniya District Secretary has reported that the recommendation of the District Land Use Committee which is scheduled to be held on the 21st of December, 2015 will be obtained and submitted to the Department of Forest for the release of the lands.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Member, I fully appreciate that there are many issues to be considered as far as resettlement of families are concerned. Our Ministry is taking all the necessary action. This has been happening for so many years and we took over only a few months ago. So, necessary steps are being taken. I cannot give you a reassurance on what date we can give it because we have to get the permission of the Department of Forest and the Department of Forest will have to release the lands.

( ) (The Hon. Vijitha Herath) ; . . . . . .

. . . , . . , - , - . . , , ?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Yes, as far as electricity is concerned, Hon. Member, with the permission of the Cabinet, tenders have been called to supply electricity for 65,000 houses. Each house will have a solar power system and furniture will also be provided for inhabitants of each house.

The second thing is, as far as water is concerned, my Ministry is taking immediate steps to renovate all the tanks that have been unutilized and not repaired. Once the tanks are repaired probably within another six months time, I will take immediate steps to see that water is provided. Otherwise there is no other way of providing water.

. . solar power system . 5 . , . ., " . " .. . . . . . . , . . . ?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Yes, firstly I appreciate that you raised this question. Now, when we talk about the solar power system, I am not talking about the solar power system to be given to thatched-houses. I am only talking about the new houses that are going to be built and there will be solar power to those houses. I think that should be clarified.

Secondly, your point of view has been a well-known factor - electricity is not provided; water service is not provided. It is done not only by my Ministry. It is being concurrently done with the Ceylon Electricity Board and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board. As water is very important for humans for their living, I am taking immediate steps to renovate the tanks that are available in the Northern Province. As far as electricity is concerned, I have to discuss it with the Ceylon Electricity Board or the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy. After that I can give you a complete answer.

Thank you.

[3.00 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Mohamed Navavi) Hon. Presiding Member, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity.

Sir, I would like to speak on the votes of the Ministry of Plantation Industries, especially with reference to coconut plantation. Hon. Minister, the coconut industry was doing very well in Sri Lanka up to 1976. I can remember that a lot of items like coconut, desiccated coconut, charcoal, oil and fibre were exported and it was almost equivalent to tea and rubber exports. But, unfortunately, in 1976, almost all the coconut lands were taken over by the LRC. As far as I can remember, the Janatha Estate Development Board was formed and most of the big estates were handed over to big companies. I can remember that in our area estates such as Chilaw Plantations and Kurunegala Plantations were handed over to big companies. But, I am sorry to say that all those estates were neglected; they were not looked after properly.

I can give you one example. If the officials want they can take a note of this. I had an estate called Marichchikattuwa Estate at Madurankuliya in the Puttalam Electorate. It is our family land. When we handed over that 100 acres of land in 1976, we were plucking over 60,000 to 70,000 nuts. During the last election campaign when I went to that area I went to see this estate. It was completely neglected and fertilizer has not been used at all. Now, they have started planting cashew and they are only plucking less than 10,000 nuts. This is the state of affairs in all those estates which were handed over to big companies. This is the reason why the coconut industry has come down. I am sure that all those lands have been given on long-term lease. It is our land; it belongs to you. Therefore, I feel that there must be a system to supervise these plantations so that those estates are maintained and when they give back those plantations, they would be in the same condition that they were handed over. So, Hon. Minister, please, look into this matter. I do not think that we need to import coconut. Hon. Minister, I was not here when you were speaking. I am sure that you would not allow that to happen; we need not do that. If we look after these estates and maintain them well, I am sure we can export all these items from our country like the good old days.

The small coconut estate owners have found it extremely difficult due to the change in the weather patterns and high price of fertilizer. When I went through the Budget Proposal 2016, I noticed that Rs.250 million has been allocated for a coconut cultivation rehabilitation programme. It is a very good proposal. If we are to bring back the coconut cultivation to the state of the good old days, we will have to give subsidies. Since the change of weather patterns, there is less rain and we will definitely have to provide the estates with drip irrigation systems, sprinkler systems and tube wells. But, this costs a lot of money. So, if we can give them a subsidy or long-term loans, most of the small coconut estate holders will definitely try to increase their cultivation. Because of the drop in coconut produce - not because of our fault, but because of the fault of the big

2845 2846

companies - I would like to tell you that the big oil mills like BCC Limited and Sena Mills have closed down. Because of that, other kinds of oil are imported to Sri Lanka. If these matters can be looked into, we can definitely increase the production and we can export the products as in the good old days.

Further, Rs. 200 million has been allocated for research. Hon. Minister, especially the seedlings provided by the Coconut Cultivation Board are of the same old varieties. But, now there are new varieties. The Philippines and Malaysia have new varieties. Therefore, I suggest you to allocate more time and more officers for the Coconut Research Institute and make sure that good quality seedlings are issued. If that is done, I am sure we can increase the yield. Hon. Minister, I do not know what you have said in this regard because I was not here when you spoke. If fertilizer is used for coconut plantation, we can get the results in one year. But, since the prices are so high most of the smallholders do not use fertilizer. Therefore, please be good enough to reduce the price of fertilizer and also help owners buy small tractors to plough their lands.

Whenever we talk about the plantations we speak only about tea and rubber and we always forget coconut. So, as an owner of a coconut estate, and a Member who represents a cocoanut cultivation area, I would like to say, please, be good enough to consider a fertilizer subsidy for coconut also because more benefits can be derived from it. I am sure the Hon. Minister will look into these things. I will be there at the Consultative Committee Meeting and I will give all my support to you, Hon. Minister. During the last few years, coconut cultivation was completely neglected; everything was neglected. But I am sure you will be able to develop this industry in future and we will definitely help you.

The Minister of Rural Economic Affairs, the Hon. P. Harrison is not here, but, I must mention this. We have an economic centre at Norachcholai. There is 16,000 acres of cultivable land available in Kalpitiya. From the economic centre at Norachcholai most of our produce - all the vegetables - is always sent to Dambulla and Colombo. But, very unfortunately, we do not have a cold room. I have already requested the Minister of Agriculture to provide us with a cold room and I am now requesting the Hon. Harrison also to provide us with a cold room so that we can preserve our produce. What happens there is, whatever excess stock that is left over there will get wasted and the farmers are losing as well. Therefore, I request the Hon. P. Harrison, the Minister of Rural Economic Affairs and also the Hon. Ameer Ali Shihabdeen, the Deputy Minister of Rural Economic Affairs to provide us with one cold room so that we can preserve these vegetables and our farmers will be benefited by that. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. E. Saravanapavan. You have 15 minutes.

[3.28 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Presiding Member, the Prime Minister, Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe recently outlined a broad framework for Sri Lanka's new Constitution at his Sujata Jayawardena Memorial Oration, organized by the Alumni Association of the University of Colombo at the BMICH. He also mentioned that a Constitutional Assembly will be established to draft a new Constitution with devolution of power, electoral reforms and replacement of the executive presidential system; forming three main focus areas for drafters of the countrys new supreme law.

His Excellency the President Maithripala Sirisena had also campaigned strongly for national reconciliation to resolve the countrys ethnic problem.

The Hon. Prime Minister went on to say, Most Members of Parliament agree that national reconciliation is a primary concern. We cannot and we should not miss this opportunity. He emphasized and said that the 31st of March, 2016 had been set as the deadline on national public consultations on the key factors of the draft Constitution.

The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission in its Report on page 368 states, I quote:

What needs to be done for reconciliation and nation-building is that the State has to reach out to the minorities and the minorities, in turn must, re-position themselves in their role vis a vis the State and the country. There must be willingness on the part of all political parties to give up adversarial politics and have consensual decision-making on national issues. In order to meet the challenges of this opportunity there has to be courage and political will on the part of all political parties.

The commitments made by the new Government in this respect are welcome but the unfortunate reality is it needs to convince a very skeptical audience, because of the past records of previous Governments for over 65

years. Unfortunately, the course of action we took as people and a nation was to fight and deny our fellow Sri Lankans the opportunity to live peacefully and with dignity. We simply denied peace to each other. What we have learned is, we did not give our countrymen their dignity but were prepared to endure its consequences in a painful way with the associated indignity cast along by the international community. What sort of logic have we been living with?

It is now time to realize that Sri Lanka sans nationalism will be a true paradise in all sense to all Sri Lankans. The sufferings of the families of those killed and wounded during the war including the ones who fought the war whether they are Sinhalese or Tamils are continuing and we must resolve not to allow any space for new pain and sufferings. The ones languishing in jail and the saga of the missing do not speak well for our claims as a righteous country with noble historical traditions.

Let us look and notice where our nations focus is at the moment. All our brilliant human capital is focused and preoccupied with defending the nation from the past and hardly any focus on the future. We have entangled ourselves in such a mess that all our best and brightest are occupied in dealing with and accounting for our actions in the past.

Did any of us take these into calculation when we embarked on a dreadful cycle of violence which is essentially a sad clash of nationalism and counter-nationalism? In saying this, I am not attributing blame and shame on anyone, but we need to imagine what could have been, if we had all been more sensible. We also need to recognize that we have a fresh opportunity to create our future and be mindful of the past.

The Tamil diaspora remains important as it has the potential to both positively work towards peace or be negative. The role it will play in the future will be influenced by the path that reconciliation and political solution take. Within the Tamil diaspora, there are also a variety of opinions. Whilst it is true that many within the Tamil diaspora supported a separate State, there is currently an enormous opportunity that exist for the diaspora to facilitate constructive dialogue towards devolution and reconciliation.

The Tamil diaspora remains a major financial contributor in the current restoration and rehabilitation of Tamils. This vastly untapped capacity must be formally encouraged by institutional and procedural arrangements to result in assisting local communities. We need them to help the local systems and capacities within Sri Lanka. By winning them over, such vast diaspora resources will provide a considerable scope towards peace and national development.

Then, Sir, the formidable defence posture of conventional forces stationed in the scale at present in the North-East of Sri Lanka cannot be justified as a national security need. What kind of war are you expecting from Tamils? The previous Sri Lankan Government, several years ago, announced to the whole world that the war is well and truly over. Then, it is disingenuous to try and argue that the presence of such a large security force is a national security requirement. The removal of all, but the basic number needed for national defence is important.

Although the State of Emergency, which had been in place for almost three decades, was lifted in August, 2012, many of the extraordinary powers provided by the Prevention of Terrorism Act - PTA - of 1979 are still being exercised. The PTA allows arrest for unspecified unlawful activities without a warrant and prolonged detention without charge. The PTA resulted in impunity for wrongful acts including torture.

John Fisher, Geneva Director at Human Rights Watch said on September 15th, An early test of the Governments sincerity will be if the Prevention of Terrorism Act is repealed and not simply replaced by another bad law with another name. So, that must be repealed forthwith.

Sir, the Tamil people must be able to sing the National Anthem in Tamil. There is no point in singing the National Anthem in Sinhala without knowing what you are singing about. We want to feel that this land is ours as much as any other Sri Lankan does. So, we need the right to sing the National Anthem in Tamil on the same tune.

The Report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission and the National Plan of Action to Implement the Recommendations of the LLRC were published as Governments process of reconciliation after three decades of war. It was five years ago that the LLRC published its initial Recommendations in September, 2010 and over three years have passed since the Cabinet approved the Plan of Action in July, 2012. But, we are still a long way from implementing even some of the key Recommendations and a focused attempt to implement all the Recommendations will assist in the process of reconciliation.

The Tamils have still not recovered from the shock of the devastation experienced in the past. We have been decimated physically, socially, economically, psychologically and our land and culture too have been devastated. It will be an uphill battle to address all these. However, we are at a juncture which will define this nations future. The uphill battle of rebuilding and reconciliation must start immediately.

Over 60 years of victimhood has placed the Tamils in such a dreadful state of mind and rebuilding and reconciliation will have to endure unique challenges with

distrust being on top of the list. We sincerely hope that there is recognition that addressing the economic needs and development of the North-East are fundamental prerequisites to facilitate post-war reconciliation in this country. Our people have suffered for so long and their continued suffering cannot be justified under any circumstances. We recognize that the ground realities and the context have substantially changed; we recognize that this is the time to be forward-looking and to give this great opportunity for permanent peace our best efforts because we owe it to our people and for that matter, for all Sri Lankans.

The promised Tokyo Donor Conference to address the immediate needs of the war-ravaged North-East will provide the kick-starter necessary to attempt to rise from the ashes. The mention of the Tokyo Donor Conference reminds us of the request the Hon. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghes previous Government made to the international community to assist in post-war development, which led to the Tokyo Conference on Reconstruction and Development of Sri Lanka. This Conference was steered by its Co-Chairs, namely the United States, Japan, Norway and the EU and that was first held in June, 2003. At this Conference, the international community pledged US Dollars 4.5 billion as aid for reconstruction and development of the North-East.

This was at a time when the war was on a state of no war, no peace and even at a time when the LTTE was invited, but they refused to participate at that Conference. So, you can now understand the reason for our enthusiasm and reliance on this donor conference to lift our people from their turmoil and we believe it is our duty to shelve any skepticism and provide our utmost support to the Government in that regard.

The Joint Declaration issued after the meeting the Sri Lankan delegation - which consisted of the Hon. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera and the Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha - had with the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in October, 2015 stated that Japan will support Sri Lanka in the promotion of investment and trade, provide cooperation on the National Development Plan in Sri Lanka and for national reconciliation and peace-building. However, there was no mention of a donor conference or of the role Japan will play in such initiatives. We also want the Government to keep us engaged and informed of the progress with regard to this conference.

A comprehensive needs assessment must be carried out in the war-affected North-East as a prerequisite for rehabilitation and development in the region. I emphasize that immediate steps must be taken to be in readiness for the promised donor conference. In 2014, a Joint Needs Assessment - JNA - was carried out to establish the needs

2857 2858

of the Northern Province and the data of this JNA provides a doorway for future studies to be conducted at district, provincial, national, regional and international levels. Also the JNA has improved the availability of accurate, quantifiable information on residual humanitarian and development needs. It provides a baseline for information on resilience, development and durable solutions through evidence-based data to ensure targeted assistance. It strengthens coordination and partnership between the Government and humanitarian and development partners. Such accurate information will facilitate mobilization of resources on evidence-based requests for funding. This JNA provides a rapid overview by sampling among the returned and remaining IDPs. Sir, targeted action for regional development with initiatives tailored specifically for individual villages and districts and engaging the beneficiaries in a participatory manner with community consultation in designing and execution of such initiatives will be the key for sustainability. Large infrastructure projects and large-scale businesses will not directly contribute to sustainable development of the war-ravaged North and the East. These projects will have only a limited ability to engage locals in rebuilding and recovery of the region. What is required are solutions that address the specific needs of the returnees and ensure social stability at the village level.

A significant aspect in addressing these needs is livelihood support through skills development and loan facilities. Human capacity development at individual, village and institutional levels is paramount for sustainable regional development. Vocational and skills development training should be provided to households, persons active in trade and youth engaged in construction-related services. Reinforcement of administrative capacity to act as an enabling mechanism to assist will provide fresh input for effective programme management.

Sir, the discourses in the past have come up with many proposals for devolution of power to achieve lasting peace in Sri Lanka.

Now, let us look at the current provincial council system. The status of the current provincial council system is dismal and its design and operation results in encouraging conflict than resolve.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Then, Sir, I will table* the rest of my speech.

Thank you.

* : * :: * Rest of the speech tabled:

The causes range from the Central Governments constant interference with ad-hoc top down operational direction and management. Central Government has the capacity to undermine devolved structure by legislation enacted overnight and has done it. The Central Government is still playing a larger role in many provincial affairs with its national policies and district secretariats.

Due to arbitrary pronouncements of national policies, this cannot be even described as decentralization. In fact, it would be ridicule to suggest that the current provincial council powers are devolution.

Let us look at the Local Government System. In order to revamp the local government bodies and to prepare them to take over higher order development responsibilities, the previous Government in 2009 developed and gazetted a National Policy on Local Government after the war but yet implemented. As a Government geared towards developing the rural economy and committed to a greater devolution and power sharing, it should implement the recommendations in this policy document forthwith.

Police powers are fundamentally important for rebuilding the North-East. How can we rebuild our decimated social structure without an indigenous or local level policing that has the capacity to respond in meaningful ways at the grassroots to issues to achieve social harmony.

Lands of the North and East must be dealt with like land in any other areas in Sri Lanka. It must be freely available for anyone to buy or sell on a fair market be they Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims or even foreigners.

Experiences of takeover of our lands that were owned privately and forcefully settling communities with Government assistance under engineered programmes must be avoided.

The Government in the past designed deliberately, settlement of communities as a tool for nationalistic agenda is what we strongly object to.

The land powers must be devolved with defined mechanisms to deal with resettlement issues.

Let me also mention about the Devolution Proposals of the past. The journey of the past 20 years in attempting to devolve powers to the North and East clearly lets us know the issues we need to be mindful in the future model, to ensure its stability and certainty.

The merger of the North and the East, which was an article of faith as far as Sri Lankan Tamils are concerned, was undone by a judicial pronouncement.

In fact, President Chandrika Kumaratunga, Hon. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Mahinda Rajapaksa were all willing to go beyond the 13th Amendment.

Mangala Moonesinghe Report, the draft 2000 Constitution and the Experts Committee Report - all of them have made positive recommendations which go far beyond the 13th Amendment.

President Rajapaksa appointed the All Party Representative Committee (APRC) in April, 2006 and talked about 13th Amendment Plus One. The One however, that was in the final Report of the APRC has so far not been made public.

TNA is committed to achieving a bright future for the Sri Lankan Tamil community in a united Sri Lanka, in which all citizens can live in dignity, equality and self-respect. To this end are prepared to work for a durable political solution through meaningful devolution of powers.

I now refer to the Proposal by the Hon. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The Hon. Prime Minister said at this Sujata Jayawardena Memorial Oration, the new constitution will focus on greater devolution of power to the provinces, within a unitary structure and explained that the Austrian model for provincial devolution was useful in this respect. The impending task before us is to identify additional powers that will be devolved to the province. It is my belief that these devolved powers should not revert to the centre, the Prime Minister said.

We are willing to explore any and every proposal put forward to us and every opportunity provided to us. We have in the past participated in many discourses and conferences and have expressed what we are seeking and the reasons for what we are seeking. So, we will continue to do that.

Sometimes, it is unfortunate that we keep getting mixed signals from the Government such as the initiative to introduce what is being described as "grassroots level reforms". Some 2,500 Gramarajya Development Centres (Sanwardhana Kendraya - GSK) are to be set up. This is clearly one that is designed to govern even the villages centrally from Colombo.

In conclusion, I wish to outline a way forward. We are announcing that we will constructively engage the Government in its reconciliation and devolution process. We also ask that the Government to be sensitive and not give mixed singles that could damage the credibility of this process as we too cannot miss this opportunity to achieve a permanent and lasting reconciliation.

Repealing of PTA, implementing key LLRC recommendation and removing the security forces from occupied private lands and releasing all the political prisoners will be a good start towards reconciliation and engender confidence.

To assist with the reconciliation, rehabilitation, recovery and regional development must start with local stakeholder participation. Centrally directed operational management will soon become counterproductive with negative consequences.

We recognize that 30 years of war has destroyed the human capacity to even engage in this mammoth task of rehabilitation and development in a meaningful way but this is an important step in reconciliation that we all must try and find ways to do. We will require significant external professional expertise to even participate in the planning for recovery at every levels of our society.

Further needs assessment must have local participation and even in the defining of its scope, without it being tempered by overblown security related consideration. The needs assessment should not simply a matter of finding out a wish list it must reflect a holistic approach to uplift our war-affected society.

It is essential that the Government and Sri Lanka take this opportunity for devolution, reconciliation and integrate the Tamils more effectively in the fabric of this nation. We welcome that the Government has demonstrated and expressed its interest in moving onto these political processes and we assure that we will engage with good faith in a constructive and forward-looking manner.

We have had many expressions of noble intention for reconciliation and rebuilding from various Sri Lankan governments and leaders. The inherent lack of will, not just residing at political level but it is in every layers of public and private sector resulting from slogans and campaigns carried out in the past and need to be addressed. In our history of reconciliation, we have a long list of resolutions, recommendations and action plans and every one of which would have benefited but never implemented.

The major issue in the past had been the lack of political will to look beyond immediate political gains. What is required is the long-term

interests of the country, a consensus, at least broadly, is required on the subject. We believe that the Government of today is in a position to do this and has the impetus to do.

I feel that a new chapter has opened in our attempt to achieve peace and reconciliation, we are eagerly awaiting for a devolution proposal that will enable our country to achieve what all of us yearn for, namely peace, stability and unity.

( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Aravindh Kumar) Sir, please give me one more minute. , . .

Since this is going to be my last speech for the year 2015, before I conclude I must mention a few words about the Hon. V.S. Radhakrishnan, the leader of Up-Country Peoples Front and Deputy Leader of the Tamil Progressive Alliance, who has been appointed as the State Minister of Education. I consider this a very important and a very responsible appointment. I represent the plantation community and I need not mention about the drawbacks of the educational levels and the educational system in the plantation areas. With his lengthy experience as the Provincial Minister of Education in the Central Province and with his ability and efficiency, I am confident that the Hon. V.S. Radhakrishnan will make a drastic change in uplifting the educational standards of the plantation community.

Finally, I take this opportunity to wish everyone who is present in this House a bright and a prosperous 2016.

Thank you, Sir. [.. 4.52] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce)

Our Leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe has ensured a Cabinet that can work, that have capabilities and honesty. Therefore, Sir, I place on record my appreciation for this Government for ensuring the promises given are fulfilled in the next year.

I remember very well the liberalization of international telecommunication lines. When Sri Lanka Telecom held the monopoly, a telephone call to America, for instance, was about Rs. 100 a minute. How did it come down to Rs. 10 a minute? Now, I think it must be about Rs. 3 a minute. That is because there was liberalization of international carrier transmission.
