( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ENTERPRISES ( ) (The Hon. DEW Gunasekara) I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for permitting me to present to this House, the Third or Final Report of the Committee on Public Enterprises for the year 2014, perhaps the last Report in the current Session of the Seventh Parliament. I have already submitted two Interim Reports for the year 2014, in keeping with my pledge to this House.

Sir, since you appointed me to this office as the Chairman of the COPE in June 2010, our Committee has hitherto presented six Reports in all - three Final Reports and three Interim Reports - having completed 627 examinations, during the period June 2010 to March 2015. We have brought under our scrutiny each and every institution assigned to us several times. This is an unprecedented record in the history of our Legislature.

Since the inception of the COPE in 1979, within a period of 31 years till 2010, the previous Committees on

285 286

Public Enterprises had completed 670 examinations, as compared with 627 examinations in this single session, within a period of less than five years. Our examinations have been both extensive and intensive. We have done on-the-spot investigations as well. Certain strategic business enterprises were summoned several times within a year.

Mr. Speaker, amongst the nearly 250 institutions assigned to the COPE, are educational institutions, research institutions, regulatory institutions, promotional institutions, banking and finance institutions and strategic business enterprises. We have now brought under the purview of the COPE, State-owned companies and subsidiaries registered under the Company Law and even those companies with a fair share of State capital.

Mr. Speaker, despite a heavy load of work and with the ever-increasing volume of work to be completed within a single calendar year, the Committee has been able to accomplish its constitutional task effectively and expeditiously earning the admiration of the people. The prestige of the COPE and, in consequence, the dignity of the House has been appreciably enhanced both nationally and internationally.

All this has happened under your astute leadership and I take this opportunity to offer our sincere thanks to you, Mr. Speaker, the Secretary-General of Parliament and his staff for their guidance, advice and support. I also take this opportunity to reiterate with emphasis, the imperative need for amendments to the Standing Orders in order to increase the COPEs powers, authority and capacity. I am happy that the Select Committee on Standing Orders has expressed its concurrence.

Quite modestly, our Committee claims credit to our share of contribution towards strengthening the concept of good governance through its performance. We have made in our Report, general observations as well as specific observations. Equally, we have made several short-term as well as far-reaching recommendations.

Despite all our efforts, there were still five institutions which have failed to submit their Annual Reports to the Cabinet and Parliament repeatedly for three years. There are two institutions which have earned unfavourable audit opinion repeatedly for four years. There was one strategic business enterprise, which had not prepared its financial statements for two years repeatedly. During the year under review, special focus and concentrated attention was given to 58 selected institutions, which are strategic business enterprises. We have commenced Performance Audit in addition to Financial Audit. A Follow-Up Committee - a new mechanism - has been introduced in order to ensure speedy and effective implementation of the COPEs directives and recommendations.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Committee, I wish to thank the Secretary of the COPE and her staff, the Auditor-General and his staff, the Director-General of Public Enterprises and his staff and the Director General of National Budget and his staff for their unstinted

cooperation. I also wish to thank the media for their response and critical support to the COPE. Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, the House must commend the Chairman and Members of the COPE for starting Performance Audit also and not restricting itself to Financial Audit. This will certainly strengthen the supervision that Parliament has over these institutions. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella - Minister of Plantation Industries and Leader of the House of Parliament) . , . . Question put, and agreed to. . . Ordered that the Report be printed.

( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful for this opportunity given to me to comment on the manner in which the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution is going to be placed before the House. I am afraid that it seems to violate all the principles of transparency and good governance on which the present Government was elected, and I am extremely sorry that this happened.

The manner in which the Draft was first prepared has already been described by several of my Colleagues and it indicates the complete absence of consultation, as promised in His Excellencys Manifesto. But, what was even worse was, after a discussion was held of Leaders of Political Parties under the Chairmanship of His Excellency, and the general consensus was that there should be some adjustment, this was not followed. I regret to say that the Hon. Prime Minister almost tearfully said that he would complain to former President, Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga about this, and it is a matter of great regret that following doubtless what was his personal complaint, we had a change in what it was claimed the Cabinet had agreed. But, what was also unfortunate is that the distinct directives given to the gentleman who drafted this, violated what was gazetted and certain provisions which the Supreme Court has very sensibly struck down were retained despite the clear consensus that they should be removed. Keeping the Prime Minister as Head of the Cabinet and allowing him unfettered discretion in the appointment of Ministers, all of which the Supreme Court has shown is completely in violation of the Constitution, was an arbitrary act. When I complained about this, the drafter simply said that it was a human error. He had not bothered to check on the mandate given to him to make sure that no such violation of the Constitution occurred and instead, he rather apologetically said, You know, people are human and they err and make mistakes. But, such mistakes are intolerable in a situation in which the supreme law of the land is being discussed. I am therefore, extremely grateful to the Court for having made it crystal clear that this type of tampering with a Constitution should not be allowed.

My Colleague from the Jathika Hela Urumaya pointed out that Constitutions are not meant to be made to serve the predilections of particular individuals. In a country that really follows the Westminster System, we really have resignations at this point when efforts to impose arbitrary mechanisms on the country are so categorically struck down by the Court.

I hope that those Members of this House who wanted good governance - I believe there are several of them in the United National Party as well as on this side of the House - will make clear that the traditions of Parliament need to be followed. In this case, I do not say that heads should roll, but people should accept responsibility for so endangering the reform agenda of His Excellency the President and concentrate on what we are all agreed on, which was that the excessive powers of the presidency should be reduced, instead of trying to transfer them elsewhere. This has been a tragic event and I hope it will not prevent the reforms we need.

In this context, Mr. Speaker, I hope very much that we will be able to strengthen Parliament. As was already done, - my Colleague who chaired the COPE mentioned the work of the Committee on Standing Orders - it remains now for that Committee to finalize work on consultative and sectoral committees. This is the way we move towards good governance and accountability. We need our code of conduct which was promised; we cannot confine reforms simply by transferring powers from one executive authority to another.

Thank you. ( , ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage) Thank you very much for allowing me to make a small intervention on this issue. I must, at the outset, point out that the suggestions that have been made by Members of the Opposition, particularly, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris and the Hon. Susil Premajayantha, are at variance. That is one matter. It is not clear as to whether the Hon. Susil Premajayantha would be satisfied if all the amendments, which had been presented before the Supreme Court are incorporated into the Bill and presented to the Members, that it would suffice. That is what the Government has undertaken to do so within the next few days; perhaps even tomorrow that would be made available.

But, then, let us examine the other issue of what the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris has espoused and the Hon. (Ven.) Athuraliye Rathana Thero has been espousing to present it altogether incorporating all those amendments as a Bill and once again to gazette it. That, I believe is a filibustering exercise for all purposes. I was present in the Supreme Court the other day when this matter was taken up; I must correct the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris. When the first counsel got up to make his submissions on behalf of the intervenient petitioners, the Court addressed all counsel and they wanted to discuss the methodology of hearing submissions. At that initial stage itself, the Attorney-General indicated to Court that he proposes to amend certain provisions of the Bill. The Court was

321 322

possessed of it. Immediately, those amendments were handed over to Court and counsel reserved their right to make submissions on those issues as well, taking them into consideration.

Having said that, now if we are to allow this exercise of once again gazetting provisions of a Bill which has already been subject to examination by Court, to which a pronouncement has already been made, it will be virtually giving what you would call in English a second bite at the cherry. For whom? For the same people. It is a futile and superficial exercise once again on a matter upon which the Court has already made pronouncements. So, such things have never happened before.

Now, if you take the instance of Court itself, on its own volition, can suggest changes to an already existing Bill, to bring it in line with the requirement of the Constitution. This has happened several times. The Attorney-General as the law officer of the State, at the very outset, before the Supreme Court has indicated that he was going to amend certain provisions of the Bill. I do not agree with the contention that the contents of the amendments were at variance with the substance of the Bill itself. That is certainly not so. It was almost in keeping with the substance of the Bill itself. Therefore, if you concede the arguments of the Hon. Members and if you are to once again gazette this Bill, which has already been subject to examination by Court, it is virtually a superficial exercise and it is going to be totally a futile exercise. It has never happened before.

Therefore, I urge the Hon. Speaker to follow the procedure that has been suggested by the Hon. Susil Premajayantha and take up this Bill for debate. The Hon. Prime Minister has already indicated that he is dropping those provisions regarding which a referendum is required.

Thank you.

I quote:

The Supreme Court shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction to determine any question as to whether any Bill or any provision thereof is inconsistent with the Constitution :

Provided that -

(a) in the case of a Bill described in its long title as being for the amendment of any provision of the Constitution, or for the repeal and replacement of the Constitution, the only question which the Supreme Court may determine is whether such Bill requires approval by the People at a Referendum by virtue of the provisions of Article 83;"

123 (1) . I quote:

The determination of the Supreme Court shall be accompanied by the reasons therefor

Then, Article 123 (2) states, I quote:

Where the Supreme Court determines that the Bill or any provision thereof is inconsistent with the Constitution, it shall also state -

(a) whether such Bill is required to comply with the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 82 ; or

(b) whether such Bill or any provision thereof may only be passed by the special majority required under the provisions of paragraph (2) of Article 84 ; or

Referendum . . . . .

325 326

. , . . .

I tend to disagree with my Friend, the Minister of Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage, who mentioned the word, filibustering. If you use the word, filibustering, you accept that there is a certain error. If you accept that there is a certain error and then say, Do not filibuster, that is not fair. We are trying to deal with Constitutional Amendments. There could be any other amendments the Bench can hear, the Bench has heard, the Bench has proposed amendments, but in relation to Constitutional Amendments, the Bench cannot propose anything as an amendment. That is where it lies. The Constitution is very clear. It says when "shall" only refer, whether a two-thirds - obviously amendments to the Constitution need a two-thirds - plus a Referendum is necessary.

. - - . . . 10 , .

I was present in Court, just as you were. It was not agreed by the lawyers who represented the petitioners. These amendments had not been incorporated in the Bill; that is a right that was not given. It did not come to Parliament. It went straight to the Supreme Court. It had never happened in relation to a Constitutional amendment, Hon. Speaker. It can happen in a dialogue on any other Bill.

Secondly, the Provisions that have been struck down by the - [Interruption.] I did not disturb you. I have only denied what you have said. I did not want to deny that at that time. Kindly let me finish my speech.

Secondly, the Provisions which the Supreme Court says require a Referendum, are ones that will apply after the term of the incumbent President. So, as far as we are concerned, those do not apply to any of us.

But, that does not make the Committee Stage procedure any different. . . , , . ; . . .

Thilakawardanes judgment, prior approval of Parliament was required for raising any foreign commercial loans or, for that matter, issuing any foreign bonds. But, when the amendment was brought in, what was certified by the Attorney-General at that time was something else. You have raised a lot of money after that without coming to Parliament. Now, we are looking at ways and means of amending that and including it. This is what happens in the case of amendments.

My Friend spoke of all these proposals. . , , , , . . . , . Not only were copies given, but this was also discussed. The Determination of the Supreme Court, on page 12, states, I quote:

The thrust of the submission of Mr. Gomin Dayasiri was that paragraph 14A(1) enables even foreigners to receive benefits as they become the beneficiaries of the rights by virtue of the synthetic definition of a citizen .

13 . :

Having considered the submissions of the Counsel, the Hon. Attorney General informs Court that he wishes to bring in the following amendments at the Committee stage:"

? . , .

13 :

" (a) to delete the words 'held by' in above 14A(1) and following to be added thereof -

'Being information that is required for the exercise or protection of the citizens rights held by any person of.'

(b) In paragraph 14A(2) after the word privacy, following words to be interpolated -

Contempt of Court, Parliamentary privilege. In paragraph 14A(2) to delete the words 'information received' and to replace with 'information communicated' ".

, . 13 :

"It was the submission of the Counsel that the sub-paragraph 14A(1)(d) violates the rights of the people. However, the Hon. Attorney General has agreed to delete the above 14A(1)(d), and to replace it with the following provision:-

329 330

14A(1)(d) Any other person, being information that is required for the exercise or protection of the citizens right of access to information in relation to a person or an institution referred to in sub-paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this paragraph."

, , ", . 14A (1) (d) " . ", " . .

, . , . . , , , , , . , . , . How can you say, Hon. Member, that the Court did not consider what the counsel said? You are estopped from taking it. The Court has considered it; the lawyers have considered it; the lawyers have agreed. Mr. Gomin Dayasiri, once given the Amendment said, "That is not enough, I want more". So, he was given more.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, I want to raise one more matter. , . Page No. 7 of the Supreme Court Determination states, I quote:

Clearly, the Constitution did not intend the President to function as an unfettered repository of executive power unconstrained by the other organs of governance.

.

It further states, I quote:

the Cabinet collectively is charged with the exercise of Executive power, which is expressed as the direction and control of the Government of the Republic and the collective responsibility of Cabinet, of which the President is the Head. It establishes conclusively that the President is not the sole repository of Executive power under the Constitution. It is the Cabinet of Ministers collectively, and not the President alone, which is charged with the direction and control of Government. Further, this Cabinet is answerable to Parliament.

, .

Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

333 334

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake - Minister of Tourism and Sports) Hon. Speaker, let me speak a few words on this occasion. In my opinion, the system has worked, Hon. Speaker, because the intervenient petitioners have been able to go to court and get a clear judgment. Earlier, whether this was possible or not is a question. Certainly, under this Government, the Supreme Court is much more independent. That, we all know. Earlier, it was not the case. As you know, in several cases under the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, there was no independence of the judiciary at all. But, on this occasion, no telephone calls went from the Presidents House or the Prime Ministers Office to the Supreme Court. That is very clear. So, we have given an independent judiciary to this country. That is one of the most fundamental aspects of the separation of powers.

I can talk from my personal experience. When my father signed the Impeachment Motion against President R. Premadasa, Justice Mark Fernando held with my father and the Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali saying that natural justice was not given. But, the other two Judges did not. All I can say is that when I look back on history, if my father and the Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali were in Parliament, this Parliament would have been much more richer.

Then, I come to the Eighteenth Amendment. I voted for the Eighteenth Amendment. Now, I have to absolve myself from that. I understand the mistake I made and I am asking you also to understand and tap your heart and re-correct that mistake by being with us on this occasion. This is the ideal occasion for that. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella clearly showed you how that Amendment was brought. We had only two or three days to analyse and examine that. You all know that the Eighteenth Amendment was a dynastic amendment to keep the Rajapaksa family in power. You all know that; we all know that. Who were the people who drafted this? Now, they can come and speak in glowing terms about what happened. But, we know what really happened. We raised our hands to the Eighteenth Amendment. So, let us be honest to ourselves and as free citizens of this country, tap our conscience and rectify this cursed Eighteenth Amendment and get rid of it. I earnestly ask you that.

Then, of course, there is a view - it is a wrong view - that this is an individual-based agenda. Actually, when we look at the provisions in the Nineteenth Amendment, we should not look at the individuals; we should look at the system; we should look at the system of powers and functions that is given by the Constitution and how the power flows. That is our role. The sovereignty of the people is supreme. Therefore, whether the Hon. Ranil

Wickremasinghe, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena or the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris is the Prime Minister, that is not the issue. Surely, we must be objective now and make a correct perspective of where the Constitutional power should lie. We have made huge mistakes in this country. I remember my father again. He did not want to vote for the resolution to deprive Mrs. Bandaranaikes of her civic rights. He spoke against it in the Cabinet. But, then, ultimately he had to come to this House and raise his hand. That is the system that we are all trapped in. We have to understand that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) We voted against it. ( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) Congratulations! I raise my hat to you. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) We were the party who defended Mrs. Bandaranaike in Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake) You were not in the UNP, though.

The three-line whip that is there is very stringent. All party Members have to bow to that.

Then, I just want to mention to you about the transfer of powers. I went through the transfer of powers to the Prime Minister. Actually, my interpretation of this is that this is a clarification of powers. If I was the Prime Minister, I would know exactly what I would want to do. So, in one way, although it is not the Westminster System of traditional transfer of powers, I would look at this more as a Napoleonic coding of powers to the Prime Minister. Certainly, if I was the Prime Minister and heading the Cabinet, I would want to be able to make changes in the Cabinet; of people I want to bring in and leave out. That option should be mine. So, what we have to do is, re-focus our minds to the understanding that there is going to be a tremendous transfer of powers from the President to the Prime Minister. It has been argued in this House and the perception that is being given is that this is Ranil Wickremasinghes agenda to transfer powers to himself. Actually it is not. Whoever is the Head of the Government has to have the majority of the House. He has to command the respect of the House. So, it can be anybody. So, the Constitutional powers of the Cabinet such as assigning of subjects, division of subjects, have to be in the Prime Ministers hands. It does not mean that there has to be a conflict with the President.

335 336

2015 09

The Finnish Model is very clear on this and I would just like to say that the Finnish Model is a good example for all of us to examine with regard to this issue. In the Finnish Model, the transfer of powers from the President to the Prime Minister happened. The President became more of a conciliator, an arbitrator of problems and a symbol of sovereignty and respect for the country. But, the clear head of the Cabinet was the Prime Minister. So, this is not an issue of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Hon. Navin Dissanayake, or any individual Prime Minster. It is actually the collective system, the objective system that this country needs; this House has to debate and take decisions.

This is a historic moment for us; let us not miss this opportunity. Let us not play petty politics in this instance. My generation was ruined because of petty politics. You do not have to do that anymore. We have a President from one party; we have a Prime Minister from another party. This is an ideal opportunity and I urge all of you to join hands with us. If we do not do this, I feel history will curse all of us.

Thank you.
