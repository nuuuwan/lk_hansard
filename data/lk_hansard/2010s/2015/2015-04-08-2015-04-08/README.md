[5.01 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Presiding Member, I am glad to speak on the Regulations under the Registration of Title Act. These Regulations was published in the Order Paper in October 2014, under the previous Government. Today, our Government, which is a Government of cooperation between the two major political parties in this country together with many of the minor parties, has brought this up for approval by Parliament. This is one piece of legislation or regulation which has been accepted by all as beneficial to the public and, as such, we have brought it up here with full cooperation, without any ill-will. We are sure that nobody will vote against it today. Unfortunately, though the House is depleted, still this is something that everybody is going to accept.

The Registration of Title Act itself was a positive piece of legislation. The Regulations brought up here today are a further improvement to see that every piece of land can be identified in a more easy manner, whereas in the past under the original Ordinance, there were so many difficulties in identifying the lands that had been registered. That led to many frauds and abuse because there was no clear identification of the property that had been registered. Today, we are including certain numbers for these properties; we are including the assessment numbers into the document that is going to be registered with the Land Commissioner. By doing this, so many issues that come up between owners of properties and so many disputes that arise between people are attended to. Therefore, it is a very positive piece of legislation or regulation.

Likewise, there are many issues that have come up since the 1978 Constitution was adopted. We introduced the Presidential system of governance. In the initial years, nobody thought that that was a bad thing; everyone thought that it was necessary for a developing country. Nobody thought that the President could become a monster with too much powers. So, the people did not initially ask for any change in the Presidential system. But, subsequently, over the years, the abuse of the powers vested in the President brought us to a stage where everyone was asking for the abolition of the Executive Presidency. Our new Government, led by His Excellency

Maithripala Sirisena, pledged to abolish the Executive Presidency, restore the Seventeenth Amendment, and bring in good governance to this country. In this attempt, we all have to cooperate by forgetting our party affiliations, for the good of the people and for this country, like we do for these regulations. So, this is why we request for the cooperation of all to implement the 100-day programme of President Maithripala Sirisena, which was sponsored, supported and has received the mandate of the people on 8th January, 2015 with the cooperation of the United National Party.

At the same time, since we are talking about land issues today, I wish to point out a few things about the plantation people and their land rights. Even today, a few people who have liberated themselves from life in the plantations have moved to urban areas or semi-urban areas and they have been able to buy land on their own. That is just a handful of people, maybe less than 5 per cent of the Indian-origin Tamil population in this country. They have bought lands; they have built homes; they have built industries, shops and various things like any other person in this country. But, most of the people of Indian origin live within estates, in houses built by the British planters over 150 years ago. They have no land rights; they have no rights even over their homes - the line rooms that they live in - and they have been agitating for land, for separate houses, for ownership of their houses. This is the issue that the present Government accepted and put before the people under the 100-day programme where we said, "We will give separate houses with ownership for those houses to the people in the plantations". This was a very attractive slogan. It should not remain a mere slogan. It has to become a reality.

In 1995, the first Ministry for Estate Housing was created by the former President, Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunga and the late Minister, Hon. P. Chandrasekeran was appointed as Deputy Minister in charge of Estate Housing under the then Housing Minister. For the first time, separate houses were built in the plantations on seven perches of land. They were not given deeds. Nobody would build a house on a land that does not give you ownership, but the people in the plantations, who thought having a separate house itself is a great boon to their life, accepted these seven perches, used the grants, the money given by the Government, used the loan money given by the Government, invested their savings and built these houses on seven perches of land without a deed. The house belongs to them, but the land belongs to the State and it is vested in the LRC. Now, it is more than 20 years since this process started. Many of them have now settled the loans payable to the NHDA and they are waiting to receive the deeds for those houses, so that they can actually call it their own, because they believe that they would never be evicted if it is owned by them and they did spend their own money to build on those lands.

The Hon. Minister for Housing, Hon. Sajith Premadasa has already put up a Cabinet Paper for some houses in estates in the South. Lands have been vested in the NHDA from the Land Reform Commission and he is preparing to issue deeds. A similar process is necessary in the upcountry where 23,000 houses have been built under this scheme and about 6,000 people have already paid up their loans and are awaiting the receipt of deeds. The LRC at one time said that the lands can be vested only in the Estate Worker Housing Co-operative Societies and not in the people. Those have to change now. Today, every single worker in the plantations is a citizen of Sri Lanka. He is entitled to land; he is entitled to register lands in his name. So, these people have to be given the land and the houses individually for their own use and for enjoying their ownership. There is some difficulty or some reluctance on the part of the LRC to do what they did in the South to the people in the up-country, which is unfortunate. I have spoken to the Hon. Minister of Lands. He has agreed to look into this issue and clear it for us. This has to be done if all people in this country - the people in the South as well as the people in the upcountry - are to be treated equally.

It has been the practice to have land kachcheries where landless people are given lands. A land between 40 perches up to two acres is given to a family in this country. But, as far as the plantation workers are concerned, in the past, only seven perches of land was given for building houses. But, in 1973, when the Land Reform Act itself was passed by Parliament, it was considered that an estate-worker family requires one-eighth of an acre or 20 perches of land for their living. When the determination was made for 50 acres of land to an individual, which was the ceiling then, that 50 acres of land was given with an additional two or three acres, which were calculated on the basis of 20 perches or one-eighth of an acre for each worker working in that particular plantation or estate. On that basis, many persons who received their 50 acres have received two or three acres extra to accommodate the workers working in those estates. But, today, some of these estate owners are trying to evict the workers from their private estate. These extra two or three acres were given to them on behalf of the workers who were working there. So, that extra land available to that owner, due to the number of workers he had at that time, should actually be owned by those workers. Therefore, it is unfortunate and unethical for the owners of those private estates to attempt to evict workers because they do not serve them today.

This community came from India in 1834. They have been living here for 180 years. They have served this nation handsomely by contributing to the economy, contributing to the foreign exchange earnings and to the wealth and well-being of this country. They deserve a better deal. So, I feel that these workers must be given full

rights with title deeds for those 20 perches and they should never be evicted. Also, when housing land is given in estates in the past, seven perches have been given. But, seven perches of land is not enough for an agricultural family. Any estate worker is an agricultural worker. Being an agricultural worker, he needs land around his house where he can cultivate some vegetables, have a cow for milk, or have some poultry for eggs or meat, or rear a few goats. These are vocations that are related to a farmer and agricultural workers. So, why should we deny these?

For this purpose, I feel that whenever land is given for housing in estates, it should be increased from seven perches to twenty perches. That would be the most fair thing to do for this community that has worked so hard for this country for 180 years, for six generations without a break. Thank you.
