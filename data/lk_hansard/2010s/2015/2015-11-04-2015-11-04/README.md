.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Speaker, this is not a matter that is sub judice. When a "B" Report is filed in court that does not mean that the matter is pending adjudication. If there is a court case that has started, the matter is pending adjudication. It is only then that the Parliament refrains from going into the matter. Just filing a "B" Report does not mean that a matter is before court for adjudication. Even previously, there have been Rulings from the Chair that a "B" Report does not necessarily mean that a matter is sub judice. I concur with the Hon. Anura Dissanayake that this is a matter that is of great public importance and this must be debated. Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . sentence , " " . . . 84 (vi) , . ( ) (The Hon.

, . . , . . , . ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) .

, .. . [2.36 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am glad to second the Motion proposed so eloquently in his inimitable style by the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, as always, at the Adjournment time on a matter that is so important to the country today. It was not just one transaction, but a myriad of issues that he adverted to, as he proposed this Motion.

With regard to the issue at hand, namely, the matter regarding the Avant Garde Floating Armoury, I am conscious of the Ruling given from the Chair this afternoon. I will abide by that and refrain from straying into certain areas which might become matters of judicial investigation even on a subsequent date. I am saying that because I am aware of some of the serious implications of this particular transaction. I agree with the Hon. Member who proposed the Motion, that this indeed is a very serious matter that confronts this country.

This Adjournment Debate assumes a very strange nature. As the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake was proposing it - I watched with interest - many Members from the Government Side were nodding vigorously in agreement with him. This is strange for the reason that - for the first time I witnessed this in the House - even after the Hon. Member named several Ministers, not one raised an objection, except the Hon. Leader of the House and that also by way of clarification to exonerate himself and to say that he is not guilty of the charge that was being made. But the rest of the Ministers, although named, sat quietly and listened. Even when the Hon.Member challenged to deny charges if they could, they sat still, confirming to the country that the charges that were being made are in fact true.

195 196

For the first time, when a floating armoury was discovered off the coast of Galle, the country was aghast. People in the country had a rude shock - how come a ship full of lethal weapons has been found? Because until then no one in the country knew of these transactions.

Then it transpired that it is not just one ship but there are a few more. Some ships were anchored off the coast in Africa in different names - "Sinbad" et cetera. All ships were full of weapons and these weapons were being rented out. In Africa you rent out weapons and you know or you do not know who eventually gets to use those weapons. That is one side of the story. The other issue was the legality of these operations. As the Proposer said, the Hon. Prime Minister himself in answering a Question in this House has confirmed that none of these weapons have been licensed. So, unlicensed weapons on the high seas or even crossing maritime boundaries of several States, raise very serious issues.

Apart from all of that, even restricting it to issues of corruption, many other questions arise. What are these companies? How did these companies come about? Who are the shareholders of these companies? We saw over the last several years a number of these companies mushrooming and once we saw the spectacle of one of the companies - Lanka Logistics Limited - having as its shareholder a certain "Peter Mohan Maithree Peiris" who, for a period of two years illegally sat in the chair of the Chief Justice of this country. He is a shareholder and there are several others who held posts of Secretaries of important ministries - even Secretary to the Treasury. What were they doing with these weapons?

As the Hon. Members know, all of these lethal weapons have serial numbers and if they were bought legally by the Government of Sri Lanka, it is all recorded in books including the serial numbers. I am raising the question as to whether the serial numbers on the weapons that are found from time to time in different ships, match the serial numbers of the weapons imported by the Government of Sri Lanka? Because, I am given to understand that those weapons are treated in the books as "unserviceable" or "obsolete" and have been condemned and destroyed. You condemn those as "unserviceable" and you write in your books that these weapons have been destroyed therefore; but they find themselves in the hold of a ship being sold and rented out to various unsavory elements in Africa and beyond. God knows whether ISIS is using any of your weapons. The country is entitled to know the exact nature of this transaction. You cannot play hide-and-seek in this. If there is an offence, you apprehend the offenders and you try them for that offence. But a feature as serious as this, certainly, the country is entitled to know. Why has this issue been kept under wraps up to now?

Whilst this is going on, the Proposer mentioned several other instances of suspects going scot-free. I will raise one or two issues before I sit down.

During the election campaign or just prior to that, the former President went to Kilinochchi and distributed gold jewellery to people who, he said, were the owners of that gold jewellery. This gold was taken into custody at the end of the war in 2009. What was the former President doing with that gold jewellery for five or six years? It obviously was in his custody. Did he give those to his wife to wear them for ceremonies? We have raised in this House the quantity of gold so recovered at the end of the war. This is not even one tenth. Where is the balance gold taken from our people? We have information and that is true. The former President was able to give it to the rightful owners because those were all neatly packed in cellophane bags with names of owners written. What happened to the balance? Where is it? Where is the balance gold?

With regard to people who are allowed to go scot-free, we still have the spectacle of KP not being produced before Court, despite a writ application filed by the Hon. Vijitha Herath. So far, the Government or the authorities in the Attorney-Generals Department do not seem to know whether he has committed any offence or not. When such is the state of affairs, we have over 200 Tamil political prisoners and I repeat, Tamil political prisoners, who are imprisoned for over 20 years - some of them over 20 years. For offences that they are charged, if they are convicted, the punishment will not even stretch for seven years; and Ministers are quick to say that there are no political prisoners in this country.

I say they are "political prisoners" because if you choose to treat the CEO of Avant Garde this way and if you choose to treat the suspect in the "sill redi" case in one way - where the information is that if it is an offence against public property and if it is over Rs. 25,000, there is no bail - people languish in prison for years before they are able to show exceptional circumstances before getting bail. Here is a case of one being able to go to High Court directly and walk out as if he just attended a party and going back home. I am asking the question, why are the Tamil political prisoners treated differently? Is it because they are Tamils and Lalith Weeratunga and Nissanka Senadhipathi are Sinhalese?

What happened to the assurances given to them by no less a person than the President himself on the 17th of October? I was present when the Commissioner of Prisons gave that assurance to the prisoners when they were on the sixth day of their fast. He said that before the 31st of October their releases will commence and conclude before the 07th of November. We are on the 04th of November today and no steps have been taken. I must add, the assurance said, except those who are accused of heinous crimes. That is all right. There are more than 200 people. Not all 200 are accused of heinous

197 198

crimes or whatever that you describe it to be. Some of them, I know personally, are only accused under Section 5 - failure to give information to the police - and they are there for over 15 years. I am raising this issue because you have just three days more with regard to the keeping the assurance that the Government gave to the Tamil political prisoners.

The Government is obviously guilty, admitting to be guilty, from what the Deputy Minister, Hon. Ajith Perera, just said before I even seconded the Motion. I thought he was going to second the Motion, so enthusiastic he was. These things must be rectified. We supported the change on several fronts, especially on anti-corruption. If this is the way the Government conducts itself, I am afraid, this Government will not stand another year.

Thank you very much. ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale - Minister of Foreign Employment) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale) . , . . . . . , . ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) .

Minister, I appreciate that you made the disclosure of your personal involvement in the case. That, you should do and you have properly done that. But, should you be going into the transaction, stating matters of fact that might cross the boundaries of the Hon. Speakers Ruling this afternoon, as well as what you have got to know in your professional capacity? ( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) As for the Hon. Speakers Ruling , Hon. Member, you would realize that the Debate itself is titled " ". So, the Debate itself is on Avant Garde. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, having made the disclosure of your personal involvement in the capacity as lawyer advising a client, you can still speak, but, as you yourself said, you cannot disclose privileged information you have gathered as well as - ( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) If my client is agreeable - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Even if your client gives you permission, in a Debate in the House, -

( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) But, this is relevant to the issue.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is why I raised it as a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) This is relevant to the Debate. Otherwise, there is no point in debating it. If you do not allow me to speak in regard to these facts, this Debate will be one-sided. You all are slandering this man; saying that he is a rogue, he is a cheat, he is a fraud and that this is the biggest fraud on this side of the Suez Canal. - [Interruption.] You are not allowing me to speak a word for him. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Marapana, you have only one more minute. Please conclude your speech. ( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) I have not even started my speech, Sir. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Then, you have to ask from your Party whether they can give you more time. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am only raising the issue of propriety. ( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) Propriety in regard to privilege, is a matter that I am aware of and so long as my client has given me permission to speak, then there is no violation. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I have another issue for your consideration. ( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) Yes? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is, even if your client has given you permission to speak, when you speak in the House, whatever you say is privileged and then it becomes difficult thereafter to carry on further investigations.

203 204

( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) No. Why should it be difficult? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is why I linked what you are saying to the Hon. Speakers Ruling in the afternoon. ( ) (The Hon. Tilak Marapana) Then, in that event, whatever was spoken against the person concerned will also become privileged and you cannot conduct any investigation on that. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Anybody else can speak, but then, who is to say - ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Marapana, you may have to conclude now. ( ) (The Hon.

Sir, when I was in government service as the DMO, Base Hospital, Vavuniya, there was a case referred to me. An eight-year old boy was sexually assaulted by a 14-year old boy. That particular incident had been witnessed by a 12-year old girl. This happened in 2004. Then, in 2014, I was called to give evidence in court. At that time, I was a Member of the Provincial Council and that particular boy, the suspect, was married. He appeared in court with his wife. The witness was a university student. She came to court with reluctance. As I was a Member of the Provincial Council, I also appeared before court reluctantly. Ultimately, only after ten years' time, the case was taken up. Actually, this has been the real situation in this country.
