(a) (i) Import potential of the Gross Official Reserves (2000-2014)

Sir, I would like to mention that the Reserves are increasing.

(ii) Import potential of the Gross Official Reserves in terms of coverage of goods and services (2000 -2014)

Sir, the months of imports of goods for 2015, as of today, are 5.8 and the months of imports of goods and services for 2015, as of today, are 5.1.

(iii) Import potential of the total foreign assets (2000 - 2014)

(iv) Gross official reserves amounted to US Dollars 6.8 billion by end September 2015. In terms of the number of months of imports, this level of reserves was equivalent to 4.2 months of imports, well above the internationally accepted benchmark of 3 months of imports.

At this moment, our gross official reserves stands at US Dollars 7.6 billion.

(v) In the first nine months of the year, foreign exchange outflows which were primarily driven by the settlement of the matured International Sovereign Bond, IMF-SBA repayments, foreign currency debt service payments and the supply of liquidity to the domestic foreign exchange market had an impact on the level of gross official reserves. Meanwhile, with the proceeds of the ninth International Sovereign Bond issuance of US Dollars 1.5 billion in late October, 2015, gross official reserves are estimated to have improved further.

It was as low as US Dollars 6.8 billion by end September because your Government borrowed recklessly at an absolutely high rate without any rhyme or reason. As a result, a bullet payment had to be made on the 10th of October and the outflow of US Dollars 500 had an impact on the amount. But we were able to mop up and mobilize further funding and we have been able to move up to US Dollars 7.6 billion as I told you a little while ago.

, . 13 . , 13 - Operative Paragraph - :

Also welcomes the commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to sign and ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance without delay, to criminalize enforced disappearances and to begin to issue certificates of absence to the families of missing persons as a temporary measure of relief;

Certificate of absence . . , - [Interruption.] That is what I am building up. I will tell you. That is a good question. If you look at the present position, there are 95 signatories and 51 parties to the Convention who have ratified it. If you look at the list, India has only signed it, and India signed it way back on the 6th of February, 2007. Then, Maldives has signed it on the 6th of February, 2007. That is long before even Sri Lanka decided to sign it - let alone ratify it. Now Sri Lanka has done it yesterday, as I mentioned, to coincide with the International Human Rights Day. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera - Minister of Foreign Affairs) And we presented it - ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Yes. I can remember when the Hon. Minister presented the Cabinet Paper, he mentioned to the Cabinet

1539 1540

that he wants to bring it before Parliament and not only that, he also wants to put in place enabling legislation to give effect to this. Any country can sign these things. But the implementation- ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) We will do so in the first quarter. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) There you are! You got it from the horses mouth.

So, these are progressive steps. That is a good thing. Actually, we must do this. We were isolated as a result of not appreciating that these kinds of steps should be taken. I would think that this decision, to sign the Convention yesterday, will once again further consolidate the international support that we have been receiving since the election of President Sirisena on the 08th of January.

The other thing I would like to mention is an article that I saw in the "Daily Mirror" on the 09th of December, 2015. Former Minister, Prof. G.L. Peiris states, I quote:

Accepting UK help for military reforms dangerous: GL

That is the headline of this article. Then, he goes on to state, I quote:

An offer by the UK to provide UKP six million to upgrade Sri Lankan Armed forces and a move followed by the offer to appoint the Military Attach of the UK High Commission in New Delhi to oversee these reforms were detrimental to the national security of the country, former External Affairs Minister Professor G.L. Peiris said today.

When I saw this, what came to my mind immediately was as to what this Professor - the former Minister of External Affairs - was doing when submarines came to Sri Lanka. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe - State Minister of International Trade) Two submarines!

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Two submarines came to Sri Lanka. No one knew about that. Did he, at that time, as the Minister of External Affairs, come out and say this is wrong? ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) These were docked in Colombo.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Yes, these were docked in Colombo. It came in the newspapers and it is only then we knew that this has happened. The Prime Minister clarified the position subsequently and he said, Anyone can use the facilities at the Colombo Port or any of our other ports. But we want to do it in a transparent manner." It is not good when these things are done in an underhanded manner or in a secretive manner. Sir, you know that in Sri Lanka you can never keep secrets. Even the Cabinet discussions we read next day in the newspapers. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Hon. Minister, those were military submarines, not normal submarines. ( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) Yes, those were military submarines. Even the military submarines can come, but it should be done in a transparent manner, as the Prime Minister said. Those facilities can be given to anyone, that is not an issue. So, what happens when this kind of thing takes place? Our traditional friends get alarmed. They feel that there is a military secret, military partnership that is being played out and they feel betrayed. They feel that it is dangerous to their own sovereignty. I do not want to mention names but, we know the alarm bells that rang as a result of that incident.

So, I cannot understand as to why the former Minister of External Affairs is talking about Pounds 6 million being offered to Sri Lanka to strengthen the military and being silent on so many other events that took place. I do not want to mention them now due to lack of time. I can take this as an example to say that it was a dual policy that was being followed. Now we have a transparent effort that is going to be put in place.

What I want to state for the record Sir, is that we have had military ties with a number of countries over the years. Even during the previous Government, we had joint military exercises; we had training opportunities that were given to the officers of our armed forces and some were brought here even for the training on IHL issues - International Humanitarian Law issues. Also we worked with the ICRC very closely even during the war to strengthen the army in the IHL area. So, there had been so many exchanges that have taken place, which is good for the armed forces. We have had exchanges with the US; we have had exchanges with the UK; we have had exchanges even with Poland, for example. When I was browsing the internet I saw those. Even with India we have had exchanges since 2012. So, this will continue. I do not think everything has to be looked at in the context

1541 1542

of what is useful politically. I think now we have to stop slinging political mud and join forces to ensure that this country prospers in the future and we are once again a member of the international community. We were virtually banished in the past which was to our disadvantage. Now things are moving in the right direction.

Once again, I want to place on record that all these have been made possible because of the acceptance that His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena has received internationally. When a country decides on the policy of another country, they look at the Head of State - in our case especially the Head of State because the executive power is vested in the President. So, they look at how the President acts, behaves and talks. What the President has done in the past 11 to 12 months is commendable. We had Samantha Power coming as a result of an invitation extended by the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs. She came here and made a public statement to say that Asian and African leaders must take President Sirisena as an example. Did we ever dream that this kind of a statement would be made by the most powerful country in the world - one of the leading diplomats and a member of the Cabinet in the US? That is not something stated by just an ambassador. The US Permanent Representative in the UN is a member of the Cabinet. So, this is just one example. There are so many other examples.

Sir, before I wind up I also want to place on record my gratitude to the Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale.

, demand , , . . . . . . [1.52p.m.] () ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe - Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana) Hon. Presiding Member, today we are discussing the Votes of two very important Ministries: the Ministry of Foreign Employment and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Sir, first of all, I take this opportunity to commend the yeoman service rendered by our present Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, during this short span of time since our "silent revolution" which occurred in this country on the 08th of January this year.

Sir, we knew that our Foreign Service or the Diplomatic Service was in total disarray in the recent past. We are proud to say that even at the time when we achieved Independence in 1948 and even thereafter for several decades, we had the best Diplomatic Service in Asia. But, gradually, this situation deteriorated, specially due to the fact that there was too much of political intervention in diplomatic relations as well as due to the lack of experience and wisdom on the part of the rulers who ruled this country.

We know that throughout history, our leaders had special affiliations with various countries in the world. Some say that the late President J.R. Jayewardene had special regard for the United States, the European Union and also for Japan; and the late Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike had very special relationships with countries like China and Yugoslavia. But, with all that, they were mindful of the fact that, throughout they maintain their bilateral relations or a good relationship with our neighbouring country India and the other countries in Asia.

At the beginning of the last regime - in fact, I warned the former Government during that period itself - when

1543 1544

they appointed Dr. Palitha Kohona as the Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we knew that our foreign relations would be in disarray. Not that we had any animosity towards Dr. Palitha Kohona or any grievance against him - he is a learned gentleman who had been a citizen of a different country for a long period. He had not much experience or knowledge about the recent past of this country and had not even visited the country for a long period. And as a matter of principle, no country has ever appointed as Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs a person who is not a citizen of that country. In addition to that, as a result of appointing non-citizens as our High Commissioners and Ambassadors to various countries by the last regime - some of which were most important countries like the United States and the United Kingdom - gradually our foreign relations deteriorated.

Also of course there was a serious deterioration in the human rights situation in this country with violations of human rights in various sectors. When there is a civil war, that is unavoidable. Nobody will find fault with it very seriously when there are violations of human rights at a time when there is a civil war. It was a terrorist war. Not only the international community, but even local people, including ourselves, were watching very carefully and expecting that at least after the conclusion of the civil war, or the terrorist war, there will be some improvement with regard to the human rights situation in this country.

It was not because we wanted the international community to take care of our human rights or for any sympathy from the outside world; but because it is a right of every citizen. Therefore, the international community and international organizations were watching this situation very carefully for a long period and with time, they realized that the previous Government had no will to stop the violations of human rights and improve the human rights situation in this country. In fact, the violators themselves were a part of the Government. That is why we had to face a lot of threats during the last five to six years.

But, today, we are happy that with the efforts made by His Excellency the President and also by the Hon. Prime Minister - a joint effort - and all these international relations in place, for which leadership was given by the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, we have restored the pristine glory we experienced in the past. Now, after the restoration of this situation, the whole world looks at Sri Lanka from a different angle. Just to give you one example, two months ago, there was a conference in Mexico City - the Open Government Partnership Global Summit - conducted with the participation of 69 countries, including the United States of America. All the world leaders were praising the improvement in Sri Lanka, especially for the restoration of the rule of law, the values and principles of democracy,

the independence of the Judiciary and the protection of human rights since January up to now.

I can recall what Samantha Power said. As the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe said, she is one of the most powerful diplomats in the United States - the Permanent Representative to the United Nations. What did she say in a speech she made? She cited Sri Lanka as an example. What did she say? She said that Sri Lanka is a unique example to the world that if rulers want to do a change, they can do a big change within a short span of time. Within a period of six to seven months, we restored the values and principles of democracy. Now, rule of law is being upheld, an independent Judiciary is in place and there are no extrajudicial killings, kidnappings using white vans and also the kidnappings of media personnel. The Hon. Prime Minister stated that during the last regime, 44 journalists have been killed, some have been harassed, some more have been injured and over 80 journalists have been chased out, expelled, from this territorial jurisdiction. Now, there is nothing like that and with this restoration of democracy, of course, there is greater recognition of Sri Lanka as a sovereign country, not only by Western countries like America, but by the whole world including India and China.

The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne knows that in the recent past, there were allegations against our Government, that we have distanced ourselves from the Chinese Government, that we do not have cordial relations with them and therefore, our bilateral relations have got weakened. But, that is not so. Sir, I would like to mention that when His Excellency the President visited China a few months ago, we singed five agreements and the Chinese Government has also agreed to put up a hospital for kidney patients with 500 beds in Polonnaruwa. Now, the Chinese Government has singed an agreement with my Ministry too, to refurbish the entire Supreme Court Complex and the Ministry of Justice.

That itself will cost more than Rs. 4,000 million. Altogether, the grants that the Chinese Government is going to give us is worth more than US Dollars 800 million and they have already started the process. My simple question is, did the previous Government bring into this country a single dollar from China as a grant? No. They got only commercial rate loans. Therefore, if somebody levels allegations against us that we have got distanced from China; that is a myth. In fact, we have got more closer towards China, India, America and Britain.

Now, every country is treating us in an equal manner. All are our friends. Therefore, this nation is indebted to His Excellency the President and to the Hon. Prime Minister for restoring this glorious situation that we have experienced in the past. Now our dignity, as a sovereign country, has been protected. Therefore, there is no necessity for anyone to have any kind of fear or doubt

about the foreign policy that we are following. Thank you very much. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. M.A.Sumanthiran. [2.02 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Employment.

At the outset I would like to congratulate the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, for taking many steps in the right direction, the last of which was the signing of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. As I asked the Hon. Minister who preceded me as to why it had not been ratified yet, I have got the assurance that it will be ratified in due course. The reason why I asked that question was that this is a Convention that has already entered into force and there is no purpose really in only signing this Convention: it must be ratified and acceded to. I also wish to ask the Hon. Minister whether in terms of Article 29 onwards of this Convention, whether Sri Lanka intends to make the declaration to acquiesce in the procedure of going before the Committee on Enforced Disappearances as well.

It seems to be an optional protocol that is available and I would encourage the country to accede to that mechanism also since enforced disappearances have been a very very serious issue in this country to the extent that even the previous regime appointed a Commission specifically to inquire into this matter. Following the spate of evidence that was placed before the LLRC, they felt it necessary even as an eyewash to appoint the Paranagama Commission on the question of disappearances, which subsequently got an enlarged mandate to look into four other questions of international law.

Now whilst on the question of Paranagama Commission, I would like to ask a question. At the UN Human Rights Council sessions in September this year, the Hon. Minister made an undertaking that Udalagama and Paranagama Commission Reports which he called, the previous Presidential Commission Reports will be published by the end of that month and that was done - that was tabled in Parliament prior to a Adjournment Debate. Now, those Commissions have been described as "previous Presidential Commissions" and those Reports have been tabled. Now, if that be the case, I would like to know what the Paranagama Commission intends doing

from Sunday onwards in Jaffna. Why are they holding sittings? This has caused a great upheaval in Jaffna as to why this Commission wants to continue sittings. We all thought the Commissions work has now ended and the Report tabled in Parliament, but, people have got notices inviting them to present themselves before the sittings of this Commission in Point Pedro on Sunday. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Is it on this Sunday? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, this Sunday; two days from today and then, on Monday in Jaffna town and so on. A group of people have met two days ago in Jaffna and have apparently taken a decision to boycott this sittings saying that this was to have come to an end and they are confused as to why this is being continued. So, I would like to have a very clear reply from the Hon. Minister, if possible today, so that all these anxieties and serious doubts of the relatives of the disappeared can be put to rest.

With regard to the Reports that were tabled in Parliament - even Paranagama Commission Report - recommended very serious measures of prosecution as follow up. We find that this has also been a commitment before the UN Human Rights Council because the Operative Paragraph 6 of the Resolution that was adopted on the 1st of October, states, I quote:

Welcomes the recognition by the Government of Sri Lanka that accountability is essential to uphold the rule of law and to build confidence in the people of all communities of Sri Lanka in the justice system,.. Then it goes on to state, I quote:

..notes with appreciation the proposal of the Government of Sri Lanka I repeat,

notes with appreciation the proposal of the Government of Sri Lanka to establish a judicial mechanism with a special counsel to investigate allegations of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law, as applicable; affirms that a credible justice process should include independent judicial and prosecutorial institutions led by individuals known for their integrity and impartiality; and also affirms in this regard the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, including the special counsels office, of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers and authorized prosecutors and investigators;.."

So, it seems that a proposal has been made by the Government of Sri Lanka to the Human Rights Council which has been noted with appreciation that a special mechanism will be set up - a special Sri Lankan judicial mechanism will be set up. To that extent, the Government

1547 1548

has articulated clearly to the country what they call a "local judicial mechanism" - a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism. But, this Resolution which was co-sponsored by Sri Lanka, emphasizes something in this paragraph. It states, affirms in this regard - affirms the proposal by the Government of Sri Lanka. It affirms in this regard the importance of participation of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers, authorized prosecutors and investigators. So, it is more than a suggestion; more than a recommendation; more than commending this particular model to the country. It is actually affirming the proposal by the Government of Sri Lanka itself. So, whatever be the various other features of this judicial mechanism - there will be various different features of this mechanism - this Resolution has chosen to underline one particular feature and call it "an important feature" and that feature is the importance of participation of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers, authorized prosecutors and investigators, not that of persons who give advice to the different persons who constitute this mechanism. It is in participation of Commonwealth and other foreign persons as judges, as defence lawyers, as authorized prosecutors and as investigators and it does not permit any other diluted version of interpretation.

I am glad that Minister after Minister is able to state to the House today that it is the failure on the part of the previous regime to deliver on the promises to the international community that ostracized Sri Lanka. The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe who incidentally handled most of these matters although there was a Minister for External Affairs during that time. I remember, in 2013, I asked what the Minister for Plantation Industries was doing in Geneva while the Minister for External Affairs was seated here in the House while a UN Resolution was being passed there. The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, himself, today very clearly said that those promises were not met. He did not use those words, but what he effectively said was that we were blacklisted and we were ostracized from the community of nations. The Hon. Minister of Justice who just preceded me said, Our pristine glory has been restored, in his own words, by agreeing to reasonable suggestions, by taking steps to implement our own undertakings to the international community.

I am emphasizing some of these provisions, some of our undertakings for the reason that, although some of the undertakings have been clearly articulated by the leadership of the country to the people of the country, there are still others which are not being articulated very clearly and it seems that that is also by design. I would like to ask the question as to why clear undertakings, such as the one that I read out now from the Operative Paragraph 6, is not being told to the country. Why is the truth not being told to the country clearly? Surely, you

have to face this sooner rather than later unless, of course, you are planning to breach it. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I want to assure you that we will take the final decision regarding the architecture of the special courts once the consultation process is over. In fact, we are putting the finishing touches to the consultation task force. We hope to begin the consultations by the 10th of January, 2016 and finish it by March and by March, we should have a clear idea on the contours of this special mechanism. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Hon. Minister for that clarification. The point that I was making was that the architecture can come out of consultations and so on, but fundamental undertakings given with regard to certain features of this mechanism must be fulfilled, whatever be the outcome of that consultation. Operative Paragraph 10 of this Resolution also welcomes the initial steps taken to return land and we have also welcomed it - 1,000 acres in Walikamam North and about 1,500 acres in the East in Sampur. The Government did release those lands, but there are several thousands more that need to be released. This Resolution, having welcomed the initial steps, encourages the Government of Sri Lanka to accelerate the return of land to its rightful civilian owners. It states, "Accelerate the return of land to its rightful civilian owners".

Just after the General Election held in August, since the return of the land in Sampur, very little has been released. Still, several thousands of acres, particularly in the North are occupied by the military or under the control of the military. Military does not even occupy it. No one occupies it. The land is a shrub jungle that no one is able to enter. Now, if there is an undertaking to accelerate the return of land to civilian owners, why is that not happening? Also, there was a promise to take a re-look at and review the Public Security Ordinance and the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Now, this is a matter which was in the speech that the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs made to the Human Rights Council where he said, ...review and repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and replace it with anti-terrorism legislation in line with contemporary international best practices; review the Public Security Ordinance Act.. and so on.

Now, the Prevention of Terrorism Act is to be repealed. There is a specific commitment to that effect in the speech of the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs as well as in the Resolution. The question that I am posing is, why is the Prevention of Terrorism Act to be repealed? Because, Prevention of Terrorism Act has for long been

1549 1550

[ . . ]

2015 11

recognized as a draconian piece of legislation which does not meet the ends of justice. It has various provisions in it, which have been decried by various countries at various international fora, particularly, provisions with regard to administrative detention; provisions with regard to confessions being admissible in evidence; provisions with regard to nebulous crimes like the one that you find in Section 2(1)(h) of the Act. Now, it is for these reasons presumably that the Government itself has given its commitment to review this, to repeal it and to replace it with a piece of legislation that meets with international standards. Now, it is in this context that persons suspected to have committed offences under the PTA and their release comes up for discussion and I am glad that the Minister of Justice is also here because it was with him that we, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and myself, initially held talks on the 16th of October at the Ministry of Justice with regard to the release of these persons, about 217 in number.

The point I am making is, when the PTA is to be repealed - I am not saying that persons accused of crimes must just be released; I am no saying that. The PTA is to be repealed because it has various features in it that you yourself have recognized cannot continue; particularly the method of proof of the offence - confession. To my knowledge, most of these persons accused under the PTA have only their own confession or the supposed "confession" as the main piece of evidence against themselves. When that is the case, why are these persons still not being released? Why is the review not taking place even according to the timetable that you gave us?

According to what we were told on the 16th of October, 2015, most of these people can either be released on bail pending further determination of their cases or sent for rehabilitation, if they chose that. Ninety nine people have given letters asking that they be sent for rehabilitation, for the reason that at least through that process they can be released. An agreement was reached with the Hon. Minister of Justice, which was confirmed by His Excellency the President, that beginning from 31st of October, 2015 and ending on 07th of November, 2015, except those charged with very serious offences - that could not have been more than 50 per cent of these people - for others, there will be a process of release announced and that did not happen. On the 05th of November, 2015, there was a meeting in Parliament where a programme of release was given. The Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs was there at that meeting when we were told that immediately 32 people will be released on bail and a further 30 would be released in two weeks' time. 31 people were, in fact, released, as stated on that day. But, another 30 were not released. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Thirty nine.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, 31. Later, another eight were released. So, though it was said 32, okay, 31 were released. But, we were told another 30 would be released in two weeks' time. 30 were not released; only 8 were released. Why is that? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Can I clarify? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) We had a discussion with the Attorney-General's Department. They are looking into the cases of those who plead guilty for lesser offences. [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Give the Hon.Minister of Justice the mike. Otherwise, it will not go on record. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, I will clarify before you go further. There were 99 people who asked for rehabilitation, which meant that they were willing to plead guilty for lesser offences and have a short term of sentence followed by a period of rehabilitation. Out of that 99, only 85 had cases pending. The other 14 were convicted offenders and that matter has to be dealt with separately. Out of those 85, we were given a list of 20 names as those who can be convicted for lesser offences and sent for rehabilitation. That number does not involve the persons to be released on bail by the Magistrate's Court. The number that I am talking about is 61 persons who have no charges against them, yet. It is from that lot that 39 were enlarged on bail. It is a strange situation. I can see it on your face, that people who have not been charged for any offences have been enlarged on bail. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) No. Those who have not been charged are 52. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, later they found more. At a meeting - unfortunately you were not present - convened by the new Minister of Law and Order and Southern

1551 1552

Development attended by the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation and Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, they said the earlier number was wrong and that they found nine more names. So, it is 61. 39 have been enlarged on bail. 22 of those who have not been charged with any offence have been refused bail. That is one issue. I want to know why.

Out of the other category of 85, we were told more than two weeks ago, the first batch would be released. I spoke about it in Parliament and asked the question - only one person was released - how can the first batch consist of just one person? I am asking all of these questions - I am not quibbling with numbers - because in the result, what has happened is, only 67 people out of 217 have been either released on bail or convicted and sent for rehabilitation, which leaves 150 out.

Now, you have established a special court to try the others. But, surely, that was not what was in contemplation when we met you at the Ministry on the 16th of October, that out of the 217, 150 will have to face charges and only a small number will be released on bail. That was not what was contemplated. It was the opposite. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) That was the -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Give the mike to the Hon. Minister. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) As you mentioned just a few minutes ago, you all have not asked to release those who face serious charges. -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) . ( ) (The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti) , seat .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Committee Stage . () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Yes, this is the Committee Stage. ( ) (An Hon. Member) Committee Stage .[ ] ( ) (The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti) Mike . record . () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) . [ ] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes. Hon. Minister, it is more important to have a record of what you are saying than to maintain your place in the House. ( ) (The Hon. Sunil Handunnetti) Whatever place he may be in, we want what he says on record. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Presiding Member) , () . () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Sumanthiran, at the initial stages, we agreed on a particular formula. A few minutes ago, you yourself said that you are not asking us to release those who face serious charges. In fact, that was the real issue, where the Attorney-General's Department has to go through each case one by one, separately. They found that there are certain categories of detainees - those who have already faced serious charges - and another group who will be charged for serious offences. Only for those who have not committed serious offences, we said we are going to consider bail. So, as we have agreed - I agree that the number has varied - but we have already done it. Thirty nine persons have been bailed out through the court and

1553 1554

[ .. ]

2015 11

there is an understanding that another 20 accused, who will plead guilty for lesser offences, will have to go through minor punishment and some will be sent for rehabilitation. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Could you tell us what the offences are? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Wait, I am on my feet. The point I was trying to make is, even out of those 20, when the names were given, we found that two persons had already been acquitted. So after they were acquitted, we were given names asking them to plead guilty to some offence and go for rehabilitation. How that happens, I do not know. So there are 18 () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) When you discussed these things. I think you also had the list. We went by the same list. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is not the main issue that I am coming to. The main issue that I am coming to is; the result is only 67 having entitled to either bail or rehabilitation out of 217. Now, that was not in contemplation. Surely, when we spoke to you, when we spoke to even officials of the Attorney-Generals Department - we had several meetings - they have very clearly told to us that those who were supposed to have been involved in grave crimes did not exceed 30 or 40. Now, 150 are still to be dealt with. Even with regard to those who committed serious crimes - whatever is called "serious crimes" - we did not say they need not be released. We said, for the moment let that be, we will talk about that later. Some of them have served more than 20 years. There are two who have been in prison for 19 years and the cases are not yet over. So, we need to look at all of these from various angles. If they have been there for a longer period than what the punishment itself would be, that needs to be looked at. All that we said was, that can be looked at later.

The point that I am raising now is that when an international undertaking has been given to repeal the PTA, the PTA offenders are convicted, as you know very well primarily on their confession. That is one of the most serious features of this law that has made it impossible to continue in our statute books. So, it is with that view that I am asking, having given a commitment internationally to repeal the PTA and replace it with legislation that meets with international standards, and then admissibility of confessions must certainly go out, how is it that you

intend continuing with the prosecution of 150 people out of 217 that was not in contemplation - it was a much smaller number - and even if that was a smaller number, how do you intend continuing with the prosecutions by a especially established court now? With confessions - () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Member, that is not correct. It is not a specially established court, it is another court. It was due to the shortage of the judges that we appointed a High Court Commissioner at the request of the Hon. Chief Justice. It was the view of the Hon. Chief Justice that there should be some experienced judge to hear this case because the whole world is watching this. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is right. - [Interruption.] No, no. Speeding-up is not the issue. You are trying to speed up the prosecutions of 150 people - when you said it was only 30 to 40 - by the use of their own confessions which are the primary evidence in a PTA trial before you meet with your international obligations. I say that violates the whole spirit of your undertaking that you will repeal the PTA. Now you have a speeded-up process, so that there is not going to be any prosecutions left. That cannot be. You give an undertaking based on a certain principle. You have agreed that the PTA cannot continue in our statute books. It is obnoxious; that is being agreed to. And then now you want to continue with - I understand if there are cases that you call serious, you want to deal with separately, you want to look at the period of time they have been in prison, all of that, we will look at that separately. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Member, at this stage - do not misunderstand. In fact, your initial request - not only yours, of all those who are concerned about this issue - was that if there is anybody who is not facing a severe charge, either release him or bail him out. The other cases where, as you now mentioned, there was a delay of 15 -20 years, speed those up and finish as soon as possible. That was the request made by everybody. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, no. We never made that request. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Even to the international community, our undertaking was that we will speed up all those cases and conclude.

1555 1556

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Minister, you are missing the point I am making. This is a prosecution under a law which you have agreed to repeal for its obnoxious provisions. How do you justify speeding up prosecutions under that law which you have already committed to repeal for the very reason that it is obnoxious? -[Interruption.] No. That is not the request. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) There is no agreement with any agency or with the international community that we are going to try them after abolishing this law. The Sri Lankan Government as well as we, as Ministers, have not given any undertaking that we will try these suspects or the accused only after abolishing the PTA law. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That I understand. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Those are the pending cases, those are the sub judice cases. We cannot tell the judges .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That, I understand. That is why I said you are violating the spirit of the undertaking. Hon. Minister is very cleverly answering my question. But that will not do. That is what the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe was able to say a little while ago. You cannot nitpick like this. If it is your intention - and this was your intention when we spoke to you as well; that there will be a very small number that we will deal with later. But this is not a small number. This is the bulk of that number. Only a small number has been released contrary to even what you expected, as you concede today. So, now I am raising this because these are matters that affect reconciliation. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rajavarothiam Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Affect your credibility. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) And your credibility as well. That is the tenor of what I am saying. You yourselves continuously say - even the

Hon. Minister of Justice who spoke before me said that promises have not been kept and therefore, we were ostracized. Now, I am only urging, what you have agreed to do, do it properly, do it with the right intent and do it quickly so that you are not accused of prevaricating, you are not accused of breaching the spirit of the undertaking that you have given.

Acceleration of release of lands, I raised. Now, that has not been done. So, I am pointing out various undertakings given which have either not been implemented or coming in dribbles that will never be even recognized, unfortunately, if it comes in such a slow pace.

Operative Paragraph 16 of the Resolution of the UN Human Rights Council, states, I quote:

Welcomes the commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to a political settlement by taking necessary constitutional measures, encourages the Governments efforts...

The Government has said it is taking efforts and that is being encouraged.

"..to fuful its commitments on the devolution of political authority.

So, that is yet another commitment given and that also, at some point, has to be delivered. I am not saying that is something that you can do tomorrow. But that is a very definite commitment given because it reads like that. It states:encourages the Governments effort to fulfill its commitments. So, the Government has said that it has given the commitment; Government has said that it has taken efforts to fulfill its commitments and that is being encouraged by this Resolution. So, I am flagging these issues not with the view to find fault with the Government, I expect the Hon. Minster of Justice also to understand what I am saying, I am saying these things in the spirit of urging the Government to expedite the process. You are doing something. We are recognizing that. But do it in such a way that you are seen as doing also. Otherwise, what you do also will not be recognized. When it comes in dribbles or as I said, comes too slowly, it will not even be recognized that it is being done. So, I congratulated the Minister of Foreign Affairs for taking steps, and I urge that further steps be taken quickly in time, because in these matters time is also of the essence. You will find that the Resolution that you have cosponsored also has time-bound reviews. There will be an oral update in June next year and a comprehensive report in March 2017, to which you have agreed. So, you have agreed to these time-bound reviews and then you must be seemed to have accomplished what is expected by that time.

I do concede that Sri Lanka can be a great example as the Hon. Minister of Justice who spoke before me said. Sri Lanka can be an example to the world and I think that is the expectation of the world community today that Sri

1557 1558

Lanka has changed course in the right path; but you are not yet there. There is a lot more distance to go before we can get there and we are willing to go with you that distance; we are willing to assist you in whatever way, but we must move. We cannot be stagnant. That is all that I am saying. Whatever assistance you require from us- ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) After ten years of a certain mindset, it is difficult to change everything overnight. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, I am not expecting anything overnight. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) We too are struggling with certain bureaucratic bottlenecks which we are confronting everyday, but we have the political will to overcome all those challenges. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I thank the Hon. Minister for that explanation, and I thank you for the efforts that you take to break those bottlenecks. It is also our role to encourage you to move faster than what you are doing because people are impatient.

When I spoke here last time on this issue I said this that people are impatient, and I repeat it again. During the last regime, people did not have expectations. At least, our people did not have expectations, but, now, they have expectations and when those expectations are not met they are more disappointed than they were during the previous regime; because during this regime they think the right thing will be done and when they find that it is delaying or not happening, naturally their disappointment is greater. I do understand the bureaucratic bottlenecks, the mindset, all of that; but that can never be an excuse for not moving forward. I think we can agree on this and as I said you will have our utmost support as you have had even on the prisoner issue. You know that. We have also gone, met with the prisoners and so on, but there is an expectation. There is an expectation that must be fulfilled and I am afraid today there is heavy disappointment and you must move forward.

The release of land and the release of prisoners are very very important and urgent and I think those are some important steps that you can take in the movement forward. I did say that with regard to the Operative Paragraph 16, with regard to a political settlement, we are not expecting it overnight. I did say that. But some efforts have to be taken in the right direction at the right time. But other issues that really press upon peoples daily

lives, peoples anxiety, the disappeared persons issue, the prisoner issue, the livelihood issue and the right to occupy their own land - these are some things which cannot be delayed, which have to be dealt with sooner rather than later.

I would like to remind, before I conclude, the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs to please clarify the continued sittings of the Paranagama Commission.

Thank you. [.. 2.46] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. S.M. Marikkar) , . , .

BUDGET SPEECH - MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS POLICY

When this Government was elected in January 2015, our relations with our neighbours and the rest of the world were at their worst point since Independence over half a century ago. Sri Lanka was an international outcast. Relations with key allies were strained and our diplomatic service had been run to the ground. We had lost our credibility and the worlds respect. In fact, since 2010, every March the then Government faced ever-greater annual censure at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. The previous Government also embarked on the risky and hazardous course of cultivating one set of friends at the expense of many other traditional friends. Relations with important partners - including India, the US and EU- were strained. These policy choices had real costs. GSP Plus, which had helped create tens of thousands of jobs and help maintain the competitiveness of our apparel industry and other industries, was withdrawn. And instead of working with these countries to restore these facilities for the benefit of our people and our nations economic benefit, it was decided, without consulting the public, that these facilities are not required. Fish exports to the EU, our largest fisheries export market, were banned because we had violated basic norms of high seas fishing. The prospect of economic sanctions loomed over us. But over the last year, the Government replaced this self-defeating foreign policy that lined the pockets of the few, with a foreign policy based on the principles of good governance that serves the interests of all Sri Lankans. We have put in place a clear, stable and results based foreign policy that provides tangible benefits to all our citizens. Already in the last year there have been some notable successes.

First, following the consensus-resolution at the Human Rights Council in Geneva this September, Sri Lanka is no longer a pariah state - we are regaining our place as a respected and principled member of the international community and the community of democratic nations. As the cabinet-ranking US Ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, put it and I quote, I cannot think of another country in the entire world where you have seen such change in such a short period of time. Second, we have ensured that we have strong and deep relations with ALL our friends and allies in the international community - and that no one relationship is at the expense of another. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have visited India, the United States, China, Japan, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, France, Thailand and Singapore. We have received the Prime Minister of India (the first bilateral visit in 28 years), the US Secretary of State (the first official visit in 43 years), the German Foreign Minister, the Singaporean Foreign Minister, the Qatari and UAE Foreign Ministers, the Swiss Foreign Minister and many, many other foreign dignitaries. These visits have laid the groundwork for economic, cultural and political cooperation that will provide tangible results in the form of trade agreements, investment, technology transfer and development assistance in the coming years. Third, we are beginning the process of re-establishing links with the many Sri Lankans overseas who had lost faith in Sri Lanka. We have restarted the engagement with the Diaspora that was started soon after the end of armed conflict by former President Rajapaksa. Many individuals and organizations who did not have confidence, are now inspired to make a genuine and positive contribution to Sri Lankas reconciliation and development journey. My colleagues and I have had meetings with leaders in the overseas Sri Lankan community - which consist of many eminent doctors, statesmen, businessmen, lawyers, musicians, writers and even chefs. There is an overwhelmingly positive response and we hope to take concrete measures to transform that goodwill into tangible contributions towards reconciliation and development over the coming year. In November this year Fr. Emmanuel, the President of the Global Tamil Forum, in an interview with the Sudar Oli Tamil newspaper, said that his organization was working for a united Sri Lanka: the political solution we work for is the once voted by the Tamils in Sri Lanka by their election of the TNA, namely - a united Sri Lanka where all citizens are equally treated and the Tamils are recognized as a distinct people and devolved power to rule themselves.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS MANAGMENET In addition to putting the right policies in place, we are also striving to ensure that our countrys foreign affairs are managed professionally - with integrity and accountability. Under the previous Government, incompetent cronies were appointed to key missions, which were in turn made offices for their private businesses and even their criminal enterprises. In fact, in the Washington DC embassy over 330,000 US Dollars was missing in one property transaction. From the Foreign Ministry expenses alone over 339 million rupees were wasted on five lobbying firms between 2009 and 2014 that produced no results, while many of our capable diplomats were kept idle for political reasons. Many other payments were also made through the Presidential Secretariat and Central Bank. The Foreign Ministry also became a site of political patronage - the Former Monitoring MP cronies children, the CHOGM babes and boys, were appointed to Foreign Ministry positions without proper procedure. They were paid through the Kadirgamar Institute of which former Foreign Minister was Chairman of the Board. Millions of rupees were wasted, mainly through the Foreign Ministers vote, on extravagances - including adult films $200 shots of cognac and $288 steaks.

We have reversed this trend and are in the process of creating a professional, empowered and accountable Foreign Service. Career diplomats have been appointed to missions where possible. However, due to many years of neglect and failure to recruit there are insufficient numbers of staff to fill ambassadorial positions. And at any given time, a sufficient number of senior-level Foreign Service Officers are required to serve in the Ministry in Colombo which is the nerve centre that manages our Foreign Affairs and works closely with the line ministries and foreign missions represented in Colombo. Therefore, we have been compelled to appoint a number of professionals and academics to positions abroad. Yet, despite these constraints I am pleased to announce that within a year we have doubled the proportion of career diplomats posted as ambassadors from a third to nearly two-third and reduced the number of non-career diplomats from two-third to just over a third. We are also undertaking the short-term and long-term restructuring of the Foreign Ministry. In the short-term we intend to cut costs and focus our resources by closing down missions abroad for which no clear rationale exists. We also intend to introduce Non-Resident Ambassadors to further cut costs and to establish a presence where a full-scale embassy cannot be justified but where Sri Lankas interests need to be furthered. Perhaps most importantly, we intend to create the necessary systems and policies to ensure that our diplomatic service is able to perform at the highest levels of excellence. This also means creating systems to take punitive measures where required for wrongdoing and sub-standard work, in order to ensure that the reputation of vast majority of conscientious and ethical officers is preserved. To this end, we are in the process of re-introducing the system of inspectors-general who will visit our missions abroad and report on compliance and performance. Allow me to conclude by saying that we will not rest on the laurels of the past year. Over the next year we will work very hard to ensure that the worlds tremendous goodwill is transformed into tangible benefits for Sri Lankas people and that Sri Lankas foreign policy and management of foreign affairs is placed on meritocratic and professional foundations.
