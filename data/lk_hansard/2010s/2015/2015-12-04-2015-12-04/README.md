(a) Will he state-

(i) whether the removal of the tax of Rs. 90.00 from the selling price of cement by the last Interim Budget was done as a measure to bring down the prices of cement; and

(ii) the tax revenue loss per month to the government as a result of this?

(b) Will he also state-

(i) whether the retail price of cement was fixed at Rs. 840.00 having published the relevant price reduction in the Gazette of 20th February 2015;

(ii) whether cement is sold in the country at that price since then; and

203 204

2015 04

(iv) if not, is it not a grave error that the government lost its income while the consumers too lost the anticipated relief?

(c) Will he inform this house-

(i) whether steps will be taken to effect this price reduction as promised by the interim budget; and

(ii) if so, the date it will be effective from?

(d) If not, why? ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce)

(a) (i) The Customs Duty on import, that was 7.5 per cent, has been removed by the last Interim Budget in order to reduce the selling price at the local market.

(ii) There is a loss of around Rs. 100 million per month from the tax levy because of this removal of Customs Duty.

(iii) More cement is imported to this country under the Free Trade Agreements established between India and Pakistan. Cement imported under Free Trade Agreements is exempted from Customs Duty. Therefore, the removal of this Customs Duty has created opportunities to import cement from countries like Indonesia and Malaysia at competitive prices.

(b) (i) Yes.

(ii) No.

The Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 1902/47 was published on 20th February, 2015 declaring the price of a bag of cement as Rs. 840.00. Yet by the Extraordinary Gazette Notification of No. 1908/9 dated 31st March, 2015, maximum retail price of a 50kg bag of cement was declared again as Rs. 870.00. Cement is sold island-wide at that price since that day.

(iii) Not relevant

(c) (i) Yes.

Implementation of the price at Rs. 870.00 in the market island-wide as declared by the Extraordinary Gazette Notification dated 31st March, 2015 is monitored by the Consumer Affairs Authority.

(ii) Since 31st March, 2015.

(iii) in terms of decision No. CSS/2/13/GRAD/1-V of the Chief Secretary of the Southern Province dated 12.08.2014 and by the decision G/SP/12/08 of the Governor dated 18.11.2014, 313 trainee graduates, who were recruited for Matara District, were entitled for the permanent appointments

[9.49 a.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity given to participate in the Committee Stage Discussion on the allocations for the Ministries of Defence, Justice, Law and Order and Southern Development.

As I stand to deal with the specific Heads and related matters, I want the House to remember yet another very sad event that is about to happen today in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. As we all know, in a few hours time, a Sri Lankan woman will be stoned to death in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. On the 9th of January, 2013, a very young girl, Rizana Nafeek, was beheaded and we had special reference and a Debate in this House in respect of that. Now, barely two years have passed and we have this situation confronting us, today, which is yet another reminder to us of the kind of relations that we should have with the countries at large and the terms on which we have those relationships. I am told that our Head of Mission to Saudi Arabia has flippantly remarked that if our workers who go to that Kingdom for a living do not like the laws in that country, they can always stay away: they need not come there.

That is not the kind of response that we expect from the Head of our Mission there nor the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the officials of the Ministry of Justice and others who are tasked with - I also would like to mention the officials of the Foreign Employment Bureau - looking after the welfare of Sri Lankans whichever part of the world they go to.

This is a grim reminder of the kind of laws that are extant in some parts of the world and the hypocrisy of the other nations of the world in dealing with some of these stone-age rules that are being implemented.

I must mention that whatever I say here today is no reflection on any particular religious tradition, or my respect for people in different parts of the world implementing their own customs, norms and the laws that they decide should be extant in their part of the world. Nevertheless, today we belong to one global village and we live by certain rules that apply to a civilized community of nations and in that respect we, as a country, also have made grand strides in recent times in allowing our friends around the world to ask us questions, to give us advice and we open to deal with issues that may affect the international norms that are prevalent today.

Today, we face this situation because it is a citizen of this country who is facing this. But, we do have diplomatic relations with these countries and I mention very specifically the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Not only we, also several superpowers, all the countries - the civilized community of nations - have relationships,

diplomatic ties with this particular country and one is not able to see how much influence or pressure or advice the world at large is able to give to this country even if there is some pressure that is brought upon, it is not apparent at all. A woman is to be stoned to death for adultery. I am not a believer in Islam. Nevertheless, I respect people who decide to follow Islam and declare that Shariya Law is the law by which they will conduct their lives. Also we have a sizeable population of those who follow Islam in this country. I consider myself a friend of that community and in that spirit of friendship, I would like to raise a question to our brethren who follow Islam.

I see at least one Minister in the front row of the Government and there are several others in the Government, senior Ministers who are adherents of the Islamic faith and I would like to ask this question openly and in a spirit of friendship, " Is this what Sharia Law actually prescribes?". I am a believer in the Christian faith and these laws are reflected in the Bible too that people were stoned to death. It is there in the Old Testament. But in the understanding that has developed over the years - very particularly, during the life of Jesus Christ, there is a recorded instance of a woman who was caught in adultery, who was brought before him and those who brought that woman before him asked him the question, The law, Torah, requires us to stone her to death. What do you say? and the answer Jesus Christ gave after a long moment of reflection was, Let him, who has no sin, cast the first stone. and the story goes that the men who had gathered there with stones in their hands dropped the stones and went away one by one and there was no one left to stone her and she was sent away. The man who was caught in this same transaction is supposed to be given 100 lashes. The women is to be stoned to death and the man is to be given 100 lashes. I am not sure if this law is to be implemented in our country today - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. S.M. Marikkar) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) A point of Order is being raised by the Hon. S.M. Marikkar. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. S.M. Marikkar) , - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, that is not a point of Order.

Risad Badhiutheen ) . . - [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, please allow the Hon. Member to carry on. Do not disturb any more.

( ) (The Hon. Ishak Rahuman) , . ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Do not insult any religion. Hon. Sumanthiran, you go ahead now. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I have already given my assurance. But, I am raising a serious issue and I will continue to speak on that. I will not insult any religion. I have not done that up to now. I am raising - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ishak Rahuman) . . ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Please, do not disturb him now. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Nobody has absolute right to speak about certain issues. All of us have a right to speak and I will continue to speak. I will not say anything that will even touch upon the dignity of the Muslim people of this country or any country for that matter. I will not offend any religion, I give you that assurance. You must be patient and listen to what I have to say.

Nevertheless, this raises very serious issues of justice. I was going to talk about that man, who is to be lashed, as well. Who can last 100 lashes? Now, Singapore has laws like this, not only Muslim countries. In Singapore, even for much lesser offences, people are caned.

Sometime ago, we had a young person who had got into mischief, who had spray-painted in public and he was subjected to whipping. Now, we saw - [Interruption.] All right, I will speak about Singapore then, if others are getting upset. When that happened, we found out how this whipping takes place. A person cannot stand more than two whips, two lashes at a time. He is taken to hospital. His skin is split. Now I say as much as we allow in a spirit of openness and transparency, we open up to the world community too in a spirit of friendship, comment upon the laws that we practise, there are very serious issues of human rights, breach of human rights in this country that others have raised. I say even though we are a small country, we have a place in the international community of civilized nations. I am saying we must raise issues of justice of human dignity with those countries. It may be that they believe that certain religious traditions require that.

Now there is a debate in the world with regard to death penalty. Several states in the USA practise death penalty. We also have death penalty in our statute books. Would that be offensive to any religion, if we have a discussion as to whether death penalty should be continued or not? Not at all, merely because some religious texts prescribe that. I am believer in the Christian faith. My religious texts prescribes death penalty. It prescribes stoning to death. That is why I said, it is not only the Islamic faith. So do not take me wrong.

I am raising issues of understanding of the particular century in which we live and our understanding of what is

219 220

2015 04

right and what is wrong. Religious traditions must be observed. There is no question about that. But, are we open enough as a country? Why did we plead on behalf of that girl who was beheaded? That was a judgment passed by a court of law in that country. We should not have interfered. But we did. Why did we do that? Because we thought there was a serious case of injustice. Everybody, without any religious differences, all of us, appealed. Even though a court in Saudi Arabia had passed a death sentence by beheading, we, all of us, appealed that that life be spared. They did not heed us. But we did not say, Well, that was according to the Sharia Law that countrys court has ruled. Therefore, we must not ask. No, we did not do that. Even in this case, as the Hon. Minister himself said, everyone is appealing. Why are we appealing? We are not appealing because we disrespect the Sharia Law, Hon. Minister. If it is according to Sharia Law, then, we will not appeal. Then it will be construed - ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Sir, I rise to a point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) What is your point of Order, Hon. Minister? ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) , . , sensitive issue . Sharia Law . . , touch . . . . , . 23 . , appeal . ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) That is right. Hon. Sumanthiran, you go ahead with your speech. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is the very point that I am making. Thank you so much for that explanation. That is the very point I am making. There are no religious differences here among all of us. As you have now pointed out, all the Muslim Members of Parliament here have appealed for redress. So, it is not decrying the Sharia Law, it is because you

think that there must be some justice to that woman and you have asked for clemency.

Now I am asking this question. Let us leave the Islamic countries aside. Let us look at the other countries. If people are taking so much offence that mere mention of the kinds of punishments that are meted out is an offence to their religion, we will leave that out. Let us take Singapore; let us take some states in the US and the kind of methods that they use to execute people like the electric chair. You have seen pictures of how people die of electrocution when they carried it out in the US. Are these not issues that we also, as an equal member of the community of nations, are entitled to raise with these other countries as much as they raise issues of human rights with us? That is the point that I am making.

I think we should raise these issues because these transcend national boundaries. These issues of human dignity and so on transcend even religious boundaries, ethnic boundaries, racial boundaries and peoples boundaries. Therefore, I am appealing because it is a question of justice. Today the Vote is on the Ministry of Justice and that is why I am taking up this matter without taking it up under the Votes on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We understand justice in a particular way to the extent that we allow others to raise questions with us. I am saying, as a country we must also raise these questions and, if necessary, even put our diplomatic relations on hold with countries which practise certain methods of punishment, because it does not accord with what we think is a just way of dealing with offenders. Offenders also have rights; offenders also have dignity that must be preserved. That is why in some of our judgments torture is not allowed. It is very specifically set out, even the blackest criminal is entitled to the guarantee not to be tortured. That is his absolute right. That sets example. Why is that? Because we think, in our standards, in our norms that - ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake - Minister of Plantation Industries) Hon. Member, is stoning to death not a form of torture? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Well. That was the point that I was making but people are getting upset. So, I will move on.

There are certain values that we have agreed to and it is not only for our own country, I am suggesting that we must talk these ideas of justice with our friends across national borders as well and debate them and ask them and seek to change.

221 222

While we do that, let us look inwards as well. There was an answer given by the Minister of Foreign Affairs yesterday to a Question raised by the Leader of the EPDP the previous day saying there were no secret detention camps in this country and the UN was wrong. But the former Navy Commander himself, in an interview to the "Island" newspaper, has confirmed that there was a secret detention camp in the naval dockyard. I wonder how the Minister of Foreign Affairs was able to say yesterday that that is false. It was there in the front page of the "Island" newspaper. Wasantha Karannagoda has said, Yes, we did keep some people under the air-raid shelters that the British built. Of course, he denied torture. So, these are serious issues that have arisen. When the man who was in direct command of the place says, Yes, we had a secret detention centre, we have a Minister answering in Parliament and saying, No, that is a false claim. [Interruption.] All right. I agree. It is good if you have your mike on and say that there was. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera - Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife) We do not know. It was not during our period. It was during the Rajapakse regime. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) There is nothing to hide. During the last regime, they would have had. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is right. All right. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) We openly spoke about that. , . There are no detention camps now. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Leader of the House, that raises another serious issue. Where are those people who were in those camps? Where are those people today? Where are they? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) So, that must be investigated. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Member, the Hon. Leader of the House has given that assurance. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you. You have given that assurance and that must be investigated. ( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) Hon. Member, we cannot confirm that whether there was a detention camp at that time and whether there were people detained there. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, the Navy Commander at the time confirms it publicly. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Member, you may continue. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you. I take the assurance of the two senior Ministers that that will be inquired into. That is very important because disappearances is a very serious issue in this country. -[Interruption.] The previous Government itself appointed Commissions to inquire into that conceding thereby that there were complaints. The Commission that was appointed by the previous Government itself received more than 20,000 complaints. So, it is a very serious issue.

Now, we have the revelation that there was, at some time, a secret detention camp in the Naval Dockyard and we do not know where those people have gone. So, that is a matter that needs to be inquired into. I have names of persons who are held in Boossa. Is Boossa, a detention centre or a remand prison? What is it? I would like an answer from the relevant Minister today.

Is Boossa a gazetted detention centre or is it a remand prison? I have names of Tamil political prisoners - Nadarasa Saravanabavan, Sellathurai Kirubaharan, Thangavelu Nimalan and Kanagaratnam Adhithyan - who

223 224

are held in Boossa. Do they fall into this category of prisoners who are being considered for release or not and why are they held separately when the others are held under judicial custody? Why are these people being held separately and how many persons are being held in the Terrorist Investigation Division, the TID, in Fort and in other places? Why is that information not being revealed? I have been to the TID several times in my capacity as a lawyer, mostly when I used to visit the famous journalist J.S. Tissainayagam when he was being held there. I have seen several, even hundreds of people, being detained there. So, are those detentions still continuing?

At one stage some years ago, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Manfred Nowak, visited this country and the TID. His report is available on the internet. Anyone can look at it. He visited the place twice and in his report he says that when he went the second time, he found people who were not there the first time. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) In which year? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) This was in 2007 or in 2008. -[Interruption.] But, the same Terrorist Investigation Division is continuing today. We all know that these things happened then. That report states that there were some people who were there the first time he went and they were not there the second time he went. There were some who were not there the first time and who were there the second time. When he inquired from them, Where were you when I came?, they had told him that they were kept hidden in different places. It is there in his official report that was published.

So, the question I am asking is, All right, these happened during that regime. Is it happening even now?. If you say it is not happening now, if you say that there are no detainees in the TID and in various other places like Boossa, then you must tell us that, because we have now found at least the four names I have given to you of persons who are being held in Boossa. After 10 or 11 months you took office, why are these things still continuing?

Now, take the plight of the "Tamil political prisoners". We advisedly use that term even though the Hon. Minister of Justice refuses to use it. On the 16th of October, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and I had a discussion with the Hon. Minister of Justice. We talked at length about the different categories of prisoners and an assurance was given to us, which was later confirmed through a telephone conversation that the Hon. Minister of Justice and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition had with His Excellency the President. The assurance was that their releases would commence latest by the 31st of October

and a particular process of releasing them would end by the 07th of November. This was communicated and that is how the prisoners gave up their first fast unto death. This was not to apply to persons who were accused of serious crimes. I must say that also and that was also communicated to the prisoners. This was not to apply to a small group of people. We were told that there was a small group of people who were accused of heinous crimes and this will not apply to them. We took that. We said, We will deal with that later. We communicated that to the prisoners. The 31st of October came and went and there was no release. Then, we had to agitate.

On the 05th of November, there was a meeting convened by the Hon. Prime Minster in Parliament. We had all the officials attending and there, it was agreed that 32 persons would be released before the 07th of November and 30 others would be in two weeks time. On the 09th, 10th and 11th November, 31 persons were released on bail. So, at least we saw some movement and the numbers were very close to the promise that was given to us. But thereafter, a further eight were released on bail, not another 30 and we have been told that that is the end of the matter; no more releases on bail. Why is the undertaking that was given to the Hon. Prime Minister in the Parliament Complex being breached?

With regard to the others who are facing trials in the High Court, the Hon. Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs himself went to the prisons and told the prisoners to apply for rehabilitation and that would be considered. Ninety nine of them gave letters asking for rehabilitation and they told us - I was there with the Hon. Minister - that they are not giving it with their full heart in it, but only as a way of somehow being released after long periods of detention. There are three people who have been there for over 20 years and their case is still not over. Several have been under detention for over 15 years. Some of them have been charged under Sections 2 and 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, for which the maximum term of imprisonment is seven years, but they have been there for 10 to 15 years and the trial is still not over. More than 95 per cent of them have only their confession as the only evidence against them. You know what these confessions mean under the PTA. The provision of admissibility of confessions under the PTA is the one that has dented all the investigative ability of our police force. They have totally lost it today because it is so easy to beat a man, get him to sign and then produce it as evidence in court. I related a story about that the last time I spoke on this.

Another 20 prisoners were to be released before last Wednesday for rehabilitation. The Hon. Minister of Law and Order and Southern Development is here. That assurance was given by the officials at a meeting chaired by him. Out of these 99 prisoners, we were told, 85 have cases pending in court and out of that 85, the first batch would be sent for rehabilitation before last Wednesday.

225 226

Now, ten days later, the information I have is that only one person has been sent for rehabilitation. Is that what you call the first batch? Out of 85, your "first batch" consists of one person, ten days after the deadline. Why is this happening? They had suspended their fast for the second time because of this assurance that we gave them after that meeting convened by the Hon. Minster of Law and Order and Southern Development. Both the Hon. Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs and I went to the prison and convinced them to give up their fast. We have cooperated with you for so long in this matter. We have pleaded with the prisoners to give up the fast; we have pleaded with them to be patient, that things are moving. I am not saying it is not moving. I am giving you the figures, the dates and the deadlines to show you how much it is moving or not moving. Why is this happening? How are we to answer to these people?

There was a young man of 18 years of age who committed suicide. I do not condone that act at all. Nobody committed suicide for the release of these prisoners during the last six years, although we tried several times. Only when the process has started, unfortunately, somebody went and committed suicide. The reason is, it is in this Government that they have some faith, they have got some expectation. In the last Government, they did not have any expectation. So, nobody went and jumped in front of the train. They knew even if you did that nothing will happen. It is only in this Government that they have some expectation. But, if you drag your feet like this, that is not just being dented, that is being demolished. An impressionable age of eighteen years and there are many more who are in upheaval say the Government has let us down, the Government has continuously given us promises and has let us down.

Now, these people ask us the question, when we voted at the Second Reading, "Why did you vote with this Government? Why did you vote for the Budget? They are not doing anything. They are only giving you promises. The previous Government did not give you promises. This Government is giving you promises. That is the only difference. They are not carrying it out. They are also in breach. Why are you voting?" Now it is public that two of our Members kept away and they have issued a statement today criticizing the rest of us for voting with the Government. We have taken this so far. We have taken what people might call, "political risks" in trying to move this forward in some way, so that we can engage constructively and deliver to our people. But, I am afraid, today I will have to say to the Government that even we have reached the end of our limits of patience. Because, as I stand today and as somebody who has gone with every Minister to the prisons and given assurances, how am I to say that one prisoner is the first batch of the 85 prisoners to be sent for rehabilitation - that too for rehabilitation. With what face can I say that? We think

there is a golden opportunity. We are willing to stretch our patience, but not everyone who is deeply affected, who is directly suffering is able to do that and you must realize that and my appeal to the Government today is that do not let this opportunity slip - it is just about to slip.

There are various other assurances given to us of working together. That is also now all gone, with regard to Chair of District Coordination Committee and so on. We were given specific assurances that in the districts that we won that our Members of Parliament would be appointed to chair those District Coordination Committees. That is being breached. We thought only in one district, and this morning to see in two other districts it has been breached. In a district where we have five Members of Parliament and where the Government Member got in only because another party who did not get any Member got just six votes more to qualify for the five per cent, has been made the Chair of the District Coordination Committee. How can you justify this? It is the same policy of the previous Government. In the implementation there is no difference. The only difference is that you give us false promises whereas the previous Government did not bother to give us false promises. At least we knew where we stood with them.

But, you are deceiving us. "Which is worse?", I like to ask. Now, is this by design? We have to ask the question, "Is this by design?" I cannot imagine anyone in the Government being so dense as not to understand this. Then the question arises, "Is it by design that you are trying to alienate the Representatives of our people from the people." You are drawing us, you are giving us promises, you are making us communicate those promises to our people and then deceive us and create a gulf between our people and us. The United National Party is long-remembered for machinations like that. We thought it is different now. But you are pushing us to suspect that nothing has changed, that the methodology is still being practised only with greater finesse this time.

Sir, there are several members of the armed forces who are still resident in the Northern Province particularly, not so much in the East. In allocations, we understand that so long as you have such a large army you have to pay their salaries and your recurrent expenditure will be maintained at that high level. But the question arises, after six years of the war when the country is not facing another war, most of those soldiers are getting beyond their fighting age, in any case. Why do you not have a scheme for demobilizing the army so that when they reach the ages of 35, 40, 45 they can move on to be able to carry out some vocation of their own, move away from a military environment and carry out civilian normal life, even for themselves. That would greatly relieve the people amongst whom they live now. That is the second one. So, I want to ask the Government whether the Government has a plan. Is the Government at least

227 228

[ .. ]

2015 04

planning to implement defence review, actually take stock of the security requirements of the country and in a rational way deal with this issue?

With regard to the Ministry of Justice, again there is a lot of disappointment. There were 91 persons who were employed. They were given employment since January this year as minor employees in the Ministry of Justice. Just one of them is a Tamil-speaking person. Just one of them! Why is that? Now, this is the Ministry of Justice. The Deputy Minister of Justice for the last several months is there in the House. There are vacancies in the North and the East for Tamil-speaking persons and they have not been filled. Ninety one appointments and just one Tamil person! Even at the level of minor employees, only one Tamil and 90 Sinhala-speaking persons.

There is a severe shortage of judges also. We have been agitating this for a quite a long time. There is a shortage of Tamil-speaking judges at every level.

There are Civil Appellate High Courts and in several of those, there is only one judge proficient in Tamil. Once we had the situation of a judge who did not understand or read or write Tamil, sitting in the Civil Appellate High Court in Jaffna along with another Tamil judge. We had to argue cases before him and he did not understand anything from the brief and he said, My brother understands. So, why do you have two judges sitting there? If his brother is the one who is going to hear the case, why do have two judges? It is a farce. Why do you not fill those positions? There are many people who are willing to go there and who have applied for these positions. -[ Interruption.] Yes. But, they have not been appointed. We have this problem not only at the minor judiciary level, but also at the High Court level. Now, even in the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, we have a very serious issue. The second appeal from Civil Appellate High Court comes to the Supreme Court. The briefs are entirely in Tamil and although Articles 24, 25 and 26 of the Constitution very specifically say that if a judge cannot understand the language of the record, it must be translated for that judge. That is an obligation of the State. To this day, there is no provision made for that.-[Interruption.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe - State Minister of International Trade) The CJ can -[Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) CJ cannot hear cases alone. You need three judges to hear a case. - [ Interruption.] No, that is an obligation of the State. This is the Committee Stage Discussions on the

Votes of the Ministry of Justice and that is why I am raising this issue. The Superior Courts Complex funding will not be sufficient to translate briefs. The Ministry of Justice must allocate funds for that. This must be taken as a priority, because these are the issues that gave rise to serious problems in this country for so long. In 1987 this amendment was brought in to the 1978 Constitution and to this day, you have no provision to implement that. I myself have many of these appeal briefs and we cannot argue the cases. Everyday, they go down for another six months because there are no judges proficient in Tamil to hear them. At one stage, there were two Muslim gentlemen who constituted what was called, a Tamil-speaking Bench. Now, those two gentlemen have also retired. Therefore, either you must have enough number of Tamil-speaking judges on the Bench in both superior courts or you must have a mechanism and sufficient funds for the translation of the briefs. The second is the most preferable, because then, you do not swap for Benches, you have a choice of all judges hearing the case, which is good.

I want to raise another serious issue which is again about the prisoners. I gave the numbers of 31 persons plus 8 persons, which makes 39 - enlarged on bail. Another 20 are supposed to go for rehabilitation and only one has gone, which is altogether 40. If the other 20 persons are also sent then it is about 60 odd. Now, there were 217 such prisoners. On the 16th of October, we were told "except a small number" of those who are accused of heinous crimes. We accepted that that can be dealt with later because that was going to be "a small number" - others would be released. Today, we have a situation where only about 60 persons released. More than 150 are still there. Not only that, a Special Court has been established to hear their cases. Under what definition do you say 150 out of 217 is a small number?

How can 150 be a small number out of 217? We thought it would be about 20 or 30 prisoners. We were told that there were 15 serious cases. So, we said, All right. That can be dealt with later. In those 15 cases, we thought there maybe more than one accused in each case; maybe 30 maximum. But, that is not what is happening. What is happening is that you set-up a Special Court and the Bar Association has raised serious questions about that court, that it is out of the ordinary. They opposed it and I am afraid, we have to oppose it as well for two reasons.

First is, because this is against the assurance given to us that you are going to continue to try 150 people under a law which you, yourself, have conceded will be repealed. Then, the second is, picking a judge by the Minister of Justice who has recommended the appointment of that judge to a Special Court to hear these special cases is not desirable at all. That raises serious suspicions. So, I urge the Government to abandon that project of this Special Court forthwith, because the intention or at least what was transmitted to us was never

229 230

to continue the trials of 150 people. That was to be about 20 to 30 people and we would look that as well. If there are very long-term prisoners there, that also have to be dealt with and they also have to be released. So, this is all in violation of definitive promises that have been given to us by the President, the Prime Minister and the relevant Ministers and I wish, before we conclude todays Proceedings, that the three Ministers would give us answers that are acceptable.

The Committee, after deliberations, agreed to provide CDs and DVDs in place of printed copies of Annual Reports which are routinely submitted by various institutions.

The Committee was of the opinion, that this will greatly reduce the high cost of printing these documents. However, it was decided to have about 15 hard copies placed in the library for the use of any Member who wishes to do so.

The Committee further directed the Secretary to make these documents available in the Parliamentary Website.

But the moment they find that the Government is lacking, the leadership is lacking the initiative to control, to focus on national security, they try to make the maximum out of it. Now, they have deviated from their principle, the policy, of being mediate. Automatically, we are pushing them to be extremists. This is something that you will have to take account of.

war crimes . I would like to draw a comparison. Take the incident that took place in Paris. ISIS attackers opened fire and bombed several public places in Paris including theatres and restaurants, leaving 184 people dead. The President of France, Franois Hollande and the French Government responded to the attack by sending in their fighter jets to Syria and bombing supposedly ISIS stronghold areas. The French Parliament also declared a state of emergency and extended it further in the wake of attacks. This has allowed the government to take into custody any person or, access or inspect any place or institution with no warrant or reason to do so. I would like to draw a comparison between Sri Lanka and Paris.

The reaction of French President Hollande and his Government to the attacks in Paris has been 24/7 bombing in Syria with the use of their fighter jets and drones. How is it different from what Sri Lanka did when we were confronted with terrorism? If military attacks on

303 304

[ ]

2015 04

another sovereign nation for the loss of 184 lives can be justified, how does the pre-war situation in Sri Lanka differ from that?

Mr. Chairman, the ISIS is a terrorist organization. The LTTE terrorist organization is banned or proscribed in 28 countries. President Francois Hollande, being the Commander-in-Chief of France, has the right to protect his country. An act of terrorism was committed against his country where 184 lives were lost. He and his Government goes into another sovereign country and bomb that nation mercilessly, killing, maybe, militant terrorists of the ISIS, but also innocent men, women and children. . . .

How are the innocent lives lost in Syria due to the bombs dropped by France termed as "unavoidable war casualties" by the champions of human rights? Those are termed as "unavoidable war casualties". Why do they measure us in a different way? In the Syrian crisis, 1.2 million people have become refugees. You would have seen children in those pictures. But, those are "war casualties". What happened in Sri Lanka are "war crimes". So, where is justice? Sir, they term the loss of innocent lives in Sri Lanka as "war crimes". No civilians confined in Sri Lanka were intentionally targeted.

Sir, I do not want to spend anymore time on this since I am running out of time. But, what I am trying to say is that there are double standards. So, let this be taken up as a country without being divided as green, blue and red, as to how the war situation in Sri Lanka differs from France's bombing mercilessly without any reservation, making 1.2 million people destitute, making them refugees and killing thousands of children. Those are "unavoidable war casualties" and accepted. But, we become war criminals. We are going to be tried and we are making ground for them to try us in Sri Lanka with the blessings of the UN and the international community. Is there justice in that? ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Member, your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Just give me two more minutes, Sir.

I would also like to state about the Avant Garde issue. Avant Garde became a subject here. Former Attorney-General, the Hon. Tilak Marapana, and the present Minister of Justice are here. Sir, I would like to table* the Agreement signed between Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Limited and Avant Garde in October, 2015, as I have hardly any time.

This is the Agreement that was signed. My good Friend, the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga, said that in September that they had this problem. Yes. In October, 2015, the Ministry of Defence signed an Agreement with Avant Garde. I am not a person holding a brief for Avant Garde. But the fact is that on the 20th of October, Avant Garde signed an agreement with the Ministry of Defence - the Minister is His Excellency the President - for five years. ( ) (The Hon. Chairman) Hon. Rambukwella, you have to wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Please give me 30 seconds to wind up.

Sir, what the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga said was right. There is Rs.510 million due and they have agreed to pay a 50 per cent down payment and the rest in instalments for the next ten months. Basically, what I am trying to say is that this is something that you have got to investigate. If they have done something wrong, let them be punished. But, remember that about 7,000 ex-servicemen are working in that organization. Do not let this slip into India, or any other country or any other interested party. Just investigate if they have done anything wrong and take action against them, that is not a problem, but do not penalize them over personal grievances.

Thank you. [.. 3.20] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe - Prime Minister, Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs) , . . . . , '' . .'' . . . .
