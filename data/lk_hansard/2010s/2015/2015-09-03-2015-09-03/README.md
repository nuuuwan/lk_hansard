. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) , " " . " " . , " " . , " " . . . The intention of the legislators is very clear. The interpretation given by the Hon. Anura Dissanayake is that it should include all political parties. Then it must say, - " " - all political parties. But it is not there. Therefore, the only possible interpretation you can give is that it need not include all political parties. Thank you.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) , " " . Hon. Speaker, the Government in UK has also determined - we have seen by precedent - what a National Government is. They had two - one during World War I and one during World War II. I would like to tell you that all the parties in the House of Commons in 1940 did not enter the National Government. The Independent Labour Party with two Members and two or three other small groups did not enter the Government. It was only the three main parties that came in. So National Government in no way means that all the parties in Parliament that were with us when we presented the definition in Parliament.

I would like to ask Hon. (Dr.) Jayampathy Wickramaratne, to quote something from the Hansard when

If at the conclusion of the General Election held immediately after the coming into force of this Article, the recognized political party or the independent group obtaining the highest and the recognized political party or the independent group obtaining the second highest number of seats in Parliament agrees to form a Government of national unity,

(DR) Jayampathy Wickramaratne) When you interpret a Constitution you do not ask the draftsman; you read the provision concerned. Hon. Speaker, it is very clear.

" ." . , " " . A reference to the largest party is not necessary and there is also a presumption against absurdity. . . There is a

105 106

presumption against absurdity. If this interpretation is accepted, just one small political party or one lone independent can frustrate the formation of a National Government.

In my respectful submission, Hon. Speaker, the law is very clear on this subject. My submission is fortified by the Proceedings of Parliament and the presumption against absurdity.

. . ( ) ( . - ( ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Sir, with due respect, the point I wanted to make has already been made by the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva. We are concerned with the interpretation of Article 46(5) of the Constitution. I am not going to make a statement on the merits or the demerits of the Bill. But, the definition of a National Government makes it clear that the National Government being constituted does not contemplate an alliance of all political parties. The definition is quite clear. Article 46 (5) of the Constitution states, I quote:

For the purpose of paragraph (4), National Government means, a Government formed by the recognized political party or the independent group which obtains the highest number of seats in Parliament together with the other recognized political parties or the independent groups.

107 108

[ ) ]

2015 03

Not "all". It does not say, together with all the other recognized political parties or the independent groups. So, the definition is quite clear that it does not mean that a National Government would be constituted by the main party and all the other parties coming together. The word, all is not there, which means, it can be the main party and one or more of the other political parties in the House. I think that position is very clear and that is my submission, Sir.

Thank you. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) , . " " . . , , . . () . " " . . "" , () . . " " " " . . , .

- I happened to be the lawyer in this famous case - the Ruling given by the then Speaker, the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike, where we obtained an interim order from the Supreme Court with regard to some Proceedings in Parliament as to whether a certain Resolution is to be accepted or not by the Hon. Speaker. When we obtained that interim order, there had been a lengthy debate in this House. After considering all the legal provisions and submissions, the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike delivered a historical, landmark judgment that when it comes to the affairs which are to be regulated within the House itself, it is purely a matter to be determined by the Hon. Speaker; it is not a matter within the purview or the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.

I can remember when there was a Resolution with regard to the impeachment of the former Chief Justice, then Speaker, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa also, by following the landmark Ruling of the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike, came to the same conclusion that when it comes to a matter within the purview of the House it is to be regulated by the House itself and that the court need not interfere and the court should not interfere.

Therefore, the question as to whether there has to be any determination from the Supreme Court with regard to the interpretation of the National Government is completely out and there is no relevance, no bearing whatsoever. Therefore, I would humbly like to inform the Hon. Speaker that this Determination is well within the purview of Parliament and it has to be finally determined by the Hon. Speaker. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

. ( ) ( . - ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Speaker, permit me to say a few words in regard to my elevation to the exalted position of Leader of the Opposition this morning as per the Announcement made by you. I am greatly humbled by this honour that has been conferred on me and I, on behalf of my Party, accept the position with a sense of humility.

I must congratulate you on upholding the conventions of this House in recognizing the party with the largest number of seats which has not formed any alliance with the Government as the party entitled to hold the position of the Leader of the Opposition. I wish to thank the voters of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, particularly the voters of Trincomalee, for the confidence they have reposed in my Party and in me. I also wish to thank my Colleagues for continuously electing me as their Parliamentary Group Leader.

, . , . . . , .

We will oppose the Government on all issues where it is the national interest to do so. We will support the Government on all issues where such support is justified. We will extend our fullest support to all parties and Members in the Opposition and we will work closely with them to ensure that we are an effective and efficient Opposition. This is an assurance I want to give all the political parties and Members in the Opposition that we will not hesitate to work with you unitedly to serve the cause of the Opposition and to be an effective and efficient Opposition against the Government whenever that is required. There are issues that need to be resolved in the national interest.

. Amongst them, is the long-festering Tamil question, . We would like to work closely with everyone to resolve this question. While we shall be loyal to this country and to the people of this country, I

must emphasize that it is also our primary duty to ensure that there is an acceptable resolution of the Tamil question. , , . . .

I might now, Sir, make a few comments on the Determination under the Constitution that we are presently discussing in this House. A National Government, in the present context in the country, is maybe a national need. The two main parties working together could be in the national interest. This is the first time in the countrys history that the two main parties have decided to come together and constitute a government. This is also in consonance with the two democratic verdicts delivered by the country recently and also in keeping with the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution. It is in keeping with the Nineteenth Amendment that this Resolution is brought to this House today.

What is happening maybe necessary; it maybe good for this country and we wish the process all success. But the increase in the number of Ministries to achieve this does not seem to be in conformity with good governance. It would have been much better if the two parties were able to come together without an increase in the number of Ministries. But unfortunately we have a culture in this country which has become deeply entrenched in recent times which has resulted in the number of Ministries being enhanced through various devious processes, including - if I might say so with respect - the use of various considerations in order to buy over Members of Parliament. I think we should put an end to this culture.

We must not forget that in our neighbouring country, India, which is a large country, they have only 65 Ministers: 27 Cabinet Ministers including the Prime Minister, 13 Ministers of State with independent charge and 25 Ministers of State. There are no Deputy Ministers there. A country of 1.2 billion people has only 65 Ministers. We have just 20 million people. This is something that we must bear in mind and the desire for Ministerial positions, which is against the national interest to an extent that is not consistent with the need of the country, is the culture that we must get over. That would be my submission.

While I do realize that in the present context a National Government, under any circumstances, maybe a dire necessity and maybe something which this country needs, we must also remember that this culture must be ended. This culture of everybody wanting to become Ministers somehow must be ended and we must turn a

new leaf. That will be in the interest of this country. So, taking a good example from our giant neighbour, where despite all the diversity that exists in that country, they are able to stay together on account of their structures of governance.

In fact, I was thinking to myself this morning, rather than having so many Ministers in the Centre, why can we not have three to five regions in this country, vested with substantial powers of governance? There are many young Members of Parliament who can be excellent Ministers and Chief Ministers in those three to five regions. Give them maximum power and allow them to rule various parts of this country in such a way that the peoples interests are best served. After all, India has today 29 States. The country is united, the country stays together. The country stays together because peoples aspirations are respected, honoured and implemented by the States which have been constituted in such a way so as to preserve linguistic interests, cultural interests, religious interests and so on. This is what we need.

So, Mr. Speaker, while we realize the importance of this Determination in the present context in our country, I think we need to get away from this culture of having excessive number of Ministers in our Cabinets. That is not very good and the people of this country would not respect that for too long.

I thank you, Sir.

They have pumped in enough money to the US Stock Market in trying to stabilize the economy, but in the last few weeks, Hon. Deputy Speaker, US Dollars 108 trillion has been wiped out from the US Stock Market, which means the US economy will be facing the biggest crisis to come. Now, Sir, US Dollars 108 trillion is out from the US Dollar 240 trillion Stock Market. This is a very serious issue. China is releasing its US bonds. The more it releases the US bonds, the more the crisis would be. This is what we are also going to face.

So, the " " of the Hon. Prime Minister or the " " of is not there. We have to face the reality of the crisis. The reality cannot be met by offering ministerial portfolios. The reality can only be met if we get down to the subject and try to evolve an acceptable way out of this economic crisis. We are in an economic crisis. The economic crisis will engulf us and a political crisis will also come. This is all what I have to say. So, under the name of a National Government people will be happy to see you go in a car flying a flag, but the crisis will be on the cards.

[1.55p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Hon. Deputy Speaker, first I would like to thank this House for appointing you to this position. I have known you for a long time and I am very confident that you will do an excellent job as the Deputy Speaker.

This country has gone through a 30-year old war. We have been divided on race, religion and creed on party lines. His Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena on January 8th obtained a mandate on the basis of forming a National Government. The reason being, he wanted to go against the party lines based on race, religion and creed. Today, the UPFA and the United National Party are forming a National Government and we are seeking to get approval for this Resolution. There is a constitutional provision that the Cabinet should be 30, but if there is a National Government formed by the first and the second party - which obtain the highest number of seats - you can seek the mandate from this House.

In the past some leaders have had Cabinets which have also been known as Jumbo Cabinets." Here, there is a need, because we have reached a consensus that all of us want to be part of the development of this country. Therefore, we have to work together. How can we work together? Each party has to have somebody in the Cabinet to represent them and also the diversity that is there in the Cabinet will definitely help us move forward.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would also like to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. R. Sampanthan. It is a great achievement that this House has decided to appoint Hon. R. Sampanthan as the Leader of the Opposition. It shows that this country is moving in a new direction. Earlier, we always thought on communal lines. Over 30 years, the Muslims, the Sinhalese and the Tamils were divided on various issues. But, President Maithripala Sirisena very clearly stated, I want to unite the people of this country. At a time when President Mahinda Rajapaksa challenged him, utilizing all State machinery, the people of the North-East and the South decided that President Maithripala Sirisena should lead this country. Also, we should be aware that no party obtained an absolute majority. That proves that the people of this country have decided that President Maithripala Sirisena should give leadership to this country with the support of all parties. In the past, politicians spoke about National Governments, but there was no sincerity in their approach. The first thing President Maithripala Sirisena did after the January 8th Presidential Election was to appoint the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe as the Prime Minister. Even this time, soon after the General Election, he appointed the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe as the Prime Minister. Therefore, we should think differently. Recently, I participated in a debate where certain

Members of the United National Party said, " ." We have to move away from thinking on party lines even at village level. That is important in this country because we have lost lives; we have been left behind; countries have developed and people have got various benefits through that development. But this division of people by using race, religion has resulted in confrontational politics in this country. Therefore, from the time we obtained Independence, it is proved that confrontational politics has not helped. Therefore, this Resolution should be supported by all.

It is unfortunate that the JVP is taking up the stand that the Cabinet should have only 30 Ministers, and now we are seeking that the Cabinet be increased further. The JVP should understand that when we discuss the concept of a National Government, all parties, all Members, should be given an opportunity of being a stakeholder in the development. He said that we should restrict it to 30 Cabinet Ministers. But there are practical difficulties. That is why 212 Members of Parliament voted for the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The Nineteenth Amendment gave the option that if this House desires, we could increase the number of Cabinet Ministers and that is what is going to be achieved by this bipartisan approach. Therefore, all Members of this House should support the National Government for future prosperity of this country.

Thank you. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . . , . . . .

. - - . . ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . [2.56 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Speaker, permit me first to congratulate you and wish you well as you preside over the Proceedings for the first time as the Deputy Speaker today.

Today happens to be a historic day when our Party Leader, Hon. R. Sampanthan, has been recognized as the Leader of the Opposition. I wish him also well in the discharge of his functions as the Leader of the Opposition. I say this is a historic day because this is the second time a Member of the Tamil community has assumed this Office. The first was in July 1977, when the Hon. A. Amirthalingam adorned the Office of the Leader of the Opposition. Yet, that ended in a rather unfortunate way. In 1983, consequent to the adoption of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution and the extension of the life of Parliament through a devious means of a Referendum, the TULF, at that time, did not attend Parliament and one by one lost their seats in Parliament and it happens to be that the Hon. R. Sampanthan was the first to lose his seat in Parliament in 1983. In some way, today, these fortunes have been reversed and the very person who lost his seat first in 1983 has been recognized as the Leader of the Opposition. This bodes well for the country; this bodes well for this House.

There is a National Government. I think the phrase is well used for the reason that the party that has obtained the largest number of seats and the party that has obtained the second large number of seats have joined together and have formed a National Government to address serious issues that have plagued this country for so long. I am glad that today, speakers on both sides of the House have identified the Tamil national question as one of the foremost issues that need addressing in this National Governments endeavours. But, I am also saddened that when they refer to what they call "the challenges from international community", they are rather short-sighted and view these concerns that have been raised internationally as some kind of a threat to national sovereignty. I urge this House not to view the legitimate concerns raised by the international community with regard to matters that have taken place in this country as a threat, but rather as an opportunity in which we can put our House in order and not to look at the questions of accountability as something in which we must protect someone or the other. We must be transparent and truthful. If we are truthful about what we did to each other, then, that is a way forward as for us. I speak for my Party. We are willing to open and look at even injustices that were committed in the name of the Tamil people and similarly, we urge the rest of the country to face up to what actually happened, rather than think of it as national pride and something that you need to sweep under the carpet.

With regard to the Resolution before this House, also I am saddened that whilst the Government has taken very positive steps forward, that it still deems it necessary to increase the number of Cabinet Ministers, State Ministers and Deputy Ministers.

We had an extraordinary situation this morning when a Member of this House tendered his resignation. I say it

181 182

is extraordinary because he gave some reasons, which this House has not seen or heard hitherto. I sympathize with that Member who resigned today. I agree with him in the sentiments that he expressed, but I disagree that he had to leave the House. I wish he had remained and worked towards changing the scenarios that he did not like. That has a very direct bearing to the Resolution before this House today and in some way I think we must recognize the bravery of that gentleman who has acquired a name and reputation as an upright public officer to have said what he wanted to say and leave this Assembly.

The increase in the number of Cabinet Ministers, State Ministers and Deputy Ministers is happening for the very reasons that he stated in the House this morning. When the Prime Minister moved the Resolution, he said, We are forming a National Government. He did not say why, therefore, the numbers have to be increased. Every Member of the Government and even from this side of the divide - probably those who will be seated on that side very soon - supported the idea of increase of numbers, but did not justify it. We are all for a National Government to address national issues. That is a good thing. But why pray that you have to increase the number of Ministers? This is where the whole noble intention of yours goes down. It gets sullied. It is obviously bribery to join the Government. What else can it be? If the Members of this House want to support the noble intentions of the Government, they can very well join the Government, sit on that side and support it. You do not have to become a Cabinet Minister or a State Minister or a Deputy Minister to do that. This culture of thinking that practically this is necessary, brings the reputation of the Members of this House weigh down; it pulls it down. And I wish we will get out of this culture of thinking that if somebody needs to support something good that the Government is doing, you have to offer that person a portfolio.

That is nothing but bribery and I am very sad that whilst we support the efforts of the Government to form a National Government to address issues that are very important - issues that we hope will be resolved during the next one or two years - that you have resorted to a method that is not so noble and until that changes, there is a long way that we have to go before we see this country on the right path.

So, we oppose, in principle, the Resolution before this House and, as the new Leader of the Opposition clearly said today, we will oppose the moves of the Government if we think that that is not in the national interest, but, whatever that this new National Government does in the direction of resolving the national issue; dealing with other important issues; particularly, enacting the third Republican Constitution, which will identify and affirm the distinctiveness of the different peoples who inhabit

this country whilst forging one national identity, we will support it wholeheartedly.

Thank you very much for this opportunity. [.. 3.06] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem)
