, . . , . . , 2012 22 () . .

Out of the three Motions relationg to Local Government Bodies moved today, the first Motion relates to members of the Provincial Councils and Local Government Bodies to continue to be Justices of the Peace even after their term expires. Hon. Member, we have to look at the legality of this issue. Originally, in terms of the Municipal Councils

525 526

Ordinance and the Urban Councils Ordinance, you would realize that the Mayor, the Deputy Mayor, the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman are entitled to be Justices of the Peace and also unofficial Magistrates. There was an amendment brought to the Judicature (Amendment) Act, No. 29 of 1991 where members of the Provincial Councils and members of the Local Government Bodies were incorporated into the Fifth Schedule to be ex-officio members. The question here is, when a Member of Parliament ceases to be a Member of Parliament, he does not have the right to be a Justice of the Peace. , . When you appoint a Justice of the Peace, there is a great responsibility. However, there was a dialogue with regard to introducing a pension scheme after ten years. Those are more prudent mechanisms, because you have realized the quality of the Justice of the peace and now there is also an educational requirement to become a Justice of the Peace. You must not allow a person without any educational qualifications to be a Justice of the Peace, because a document which is attested by him can be used in a court of law. So, there should be a certain degree of education needed to be a Justice of the Peace.

Therefore, with regard to the first Motion, I would like to ask the House to reconsider this Motion and see whether we can extend the post of the Justice of the Peace of members of the Provincial Councils and the Local Government Bodies after they cease to hold office, because it is given to them as ex officio members.

The second and the third Motions relate to the benefits given to a Members of Provincial Councils. Some Hon. Members of the House raised the issue that the law says that a Provincial Council member is entitled to 50 per cent of what a Member of Parliament is entitled to. If we want to increase their benefits, one would say that we have to increase the benefits of a Member of Parliament, because it is tied up. Already there is a public outcry that the Members of Parliament are getting too many facilities. But there is another dimension to this. Some Members raised the issue that members of Provincial Councils are not even getting their 50 per cent. Therefore, my Ministry will look into this and see whether that is in compliance with the law - that Members of Provincial Councils would get their entitlement of 50 per cent of what the Members of Parliament get.

Then, the other Motion was with regard to perks and privileges given to members of the Provincial Councils and the Local Government Bodies. We have realized that they have great difficulties and continuously governments have taken steps to improve their facilities. So, we will take a policy decision to increase the benefits given to members of the Provincial Councils and the Local Government Bodies. But also there is a public outcry with regard to the performance and the conduct of Local Government Bodies. I

was compelled to set up a separate unit in my Ministry to deal with corruption issues related to Local Government Bodies. As you are aware, today the public perception towards Local Government Bodies is very low. Therefore, whilst improving the facilities of the members of Local Government Bodies, we have also to look into the fact that there is a public outcry with regard to their conduct.

Therefore, I thank the Hon. Buddhika Pathirana and the other Hon. Members who took part in this Discussion. We will consider all these views and move forward and see that benefits are given. We will also see that conduct and decorum of Local Government Bodies are maintained.

Therefore, once again I thank everybody for participating in this Discussion. We will take note of this issue and move forward. Thank you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you. , . [.. 6.33] ( ) (The Hon. Buddhika Pathirana) , . , , . .
