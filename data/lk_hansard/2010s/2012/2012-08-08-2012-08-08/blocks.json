Finally, the Deputy Minister of Education replied and that should have been the end of the Adjournment Debate. Sometimes, during the Adjournment Debate, you find a Member coming and contesting what the Minister says leading to an argument, but it ends at that. You do not go outside that; that is the only topic taken up. But, in this instance, that had not taken place. After the Deputy Minister, the Hon. Gamini Wijith Wijayamuni De Zoysa replied, we found the Hon. Hunais Farook getting up to speak. Then, the Presiding Member in the Chair allowed that. The Chair cannot allow that especially when the Secretary-General also advised against it. - [Interruption.] Let me finish it. At that stage, even the Chief Government Whip intervened to say that it is on the situation in Mannar. But, when you read the speech - I think even the Chief Government Whip had been misled - you find that there is nothing about the situation in Mannar, but it is a reply to some of the speeches made in the House earlier by the Hon. John Amaratunga and the Hon. J. Sri Ranga. That should have been replied at that stage. If he smuggled it in while the Adjournment Debate was going on, that is a different issue because sometimes you find other issues coming up during the Adjournment Debate. But, once the Adjournment Debate was over, you could not go beyond it. Then, you found the Hon. Ajith P. Perera getting up and objecting to parts of it, at which stage, with the objections, the Chair should have adjourned, cutting it off. In one part, the Hon. Farook referred to the conduct of the Magistrate of Mannar, that he came in his official robe and ordered the police to shoot. Now, that is a matter which is under investigation. Anyway, the conduct of a person administering justice cannot be taken up without a substantive Motion under Standing Order No. 78. So, when that happened, that should have been over and it should not have gone anywhere beyond that. But, what happened was, the Chair allowed it to go on. That is all contrary to the Standing Orders. When you say Question put, and agreed to, the Question was put and agreed to when the Deputy Minister, the Hon. Gamini Wijith Wijayamuni De Zoysa, finished his reply. After that, there was no other Question to be put. What the Hon. Farook raised was not part of it. So, you could not allow it. It had nothing to do with what had been debated and if you had allowed it during the time when the Adjournment Debate was going on, that is a different matter; you cannot argue on it.",

That is where I am drawing the distinction. He cannot reply to those speeches. If something else had taken place, if there had been another shootout or if there had been some other incident in the last few hours, we should actually have given him time before the Minister replied. Now, what is in Hansard cannot be removed. I only ask you to ensure that proper procedure is followed. As far as the conduct of the Hon. Member who was in the Chair is concerned - I do not think that we have a way of bringing a Motion against any person: the Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Deputy Speaker or the Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees - all we can say is that that person is not fit to be on the Chairmans Panel. But, the problem is, we are not discussing Notice of Motions or Orders of the Day. Unfortunately, what happened on that day was the Hon. Member who was presiding at that time seems to have confused with the Orders of the Day and Notice of Motions with loose motions, and that loose motion is continuing all the time. - [Interruption.]",

You all use Gandhi, Bush and Cameron when you want; but you all act like typical Mugabes. That is the difference. All we want is to ensure that there is a decorum in Parliament. We are the principal Opposition and the alternate government and when we say something, we say it with responsibility. It is for the Government to disprove it with facts rather than try to basically belittle a question that we pose and try to go on a voyage of discovery. The biggest problem is that you lack substance; you have a bad brief and you are unable to prove to the people who are suffering day in and day out.",

Then, the second point I want to make is that though you made all these allegations, we have responded to all these questions which are put before this forum on various occasions. Now, I want to refer to a few. For example, on the question of Greece Bonds, I gave a very full answer on the 17th of July 2012. I gave a very comprehensive answer. I believe it was to the satisfaction of the Leader of the Opposition and I saw a columnist of the \"Sunday Island\" complimenting me and the Government for giving a very honest answer to this issue. Even regarding the EPF and ETF investments, I gave a very comprehensive answer. It was given in response to a statement made by the Leader of the Opposition. If you want to get details, I can give you. Just go down to the Library and look at that because I tabled all those documents. You can get all that information. It may be true that under your Questions, some of those things may not have been answered and we may have asked for time. But, I have given a very comprehensive answer to this House on the question of investments of ETF and EPF. If",

In the real world, everything does not go in the way that it is found in textbooks. You can always find some problems but one must look at the bigger picture. Where are we going? Are we going on a satisfactory trajectory and what do competent agencies say about our trajectory? These are the questions we have to ask. That is why I referred to the revered Mahatma Gandhi. During the struggle for Independence, Mahatma Gandhi said, As colonialists, you can find a lot of problems with the Indian Congress. You can find a lot of problems with the Indian Representatives. But, that is a drainage inspectors report. You can have a good working system of public drainage. An inspector will say, A tap is missing here; water is flowing out there. Some commode is not working properly. All those are true. But, while that is true, one must look at the total system of water management. So, I am going to prove this to you by quoting very competent people. We have to look at the indicators of the totality of this growth pattern. You may disagree with our emphasis. That is your right. But, as the Government, we are following the targets and objectives that we have set for ourselves. So, look at what these people, who are supposed to supervise and regulate, not only the Sri Lankan economy but also the global economy, say. You know the mandate of the IMF is global surveillance because today we are interlinked in the economic sense and they have to look at each economy; see how they are integrated, and how the lack of progress in one economy can impact on the other as we are now experiencing in the global economy. What have they said? Look at what the IMF has said. I am going to read to you what the IMF authorities have stated.",

The EPF has made several investments in various listed corporates through the Colombo Stock Exchange and also in selected unlisted corporates on the basis of the intrinsic value of the company, its growth prospects, the possible enhancements of share value in the medium to long-term, its governing structures, the viability and prospects of the industry, the quantity of shares available, its future plans, impact of the growing economy on the company et cetera.

They sit together and decide the companies that should be invested in. It is not a private decision made by the Governor or any other single person. There is a whole procedure. There is a research unit; they prepare research papers. They look deep into the companies concerned. They look at what that company can do for the economy of this country, a whole variety of factors are studied. Then, they make recommendations not to the Governor. Recommendations are made to a Deputy Governor who studies this. Then, finally, a paper goes to the Governor who is also mandated to discuss these matters and take orders from the Monetary Board.

As far as these investments are concerned, these are long-term investments. We will hold on to these till such time. After all, if the country is going at 8 per cent growth, the time must come when the stocks must go up.",

That is why they are not going to courts. If they go to courts, the courts will point out why this decision was made. So, please let us keep it at a level of logic. So, as far as the EPF and ETF are concerned, we have said earlier that these are long-term investments. We are one hundred per cent sure that as we go along, the value will increase and when the value increases, the amount of money that will be given to the individual worker will be higher. And, in any case, finally, it is up to the Government and we can even give ex gratia payments if you want. So, do not worry. Not a single worker has approached you. We do not recognize you as you are the party that has harassed workers; murdered workers. - [Interruption.]",

Thus, the Muslims of Mannar, including the fishermen of Uppukulam, were forced to leave their homes. Mannar is not a recent Muslim settlement. It is one of the earliest Muslim settlements in Sri Lanka. The fisherfolk in Mannar are successors to these early settlers. However, to the LTTEs genocidal and narrow view, all that meant nothing; the traditional homelands and the birthplace of others did not matter. What mattered to them was the ethnically cleansed Tamil Eelam. It was an LTTE dream. But, it was our nightmare and more so, for a majority of the Tamil people. For 22 years, these Muslims have lived as refugees since they were evicted from their lands. There are those who are obstructing their return and resettlement. They are giving effect to the LTTE decree that Mannar should be without Muslims. I do not think that any Member of this honourable House will accept that. I certainly will not.",

In Colombo, in the High Court of Colombo, in one of the foremost court buildings in our country, learned lawyers together with others broke furniture, shouted, abused and showed their anger in open court. Many saw the incidents as a pre-planned protest against the judgment of the High Court. When illiterate fishermen protest against a Magistrate, that is condemned but when lawyers shout at and abuse High Court judges, everyone including the legal fraternity and sections of the media are silent. One judge in that case was no less than a most senior High Court judge, a lady and a well-respected member of the judiciary. So, why was the Bar Association silent then? These are questions that the Bar Association must answer before taking sides on an issue that arose from total indifference to the heartburns of the much maligned Muslim fisherfolk.",

Ivor Jennings was quoted as saying that the Opposition will have its say but the Government will have its way. He took out of context because more than once he repeated himself by saying that the Opposition can say whatever it wants but even a single word that they say, we will do what we want. That was certainly not in the spirit of democracy because he repeated himself and I will say that that was actually showing a contempt of democracy. Democracy is where a government is enriched by the criticism of the Opposition and amends its programme as it goes along. I was shocked that such a Senior Minister in this House would continuously make such a statement.",

    "text": "The Hon. Amunugama was talking about the attack of the Opposition on the Central Bank and its Governor. I think the question that is pertinent was to ask about the independence of the Central Bank. The independence of the Central Bank is the question at heart. We have quite a few things actually that are being debated. We have the value of the rupee and the devaluation of the rupee. We have the hedging contracts that we have been discussing and debating. We have other matters that we have been discussing and if there was a common factor, it was the Governor of the Central Bank and the Central Bank. The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama said that we need to look at the whole economy as a whole and I agree with him. But, I also wanted to point out that when the rule of law diminishes, it diminishes us all. In the Asian crisis in 1997, the Thai Baht was defended at a cost of the half of the countrys reserves in Thailand by the Governor, Mr. Rerngchai Marakanond. He basically wasted US Dollars 30 billion before the Baht depreciated from 25 to 48 to the Dollar. The senior officers of the Thai Central Bank had endorsed the Governors decision without providing sound counsel and that is what the inquiries subsequently showed. Why did they do this? They did this, according to the inquiry, because of the job and the perks they received. The Sri Lankan Rupee has depreciated from around Rs. 113 to Rs. 135 to the Dollar. Before it began to depreciate, the Sri Lankan reserves were blown away by Dollars two and a half billion which was also nearly half the reserves of the country. That inquiry against the Thai Governor of Central Bank was initially upheld by a court that he had mishandled the economy.",

    "text": "There was a discussion today on the EPF and Members of the Government took great pains to say that 92 per cent of the EPF was safely deposited in Government securities and we have no debate about it. It is true that we are debating about the quantum of money that was put in the stock market. In todays context, it is nearly Rs. 75 billion to Rs. 80 billion. A 10 per cent loss on that, would be Rs. 8 billion. But, in the year 2009 and 2010, when the stock market rose by 125 per cent and 96 per cent, those who had invested their hard-earned money in the EPF only received in one year less than 4 per cent and in the next year just over 4 per cent. That is why the Opposition has consistently and continuously brought this to the attention of the nation. The EPF has been used among other captive Government funds basically to buy shares above their intrinsic value and subsequently encounter a loss. These shares have been invested not in blue-chip companies as the requirement is but also sometimes in unlisted companies and sometimes in newly-listed companies, which are companies that are not financially stable. Also, now there is evidence that there has been a scheme of pumping and dumping in the market where a few investors have profited at the expense of the working people of this country.",

We strongly argue, not only for the independence of the Central Bank but also for the independence of the Securities and Exchange Commission, that the Commissioners be appointed apolitically and also that the Commission would report to Parliament and be remunerated by Parliament. There is a breakdown in law and order and in good governance. The economic connection between good governance and the economy is a proven thing in contemporary economic research and literature. More recently there have been studies at the Harvard University by an Italian economist and by others strengthening the views of conservative economists of years gone by. That is why we continuously bring this to the attention of the Government. We have discussed many things today. But, I would also like to highlight at this time, the issues to do with those who are in the evening of their lives.",

Make it public; be transparent; let the country know about it. We always do not need to have laws to do these things. We tried to bring in a Right to Information Bill and we were blocked and not allowed to bring that. The Government promised to introduce a Right to Information Bill and we are still eagerly waiting for the Governments Bill. Meanwhile, this oil hedging deal is a matter of public interest, but we also want to know the details of that Right to Information Bill. This zero-cost collar option was taken. At that point, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation did not pay a fee. So, it was natural that inherently this contract was going to be disadvantageous to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. So, who takes responsibility? There are two questions that I would like to pose before the House: who approved the hedging transaction and who, in the Government, takes responsibility? That is the first question. We have been told at many different times that it was officials; that it was the Board of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation; that it was the Cabinet and so on and so forth.",
