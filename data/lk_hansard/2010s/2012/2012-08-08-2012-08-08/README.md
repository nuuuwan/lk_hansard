( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, Standing Order No. 19 deals with the Business of Parliament. After Public Business, we have made provision for Adjournment Motions. With regard to an Adjournment Motion, the normal way is, notice is given by an Hon. Member through the Hon. Leader of the House or the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. Then, you get half an hour for the Opposition, half an hour for the Government and with the Minister replying, the Adjournment Motion comes to an end, at which stage the House has to be postponed to sit, as decided or according to the Standing Orders, on the next Sitting Day. So,

667 668

2012 08

anything that takes place after the Adjournment Motion is not valid. Sir, I can quote the relevant Standing Orders but to save the time of the House, I just put it down because this is accepted.

On the 19th of July, 2012, the Adjournment Motion was moved by the Hon. Buddhika Pathirana regarding the Principals Service. There were views expressed. Finally, the Deputy Minister of Education replied and that should have been the end of the Adjournment Debate. Sometimes, during the Adjournment Debate, you find a Member coming and contesting what the Minister says leading to an argument, but it ends at that. You do not go outside that; that is the only topic taken up. But, in this instance, that had not taken place. After the Deputy Minister, the Hon. Gamini Wijith Wijayamuni De Zoysa replied, we found the Hon. Hunais Farook getting up to speak. Then, the Presiding Member in the Chair allowed that. The Chair cannot allow that especially when the Secretary-General also advised against it. - [Interruption.] Let me finish it. At that stage, even the Chief Government Whip intervened to say that it is on the situation in Mannar. But, when you read the speech - I think even the Chief Government Whip had been misled - you find that there is nothing about the situation in Mannar, but it is a reply to some of the speeches made in the House earlier by the Hon. John Amaratunga and the Hon. J. Sri Ranga. That should have been replied at that stage. If he smuggled it in while the Adjournment Debate was going on, that is a different issue because sometimes you find other issues coming up during the Adjournment Debate. But, once the Adjournment Debate was over, you could not go beyond it. Then, you found the Hon. Ajith P. Perera getting up and objecting to parts of it, at which stage, with the objections, the Chair should have adjourned, cutting it off. In one part, the Hon. Farook referred to the conduct of the Magistrate of Mannar, that he came in his official robe and ordered the police to shoot. Now, that is a matter which is under investigation. Anyway, the conduct of a person administering justice cannot be taken up without a substantive Motion under Standing Order No. 78. So, when that happened, that should have been over and it should not have gone anywhere beyond that. But, what happened was, the Chair allowed it to go on. That is all contrary to the Standing Orders. When you say Question put, and agreed to, the Question was put and agreed to when the Deputy Minister, the Hon. Gamini Wijith Wijayamuni De Zoysa, finished his reply. After that, there was no other Question to be put. What the Hon. Farook raised was not part of it. So, you could not allow it. It had nothing to do with what had been debated and if you had allowed it during the time when the Adjournment Debate was going on, that is a different matter; you cannot argue on it.

Secondly, while that was a matter which was outside the subject under discussion and the Secretariat had advised against it but it was allowed. So, that is contrary to the Standing Orders and the practices of this House. That is why I wanted to bring this issue to your notice. You should go into it, Sir, because it is an important issue.

, . . . . . . , . . . . . .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Speaker, may I intervene? In the first instance, the way the Hon. Leader of the Opposition thought of raising this in Parliament today itself contravenes the Standing Orders. He has no clause or provision to raise this question in this way. That is number one. Therefore, Sir, I would urge that all what he said be expunged from Hansard. That is my contention.

Number two is, nowhere does it say that, after the Adjournment Debate, an Hon. Member cannot raise any questions. He quoted, very surreptitiously, Standing Order No. 19, but did not detail it. It does not say that.

669 670

On that day, Sir, it was I who presided in your Chair, in that hallowed place. Standing Order No. 138 states, I quote:

Anything which by these Standing Orders may be done by Mr. Speaker, may be done by the Deputy Speaker or Deputy Chairman of Committees or by a member elected by Parliament presiding in the place of Mr. Speaker

That had been duly followed. Then, Sir, I must remind the Hon. Leader of the Opposition to look into the last Standing Order, No. 142, which I quote:

All matters not specifically provided for..."

I emphasize and underline the words "not specifically provided for". I want to send him a new copy of the Standing Orders across the Floor. Sir, it goes on to state, I quote:

"All matters not specifically provided for in these Standing Orders and all questions relating to the detailed working of these Standing Orders shall be regulated in such manner as Mr. Speaker may, from time to time, direct.

That is, in the place of Mr. Speaker, Deputy Speaker or Deputy Chairman of Committees, by a Member who presides over. So, it had been duly followed.

If I may give an explanation of what happened on that day, after the Debate, the Hon. Member, the Hon. Hunais Farook, said that there was a matter of national importance and that it had to be raised, and it was so. Therefore, the Chair allowed it at that time. The Chief Government Whip also supported it at that time. He said, Yes, . Then, the Hon. Ajith P. Perera, after a slumber in this House and after the Hon. Hunais Farook spoke for about five or ten minutes, - [Interruption.] . . . Mount Lavinia , extend . - [Interruption.]

So, Sir, after such a slumber, the Hon. Ajith P.Perera got up and objected. Since he raised a point of Order, I asked the Hon. Hunais Farook to conclude his speech and it was supported also by the Chief Government Whip. That is all what happened. So, it had been done according to the Standing Orders. Standing Order No. 19 does not say that you cannot raise a matter of Privilege or a matter of importance after the Adjournment Debate. The debate is not what is important. Sir, he must read Erskine May again. Any Adjournment Motion does not end by itself. If there is any matters of national importance, such matters could be allowed at the decision of the Chair. That is what Erskine May - the authority on parliamentary practices - also says in this regard.

Therefore, Sir, nothing was done contrary to the Standing Orders. What is contrary is what has been done today by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, who has been charged in the Mount Lavinia Court, his getting up and saying that that had been a violation of the Standing Orders. But, those had not been violated.

Thank you.

( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I am drawing your attention to the proviso to Standing Order No. 23(2) which states that when a matter of public importance may be raised, it can only be raised at the conclusion of Questions by the Leader of the Opposition or a leader of a recognized political party after due notice has been given. That is the only stage at which a matter of public importance can be raised. If this matter, which is described as a matter of public importance, was raised after the Adjournment Debate, when the matter of the Adjournment Debate was also over, that is clearly in contravention of the Standing Orders of Parliament.

What was raised by the Leader of the Opposition today is a matter within Parliament. No one outside is raising this issue. Within Parliament itself - I agree with the Hon. Dilan Perera - it has been raised on the 19th of July. When the Standing Orders clearly state as to when a matter of public importance could be raised, it was not raised at that stage. So, Standing Order No. 142 has no application because if it has been specifically provided for, then rulings from the Chair will not matter after the Adjournment Debate. But, after the Adjournment Debate has been concluded, there is absolutely no way in which the Standing Orders would permit a matter of public importance, as described by the Chief Government Whip.

673 674

He described it as a matter of public importance. If it was a matter of public importance, it could never have been raised at that stage in Parliament. This Parliament can now look at that and bring it to the notice of the Hon. Speaker to make a ruling on that.

substantive Motion . . . . . . . 71. (1) . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, firstly, this is a matter which has been raised by an Hon. Member in this House and not by anyone outside the House.

Secondly, this matter was raised today after the Hansard of 19th July, 2012 was tabled in Parliament. Unfortunately, we are unable to get the Hansard out on the very next day and the Hansard of 19th July was tabled only yesterday because that was the first Sitting Day after the 19th of July. So, we were able to go through it only yesterday and we raised this matter today. I think there is a point if we raise it after three months. Certainly, we cannot do that. Otherwise, Hon. Speaker, the Hansard will have to be available to us on the very next day but I do not think that is technically possible today with the workload that is there, especially for a Parliament which functions in all three languages.

As far as I am concerned, I must first tell the House about the matters of public importance. I think some of the other speakers have dealt with it. What is Public Business? Standing Order No. 20(1) states, I quote:

Public Business shall consist of Orders of the Day and Notices of Motions.

So, Orders of the Day and Notices of Motions were also there. The last one was the Adjournment Motion. There was a big issue as to what the Adjournment Motion is. Mr. Speaker, just let me read out this quotation and after that I can tell you from where I got it. I quote:

" 'Adjournment' means the temporary termination of sittings of the House of Parliament until it meets again on a future date. The issues raised by a Member of Parliament at the time of adjournment are called Adjournment Motions.

Adjournment motions can be moved at the adjournment time for which one hour has been allocated each day.

Once the adjournment motion is moved by the Member it should be seconded by another Member. After the debate, the Minister concerned has to reply. For the debate 30 minutes are allocated for the Government and 30 minutes are allocated for the Opposition.

675 676

[ .. ]

2012 08

This was taken from your own website -Parliament website - because an Hon. Member asked from where I took this.

Once the Minister has replied, the Adjournment Debate is over and the House has to conclude its Sitting. Now, this issue was not under Notice of Motions or Orders of the Day. Then, the Hon. Chief Government Whip raised an issue. - [Interruption.] Yes, there was a Debate on Regulations under the Maritime Pollution Prevention Act and under the Standing Orders, anyone can reply and the Chair takes a Vote when the matter has been debated fully. Once it has been debated fully, the Chair takes the Vote and then proceeds to the next item. After the Debate is over, nobody can come back and say, I want to debate this issue. That is the position of the House.

Secondly, the Hon. Chief Government Whip did refer to the fact that there were issues of critical importance which had developed that day itself and that it be taken up. If that was so, even then he has to get the permission of the House. But, I do not find fault with him. Now, I quote from Column 457 of the Hansard dated 19th July, 2012 wherein the Hon. Chief Government Whip said:

Hon. Presiding Member, there is a very urgent and important matter in relation to the situation in Mannar

Sir, when we read the speech of the Member, we find that there is nothing about an urgent situation in Mannar. It is a reply to the speeches made by the other Members on that day. That is where I am drawing the distinction. He cannot reply to those speeches. If something else had taken place, if there had been another shootout or if there had been some other incident in the last few hours, we should actually have given him time before the Minister replied. Now, what is in Hansard cannot be removed. I only ask you to ensure that proper procedure is followed. As far as the conduct of the Hon. Member who was in the Chair is concerned - I do not think that we have a way of bringing a Motion against any person: the Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Deputy Speaker or the Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees - all we can say is that that person is not fit to be on the Chairmans Panel. But, the problem is, we are not discussing Notice of Motions or Orders of the Day. Unfortunately, what happened on that day was the Hon. Member who was presiding at that time seems to have confused with the Orders of the Day and Notice of Motions with loose motions, and that loose motion is continuing all the time. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

. . rose. ( ) (An Hon. Member) You are making it worse.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, Standing Order No. 71(1) is very clear on this. It states, I quote:

"Mr. Speaker in Parliament and the Chairman in any Committee shall be responsible for the observances of the rules of order in Parliament and Committee respectively and their decision upon any point of Order shall not be open to appeal and shall not be reviewed by Parliament except upon a substantive motion made after notice.

This is the Standing Order which the Hon. Leader of the Opposition is contravening. Today, Sir, we saw a futile attempt being made by the Member of the TNA trying to defend the Hon. Leader of the Opposition and it shows a new alliance, a UNP-TNA Koti alliance. This must be told to the entire country.

We are the principal Opposition and the alternate government and when we say something, we say it with responsibility. It is for the Government to disprove it with facts rather than try to basically belittle a question that we pose and try to go on a voyage of discovery. The biggest problem is that you lack substance; you have a bad brief and you are unable to prove to the people who are suffering day in and day out.

This is the problem. Financial discipline has eroded and people who should live up to their professional standards are not doing so. That is why the Government is allowed to have a carte blanche to do anything and everything they want. Look at the sense of shamelessness. The stock market has a couple of influential mafias. They go before the President and say that the cause for the drop in confidence of the stock market is because of the United National Party. I mean, where on earth do you get such situations? This is the shamelessness of such professionals.

I was astonished to see the presence of some of them who had quoted through the "Financial Times". We were able to read that. Even though the editor was not there, at least we got to know what was going on. So, it is a clear reflection that all these so-called businessmen are singing hosannas for their dinner. They are worried and want to

go and tell the President, I am sorry, your financial policies are wrong. Where is the active Finance Minister who is there? You have a Deputy Minister who does not answer Questions in Parliament. You have a Senior Minister who has a bad brief and trying do his best out of it but he is also getting offloaded on the way. So, this is a very serious situation. I think there is a necessity for an all-party mechanism, to ensure that we bring the economy under control.

If you take the rates of Treasury Bonds, Hon. Minister, you would see that the impact is Rs. 82 billion. Tell me whether you are putting these into the capital investment of this country or not? No is the answer. If that is the case, who is held responsible? You are the ones who have been running this country for the last 19 years except for the two years that we were in power during which period we had financial discipline. But by doing so, what happened? We made the economy and we paid the price for doing so. On that particular basis, all we can say is that there is a necessity to ensure that we have financial discipline coming in.

So, there must be a sense of collective responsibility. It is with that sense of responsibility that the United National Party has always been coming forward. But, if that support is regarded as a weakness, then that is a problem. The biggest problem in our country is not bad people doing bad things but the good people not doing anything. That is the problem. - [Interruption.] That is a different matter. Do not worry about the internal politics of the UNP. Today, it has been manifested very clearly that the people who have gone to those places are doing an incalculable amount of damage than what it would have normally been. - [Interruption.] Do not worry about our party.

"" consulting firm , contract . ! . .

......around September 2011, a well-known US based consultancy firm, Mckinsy and Co. had been given a consultancy assignment, said to be worth over Rs. 150 million by the Colombo Stock Exchange, to propose strategies to broaden the retail participation in capital markets and to build a stronger unit trust industry.

This consulting firm has produced an action plan in December 2011 which sets out what they call three key transformational themes. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, the most important theme set out by them is to outsource the current in-house portfolio management of the EPF and ETF to private sector unit trusts.

, 150 consulting firm , . , :

In that background, those who were plotting such a move behind the scenes, may have come to the conclusion that this transformation as they call it, could take place only if sufficient pressure was brought upon the Government and the Monetary Board, through a systematic allegation of mismanagement of EPF funds, coupled with a call for a change in management by influential agencies.

? :

..after the report of Mckinsy & Co. was issued in December 2011, the attacks on EPF have been stepped up, with the effort being spearheaded by the US linked, anti-China, Opposition MP. The suspicion that has now arisen is, as to whether these constant attacks on the EPF are a part of a broader plan set in motion by certain foreign interests to wrest control of the largest Fund that is owned by the people of this country

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) . , . , . - - . It is far from me to insult you, but of course there is room for counter arguments and so on. So, please rest assured that we are not going to insult you.

Now, Sir, I must make one thing absolutely clear. We represent the Government of this country. We have gone before the public of this country and I think on 20 occasions, we have been returned to power and we have formed a Government. On 22 occasions, you have lost elections and in the forthcoming elections, you will bring that number up to 25. So, we are having a discussion between a Government which has the confidence of the people and which has been elected by the people, and by a number of critics. They have every right. They have been defeated in the polls and their policies have been rejected by the people but as a democratic forum in this Parliament, they are perfectly entitled to make criticisms and to point out any defects that they imagine is a part of the Governments policies.

I want to quote Sir Ivor Jennings. He said: The Opposition can have its say, the Government must have its way. That is the Parliamentary procedure. So, we are going to have our way. There is no doubt about that. When it comes to economic matters, I want to assure this House that this Government will have its own way. We have been selected to follow those policies and we cannot follow the policies of the Hon. Members on the opposite side. So, that is the first point I want to make. Then, the second point I want to make is that though you made all these allegations, we have responded to all these questions which are put before this forum on various occasions. Now, I want to refer to a few. For example, on the question of Greece Bonds, I gave a very full answer on the 17th of July 2012. I gave a very comprehensive answer. I believe it was to the satisfaction of the Leader of the Opposition and I saw a columnist of the "Sunday Island" complimenting me and the Government for giving a very honest answer to this issue. Even regarding the EPF and ETF investments, I gave a very comprehensive answer. It was given in response to a statement made by the Leader of the Opposition. If you want to get details, I can give you. Just go down to the Library and look at that because I tabled all those documents. You can get all that information. It may be true that under your Questions, some of those things may not have been answered and we may have asked for time. But, I have given a very comprehensive answer to this House on the question of investments of ETF and EPF. If

you read that and if you have any further questions, we are quite willing to answer. I said on the Floor of this House and I invited the Leader of the Opposition to go through those details provided, and tell us what further information he wants. We have absolutely no intention to hide anything. On the question of not having replied to a particular question by my honourable Friend, there may have been some problem. But, we have given a comprehensive answer to the Leader of the Opposition.

Now, I want to come to the third point. The mode of argument of the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake and unfortunately my good Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva also has been infected by that cherry-picking approach.

You know very well that in any economy, in any political system, in any culture, if you want you can pick up four or five issues. In the real world, everything does not go in the way that it is found in textbooks. You can always find some problems but one must look at the bigger picture. Where are we going? Are we going on a satisfactory trajectory and what do competent agencies say about our trajectory? These are the questions we have to ask. That is why I referred to the revered Mahatma Gandhi. During the struggle for Independence, Mahatma Gandhi said, As colonialists, you can find a lot of problems with the Indian Congress. You can find a lot of problems with the Indian Representatives. But, that is a drainage inspectors report. You can have a good working system of public drainage. An inspector will say, A tap is missing here; water is flowing out there. Some commode is not working properly. All those are true. But, while that is true, one must look at the total system of water management. So, I am going to prove this to you by quoting very competent people. We have to look at the indicators of the totality of this growth pattern. You may disagree with our emphasis. That is your right. But, as the Government, we are following the targets and objectives that we have set for ourselves. So, look at what these people, who are supposed to supervise and regulate, not only the Sri Lankan economy but also the global economy, say. You know the mandate of the IMF is global surveillance because today we are interlinked in the economic sense and they have to look at each economy; see how they are integrated, and how the lack of progress in one economy can impact on the other as we are now experiencing in the global economy. What have they said? Look at what the IMF has said. I am going to read to you what the IMF authorities have stated.

This is a statement made at the conclusion of the IMF Staff Mission to Sri Lanka, which has been issued as a Press Release dated 3rd February, 2012. It states, I quote;

The economy continued to expand rapidly in 2011, with growth likely to come in around 8 percent, and inflation continued to moderate to solid mid-single digit levels. The Government budget deficit also declined further, to under 7 percent of GDP.

701 702

So, this is the analysis by very competent economists. Their function is to effect surveillance not only on the Sri Lankan economy - Sri Lankan economy is too small - but also on the Indian economy. Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, as you know very well they have very critical comments to make on the American economy, the Obama Administration. They have very strong criticisms to make of the European Union. That is their mandated right. Those very people have given this certificate regarding the economic growth to the Government of Sri Lanka.

The Press Release I read to you was issued on 3rd February, 2012. Now, I will read to you the latest Press Release which was issued on 7th September, 2011. It states, I quote:

Macroeconomic conditions remain satisfactory. The economy is expanding rapidly, with growth likely to come in around 7 percent this year. As expected, headline inflation has moderated, reflecting declines in food and commodity prices, and there are as yet no clear signs of economic overheating. So, these are people - () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) When was it issued? () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Wait, I will tell you the date. This is dated 7th September, 2011. - [Interruption.] - No. I am coming to that. I will give you the latest statement. Here it is. This is dated June 15, 2012. This is the comment made by Mr. John Nelmes. This states, I quote:

The authorities are successfully implementing a bold package of policy measures to curb the current account deficit and safeguard reserves, and these measures are yielding fruit. Credit growth has slowed and imports have declined.

Given the new policy framework - in particular the pursuance of exchange rate flexibility - as well as continued strength in remittances and success in attracting capital inflows, international reserves at the central bank have now stabilized.

So, this is what very competent people are talking about our economic policies. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) You are changing colours like a lizard. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No. You can find all sorts of little errors. Now, I am coming to the rest. Wait. You have your say. Let me have my say. - [Interruption.] This is a Press Release of the Central Bank. - [Interruption.] No, be serious. It is an

extract from "Fitch and Moodys upgrade Sri Lankas Sovereign Rating" - [Interruption.] So, here we have the IMF talking about our economic growth; we have - whether you like it or not - the premier institution for monetary policy making the Central Bank with its own research giving its own version. We also have rating agencies. I ask you to look at all the reports of the banks of Sri Lanka, of the private sector companies of Sri Lanka. Each and every one of those show a significant growth. You cannot deny that they are not showing a growth. Some may say that they should strategize even differently. That is a different matter. But, every single company operating in Sri Lanka has been showing - because their Annual Reports are coming out now - a very strong growth. So, as far as the economy is concerned, I must say that I cannot at all subscribe to this cherry-picking, nit-picking approach of the Opposition. - [Interruption.] No, I cannot listen to you. Now, I am going to make a very comprehensive reply; I have no time to listen to you. - [Interruption.] Now, listen to this. I am going to give you all the facts.

The economy is in a sound condition and reserves are invested in a professional manner and a better than average returns have been earned from these investments. I am giving the details, and this will be in Hansard so that you can contradict me later on another date if you find that what I have given you is not correct.

In fact, the economy is in sound condition as can be seen from the fact that Sri Lankas growth is over 8 per cent; inflation is in single digit; debt levels are lower than 80 per cent of GDP; international bond issues are being oversubscribed ten times.There are no banking failures. There was a successful transformation to a more competitive export regime without GSP Plus; poverty is at record low levels and foreign reserves are at record high levels et cetera.

These are facts. - [Interruption.] I am going to give you all the evidence. Please sit down. - [Interruption.] Do not jump the gun. I will give you all the evidence. Let all this evidence be published in Hansard. I have only started. - [Interruption.] No. I will get some time from another Member.

Sri Lankas per capita income up to 2004 - that is after 56 years of Independence - was under US Dollars 1,000. However by 2009, in just after five years, Sri Lankas per capita income has surpassed US Dollars 2,000. Last year it had almost reached US Dollars 3,000. The country now seems to be well on its way to a per capita income of US Dollars 4,000 by 2015. Up to 2007, we really had substandard infrastructure: roads with pot-holes, broken sidewalks, dysfunctional traffic lights, regular water cuts, frequent power interruptions, delays at Government institutions et cetera which were commonplace. But, today many of these shortcomings are distant memories only. New ports are being constructed; new highways are being added; thousands of

703 704

2012 08

kilometres of concrete roads are dotting the rural landscape. Almost all the people enjoy electricity 24 hours a day when only 72 per cent had electricity in this country just about six years ago. New power plants are being added to the national grid on a regular basis. New airports are being constructed. Many cities are being beautified. Hospitals and education services are being improved. New opportunities are being created for the youth which has resulted in unemployment reaching historically low levels. All in all, an unbelievable economic and infrastructure transformation is taking place in this country.

The Central Bank is charged with managing the foreign reserves in order to safeguard and enhance the value of such reserves and to generate a reasonable income from its investments. Sir, the document I will table in the course of my speech contains a graph, which gives the track record of the Central Bank for the last 25 years. In 1987, the total income from reserves was under US Dollars 10 million. In the year 2011, our total income from reserves, which was historically high, was over, maybe, US Dollars 425 million. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Minister, what is the net income? () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I will come to that. All that is being covered. Please listen to me.

It would be clear that the returns generated by reserve management activities in the past two years had been well above the previous years and that it had yielded US Dollars 430 million in 2011and US Dollars 341 million in the year 2010. In fact, these are the only two years in the history of the Central Bank that returns have exceeded US Dollars 200 million. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) But, what is the net income? () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Further, 2011 is also the first time in 20 years that the return exceeded 6 per cent over the US Fed Fund average. This yield in 2011 has been after making provisions for losses, which clearly shows that the portfolio management has been highly successful in enhancing the value of the total portfolio while providing for any losses that had been incurred in a highly challenging and volatile global situation. You know that very well and I will give you the details later. The principle I want to enunciate is that when you have portfolio investment - I do not think anywhere in the world has every one of those investments clicked simultaneously - we have to look at the total

investments. - [Interruption.] I am not conducting an economics seminar here. Listen to what I have to say. You have to look at the total investments and how much of it will come back to you. - [Interruption.] Some click, some do not click. But, look at the total return that you get. I mean, that is a very simple, very elementary aspect of investing in the Stock Exchange or any other bond.

It is very, very wrong I must say and I protest that the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake goes on saying that the Central Bank has been consistently providing inaccurate information, suppressing the real prevailing situation of the economy. How can he make a statement like that? On what basis? He gets one or two little points from somewhere and accuses the premier surveillance economic agency of the country of providing inaccurate information. Let him show where it is. We have the Central Bank Report. There are hundreds of economists in the Central Bank and this idea that one single person in the Central Bank is doing all this smacks of some personal vendetta. He maybe having some personal problems. Who knows?

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I do not think it is fair to say that. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Why? - [Interruption.] I am talking of a conflict of interest. - [Interruption.] No, no. - [Interruption.] No, I do not accept, Hon. Deputy Speaker. - [Interruption.] You have to get up and talk like this but the fact of the matter is, there is a very clear - [Interruption.] I am not giving way, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is the point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, he is referring to the personal conduct of a Member of Parliament. He should not do that. I know he is a very honourable Minister. I do not know why he has resorted to that.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I am saying that I am not refuting what I said.

705 706

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Normally, you are not a person who does that.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) If there is any statement contrary to the Standing Orders, that will be expunged.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Please expunge that. That is good enough.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I do not mind it being removed. But, I only want to refer to a conflict of interest.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) That is not fair.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Why not?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, you continue with your speech. I have already given a Ruling. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I am only talking of a conflict of interest and the matter, I must say, is not settled; a final judgment has not been made. So, I am willing to accept that. - [Interruption.] Now, we come to the question of - [Interruption.} All right.

Now, let me come to the question of whether this is a constant refrain of the Opposition, which I want to prove is not valid. That is, they are constantly saying, both inside this House and outside, that the poor worker who is subscribing to the EPF and the ETF has somehow been played out and that he has lost money as a consequence.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Of course!

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) So, I am going to respond to that. This has been your constant refrain.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) That is true.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, that is not true.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Of course, it is true. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is what you think is true. - [Interruption.] No, that is what you think. Let me answer the question. - [Interruption.] I am going to give the Rates of Return offered by EPF to the members in recent years, compared to other alternative investment opportunities available in the country, which graph is contained in the document that I will table during the course of my speech . It clearly shows that the total portfolio investments have brought them enough - I will come to the stock market later - to have a return which is much higher than they ever had under the normal dealings with the Treasury.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. He is misleading the House.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, no. How can he say that? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) We have a return requirement of 4 per cent.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you continue with your speech.

707 708

2012 08

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Sir, how can he interrupt me when I have not finished my submissions? He is just getting up there like a jack-in-the-box. This jack-in-the-box approach cannot be allowed in Parliament. - [Interruption.] No, I am not giving way. Hon. Deputy Speaker, we must stop this jack-in-the-box policy, once and for all. - [Interruption.] You have been given a chance to speak. Now, keep quiet and let me speak. After that, all this will go in to Hansard. - [Interruption.] Hon. Acting Leader of the Opposition", can you not stop this nonsense? This is all good for - ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I think you are misleading the House.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, no. Before I have finished my speech, how can the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva make these statements? Earlier, your Leader mentioned that till the whole Debate is over on the Adjournment Motion, anybody can intervene. Did he not say that as far as the Adjournment Motion is concerned, till the final reply is made, anybody can make an intervention? So, I have not finished my intervention. Therefore, how can you jump the gun and say that this is not correct because you have not heard what I have to say? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Okay, I apologize.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Thank you. You act like a gentleman. We are good Friends. But, there must be some decorum in this House.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) If you do not give the answer -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) But, you have so many other opportunities. I hope this is not your last appearance in this House. So, do not worry. - [Interruption.] At the rate your party is going to courts, kicking out people, bringing various resolutions, I would not be at all surprised if you are removed from your position and you are not here tomorrow. That is an aside - [Interruption.] Hon. "Acting Leader", you know, in Parliament, these little asides are okay. I do not hate him or anything. - [Interruption.]

Now, let me get back to the subject. First, get this picture right, please. To the major share - 92 per cent - of EPF money, there has been no change whatsoever over the years.

From the day the EPF was formed, as far as their investments are with the Treasury, 92 per cent has not been changed at all. You are not talking about that. You are talking as though the workers full savings have been taken and given to the private sector. That is not the case. Sir, 92 per cent continues as it did when the whole scheme started. Then, only 7 per cent of it is being invested in equities. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Seven per cent is a trivial amount. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I am giving the percentages. Seven per cent is invested in equities and 1 per cent in debt instruments of corporates. The EPF has also clarified its rationale in several press releases. Now, this is the important thing. The EPF has made several investments in various listed corporates through the Colombo Stock Exchange and also in selected unlisted corporates on the basis of the intrinsic value of the company, its growth prospects, the possible enhancements of share value in the medium to long-term, its governing structures, the viability and prospects of the industry, the quantity of shares available, its future plans, impact of the growing economy on the company et cetera. Such shares in various corporates have been gradually accumulated over the past several months in a methodical and professional manner. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Janaka Bandara to take the Chair? ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Gamini Lokuge - Minister of Labour and Labour Relations) I propose that the Hon. Janaka Bandara do now take the Chair. , . . Question put, and agreed to. , .

, , . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. JANAKA BANDARA took the Chair

709 710

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Mr. Presiding Member, I want to make one thing absolutely clear. Now, the impression is being created that one single individual, the Governor of the Central Bank, is taking all these decisions. He is deciding - you allege - to put this into - [Interruption.] No, that is rubbish. You must not talk like that in this House. The Central Bank is a national institution. It has hundreds of economists. There is an Investment Committee. The Investment Committee comprises of people who have been trained here and abroad on investment. They sit together and decide the companies that should be invested in. It is not a private decision made by the Governor or any other single person. There is a whole procedure. There is a research unit; they prepare research papers. They look deep into the companies concerned. They look at what that company can do for the economy of this country, a whole variety of factors are studied. Then, they make recommendations not to the Governor. Recommendations are made to a Deputy Governor who studies this. Then, finally, a paper goes to the Governor who is also mandated to discuss these matters and take orders from the Monetary Board. So, it is a complex procedure. - [Interruption.] Why not? You have mentioned largely about the EPF. It is my decision on which I should talk. How can you tell me honourable Friend what I should talk in this House? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) The Standing Orders state that. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, no. You are just an amateur in this game. You have just come into this House and you think that this is a 5th Standard debating society in Royal College. This is the Parliament of Sri Lanka. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Unless we understand the Standing Orders - () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You can only refer to the Standing Orders; the decision will be given by the Chairman. You are not the Chairman.

Now, we are coming to the next question. You have bulls and bears in the Stock Exchange. We are going through a bearish phase. Not only here, India is also having a problem. Dalal Street in India is having a problem. The US Stock Market is having a problem;

Singapore is also having a problem. Because of the shake up in the global economy, values have dropped substantially.

So, as a result - [Interruption.] Do not talk absolute rot in this House. There must be - [Interruption.] Why not? It has gone down. In Dalal Street, India, there was a huge crisis. Shall I tell you where it has gone down even more?

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Hon. Minister, why are you comparing with the countries that have gone down more? You are comparing with the ones where there has been a drop. We are talking about - () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Please tell me, is that an argument? Please tell me. What are you saying? Some people come to this House. They have every right to represent but surely the Hon. Leader of the Opposition has a right to send people who have a modicum of intelligence to this House. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) That is why you have not got - () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) We can have a serious debate but not this sort of gutter politics. You are trying to convert everything into gutter politics. You maybe in need of a lot of publicity but it should not be at the expense of Parliament. - [Interruption.] Is that an argument? Just give me a minute. I only said that there are some practitioners of gutter politics in this House and the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe jumps up. I did not refer to him. I never referred to you. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) The UNP has been - () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The UNP has already put you in the disposable list. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) We are not traitors. We did not cross over. We did not do that.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) So, you will end up your days in the Opposition, I am glad. - [Interruption.] That is your choice. Your Leader has already decided that you are not honourable. - [Interruption.] No, no. This is what is called, There is sound but no light. In science, you have to have sound and light. But unfortunately, there are some young MPs who have only sound but no light. They cannot shed light on anything. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) What happened to the NSB? () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Now, we come to this. Because of the bearish trend in the stock market - for the moment, it is a notional figure. Nobody is going to dispose of these shares. If you look at the days stock market operations, you know how much that is going to cost but you are not going to sell it. - [Interruption.]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Minisiter, can I ask you a question?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes, certainly. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, you have to mark into market. If the price drops, Hon. Minister, what you mark into market, the value of your portfolio drops. So, the benefits accrued to the members are based on the value of the portfolio at that time. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) As of today. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Yes, precisely. If the value has fallen, it is no longer notional.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Let me take that argument. I do not want to have these cross talks. Let me give my version. That is, in any stock there is the price at which you bought it. Then, you have the movement of that stock. Then on any given day, assuming that you want to dispose of your share, there is a price that you can get, that price maybe high or low. That is a different matter. But here, it is a different case because there is no compulsion to sell that share at that time. On the contrary, Hon. Member, why the Government intervened was to ensure that there would be some stability, a life for these companies. It is a responsible act. If you took this when there was a bullrun, the Government would have said, We made Rs. 19 million" because it was at that point of time. As far as these investments are concerned, these are long-term investments. We will hold on to these till such time. After all, if the country is going at 8 per cent growth, the time must come when the stocks must go up.

I do not want to have a discussion on how to operate the stock market. That is a different story.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Minister, may I respond? () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes, please. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Minister, you cannot assume that a person will not become 55 or 60 years of age at which he has to retire. You cannot assume that. Once he reaches that age, he has to retire. So, his package is based on the value of the portfolio at that time. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, that is not how it is. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Of course, it is. So, if the value of the portfolio has come down - () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I know what you are trying to say. I will give you the answer. The total remunerative - [Interruption.] I appreciate that. I am trying to give you an answer to that.

713 714

Now, let us say that I am a worker on the verge of retiring in another week's time and some computation is going to take place. That is your argument. Is it not? Really, 93 per cent of his remuneration is already ensured because that does not come into the stock market operation. Do you concede that? () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I concede that. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Then, we are talking only about 7 per cent. Now, look at the actual reality of the payments. When it was being paid through the Treasury or whatever arrangement with the Government, there was a certain figure. I tabled those figures in the House. Actually, if a person retires today, he is getting more than what he could have got in the past because of the rate of interest. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Minister, but the fact of the matter is this. The Act brought in by the Hon. Ilangaratne in this House specified a 2.5 per cent return. Now, the issue is whether that was a real return or a nominal return. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That was - () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Let me finish, please. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I can spot the flaw. Do not bother to explain because I know what is wrong in that.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Subsequently, that return was set at 4 per cent after inflation. My point is, for the last eight years you have not been able to pay 4 per cent after inflation. As a matter of fact, all what you have been able to pay is 1.15 per cent after inflation. Out of the eight years, for five years you paid negative returns to all members of the EPF.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, let me give the answer. Please do not interrupt me, I will answer you. The first thing is that the rate of return he gets is not related to these operations of the EPF in the stock market. It is related only marginally. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) No, no. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Why not? That is determined on the total package. I am addressing the issue of how it is connected with the stock market that people are talking of. So, you will have to concede that the stock market is only fractionally responsible for that "take- home pay" because it is only 7 per cent. The bulk of it is 93 per cent. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Minister, please give me one minute. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Okay, for the last time. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) The stock market grew by 125 per cent when the returns for the EPF investment in the stock market grew only by 3.8 per cent. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is right. But, what I am saying is that it is not a stock market issue whatsoever. It is only marginally a stock market issue. The amount that is given as interest is a matter for the Government to determine. Do you accept that? - [Interruption] This is not a seminar. We will stop there. We will discuss privately.

The second matter that I want to state is that with every single person we cannot be adjusting for inflation. Naturally it has to be a certain platform. We have to take certain things for granted. For every single EPF member, we cannot be calculating the interest rate and inflation rate at the time he is retiring . We have to work on certain common variables. - [Interruption.] Do not disturb me. That is what I said.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) That is what is in the Act.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) In fact I want to tell you, the contrary is true. Why did the authorities decide to go into the stock market? Because, we wanted to increase the final - Let us call it the "take-home package" or let us call it the "take-home allowance". So, Hon. Presiding Member, the very reason why we want to diversify the portfolio; the very reason why we want to go and invest in the stock market is that these people are going to get something more. It so happens that in the bearish situation an abnormality has arisen. But, our intention is that these people would get something more in the future when we do that. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) But, Hon. Minister, - () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I cannot be arguing like this. - [Interruption.] Hon. Member, this is not a seminar. I have been more than lenient with you, my Friend. Now, let me continue with this because I cannot take the time of my colleagues. The bedrock thinking is, if they are to be given a bigger departure envelope - let us call that "an envelope" which is given to them at the point of departure - we have to find innovative ways of increasing that pot. Of course, otherwise, the Government can arbitrarily give them something. But, it is much better if that money is used to spur the economy in order to give them a better return. Otherwise, if your logic is correct, nobody would want to come into the stock market because people come with various ideas. There are long-term investors. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) We are not criticizing all investors. We are only criticizing -

So, we have invested in companies with a local base. What is wrong with that? What is wrong with investing in Sri Lankan blue-chip companies?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) In blue-chip companies? () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, in other companies also. Those may not be blue-chip companies. But, one day, they will be blue-chip companies. - [Interruption.] I do not agree with you at all. When an investor comes into the stock market, he has two options. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) It is not your money. If it is your money I do not care, but it is the workers money. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) It is workers money. But, the workers and the people of this country have been entrusted to our Government, not to you. So, we will decide what we want because this Government was appointed by the workers. They have rejected you. They do not want your advice. Has any EPF member gone to courts? Tell me. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) That is why you are robbing. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No. This is absolute nonsense that you are talking. I challenge you to give me a name and the action taken by a single EPF member who is against this investment. Sir, these people who have no hope of coming to power and who have absolutely a dismal future are flogging this, but people who are going to get money from EPF and ETF are silent. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) If we are silent, they will never get their money back. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, that is all nonsense. So, if you are right, there must be thousands and thousands of EPF members who would want to go to courts and get this. - [Interruption.] No, I do not want to - [Interruption.] Sir, I do not want to cross swords with these paperweight and mosquito-weight people. If you are boxing, you must box with heavyweights. - [Interruption.] I want to ask one question.

Sir, when the teachers are affected, they go to courts; when students are affected, they go to courts; when doctors are affected, they go to courts.

Give me the name of one single EPF or ETF holder who has gone to courts and asked for remedy. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) All I want to ask is one question.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, I do not want to - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) , .

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) This is a ridiculous situation because those EPF and ETF holders know that the final reward they get will be enhanced. That is why they are not going to courts. If they go to courts, the courts will point out why this decision was made. So, please let us keep it at a level of logic. So, as far as the EPF and ETF are concerned, we have said earlier that these are long-term investments. We are one hundred per cent sure that as we go along, the value will increase and when the value increases, the amount of money that will be given to the individual worker will be higher. And, in any case, finally, it is up to the Government and we can even give ex gratia payments if you want. So, do not worry. Not a single worker has approached you. We do not recognize you as you are the party that has harassed workers; murdered workers. - [Interruption.]

It is in fairness to the Opposition also because they will know our arguments. Then, we can have a Debate.

But, one thing I want to finally emphasize is that this imputation of male fide; that the Government is somehow doing something wrong and not pursuing the real interests of the people is absolute nonsense because here we have a group of people who have a track record of being repeatedly rejected by the people. If what you are saying is good and makes sense, will they vote against you? Now, what is happening in the Provincial Council Elections now? See what is going to happen and what a terrible hiding you will get. - [Interruption.]

Even Hitler was not entrenched like that. Hitler burned the Reichstag; your leader has burnt the Sirikotha. You first attacked Sirikotha and get six years. Hitler burned the Reichstag and got only four years, I think. So, my good Friend, Hon. D.M. Swaminathan, how can you justify this by any standards of law or decent conduct? A person gets a packed college, his own stooges in a little college, and they give him six years. Even Hitler never did this; even Pol Pot never did this.

Sir, my Electorate and I have been making media headlines in the past few weeks and I would like to make use of this opportunity to set out the real facts with regard to the events that took place in Mannar.

I am a Member of Parliament elected by the people of Mannar. My Electorate is made up of Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims. It has been my honour to represent them and to represent their heartburn and anguish.

I make this statement with responsibility and with a sense of duty. I say this because the people of this country must know and they have the right to know the true facts, about the real victims and the real culprits of what happened and what is happening in Mannar. That alone can ensure that the rule of law prevails and that justice is done in this country.

That is being described as a clash between the Muslims and the Tamil Catholics, but that is only what we see on the surface. Underneath the surface, there is a bigger battle, a bigger struggle between two forces, to which I will refer later on.

Before I was appointed the Minister of Industry and Commerce by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, I held the portfolio of Resettlement and Disaster Relief Services. The Tamils of the Northern Province would recall how I, as the Minister of Resettlement and Disaster Relief Services, spearheaded the Governments programme to resettle the displaced Tamil people in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces with great vigour and enthusiasm under the guidance of the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa, the Minister of Economic Development.

However, I had to carry out the task of resettlement under a highly risky condition. I should also mention that on my request as a Member of Parliament and the Chairman of the District Coordinating Committee of the Mannar District, the Ministry of Economic Development, under the guidance of His Excellency the President and the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa, reconstructed the Madhu Church damaged during the terror campaign by the LTTE to the pleasure of the clergy. On a similar

741 742

request made by me, the Thiruketheeswaram Hindu Kovil reconstruction had to be carried out to the chagrin of a section of the very clergy. I am mentioning this to show that I have always acted far above ethnic or communal considerations. Nearly 500,000 Tamils were resettled in the North and the East when I was the Minister of Resettlement and Disaster Relief Services, even while the displaced Muslims from the North remained in refugee camps.

Sir, in 1990, long before the words ethnic cleansing were used or known in Sarejevo, in our own little Island, the LTTE cleansed the North of the Muslims. Thus, the Muslims of Mannar, including the fishermen of Uppukulam, were forced to leave their homes. Mannar is not a recent Muslim settlement. It is one of the earliest Muslim settlements in Sri Lanka. The fisherfolk in Mannar are successors to these early settlers. However, to the LTTEs genocidal and narrow view, all that meant nothing; the traditional homelands and the birthplace of others did not matter. What mattered to them was the ethnically cleansed Tamil Eelam. It was an LTTE dream. But, it was our nightmare and more so, for a majority of the Tamil people. For 22 years, these Muslims have lived as refugees since they were evicted from their lands. There are those who are obstructing their return and resettlement. They are giving effect to the LTTE decree that Mannar should be without Muslims. I do not think that any Member of this honourable House will accept that. I certainly will not.

So, this is not about Tamils, Catholics or Muslims, about those who want to live in peace in a united Sri Lanka and those who want to divide it. Therefore, every peace-loving citizen, whether Sinhalese, Tamil or Muslim, Buddhist, Catholic, Christian or Hindu, who believes in a united Sri Lanka must and will support the cause of the Muslim fishermen of Uppukulam who want nothing, but to earn their living through honest means and to live in peace.

But, for 22 years, the Muslim fishermen of Uppukulam in the Mannar District have been deprived of their lands and fishing rights. Twenty two years is too long. It is not something that can sit quietly in our conscience. It troubles me and it will trouble all of you that for 22 years, people lived as Internally Displaced People and even after the return of peace, they still remain as IDPs.

Sir, in 2002, a small group of Muslims returned to Mannar, to their fishing hamlet in Uppukulam in Konthaipiddy hoping to regain their livelihood in their birthplace. However, any hope of resettlement was dashed when the LTTE intervened through its local warlord, Amudan, a sea tiger, and forcefully settled a group of Tamil Catholic fishermen from Vidataltivu in

Uppukulam. It was a continuation of the LTTE strategy to keep Mannar for the LTTE and its henchmen. However, when this forceful settlement occurred, the Muslims managed to obtain a written undertaking that the fishermen of Vidataltivu would return to their lands once normalcy returned. So, even when they came to settle in Konthampiti, both sides understood it to be a temporary arrangement. However, three years have gone since the end of the war in May, 2009. It is three years since the country returned to normalcy and yet the fishermen of Uppukulam have not been given back their lands that the LTTE took away forcefully. For three years, since May, 2009, the Vidataltivu fishermen, on the orders of the LTTE remnants, have been preventing the Muslims from regaining their traditional fishing Vadiya and the pier. The Muslim fishermen of Uppukulam were promised in writing by the Vidataltivu fishermen in 2002, that on any occasion they would leave Uppukulam. But, the Vidataltivu fishermen would not leave Uppukulam. The decree of the LTTE remnants continues to have force in Mannar as that of the LTTE. Who is controlling them and giving them orders? These are the questions for which we need answers.

So, what did the fisherfolk of Uppukulam do? Did they resort to force and violence? Despite all the sufferings, the Muslims of Mannar, like Muslims all over Sri Lanka and all peace-loving communities living in this Island, have tried to resolve their differences through non-violent means. The Uppukulam fishermen made representations to all authorities concerned to resettle the Vidataltivu fishsrmen in their native place in Vidataltivu or to find them an alternative location. They had made representations to me and also to other Hon. Members of the Vanni District. After three years they saw no success. How long more should the Muslim fishermen of Uppukulam wait to retrieve their own land? How long more should they wait to restart their shattered lives?

Sir, it was in this backdrop,that meetings were held by the authorities in Mannar on 7th June, 11th June, and on 26th June, 2012. The Vidataltivu fishermen were offered alternate locations and were requested to shift and even after promising to do so, they did not shift. What is noteworthy is that almost half of the original group of Vidataltivu fishermen have returned to their original places in Vidataltivu. So, why is the balance group remaining? Is it because they want to cause problems or is it that someone else is using them for causing problems? Just as much as the fishermen of Uppukulam are victims, so are the fishermen of Vidataltivu. They are being used, to this day, as pawns in a game waged by powerful forces pushing the LTTE agenda.

It was in this background that on 13th July, 2012, two Muslim fishermen had reportedly informed the Vidataltivu fishermen not to go out for fishing that day as some Muslim fishermen wanted to come to the Vadiya to

743 744

[ ]

2012 08

talk to them. This request, I learnt subsequently, had been ignored by the Vidataltivu fishermen, which had allegedly provoked about a dozen of Muslim fishermen to take back possession of the Vadiya, in the course of which some cadjan huts in the Vadiya had been damaged.

Although the Police complaint states that there is a claim that around Rs.1.4 million worth of fishing equipment was damaged, according to the Government Agent, the Divisional Secretary, the District Fisheries Director and the Police, no damage had been caused to any of the fishing equipment, gear or boats lying at the shore. However, this isolated incident was used to exaggerate incidents internationally.

Furthermore, statements of 17 Vidataltivu fishermen had been recorded naming a number of Muslims of the area, who had nothing to do with the incident, as having participated in it and thereby angering the entire Muslim community in Mannar.

Furthermore, the Muslims in Mannar believe that the damage caused to the Vadiya was partly by a Vidataltivu group led by one person called Ronald Reagan. I am told that this man Ronald Regan, who is also a fisherman, is at the bottom of the problem, prevailing on other Vidataltivu fishermen not to move out. Who is advising him? Who is directing them not to move out? These are the questions that need answers and the Muslims of Mannar are demanding a Commission of Inquiry from His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa to find answers to these questions. Muslims have reasons to believe that some Tamil religious leaders of the North with close connections to the war-time LTTE are inciting the Vidataltivu fishermen not to move out. It was this incident that came up before the Magistrate of Mannar on July 16, 2012. Whilst a lot can be said about the administration of justice in Mannar, in due deference to the Courts and - () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , ? () ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) Sir, there is a court case pending on this issue. ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) My good Friend, Hon. Jayalath Jayawardana, I am not referring to the court case.

() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) , . . [ ] ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Whilst a lot can be said about the administration of justice in Mannar in due deference to the Courts I refrain from making any comment with regard to the conduct of the Magistrate of Mannar [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

in respect of whom, long before these protests, the people of Mannar, and particularly the Muslims have made several allegations of bias, partisanship and irregular conduct. This matter will be set out in due course and in the proper forum. However, let me also say that the unfortunate incidents in Mannar could have been avoided if the relevant authorities had paid due consideration to complaints of the people of Mannar.

Let there not be the slightest doubt that I have the utmost respect for the Judiciary. The judges of our country are well-known and respected for their integrity, dedication and ability. I have no intention of tarnishing that name or reputation. It is for that reason that I regret that things have come to such a point that people were protesting against the court order. Why did they do that? What caused them to behave in that way? These are matters that need to be looked at before anyone passes judgment. For a long time they have been unhappy with the administration of justice in Mannar. Our judges are men and women of high integrity and rectitude. Unfortunately, in Mannar people have lost faith in the system. We must not let black sheep

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] damage the whole system. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

745 746

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised. What is your point of Order, Hon. Member?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) This Minister is commenting on the actions of a judge. He cannot do that without a special Motion. So, you should overrule it and it should be expunged from Hansard. He cannot comment on the actions of a judge in this House. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) So, if the people are of the view that a judge is biased or partisan, what should they do? They can appeal. There is no doubt in that. But, Sir, can every person appeal in every case? Certainly the poor fishermen in Mannar do not have the money or the time to fight long appeals against the orders made by biased judges.

[ .] [ ] Expunged on the order of the Chair.] A permanent solution is needed. This is why they wrote to the Secretary of the Judicial Service Commission. The JSC is the body vested with powers of disciplinary control over the minor judiciary under our Constitution. Dissatisfied sections of the public, I believe, have a right as well as a duty to make representations to the JSC through its Secretary, which they had done in the broader interests of justice. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, you know very well that the conduct of a judge cannot be commented in the House.

The conduct of a judge can be commented only through a special Motion.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Yes, that is right. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) He is continuing to do that. It must be stopped.

( ) (The Presiding Member) , . . Hon. Minister, you have another two minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Give me five minutes. I am tabling* copies of the letters sent by the Mosque authorities to the Secretary of the JSC.

There are six letters sent by the mosque authorities from those areas.

Mr. Presiding Member, I regret to note that to date, the Mosque authorities have not received from the Secretary even an acknowledgement to these letters. Of course, it is the Secretary who should have acknowledged these letters and placed them before the JSC headed by Her Ladyship the Chief Justice of our country.

As to what decisions are taken on these representations are matters entirely for the Hon. Members of the JSC, if the Secretary of the JSC had placed them before the Commission. But, some response to those who made the representations in the broader interest of justice and fair play may have helped calm the agitated sections of the public. Justice, we have been told must not only be done but also must appear to be done.

The Chief Justice who is the Chairperson of the JSC is known for maintaining high standards and she, as the first lady Chief Justice, took office at a difficult time when people were losing faith in the judicial system. She has done much to rebuild the confidence. Therefore, I feel that if these complaints which were addressed to the Secretary of the Commission were brought to the attention of the Chief Justice and the other judges who are Members of the Commission, they would have taken prompt action. Despite all this, I remain confident of the judiciary in Sri Lanka.

Mr. Presiding Member, the Magistrates Order of 16th July, 2012 was that the Vidataltivu fishermen should continue fishing under police protection. I came to know of this on 18th -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, do not speak about the judgment and the orders given by the learned Magistrate. -[Interruption.] Please -

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) No, no. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Yes, what is your point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is speaking on behalf of the poor Muslim fishermen and he says that letters have been written. Letters can be written. He is not referring to a judgment.

( ) (The Presiding Member) No, no. He cannot speak about court orders.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Presiding Member, you yourself had been a judge and you know it well. He is not referring to the conduct of a judge. They have written to the JSC. That could be stated in this House. . ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, your time is over. Please conclude your speech now. ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Okay. Muslims of Uppukulam- ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Okay, what is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) According to Standing Orders, please give an order to expunge that. ( ) (The Presiding Member) I have already given the order. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) That is all. ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) . . . . [ ] , . . . . [ ] . ? ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . .

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Muslims of Mannar, I was told, saw this order as a total reversal of their aspiration for resettlement.

Muslims of Uppukulam who were at the threshold of receiving their fishing lands back from the Vidataltivu fishermen in a matter of days, suddenly found themselves confronted by this order. This order allowed the Vidataltivu fishermen to continue fishing at Uppukulam under police protection in total conflict with the arrangements made by State officials to resolve this outstanding problem. Once again the hopes of the Muslim fishermen of starting their livelihood were shattered.

It is under these circumstances that the Muslims of Mannar had come out onto the streets to peacefully demonstrate against what they perceived as partiality of the Magistrate. If you are unhappy, you must appeal. Staging a protest is not the proper course of action. Judges could make wrong orders. That is why we have higher courts to appeal.

749 750

( ) (The Presiding Member) No, Hon. Minister, you cannot - ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) . Judges could make wrong orders. That is why we have higher courts to appeal. ( ) (The Presiding Member) No, no. , .

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) , .

( ) (The Presiding Member) ?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , .

Anyone who is dissatisfied with an order of court must resort to appeals to higher courts and not demonstrate outside courthouses. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) , . .

But, what should happen when the judge is seen as "partial" or his conduct is seen as "biased"?

Sir, these are illiterate fishermen desperate to return to their lands. Today, lawyers are shouting, protesting and breaking furniture in courts. So, why is everyone so quick to condemn the conduct of the Uppukulam fishermen?

In Mannar, it was a group of illiterate and frustrated fishermen. In Colombo, in the High Court of Colombo, in one of the foremost court buildings in our country, learned lawyers together with others broke furniture, shouted, abused and showed their anger in open court. Many saw the incidents as a pre-planned protest against the judgment of the High Court. When illiterate fishermen protest against a Magistrate, that is condemned but when lawyers shout at and abuse High Court judges, everyone including the legal fraternity and sections of the media are silent. One judge in that case was no less than a most senior High Court judge, a lady and a well-respected member of the judiciary. So, why was the Bar Association silent then? These are questions that the Bar Association must answer before taking sides on an issue that arose from total indifference to the heartburns of the much maligned Muslim fisherfolk.

Sir, I am placing these matters not with a view to vilifying or damaging the reputation of anyone. I am placing them as the perceptions of the Muslims of Mannar, whether right or wrong, in order to explain as I understood it subsequently, and as to why these events took place. It was in these circumstances, frustrated by the failures to secure their fishing rights, that the distressed Muslims of Mannar had decided to hold a demonstration in the Mannar town about 200 metres away from the courts on the 18th July.

The demonstrators included a large number of women and children as well, a clear indication that the demonstrators intended to exercise their right peacefully and that were not a mob that had gathered to attack the courthouse.

I came to know of the demonstration when I came out of the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo on 18th July afternoon, after spending the entire morning in the secretariat attending to the Provincial Council Election nomination matters. Immediately, I decided to rush to Mannar by chopper.

Before proceeding, I got down the file containing the representations of the Mosques to the JSC from the office of my Ministry and decided to personally hand over the set of copies of the Mosque representations to the Secretary. Having handed over the request of the Mosque authorities to the Secretary, I immediately spent time in arranging for the chopper in which I proceeded to Mannar.

I learnt of most of the matters that I referred to earlier after my arrival in Mannar and meeting with officials and the people. I urged all of them to be patient, calm and not to commit any breach of law until the authorities resolve the problems.

What happened at the protest and what caused people to get angry is widely recorded. There are videos on the

751 752

2012 08

internet showing what happened at the protest and what made people get angry. It is not necessary for me to detail all that in this speech.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, you cannot do that. , . . ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) However, I wish to urge for the due consideration of all those -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Yes, what is your point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, you were a judge. So, you are aware that whatever is said in the Bench, the orders that he makes and the judgments he gives cannot be argued here or cannot be criticized. But - ( ) (The Presiding Member) Not only the judgments, but also the conduct of a Magistrate cannot be criticized. He is talking about the conduct of a Magistrate. That cannot be allowed. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) But, there was a person called Judeson who was coming out and ordering the police. Has he got the power to do that? He has no power to do that? - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Presiding Member) No, no, you cannot discuss the conduct of a learned Magistrate in Parliament. That is very clear. I have already given my order. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, it is not the conduct. If he does something wrong at home -

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) . ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . . ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) However, I wish to urge for the due consideration of all those duty-bound to consider that 400 odd fishermen; men, women and children cannot be considered as a mob that gathered to attack anyone or the courthouse. This is because throughout they have been part of an orderly demonstration without any intention to attack the courthouse. They only ran amok when orders were given to the police to shoot at the demonstrators and disperse them. - [Interruption.] , . .

( ) (The Presiding Member) .

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) It was only then that some persons had thrown stones at the police, some of which might have fallen on the court premises. There is also a different story of a conspiracy doing its round with regard to the damage to the courthouse. Truth will not lie underground forever. It will certainly surface sooner or later. At the same time, it is on record that not one of the demonstrators had at any time attempted to enter the court premises. So, how can this be called a mob attack?

In conclusion, I wish to place on record that I condemn the stone-throwing at the police and the court premises and no one must be permitted to take the law into ones own hand, though lately it is happening far too often in the country, which includes lawyers and others who have broken court furniture.

I wish to state that apart from the recent incidents, there is in the Northern Province an organized move by LTTE remnants to prevent the resettlement of Muslims in their homes in the North. The wish of those resisting the

return of the Muslims is to keep the Northern Province free of Muslims and Sinhalese in order to, once again, lay the foundation for Tamil Eelam. Eliminating me from the political scene in Mannar is only a small part of this agenda of the LTTE remnants but a major step in the LTTE reconsolidating itself in the Northern Province is already evident.

Our struggle in Mannar is not a struggle between two fishermen or fishing groups but a struggle to stop the rebirth of the LTTE. It is a struggle to overturn the fascist decree of the LTTE. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) , . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Sir, give me one more minute. ( ) (The Presiding Member) , . , . [ ] ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Unfortunately some people in high places in Mannar with connections to the LTTE are trying to create a clash, complicate the problem and through that destabilize Mannar and the country. These are the same forces who were behind the efforts against Sri Lanka in Geneva.

Let me assure the people of Sri Lanka that I have never called a judge and interfered with his or her work. I have always been, and will be committed towards upholding the rule of law and justice in this country. But, let me remind that there can be justice only when truth prevails.

Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) . - - .

( ) (The Presiding Member) .

[5.44 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Mr. Presiding Member, it is sad that in the Debate today, the Minister, Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, had to make a defence in the House which he should have made in court. I also hope that the court takes notice of the defence that he has made in the House.

I also wanted to comment on some of the comments made earlier by the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, who is not in the House now, but I hope he will get an opportunity to look at what I am saying. He said that the young MPs have sound but no light. But, in defence of young MPs on both sides of the House - who, I think have sound and a lot of light in this generation; a lot of them are educated - I would like to say that the Hon. Ministers comments were not appropriate. Let us have a Debate where we are not depending on the years that we have spent in Parliament, our age or the grayness of our hair, but our knowledge and expertise.

In the Debate today, unfortunately, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama mentioned Ivor Jennings out of context. Ivor Jennings was quoted as saying that the Opposition will have its say but the Government will have its way. He took out of context because more than once he repeated himself by saying that the Opposition can say whatever it wants but even a single word that they say, we will do what we want. That was certainly not in the spirit of democracy because he repeated himself and I will say that that was actually showing a contempt of democracy. Democracy is where a government is enriched by the criticism of the Opposition and amends its programme as it goes along. I was shocked that such a Senior Minister in this House would continuously make such a statement.

The Hon. Amunugama was talking about the attack of the Opposition on the Central Bank and its Governor. I think the question that is pertinent was to ask about the independence of the Central Bank. The independence of the Central Bank is the question at heart. We have quite a few things actually that are being debated. We have the value of the rupee and the devaluation of the rupee. We have the hedging contracts that we have been discussing and debating. We have other matters that we have been discussing and if there was a common factor, it was the Governor of the Central Bank and the Central Bank. The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama said that we need to look at the whole economy as a whole and I agree with him. But, I also wanted to point out that when the rule of law diminishes, it diminishes us all. In the Asian crisis in 1997, the Thai Baht was defended at a cost of the half of the countrys reserves in Thailand by the Governor, Mr. Rerngchai Marakanond. He basically wasted US Dollars 30 billion before the Baht depreciated from 25 to 48 to the Dollar. The senior officers of the Thai Central Bank had endorsed the Governors decision without providing sound counsel and that is what the inquiries subsequently showed. Why did they do this? They did this, according to the inquiry, because of the job and the perks they received. The Sri Lankan Rupee has depreciated from around Rs. 113 to Rs. 135 to the Dollar. Before it began to depreciate, the Sri Lankan reserves were blown away by Dollars two and a half billion which was also nearly half the reserves of the country. That inquiry against the Thai Governor of Central Bank was initially upheld by a court that he had mishandled the economy.

773 774

So, we bring this in that light, that even officials in very high positions - maybe the Governor or the other officials in high positions - could be acting under different influences. Therefore, their independence is in question.

There was a discussion today on the EPF and Members of the Government took great pains to say that 92 per cent of the EPF was safely deposited in Government securities and we have no debate about it. It is true that we are debating about the quantum of money that was put in the stock market. In todays context, it is nearly Rs. 75 billion to Rs. 80 billion. A 10 per cent loss on that, would be Rs. 8 billion. But, in the year 2009 and 2010, when the stock market rose by 125 per cent and 96 per cent, those who had invested their hard-earned money in the EPF only received in one year less than 4 per cent and in the next year just over 4 per cent. That is why the Opposition has consistently and continuously brought this to the attention of the nation. The EPF has been used among other captive Government funds basically to buy shares above their intrinsic value and subsequently encounter a loss. These shares have been invested not in blue-chip companies as the requirement is but also sometimes in unlisted companies and sometimes in newly-listed companies, which are companies that are not financially stable. Also, now there is evidence that there has been a scheme of pumping and dumping in the market where a few investors have profited at the expense of the working people of this country.

I do not want to comment extensively on that matter as now the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating into the mafia who has basically held captive the working class peoples money for private gain and private profit. We strongly argue, not only for the independence of the Central Bank but also for the independence of the Securities and Exchange Commission, that the Commissioners be appointed apolitically and also that the Commission would report to Parliament and be remunerated by Parliament. There is a breakdown in law and order and in good governance. The economic connection between good governance and the economy is a proven thing in contemporary economic research and literature. More recently there have been studies at the Harvard University by an Italian economist and by others strengthening the views of conservative economists of years gone by. That is why we continuously bring this to the attention of the Government. We have discussed many things today. But, I would also like to highlight at this time, the issues to do with those who are in the evening of their lives.

In conclusion, I would like to make some comments on the oil hedging agreement. I call upon the Government to make public the oil hedging agreement. Make it public; be transparent; let the country know about it. We always do not need to have laws to do these things. We tried to bring in a Right to Information Bill and we were blocked and not allowed to bring that. The Government promised to introduce a Right to Information Bill and we are still eagerly waiting for the Governments Bill. Meanwhile, this oil hedging deal is a matter of public interest, but we also want to know the details of that Right to Information Bill. This zero-cost collar option was taken. At that point, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation did not pay a fee. So, it was natural that inherently this contract was going to be disadvantageous to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. So, who takes responsibility? There are two questions that I would like to pose before the House: who approved the hedging transaction and who, in the Government, takes responsibility? That is the first question. We have been told at many different times that it was officials; that it was the Board of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation; that it was the Cabinet and so on and so forth.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I will conclude quickly.

The second matter we need to know is - ultimately, this impacts on the shareholder of the country, who is the citizen - who can be identified as the culprits so that this responsibility could be passed on? This hedging contract is a clear example of conflicts that exist in a transaction. The Government was buying oil; some of the

Government banks were involved in providing for hedging and the Central Bank was advising. So, with the banks as well as the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, at every end of the transaction, the Government was involved. So, I am requesting, Hon. Presiding Member, that the Government, in the name of transparency, to table the hedging contract so that the people of this country would come to know in whose names this contract was entered into.

Thank you. [. . 6.04] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. DEW Gunasekara - Minister of Human Resources) , . . . . , ; . . , , . , , , . .

We have to be very selective and objective in this matter. The people who are the custodians of these public funds should take into account the interest of the economy and the interest of the workers. I am very happy that this issue is being discussed and that there is a big awareness campaign in the media, amongst the trade unions, in Parliament and in the whole country, so that hereafter they will think twice or thrice before they take further action as regards public funds.
