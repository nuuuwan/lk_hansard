1229 1230

[ . . ]

2012 25

I am very thankful for giving me this opportunity to recall the memory of a highly-cultured gentleman politician who had been one of those rare men with great qualities. He was both a politician as well as a military man. His services to the people of Sri Lanka, particularly to the people of the Kandy District, have been unique. I had the privilege of serving as one of his Cabinet Colleagues and I was proud of his association.

He was one of the most modest and lovable personalities who walked with men of all shades. He transcended the boundaries of race, religion, caste and creed and embraced all people alike. Sir, he had been a person who was in the forefront in social, sports, cultural and economic activities pertaining to the people of the Kandy District. He was a social worker with an objective vision. He was quite an unassuming personality with very fine human qualities.

The Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte served as a Deputy Minister of Defence and showed extraordinary valour in the battlefield directing many successful military operations including the "Jayasikuru" operation in which the Sri Lanka Army regained the Jaffna Peninsula from the deathly terrorists. As the Cabinet Minister for Irrigation, Power and Energy, he rendered an excellent service.

As a man, he fostered fellowship among the different ethnic communities and he was an ardent believer in multiculturalism and ethnic harmony. Although he began his political career as an UNPer, he joined the progressive forces and worked hard to create a sense of political awakening among the people. He always looked at the problems of the people with great understanding and an open mind. His approach to the various issues had been unique in respect of each issue. He particularly took care not to offend anyone.

The people of Sri Lanka including the Armed Forces will remember him forever for the leadership and the significant contribution he made in the eradication of terrorism towards the reunification of the country. Men of his calibre are very rare.

Sir, I join the Members of this House in paying my highest tribute to him and conveying my deepest condolences to the members of his family.

Thank you.

[3.41 p.m.]

() ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana - Minister of Scientific Affairs) Hon. Deputy Speaker, it is with a deep sense of sadness that I say a few words on the occasion when the House is taking up the Vote of Condolence on the late Anurudha Ratwatte, both General and former Minister. On behalf of the LSSP, I would like to offer my deepest sympathies to the members of his family and say on this occasion that I have the fondest memories of my association with the Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte.

He was junior to me at Trinity College and my younger brother was a colleague. I had occasion to interact with him from that young age and got to know him well and appreciated his many good qualities. We were able to maintain this association, on and off, right throughout to the end. In a way we had certain similarities in our lives. After his education at Trinity College - we know his father, who was steeped in politics, was a strong leader of the UNP in the Kegalle District and also in Parliament - he carried this political training and started his political career as a Member of the UNP and was in the Kandy Municipal Council.

1239 1240

Thereafter, I am happy that he turned to progressive politics and joined the SLFP, first as a Municipal Councillor in Kandy and then as the chief organizer for the Senkadagala Electorate. He established himself as a political leader in the Kandy District for the Progressive Movement. Thereafter, though he was not successful in the 1970 and 1977 General Elections, he entered Parliament in February 1989 as a Member of the National List and then in 1994, he was elected comfortably to Parliament from the Kandy District. He became not only one of the political leaders of the SLFP in the Kandy District, as we well know, but also as the Cabinet Minister of Power and Energy.

He was very active throughout the country as the Deputy Minister of Defence. His background in the army was invaluable. He was able, as the Deputy Minister of Defence, to assist President Kumaratunga at that time and did a yeoman service in the operation "Riviresa" and that is something, which I think will not be forgotten because the liberation of the Jaffna Peninsula from the grasp of the LTTE was achieved by him during that period.

I remember interacting with him when he was the Minister of Power and Energy. I gratefully acknowledge the help that he gave to the area I represented in the Kegalle District during that period in that capacity of Minister. So, he held very valuable and important portfolios successfully and was able to be an inspiring leader on the military front as well as in the important area of the Ministry of Power and Energy.

On behalf of the LSSP, I take this opportunity to state that as part of the Progressive Movement, he was always supportive to us in the politics that we had to do, though there were differences. He did not hold it against us and his friendliness and general desire to be helpful were characteristic of him, which we will never forget.

So, I am very glad that his children, two of them - in particular, the Hon. Lohan Ratwatte is now in Parliament with us and Mr. Mahendra Ratwatte as the Mayor of Kandy, - are in active politics following the footsteps of the their father and taking the political message and the political service which the Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte started for the people of that area.

So, I would like, once again, to express my condolences to the family on this occasion and wish that his journey through Samsara will be a happy and pleasant one.

Thank you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) What is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) He is making false statements, which should be expunged from Hansard.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) That is a very serious allegation. So, you have to expunge it from Hansard.

[6.28 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, according to our Constitution, Chapter II on Buddhism, Article 9 states, I quote:

The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, while assuring to all religions the rights granted by Articles 10 and 14 (1)(e).

Then, Chapter III, Article 10 states, I quote:

Every person is entitled to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, including the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice.

It continues and further, Article 14 (1) (e) states, I quote:

"the freedom, either by himself or in association with others, and either in public or in private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching;"

Sir, what I say is, according to the Constitution, every religion is given the freedom of thought and conscience.

So, Sir, in Sri Lanka, we have the Buddhists, the Hindus, the Muslims and the Christians. They have their places of worship. The places of religion should not be dented or harmed by anybody else in any way. If they try to do that they will be doing an act against the Constitution of Sri Lanka. I think, there are certain areas which the Government should give serious thought to because for the first time - as it has not happened before - there are certain disturbances in the country. That should be nipped in the bud; that must be buried there without allowing it to prosper.

Now, Sir, in this country, we have lived very happily in harmony with the majority Sinhalese in the Sinhalese areas and the majority Tamils in the Tamil areas. We have therefore built up a culture of our own. Our religion is very free. We are expected to practice our religion at our

will. But, there are certain incidents that take place and disturbs all of us. Now, for example, in the Kurunegala area, there is a Madrasa at Ariyasinghalewatte. A Madrasa is a place where the Holy Quran is taught and also a place where children are trained to pray. That is, you learn the Holy Quran and also learn how to pray. Now, certain elements tried to upset the applecart there.

Now, these type of things, I think, the Hon. Minister and the Government must take serious note of because after a long period of suffering, we have won a war. In Geneva, seven Muslim countries voted for us. Then, when we visited Qatar recently with our President, the abundance of goodwill and friendship they showed him, the amount of honour and dignity they showed him and also the amount of respect they showed for him, is remarkable. We have to protect that status quo in this country.

Sir. I should also like to mention that during the times of the Portuguese, Dutch and English, architectural sites of the Muslims were also destroyed in certain areas right along Galle, Hambantota, Beruwala and the rest of the island. Then Sir, even in your area; in Galle, there is a place called Palliyawatta. . . . . .

You know about the Grand Mosque in Colombo. It is an archaeological site. Certain great Saints who came from India, Indonesia and Malaysia were buried there. Incidentally there was a cannon there. When there were no radios or televisions, the people could hear these cannon sounds and that was heard even at far away places, up to Maharagama, which is about 10 miles away. We too used to hear that. Then, we start our fasting and we end the fasting with the sounds of the cannon that comes from the Grand Mosque in New Moor Street, Colombo.

Also, Sir, adjoining that there is a Mosque at the Peer Sahibo Street and our famous Niyas Moulavi, a very popular priest who appeared often on ITNs "Doramadalawa" programme, was the Pesh Imam there. The "Doramadalawa" Programme telecasts on ITN has become one of the foremost ITN productions in this country that has been graded very high. As I said earlier, there were also some Saints buried. Therefore, the attention of the Government should also be drawn towards this place.

Dharma Kabeer Masjid - the Dharga in Hambantota - has a long history and a great heritage. People came from Malaysia, Java and Batavia. Those Saints were buried there and that must also be taken into reckoning to declare it a place of national heritage.

1293 1294

2012 25

Then, the Poruwa Palliwase, we call it, Poruwa" Mosque in Godapitiya, Akuressa. Sir, the last suicide bomb attack of the Tigers went off at Godapitiya under the shadow of this Poruwa Mosque. I must also mention about Khair Hajiar who expired very recently, - even Dr. Haris Deen and the family came from London and visited the funeral house - his family and others have been very helpful in order to maintain that Mosque. That was the signal of the end of the Tigers in this country. Even the Hon. Mahinda Wijesekara, former Minister of Posts and Telecommunication, a victim of that attack, is still unable to regain his proper health. The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie, our Senior Minister of Urban Affairs escaped from this attack through, I should say, divine power. He narrowly escaped from that bomb attack.

Sir, the first Mosque built in this country is the Masjidul Abrar in Beruwala. There were steps taken earlier by the Hon. Minister to declare this place as a national heritage and there was also a proposal to issue a stamp, because that is the first Mosque built in this country after Arab settlers came there.

Our famous distinguished Speaker, the Hon. Deshamanya M.A. Bakeer Markar rebuilt it and renovated it, helped by people of the calibre of A.W.M. Razik Marikar, Abdul Hameed Hadjiar, Mr. T.M.N. Hameed, SSP, A.W.M. Ajward, A.A.M. Shamsudeen and also Mr. Ismath Abdulla, who is now domiciled in London, and a lot of interest was also taken by our Friend, a former minister, the Hon. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar. A famous writer, M.K.E. Moulana from India wrote a voluminous book" - " " about ALLIRANI, who ruled the area in ancient times. That is regarding this historic Mosque at Silvathurai in Mannar. I think we have to take action in order to discover that place because a large number of people speak about it when we go to India. It is a very historical place. That also should come to the reckoning of the Government, when you declare sites of national heritage.

I want to mention about Jaffna. There is Mankumban - an islet - where a Saint is buried. There is a history behind it. Sir, Moor Street in Jaffna also resembles an archeological site now. I must complain in this House that 20 years ago, 75,000 people were driven away even without anything to wear - including our Muslim ladies, you know how conservative they are. They cover their heads with the fardha. They were all driven away. Now, if you go and visit the famous Usmania School, Khadija School for the Ladies, they are in ruins.

Jaffna is a very famous place for great learned men like Senator A.M.A. Azeez - we call him Aringngner A.M.A Azeez - Justice M.M. Abdul Cader of the Supreme Court and also certain writers like Zubair Ilankeeran. Now, what has happened there? Houses numbering 50,000 are to be built by the donations given by the Indian Government. I told that earlier in this House

and I repeat it that I told it in front of the Leader of the Opposition of the Lok Sabha, Mrs. Sushma Swaraj. I told it in her presence when she visied us in Parliament. These houses which will be built, they say, will not be given to the Muslims who were driven away. Which court of justice are we to go? Is this justice, I am asking?

Therefore, Sir, I even now challenge the TNA in this House. When Muslims were driven away at that time and when the Muslims wre massacred at Kattankudy in Eravur, in Alingipathana and Palliyagodella in Polonnaruwa not a word of sympathy, not a word of protest, was said by them at that time. Therefore, I challenge them to declare in this House, any Member of the TNA, specially Hon. R. Sampanthan and also the others. Let them pledge that these houses that will be built soon will be given to the Muslims because they were sent away and also I want these sites to be remodeled and restructured. I told you about Mankumban.

Sir, this country is a blessed country. We used to have " " in Malwana. Now, we get "" from that land. . . , . , , . . This must go on record. This is the first time when a Motion is moved, not a single Opposition Member is present in this House. This is the callous attitude that they show to this House.

. . . . , .

. He was a very good friend of the Muslims in that area. He helped Muslim causes and even the schools in Udathalawinna and other places. I know Mr. Fawzan Anver, the SLFP organizer in Colombo Central; he was very friendly with him. Mr. Fawzan Anver got his assistance from General Anurudha Ratwatte in order to help even the Muslims in the Colombo District. Sir, I once introduced Viththuwan Rahuman of Mannar to him. Viththuwan Rahuman was also very much interested in the protection of archaeological sites.

Mr. M.A. Gafoor has been the cameraman for hundreds of films in this country and he has contributed his share. So, this type of people Viththuwan Abdul Rahuman and the Muslims of Mannar, Jaffna and down South have been very much interested in protecting their religious places and also in protecting their archaeological sites. I thank the Hon. Minister for listening to me. I hope he would take positive steps towards that. Thank you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) The next Speaker is the Hon. Jagath Balasuriya. Before that, will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer to take the Chair?

( ) (The Hon. Jagath Balasuriya) I propose that the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.
