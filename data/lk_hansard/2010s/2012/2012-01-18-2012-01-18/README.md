When we say the private sector has to have a place, we do not mean only big owners of property or companies; we mean ownership by the small man, ownership by all. We believe that no economy can be justified on moral grounds for any length of time unless the mass of the people have a share in ownership."

"In its road map for 2012, the Central Bank has outlined ambitious

plans for the EPF. The report says that the focus of the EPF will be to ensure a significant positive real rate of return to the members with the benchmark to be at least 1.5 % over inflation in any five-year period. It also wants to ensure the safety of the fund and provide efficient service. The investment portfolio is to be diversified into listed and unlisted equities, corporate debt and securitization products and long-term Government bonds and mega project financing is to be explored."

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I am only wondering whether angels have descended on the Chamber when one listens to the way the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne was sermonizing to us. He said that the "EmployeesProvident Fund belongs not to you but to the employees". We know it; even a small child knows it. But, I must put the record straight and emphasize the fact in this House, Sir, that all aspects concerning the working class is well looked after by the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government; nothing is left for others to do. There are matters perhaps for others to feel jealous. That is all.

I whole heartedly support this amendment brought before the House by our amiable Minister, the Hon. Gamini Lokuge. Now, if you look at his past records, I do not think anybody in this House can challenge the relationship, the camaraderie that he has established with the labour class. He understands their language, their aspirations, their wants and their needs, more than anybody else. Therefore, once the amendments are passed, the law would be in the safe hands of our Hon. Minister to implement. Nobody needs to fear. The working class knows it well.

Now, Sir, the Opposition has discussed with the Minister all these details and what the trade unions had wanted included in this amendment. What more democracy do you need to be practised? Whatever they have said about the amendments - to add certain things, to subtract and also to give colour and dignity to those amendments - the Hon. Minister has agreed. That is the way that this Government and the Ministers do work. Sir, some of these people really do not understand this. This will never hurt a single employee or the working class of this country. Benefits will be showered on them. That is why I say that His Excellency the President would never have allowed for these, if there is any debility to be caused on the working class or the working people. It is all done for the good of the people. Somebody said that it was the UNP that brought these Bills. I was also in the UNP. What a canard! What a daylight lie! This is not a white lie but the darkest lie one could hear of. It was the Hon. T. B. Ilangaratne - the whole world knows that; it has gone into record - who brought this Employees Provident Fund Act, after a long-drawn out struggle by the leftist leaders. We must not lose sight of it at this moment. It was the great leftist leaders Trotskyists, Marxists and socialist people like Dr. N.M. Perera, Dr. S.A. Wickremasinghe, the Hon. Philip Gunawardene and the Hon. Pieter Keuneman who fought for it. The Hon. Athauda Seneviratne who is here would vouch for it; he knows that better than anyone of us. During your time, before this Act was passed, there was no overtime for the working class.

271 272

2012 18

I know about the Shop and Office Employees' Act that was brought by the SLFP Government at that time. People used their labour. They were working in shops in Pettah till 8 oclock, 9 oclock, 10 oclock in the night or till midnight. Not a penny, not a cent more than what they got as mere salary, was paid; . . Over the years, they fought for it. Who are the architects of the payment of overtime in this country? It was those great leaders. It was after 1956 that the great revolution of the proletariat or the working class was ushered in this country. On the 1st of January, 1957, I was in the old Parliament premises at Galle Face when the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike inaugurated the nationalized bus service. At that time, I still remember, the late Hon. (Mrs.) Vivienne Goonewardena, the LSSP firebrand from Colombo North said, We have the key. That is, the Samasamaja key. We are handing over the key to the hand of the Hon. Bandaranaike to start the bus. Let us have these services nationalized for the benefit of the people, she said.

Today, what is happening? When there is a problem in one sector - there is a system of private transport as well as State transport, running side by side, and they do operate very well - when there is a threat to the public transport and when the people are unable to travel freely to their workplaces and schools, remedies are provided by the other sector.

Then, Sir, I refer to the Budget Speech, 2012 of His Excellency the President, in which he declares a lot of consolations, showering benefits on the people of the working class. He spoke not only about the people of the working class, but also about empowering artistes and journalists and promoting arts and crafts, which have been referred to in pages 95 and 98 respectively of his Budget Speech. Today, Sir, even the working class has joined the artistes at the John De Silva Rangahala near the Viharamahadevi Park. They are having a seven-day drama festival. I would urge my honourable Friend, the Hon. Yogarajan, to go and see the Tamils and Muslims acting together with the Sinhalese to promote arts and crafts, along with the working class. Those are the benefits they get and we have been giving prominence for them in society.

Today, while speaking about the artistes, Sir, I have a solemn duty to perform. 2012 17 :

" .. ."

. . That body is kept at the Art Gallery for the public to pay their last respect. So, that is the way to care for artistes.

Also, Sir, there is a section of people, Tamils and Muslim, who belong to the working class. They are working in the harbour, in hotels and in other retail and wholesale shops. They have been given the opportunity to develop their arts according to their cultural and religious background.

Sir, I have an article here with me. '' , " - " . He is a great writer.

" , , () - ."

. A humble beginning, he had. From there, he had gone to attain such heights, won the laurels of all and awards from India and returned back.

There is also "Thajul Fannan" Kalaichelvan Abdul Rauff. He was honoured by professors, lecturers and intellectuals at a very big awarding ceremony held in Trichy last week. I met him in Madras. I too offer felicitations to those great artistes and writers in this House. This is how the Government is giving all the facilities to the people of arts and music, literature and culture.

But, when you go to Madras, what do you hear? ", ." Our people give wrong information to them. What is "kolaveri" ? They have composed a nice song. The Hon. Yogarajan knows it well. It says, "Why this , ." What is that? " " . " " " " " ". , "No, ", " ", " " . " " " " . "" . . . record . .

the Minister of External Affairs of India. Where did he first visit? The "Temple Trees". He took part in the Thai Pongal celebrations conducted by no less than the Head of the State at his official residence, "Temple Trees". Mr. Krishna said, I enjoyed every moment". Here is the report that he had sent to the newspapers. What did he

273 274

say? Mr. S.M. Krishna said this, which was published on the first page of the Sudar Oli of 17th January, 2012 . Yesterday, I quoted something from that newspaper because I thought that had been published very well and neatly, and the photographs are very clear. You can read it well. It is the Sudar Oli which published that. That is the significant factor. It states, I quote:

" ".

He has agreed to the reconciliation process and the dialogue between the two parties and has also told the TNA to co-operate, saying further, Like a parrot, do not keep on saying, ', ,

in Jaffna' ". " " Jaffna ; . Palk Strait ; . . Colombo Tamil Sangam -in all, 33 books which were printed in Tamil Nadu were released here in the Colombo Tamil Sangam Stage. It was for the working class people, the ordinary people, for everybody to buy. Our Friend, the Hon. Radhakrishnan, who is seated across the aisle listening to me, knows it well. All 33 books - Tamil literature books, novels and short stories - Sir, it is a world record, were released, mind you, in Colombo, not in Madras.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, please wind up now.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay Sir.

That is why I say that if there is a country, if there is a capital in the world that enriches the Tamil language - that is the language of the Tamils and the Muslims - the Hindu culture and the Islamic culture all together, it is Colombo, the Capital City of Sri Lanka, that takes pride of it. There is this type of " ", this type of releasing ceremony, not in India but in our own country. We know it. That is why they come over and even sell their books here. If you walk along Wellawatta, Bambalapitiya, Kochchikade and Wattala, you can see in the mid of night, our Tamil ladies walking freely wearing gold thaalis and bangles. What a blessed country this has become! This has become a country where the Tamils and the Muslims are enjoying, the best in the world, Sir.

He has co-authored the book "India 2020 - A Vision for the New Millennium" with Y.S. Rajan. In it, he says that by 2020, India will be the number one country. When you go to India, you can see the difference: there are monorails running all over in Trichy and the Madras City. There is a vast improvement in the economic structure and their living patterns. Sir, that is the lesson we are learning; that is what we want to introduce in this country. That is the ambition and dream of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa to be achieved through the "Mahinda Chintana".

Yogarajan, go to Jaffna, have a cultural show with those people, the girls and the boys, if you like, and you will see a new vista being opened up in this country; everything augurs well for the future.

Sir, while concluding my speech, I welcome Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to Sri Lanka. Yesterday, I said that I was the first person from Sri Lanka or from a foreign country to call on him after he was declared the President of India. He was in a small room in the Annamalai University, Madras.

I, once again, congratulate the Hon. Gamini Lokuge and the Government for so ably presenting these Amendments and I commend them to this House.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) .

; ; ; . . . , . . . ; ; . . , , , , . [5.20 p.m] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Chairman, I was privileged to listen to you before two previous speakers. "" . , . , . . , , !

( ) (The Presiding Member) . .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) , . ! .

You requested me to go to the North and the East and see for myself. I had the privilege of going to Trincomalee.

( ) (The Presiding Member) It is a good invitation.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I went to see the Hot Wells in Kinniya. I was shocked to see that they were putting up a Buddhist Temple just beside it, where there has not been a Buddhist Temple in the past and they are collecting money from everybody who comes to see the Hot Wells, for this purpose. So, when we go and see those things, we do not feel happy as you suggested but we only feel very sad about it.

The Hon Minister has brought a Bill today. It is actually brought to give effect to two issues that the workers would like. One is, the introduction of a single number - the National Identity Card number - for every member of the EPF. I can remember very well, it was at a meeting when the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne was Minister of Labour Relations and Productivity Improvement, the Central Bank came and made a presentation and they wanted to give a unique number to every member, which would be carried through his life. Then the Minister, Hon. Athauda Seneviratne suggested that this unique number should not be any other number, but the National Identity Card Number. It is a very positive thing you have done. What the Hon. Minister Athauda Seneviratne suggested then at the NLAC, you have brought in today as a Bill in this Parliament. We welcome that Section of the Bill. I am sure, it will especially help plantation workers, who find it very difficult to claim their EPF dues, to receive their EPF dues in a proper manner. Other than that, you have also brought a proposal in this Bill to grant the opportunity for members of the Employees' Provident Fund to withdraw their dues prematurely for medical and housing needs.

This is again a very positive thing. These are two things that the NLAC accepted when the Hon. Minister proposed and we welcome that. Today, there is already a provision for you to take money as a loan from the State Mortgage and Investment Bank against the balance lying to your credit in the EPF. This was brought in by the UNP Government in the past and you are allowed to take a loan up to 75 per cent of the amount lying in your credit, in your EPF. In practice, we have seen that generally employers deduct it from the salary but they delay the payment. Then, the surcharges are incurred in the banks. Delayed payments incur penal interest rates and finally you are paying more than one and a half times the amount you borrowed. There was a case in an estate in Nanuoya where somebody borrowed Rs. 30,000, paid Rs. 400 every month for 10 years - 120 months - which amounted to Rs. 48,000. But, today, the balance that he has to pay is again Rs. 30,000, the total amount he borrowed because the Rs. 48,000 he has paid has been set off only for interest. So, what you are bringing here for premature withdrawal of 30 per cent of the amount lying to the credit of a member is a positive thing. You would already know that at NLAC, the plantation unions made representations that this Rs. 300,000 is too large because some of the plantation workers who earned only Rs.

285 286

5,000 three years ago or maybe less than Rs. 5,000 ten years ago, would not have a balance of Rs. 200,000 today - at the end of ten years. So, they have requested that this amount of Rs. 300,000 at the threshold for you to be able to withdraw prematurely, should be reduced to Rs. 200,000. But, if it is going to be 30 per cent of Rs. 200,000, it will be Rs. 60,000 and it will not serve the purpose of building a house or even a medical requirement. So, this 30 per cent should not remain as 30 per cent. I would suggest, it should have become at least the minimum of Rs. 100,000, whether it is Rs. 300,000 or even less. The threshold should be reduced to Rs. 200,000 and the minimum amount that a person could withdraw should be at least Rs.100,000.

Further, you also say that you can take a loan for housing. You know very well that the plantation workers do not have owned lands. At present, the NHDA provides them lands from the estate. They are given a loan by the NHDA which has to be paid over period of 15 years. When the late Hon. P. Chandrasekeran was appointed as the Deputy Minister of Estate Housing in 1997, he commenced some housing schemes. Fifteen years have lapsed and today, the beneficiaries have repaid the loan fully. But, the management is refusing to give them a deed because the land does not belong to them. The land is vested in the Land Reform Commission and Land Reform Commission is not willing to issue deeds for these housing plots.

Though we take the loan and repay it fully, we do not have deeds. Still the land belongs to the LRC. It is under the custody of the management and we own only the house. So, this has no meaning. I raised this issue with the Minister of Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities at the Consultative Committee, but he was not able to give an answer. He said that this has to be discussed with the Ministry of Lands and Land Development and the Ministry of Plantation Industries and that he cannot make a decision on issuing of deeds to these workers. However, in this Bill, Clause 4.(4)(a) states that you can withdraw this 30 per cent from the EPF balance for the purpose of housing. The housing includes, I quote:

(a) the construction of a house on a land belonging to a member;

So, you are going to pass a Bill where every member of the EPF can withdraw 30 per cent of the money lying to his credit. But, it is not available to plantation workers because they do not have a deed. They do not own the land that the company will give them. At present, they are giving lands for these houses. It is just measured and handed over in the belief that one day they would get deeds and people will put up their houses. For that purpose, we thought that when you pass this law, they will be able to withdraw from their EPF to put up a house. But, you have barred that particularly by saying that it

should be a land belonging to a member. The estate workers lands will not belong to a member. I would urge the Hon. Minister to bring in an amendment so that this will become a reality even for the plantation worker. So, we welcome these two Clauses in the Bill. But, was it brought in for the purpose of helping the worker or was it brought in for another purpose? Now, you have withdrawn one purpose; the creation of a private pension scheme. You know very well that the private pension scheme failed because the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne - when we were discussing the Votes of the Ministry of Labour and Labour Relations - very frankly told us that the people were not sure of receiving their money that will be credited to their pension fund. So, you have not dealt with it but you have now withdrawn the Bills and you have also deleted that from the current Bill that we are discussing today.

The other issue is about the building. At the NLAC, the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana mentioned here that the agreement was for everything except that. Even at the NLAC, all the unions - I have a letter here signed by 12 unions - have said that they want a limit and they want to know in advance how much will be spent on this building that is going to be put up by you through the EPF. So, everyone is concerned. Everyone feels it may be fair for you to put up a building for EPF or a secretariat for social security where EPF, ETF and whatever other social security organizations could be housed. That maybe a good thing, but you are taking the peoples money, the workers money. When you are doing that, they should know how much is at stake and how much is going to be risked. This is what the trade unions have placed before you in the past.

Further, you are moving an amendment today. The Hon. Minister mentioned while one of my Colleagues was speaking, that the land has already been given to you by the Government. But, you are moving an amendment today to purchase a land for the construction of a secretariat whereas earlier in the Bill itself, you said that land has already been purchased. So, are you going to buy another piece of land or are you going to put up this building in that land allocated to you by the Government beside the Ministry of Labour and Labour Relations? If it has already been given to you by the Government, I believe that it should have given to you at zero cost.

Because after all, servicing the workers of this country, the six and a half million private sector workers who are members of the EPF, is a duty of the Government. So, the Government also has to make some contribution. And, as a contribution for this building, if the Government has released the land at zero cost, I would think it would have been fair for the workers themselves to contribute the balance to put up the building. But, the workers have the right to know how much is going to be used for the construction of these houses.

287 288

Sir, another issue related to EPF is the ETF. You have proposed and now withdrawn a scheme to introduce an insurance scheme. But, the ETF itself when it was originally proposed was supposed to become an insurance scheme. In India, the ETF is called ESI - Employees State Insurance scheme. State Insurance during their lifetime should have come through hospitals. They have built hospitals for workers where they get medical treatment at concessionary rates. Their critical illnesses are attended to free of charge. Under the ETF, we have an insurance scheme for critical illnesses. But, it is not sufficiently publicized and therefore very few people are benefiting from that. Also, the ETF payments for the six months prior to that incident of illness should have been made properly by the employer.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I am finishing, Sir. Some of our employers are deducting ETF but they are not paying it up in time or properly. But, the ETF member who requests for assistance for critical illnesses does not receive it because of the fault of the employer. So, ESI or ETF should become a scheme that provides them support throughout their life and the EPF should remain as a holdback at the time of retirement.

Thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva. You have only 10 minutes.
