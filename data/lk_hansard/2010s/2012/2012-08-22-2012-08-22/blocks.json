There was a Commission of Inquiry appointed; the Commission of Inquiry sat and recorded evidence. The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons who were appointed to oversee the work of the Commission of Inquiry withdrew from the country stating that the Sri Lankan Government did not have the will or the commitment to investigate grave human rights violations in keeping with international standards because they were not happy with the way in which inquires were being conducted in regard to these two horrendous crimes.

The recommendations in the Action Plan contemplate restoration of independent civil institutions: there is the reference to the Police Commission; there is the reference to the Public Service Commission. All that the Action Plan says is that such independent institutions have already been installed. We know that that cannot be so because the Constitutional Council, which was responsible for establishing those institutions or recommending the appointments that must be made to those institutions, on which recommendations the President was obliged to act, does not exist any longer and that has been replaced by a totally different procedure. So, I do not think it can be claimed by anyone that these independent civil institutions had been established. As far as the Police Commission and the Public Service Commission are concerned, it actually does not prevail. As a matter of fact, one of the concerns we have at the present Provincial Council Elections we are facing is that we have no independent Elections Commission, which was appointed by the Constitutional Council sometime ago. We have to depend upon an Election Commission, in the independence of which I do not think it can be said that everyone has confidence. So, these are some of the matters I wish to raise.

The Executive President, the Government and its own various departments and agencies are the primary cause for the situation that constitutes the foundation for the partiality, the inequality and the injustice that the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission sought to address. It is gravely questionable whether these same agencies could provide adequate redress on the basis of the truth being ascertained. These various agencies, in my respectful submission, have a vested interest in ensuring that the",

The arrangements are indicative of a desire to continue to perpetuate the past rather than initiate innovative action to provide effective change and redress and bring about goodwill and reconciliation. The Action Plan has not been formulated after due consultation with Parliament and the democratically-elected Representatives of the affected people. The Action Plan is more focused on cover-up and concealment rather than transparency and exposure and hence lacks credibility and legitimacy. These are my observations, Sir. I think it is our duty to make these observations before it is too late because I think if something that is being done is of a highly questionable nature, we have a duty to bring that to light.",

    "text": "The Action Plan also talks about reversal of lands in Sampur in Trincomalee and Valikamam in Jaffna in the North to the people to whom those lands belonged. But, very unfortunately, that has not been done in regard to lands both in Valikaamam and Sampur. The parties went to the Supreme Court by way of Fundamental Rights applications. The Attorney-General who appeared on behalf of the Government gave an assurance to the court that these people will be resettled. Those assurances are now being violated; they are not being complied with. I raised the matter in Parliament on a number of occasions, particularly in regard to Sampur and the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, replying on behalf of the Government on the 21st October, 2011, said that apart from the land required for the coal power plant, all other persons could return to their lands. But, they are not being permitted to do so. As a matter of fact, in recent times army personnel have been going to these camps, threatening the people and telling them that they must leave the camps and go to the lands which are pointed out to them as being the lands that will be given to them in lieu of the lands in Sampur. In fact, this morning I got information that a very senior military official was to go to the camps and repeat this threat, which has been uttered to the people in the course of the last few days by more junior officials in that area. So, it is an extremely serious situation. As far as Sampur is concerned, 1,486 families are affected. Shall we put the number at 1,500? They owned in this area 2,795 acres of land. I was given the particulars. Some of them owned lands on deeds which are more than 100 years old; some of them owned lands on permits given to them several decades ago, several years ago. Now, in place of these 2,795 acres of land, which these people owned on their own, they are to be given 20 perches each and if each family is given 20 perches, the total extent of land given to these people will be not more than 180 acres. You are taking away 2,795 acres of land and giving these people in return only 180 acres. Is this fair? How can you do this? I mean, this is criminal!",

When I drove up there, a woman came running up to me. She saw me; she probably recognized me. She said, Sir, they want me to live here and they are going to be there. Can I live here?

But, then that has not been implemented. What is more? The people have been deprived of food because they are not going to the lands to which they were asked to go. For the last six months, food supplied under the World Food Programme has not been made available to these people and they are compelled to starve because they are not carrying out your directions. Sir, if this is the way you are thinking to bring about reconciliation, harmony and goodwill amongst the people, I think you are sadly mistaken; you are not going to succeed in this effort. If you want to really make a start by implementing a programme for genuine reconciliation, the first thing you must do is to restore the land in Valikamam to the people in Valikamam and restore the land in Sampur to the people in Sampur.

I have gone there from the time I was a child. Suddenly, a monk has descended to the place and has taken over the property because he wants to carry out a commercial venture. A large number of people outside Trincomalee come there to bathe. They have heard about this place. I remember when the late J.R. Jayewardene was the President, some years ago in the late '70s, early '80s, a similar thing happened in Kanniya. He was holidaying in Nuwara Eliya. I heard about it and telephoned him. I told him, Sir, such a thing is happening. You must not permit this. This is wrong. He asked me, Sampanthan, where are you? I said, I am in Trincomalee. He said, Tomorrow morning the SP of Trincomalee will report to you. The SP of Trincomalee came, saw me and told me, We have asked that monk to go away. He is no longer there. Do not worry.

Undoubtedly, a home-grown solution would be the best thing. But, at the same time, a talk of a home-grown solution should not become an excuse for not finding a solution. I shall demonstrate that efforts at evolving a home-grown solution have been numerous in the past. The Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact was not grown in Norway or India. It was grown in Sri Lanka. The Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact was very much a home-grown product. The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution is entirely home-grown and home-made. Extensive discussions took place between the Sri Lankan Government and the TULF representing the Tamil people in July and August in 1986. We talked for at least 15 days each month. On the Government side, there was the President J.R. Jayewardene, Minister Ronnie de Mel, Minister Lalith Athulath Mudali, Minister Gamini Dissanayake, Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, Hon.A.C.S. Hameed, Hon. K.W. Devanayagam. On the TULF side, there was A. Amirthalingam, M. Sivasithamparam, Neelan Thiruchelvam, V. Anandasangaree, V. Yogeswaran, Joseph Pararajasingham and myself. We discussed nine drafts in July and August 1986. Mr. Felix Dias Abeysinghe, retired Commissioner of Elections, was the Secretary of that Committee. The papers must be available in the Presidential Secretariat or in some office. That was also a home-grown solution. It had the approval of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka; it had the approval of the legislature of this country; it was passed by a two-thirds majority. How can you say that it was not home-grown? It was home-grown. It was very much a product of this country; an effort by people in this country.",

The Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement being signed does not make the Thirteenth Amendment any less a home-grown solution. The Thirteenth Amendment was the outcome of discussions that took place between the Government of Sri Lanka and the TULF, the Party that represented the Tamil people. The TULF had strong reservations about the Thirteenth Amendment. After all, the Thirteenth Amendment was eventually formulated by the Sri Lankan Government, not by both sides and our reservations continue. We have been clamouring for improvements to the Thirteenth Amendment. We want the Thirteenth Amendment formulated so as to make the solution more acceptable. The international community has played a role; India has played a role to bring about some finality to make the solution reasonably acceptable to all sides and inevitably India being our closest neighbour and whose good offices Sri Lanka accepted, has played the most prominent and important role in regard to the matter. The rest of the international community too has played a role. This role played by the international community and by India have been accepted by the Sri Lankan Government. I do not think that can be a cause for complaint. I propose, Sir, to deal with the role played by India and the international community in regard to the evolution of an acceptable political solution and I think I can best do it by referring to some of the statements that were made in the course of this long process, which will throw much light on this whole question. It must be remembered that both India and the rest of the international community played a role for the simple reason that we were not able to solve this problem ourselves.",

It is our hope that the vision and leadership that resulted in an end to armed conflict will now be employed in the quest for a genuine political reconciliation. We look forward to progress in the ongoing dialogue process in order to address this issue in a timely manner. We will continue to work with the Government of Sri Lanka and help in whatever way we can to take the process forward in a spirit of partnership and cooperation. We have noted the many constructive recommendations contained in the recently released report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, LLRC. These recommendations when implemented would mark a major step forward in the process of genuine national reconciliation to which the Sri Lankan Government is committed. Sri Lanka must seize the opportunity. The Government of Sri Lanka has on many occasions conveyed to us its commitment to move towards a political settlement based upon the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution and building on it so as to achieve meaningful devolution of powers. We look forward to an expeditious and constructive approach to the dialogue process. We believe the continuation of the dialogue between the Government and the TNA would pave the way for a political settlement including under the rubric of the Parliamentary Select Committee. I discussed this matter with His Excellency the President this morning. The President assured me that he stands by his commitment to pursuing the Thirteenth Amendment Plus approach.",

We cannot have the PSC merely to delay this process and to prolong this process nor can we have the PSC to enable some parties who will come before the PSC to scuttle the entire process. That we cannot cooperate with and that we cannot do. This is our position in regard to the matter and this is why we have not been able to partake in the PSC.",

Our people suffered immensely during the time of the war. Tens of thousands of Tamil civilians were killed. We know that. They were bombed aerially. Multi-barrel rocket launchers were used; heavy artillery fire was used even after commitments were made that they would not be used. As and when they happened, we raised all those issues in Parliament. We spoke about those matters in Parliament and they are all recorded in Hansard. There was no contradiction by the Government to any one of the statements that we made because the Government at that time realized that what we said was the truth, but we do not seek confrontation. At the same time, this cannot be swept under the carpet. You must not think that this can be swept under the carpet and can be forgotten about. It was a war fought without witnesses; the media was kept out; international media was kept out; NGOs were kept out; INGOs were kept out; the NGOs and the INGOs were asked to leave Vanni in September 2008; the ICRC was not given free access; the UN was not given free access; we, the Members of Parliament, could not go there; people died of starvation; people died due to lack of medicine; hospitals were attacked; relief centres were attacked; people lived under trees; they had no shelter.

But, to be captivated by the past and to be mired in events which have taken place in the past, in my view, is not a constructive approach to the search for solutions. I think well over 70 per cent of the Hon. R. Sampanthans speech consisted of quotations, speeches made by people at different times and documents which were produced at some point in history. It was a comprehensive chronicle of historical events. I am not for a moment denigrating the value of such a historical record. It may contribute to our understanding of complex situations. But, we do need to recognize that circumstances have changed drastically. It is a new situation that has arisen in this country since May 2009. We have to recognize that reality. Therefore, to keep talking about the past; to keep invoking quotations from the past is, I think, to restrict unwittingly ones own capability to address issues in a manner that is conducive to the emergence of viable and practical solutions. I say that with genuine respect.",

How long has it taken in those situations to reacquire some semblance of normalcy? It has always taken more than a decade. As against that, consider the extent to which things have changed in this country within the brief span of three years. Just this morning, I had occasion to give a very comprehensive briefing about contemporary events in this country to His Excellency Yasushi Akashi, the Special Representative of the Government of Japan for Peace-building, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction in Sri Lanka. I briefed him fully about what is happening at present. Last month, with Mr. Lalith Weeratunga, Secretary to His Excellency the President, I briefed Ambassadors and High Commissioners accredited to Sri Lanka about the same developments. And, again with Mr. Weeratunga, I met the local and international media and we presented a very objective, dispassionate appraisal of the accomplishments on the ground in Sri Lanka during the last 36 months.

Those who seek to internationalize the Sri Lankan situation are not only not doing any good but they are inflicting real harm on a political process in this country. There is a group of people. I will name nobody, I am not singling anybody in particular for condemnation. But, all of you will know that public statements have been made by political figures in this country, Sir, on these lines: Why are we interested in a domestic process? We can get very much more out of the international community. Therefore, let the domestic process falter and collapse. That is what we want. We will then be in a position to raise our voices and tell the world, here is the empirical proof. This cannot succeed within the shores of Sri Lanka. A passionate appeal is then made on the most facetious and frivolous grounds to the international community who are told, \"You take over, you now exert pressure on the Government of Sri Lanka and extort, cause out of the Government of Sri Lanka a solution that goes far, far beyond the parameters of any solution that would emerge from a domestic process\". I am not saying that the Hon. Sampanthan is adopting that view. I say that with honesty. But, I do say that there are others whom the Hon. R. Sampanthan is well aware of, who are certainly adopting that view and who are looking for an exit strategy out of the domestic peace process.

This means, Sir, the marginalization of moderates; the moderates who believe that this countrys destiny is in the hands of its people and its elected Representatives; moderates who are genuinely committed to the pursuit of a solution which will be constructed in keeping with the wishes and the aspirations of the people of this land. Those are the moderates who are now marginalized, who are deprived of authority by an international process which has kindled the hope that the international community will be a substitute for the organs of the Sri Lankan State in arriving at a solution to this issue. That is why I say, in all conscience and with total sincerity and honesty, that that is where this Resolution has failed the people of this land. I am not saying for a moment that anybody has done that deliberately or viciously, not at all. But, that is the consequence of that action.",

Now, I want to explain very clearly what the factual position is because I am not for a moment suggesting that there was any mala fides. The Universal Periodic Review is not specific to this country at all. One hundred and ninety two countries are subject to review by the UPR once in four and a half years. It goes by rotation and our turn comes in the first week of November. So, we have prepared the document and sent it to them. This is not the only occasion on which we have submitted similar reports. We have submitted similar reports under other international instruments to which Sri Lanka is a signatory. For example, under the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, we have submitted reports. Then, under the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of the Child as well, Sri Lanka has submitted reports. The procedure is that we submit the report, then the report is translated into six United Nations languages and then, immediately it is put on their website. It becomes a public document to which the whole world has access. Nobody is interested in hiding it; nobody can hide it; it cannot be concealed. The whole world can look at that. I am now in a position to tell this honourable House that early next week, that document will be on what is called the UPR Extranet - it is not called the internet, it is called the Extranet - so that the Hon. Members of the House can access it at any time without any difficulty whatsoever. We really have nothing to hide.",

The invitation to Navanetham Pillay was not the result of the Resolution; it had nothing whatever to do with the Resolution. We had invited her in writing before that. Then, she accepted the invitation in principle and said that, in her view, to get the maximum benefit out of the visit, she should visit our country after the Report of the LLRC is available.

We did that.

A fresh dawn, a new opportunity filled with hope for the future, let us seize that with both hands and let us move forward. The Government of Sri Lanka is only too happy to reach out to you. Come in; do come in. We are not asking you to agree with us. We are not asking you to adopt any particular point of view. Come in; say your piece without fear or favour. But, do come in because we want it to be an inclusive process, not a top-down process, where we decide what we think is in the interest of the nation.",

He quoted sections of it. I want to tell this House categorically that at no time did President Rajapaksa, in any manner whatsoever, agree to any form of international intervention in this country. There is a reference to accountability. There is a reference to Sri Lankas obligations at international law and humanitarian law, but at all times, we will assert the primacy and the indispensability; the indispensability of local processes which are the only way to arrive at a solution to this question.",

What he means by the past that we are not supposed to dwell on is commitments made by himself, His Excellency the President and the Government in general. If his theory holds good, you could have had a meeting yesterday and agreed to do something today but you come today and say \"Oh! That was in the past. Do not dwell on the past although I did give that assurance\".

We take that as a responsible response from the Government today to mean that you are now responsibly saying that those promises do not mean a thing to you. You have very clearly articulated your position in this House today. When specific instances were quoted and read out verbatim, all you have to say is: forget them.

What she purportedly meant was that the construction of roads will not indicate that the region has been developed, that the opening up of roads would not satisfy the hunger of the people there. This view will have to be taken serious note of. We cannot allow the people who were caught up in the clutches of the dreadful war that lasted for more than 30 long years to suffer any longer, even after the end of the war. I am saying this because the people should fully enjoy the benefits of the development activities of the Government. These benefits should go straight down to the people without being grabbed by middlemen or contractors engaged in road development activities.",

Conflicts of this nature cannot be solved very soon. What you have done so far is remarkable and Sri Lankas phenomenal economic growth of 8 per cent is a clear result of that, President Michel said.

The Hon. Chelvanayakam faced much trouble at that time; they were stoned. They had what were called \"ahimsa Satyagrahas\". One of my Friends, Mr. Mashoor Moulana, was thrown into the Beira Lake.
