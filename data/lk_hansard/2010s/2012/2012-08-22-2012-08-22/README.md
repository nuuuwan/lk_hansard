,

, NATIONAL IMPORTANCE OF RECONCILIATION, HARMONY AND GOODWILL AMONGST DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you Mr. Speaker. If I might read my Adjournment Motion which I move today -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Order, please! Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

, [ ] .

, , [ ] . Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair. [2.17 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees. I move,

"Whereas more than three years have lapsed since the conclusion of the war on 19th May 2009 during the course of which grave violations of international human rights laws and international humanitarian laws occurred. And whereas since the conclusion of the war the following significant events have occurred:-

(I) The joint statement issued by his Excellency the President on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka and the Secretary General on behalf of the United Nations, on the conclusion of the Secretary General's visit to Sri Lanka on 23rd May 2009 which inter-alia stated as follows: (i) "Sri Lanka reiterated its strongest commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, in keeping with international human rights standards and Sri Lanka's international obligations. The Secretary General underlined the importance of an accountability process for addressing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. The Government will take measures to address those grievances".

(ii) President Rajapakse and the Secretary General agreed that addressing the aspirations and grievances of all communities and working towards a lasting political solution was fundamental to ensuring long term socio-economic development. President Rajapakse expressed his firm resolve to proceed with the implementation of the 13th Amendment as well as to begin a broader dialogue with all parties, including the Tamil parties, in the new circumstances, to further enhance this process to bring about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka.

(II) The appointment by the Secretary General of a Panel of Experts on 22 June 2010 to advise him on the implementation of the joint commitment included in the statement issued by the President of Sri Lanka and the Secretary General at the conclusion of the Secretary General's visit to Sri Lanka on 23rd March 2009. In the joint statement the Secretary General 'underlined the importance of an accountability process' and the Government of Sri Lanka agreed that it 'will take measures to address those grievances'. The Panel of Experts in their Report released on 31st March 2011, stated inter-alia in their conclusions 'The final stages and aftermath of the war in Sri Lanka were characterized by a wide range of violations by both the Government of Sri Lanka and the L.T.T.E. of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, some even amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity.

1255 1256

More than 300,000 people became the victims of the reckless disregard for international norms by the warring parties. Indeed, the conduct of the war by them represented a grave assault on the entire regime of international law designed to protect individual dignity during both war and peace. The victory of one side has emboldened some to believe that these rules may now be disregarded in the cause of fighting terrorism' (para 258).

(III) The appointment by the President of Sri Lanka of the Commission of Inquiry on Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation (L.L.R.C.) on 15th May 2010 which submitted its report on 15th November 2011. The recommendations contained in the said report inter-alia included the need to credibly investigate widespread allegations of extra judicial killings and enforced disappearances,demilitarize the north of Sri Lanka, implement impartial land dispute resolution mechanisms, reevaluate detention policies, strengthen formerly independent civil institutions, reach a political settlement involving devolution of power to the provinces, promote and protect the right of freedom of expression for all, and enact rule of law reforms.

(IV) The adoption of a resolution by the United Nations Human Rights Council at its 19th session on 22nd March 2012, which inter alia noted (i) that the LLRC report does not adequately address serious allegations of violations of international law

(ii) called on the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the constructive recommendations in the LLRC report and take all necessary additional steps to fulfil its relevant legal obligations and commitment to initiate credible and independent actions to ensure justice, equality, accountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans. (iii) requests that the Government of Sri Lanka present a comprehensive action plan as expeditiously as possible detailing the steps the Government has taken and will take

to implement the LLRC recommendations and also to address alleged violations of international law and also requests the High Commissioner for Human Rights to present a report to the Council at its twenty second session due to be held in March 2013.

(V) The release by the Government of Sri Lanka of a National Plan of Action to implement the recommendations of the LLRC. This Action Plan has not been formulated after due consultation with Parliament or the democratically elected representatives of the affected people.

It is in this background that this whole issue in its totality which is directly linked to genuine reconciliation, goodwill and harmony amongst the different peoples that constitute the Sri Lankan polity becomes an issue of urgent national importance that needs to be kept under the close and continuous scrutiny of the countrys democratically elected supreme legislature."

That, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, is my Adjournment Motion and I might now, Sir, deal with some aspects of this Motion with your permission.

In the first instance, I would like to state that I would first deal with some actions of this Action Plan which has been released to the public. It is not my intention to discourage those who are tasked with the implementation of this Plan or to say or do anything that would result in the Plan not being implemented. But, if there are

deficiencies in the Plan, I think we owe a duty to point out those deficiencies and if we think that there are corrections that need to be made in regard to the manner of its implementation, I think it is the correct thing for us to bring that to the notice of the Government, particularly to the notice of Parliament, to ensure that the objective of the Resolution passed by the United Nations at its Human Rights Council is fulfilled. In order to ensure harmony, certain things need to be done; in order to ensure reconciliation, certain things need to be done and those things need to be incorporated in an Action Plan and implemented. Sir, I will deal with some aspects of this Action Plan - not with all of them, but with some aspects. One of them talks of appointing a special Commission of Investigation to investigate alleged disappearances and provide materials to the Attorney-General on that question. Very unfortunately the action contemplated does not seem to indicate that a Special Commissioner would be appointed. The Action Plan contemplates some other action which is not the same as a Special Commissioner being appointed with special powers and with special investigators to deal with this question.

The second matter relates to appointing an independent committee to monitor and examine detention and arrest of persons taken into custody. Here again, an Advisory Committee is not being appointed and what is being contemplated is a totally different type of action, which would not be the same as the appointment of an Advisory Committee, as recommended by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission.

Then, we come to the very grave question of the implementation of the recommendations of past Commissions of Inquiry, particularly in regard to the assassination of five students in Trincomalee and 17 aid-workers in Mutur. Here again, I am sorry to state in regard to these horrendous crimes where five innocent students were massacred on the seafront in Trincomalee while they were just standing and talking to each other and 17 aid-workers who were trapped in Muttur were massacred; they were all young people from middle-class Tamil families in Trincomalee. There was a Commission of Inquiry appointed; the Commission of Inquiry sat and recorded evidence. The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons who were appointed to oversee the work of the Commission of Inquiry withdrew from the country stating that the Sri Lankan Government did not have the will or the commitment to investigate grave human rights violations in keeping with international standards because they were not happy with the way in which inquires were being conducted in regard to these two horrendous crimes. As a matter of fact, when the investigations were proceeding, - I think at one stage evidence were being recorded through videoconferencing and suddenly as a result of some action taken by two gentlemen who appeared on behalf of the suspects before the Commission of Inquiry - directions were issued to the Commission of Inquiry which resulted in the

1257 1258

[ . ]

2012 22

Commission of Inquiry not proceeding with the recording of evidence through videoconferencing and consequently I think the proceedings stalled and eventually it came to an end. Reports of some sort were supposed to have been submitted to the President but they have not been made public and we do not know what the reports contain and crimes of this nature cannot go away. Then truth needs to be ascertained and this has now become an international issue. I think the international community is very concerned that the truth in regard to these two horrendous crimes, where innocent young boys were massacred for no reason must be ascertained and must be known to the world. I do not think the action contemplated as per the Action Plan reveals any commitment on the part of those entrusted with this responsibility of asserting the truth as required.

Then, of course, there are other matters that I would like to mention. I would not be too long, Sir, in regard to these matters because I do not have much time. The recommendations in the Action Plan contemplate restoration of independent civil institutions: there is the reference to the Police Commission; there is the reference to the Public Service Commission. All that the Action Plan says is that such independent institutions have already been installed. We know that that cannot be so because the Constitutional Council, which was responsible for establishing those institutions or recommending the appointments that must be made to those institutions, on which recommendations the President was obliged to act, does not exist any longer and that has been replaced by a totally different procedure. So, I do not think it can be claimed by anyone that these independent civil institutions had been established. As far as the Police Commission and the Public Service Commission are concerned, it actually does not prevail. As a matter of fact, one of the concerns we have at the present Provincial Council Elections we are facing is that we have no independent Elections Commission, which was appointed by the Constitutional Council sometime ago. We have to depend upon an Election Commission, in the independence of which I do not think it can be said that everyone has confidence. So, these are some of the matters I wish to raise. I can deal with more such issues but that will result in my taking a lot of time.

So, Sir, as far as this Action Plan is concerned, all that I can say is that, on a reading of the Plan, on studying the Plan, one finds that it is highly generalized, tentative and not result-oriented. The Executive President, the Government and its own various departments and agencies are the primary cause for the situation that constitutes the foundation for the partiality, the inequality and the injustice that the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission sought to address. It is gravely questionable whether these same agencies could provide adequate redress on the basis of the truth being ascertained. These various agencies, in my respectful submission, have a vested interest in ensuring that the

truth is not ascertained because they have to exculpate themselves from blame. Arrangements lack transparency, impartiality and independence. The arrangements are indicative of a desire to continue to perpetuate the past rather than initiate innovative action to provide effective change and redress and bring about goodwill and reconciliation. The Action Plan has not been formulated after due consultation with Parliament and the democratically-elected Representatives of the affected people. The Action Plan is more focused on cover-up and concealment rather than transparency and exposure and hence lacks credibility and legitimacy. These are my observations, Sir. I think it is our duty to make these observations before it is too late because I think if something that is being done is of a highly questionable nature, we have a duty to bring that to light.

The Action Plan also talks about reversal of lands in Sampur in Trincomalee and Valikamam in Jaffna in the North to the people to whom those lands belonged. But, very unfortunately, that has not been done in regard to lands both in Valikaamam and Sampur. The parties went to the Supreme Court by way of Fundamental Rights applications. The Attorney-General who appeared on behalf of the Government gave an assurance to the court that these people will be resettled. Those assurances are now being violated; they are not being complied with. I raised the matter in Parliament on a number of occasions, particularly in regard to Sampur and the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, replying on behalf of the Government on the 21st October, 2011, said that apart from the land required for the coal power plant, all other persons could return to their lands. But, they are not being permitted to do so. As a matter of fact, in recent times army personnel have been going to these camps, threatening the people and telling them that they must leave the camps and go to the lands which are pointed out to them as being the lands that will be given to them in lieu of the lands in Sampur. In fact, this morning I got information that a very senior military official was to go to the camps and repeat this threat, which has been uttered to the people in the course of the last few days by more junior officials in that area. So, it is an extremely serious situation. As far as Sampur is concerned, 1,486 families are affected. Shall we put the number at 1,500? They owned in this area 2,795 acres of land. I was given the particulars. Some of them owned lands on deeds which are more than 100 years old; some of them owned lands on permits given to them several decades ago, several years ago. Now, in place of these 2,795 acres of land, which these people owned on their own, they are to be given 20 perches each and if each family is given 20 perches, the total extent of land given to these people will be not more than 180 acres. You are taking away 2,795 acres of land and giving these people in return only 180 acres. Is this fair? How can you do this? I mean, this is criminal!

Now, what is happening? I was told that there was a proposal to convert this area into a heavy industrial zone.

1259 1260

An Australian company by the name of Mitchell Consortium was supposed to be investing in this area. I have it on good authority that Mitchell Consortium is no longer interested in coming here, that they will not come here, that they have taken a very firm decision that they will not come and invest in this land because they know under what circumstances this land is being taken. They have come to know and they have abandoned the proposal. There was a Cabinet Memorandum which approved the land being given to Mitchell Consortium.

Now, I am told that a private company in Sri Lanka - I am sorry to state with very high connections - is trying to take this land over and commence a large industrial estate on this land, depriving these poor people who have lived there for generations and centuries, of this land. They cultivate there; they live there; they derive their livelihood from these lands and these people are to be given 20 perches each in areas which are not habitable, in areas where they cannot carry on their occupation. What do they do for a living? Nobody seems to be concerned. Why are you treating us so callously? You are talking of reconciliation. The LLRC has given its recommendation with regard to the lands in Sampur and Valikamam. I went to Valikamam. The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah comes from that area. I saw the fence, a huge fence, being erected dividing the land into two and taking over a substantial part of the land and annexing it to the Palaly Airport and people have been told, "You can come and live on the other land". When I drove up there, a woman came running up to me. She saw me; she probably recognized me. She said, Sir, they want me to live here and they are going to be there. Can I live here? How can I live here? Will I be safe? I will not be safe. Something might happen to me. How can I live here? This is the trauma to which our people are being subjected. This is the suffering, the agony that we have to go through.

You are talking in terms of reconciliation. Now, I am told that houses are being constructed for these people in Sampur on the lands that have been given to them, 20 perches each. Rupees 500,000 is being spent on constructing a house. The houses are substandard houses, not worth even Rs. 200,000. They are being constructed by some military personnel or persons linked to military personnel. That is becoming an exercise to make money. People are making money, people are enriching themselves and these poor people are suffering. The agony of these people is being exploited by these forces to make money. How can you do this type of thing? I mean, this is cruel, this is wicked. This is not merely illegal, this is utterly immoral and I would earnestly request the Government, if you want reconciliation, if you want harmony, if you want peace in this country, start by returning the land in Valikamam to the people to whom those lands belong and by returning the land in Sampur to the people to whom those lands belong. The Hon. Basil

Rajapaksa gave me an assurance in this House on the 21st of October, 2011. It is recorded in Hansard. He said that people can go back to their lands except the land required for the coal power plant and only seven families will be affected by that project, nobody else. But, then that has not been implemented. What is more? The people have been deprived of food because they are not going to the lands to which they were asked to go. For the last six months, food supplied under the World Food Programme has not been made available to these people and they are compelled to starve because they are not carrying out your directions. Sir, if this is the way you are thinking to bring about reconciliation, harmony and goodwill amongst the people, I think you are sadly mistaken; you are not going to succeed in this effort. If you want to really make a start by implementing a programme for genuine reconciliation, the first thing you must do is to restore the land in Valikamam to the people in Valikamam and restore the land in Sampur to the people in Sampur. Until that happens, I am afraid you will not succeed.

Now, Sir, we are talking about the past. While these things are still being perpetuated, new things are happening in our areas. We have the famous Kanniya Hot Wells in Trincomalee. I have a letter with me but I will not read it out because it is a long letter. I gave this to the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa on the 20th of July, 2009. I will table* this letter, Sir, and I would be grateful if it is included in Hansard, at the end of my speech.

This pertains to seven hot wells in Trincomalee. It has a history behind it and it is linked to the Koneswaram Temple. Ravana dug seven places in Kanniya with his dagger to perform the 31st Day rites of his mother and hot water of different temperatures spouted from the seven different springs and ever since then, over the past several centuries, the Hindus have been performing their 31st Day rites at this particular site. I have gone there from the time I was a child. Suddenly, a monk has descended to the place and has taken over the property because he wants to carry out a commercial venture. A large number of people outside Trincomalee come there to bathe. They have heard about this place. I remember when the late J.R. Jayewardene was the President, some years ago in the late '70s, early '80s, a similar thing happened in Kanniya. He was holidaying in Nuwara Eliya. I heard about it and telephoned him. I told him, Sir, such a thing is happening. You must not permit this. This is wrong. He asked me, Sampanthan, where are you? I said, I am in Trincomalee. He said, Tomorrow morning the SP of Trincomalee will report to you. The SP of Trincomalee came, saw me and told me, We have asked that monk to go away. He is no longer there. Do not worry. The monk was sent away. They want to convert

that place into a place of commercial activity and make money and our people are being prevented from going there and performing their 31st Day rites. If I die tomorrow, my family will not be able to perform my rites at that place which we have been doing for centuries; and, you want reconciliation. Please do not think I am confronting you. We do not want confrontation. But, can you ever justify these things? I have had no reply to this letter. Unfortunately, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa has not been able to attend to it. I do not know whether it is beyond his power, because after all the assurance he gave me in Parliament, he is unable to ensure its compliance.

Then, there is a famous temple called, the Agasthyar Sthapanam, a Sivan Temple of Lord Shiva in Kanguvelli, south of Trincomalee. That temple was damaged. The Sivalingam was destroyed, the Pillaiyar was destroyed. I met the President at that time; I spoke to him personally. I sent him a letter in regard to the matter on the 29th of May, 2010. I have had no response. People cannot go there to that temple. People go there and perform several rites. It is a famous Sivan Temple over 2,500 years old. Agasthiyar was a Munivar. He was a Saint. The belief is that he was ordained by Lord Shiva to go and establish a Shiva Temple in that area and that over 2,500 years ago, he came there and established that temple. People cannot go there to worship. The Sivalingam has been destroyed.

Eight hundred acres of paddy land in close proximity to the temple, in a place called Paddukadu owned by Tamil farmers from Kanguvelli, Pulliaddicholai, Mallikaitheevu, Paddithidal, Menkamam, Bharathipuram, Kiliveddy, Manalchenai, Periyavelli and the Muslim farmers of Mutur and 20 acres of land owned by the Temple Agasthiyar Sthapanam has been taken over by some young persons from the majority community and they are cultivating that land by force. We have complained to the police. We have complained to the Provincial Land Commissioner. No action is being taken; nothing is being done. The Kanguvelli Tank bed is being cultivated by force by some young persons from the majority community. There is no law and order in this country. Is this the way you want to bring about reconciliation? Is this the way you want to bring about goodwill and harmony? I table* this second letter, Sir, which I have sent to the President on the 29th of May, 2010 and I request that it be included at the end of my speech in the Hansard.

I will not refer to everything that is happening because I will have to probably speak till midnight if I do that. But, maybe some of my other Friends who will speak after me will make reference to some of the matters. But, I would refer to just one other matter.

There are several villages in Mullaitivu, Pudumathalan, Mullivaikal West, Mullivaikal East, Ampalavanpokkanai, Valaignarmadam, Anandapuram and Keppapulavu, - all these are coastal areas - where people have been living for generations fishing and carrying on their living. Some people there have different ideas about that territory. They have been asked to go to a place called Kompavil, seven to eight kilometres away from the sea. How can a fisherman live seven to eight kilometres away from the sea, Sir? Can he carry on his occupation by living seven to eight kilometres away from the sea? They are being compelled to go. They have been told, You will have to go. You cannot say, no. You have no choice in the matter. We have chosen a place for you and their land is being taken over and they have been sent there. I am told that steps are being taken to settle fisherfolk from the majority community in this area.

How can you permit this type of thing? Are you going to bring about harmony in this country by doing this type of thing? These are the questions we want to ask you. And, if you think by formulating some Action Plan and trying to show the world that you are doing something,- while you are not doing anything proper in regard to what has happened, new things are happening which are creating further disharmony and further room for conflict and further ill will amongst people - then I am sorry, we are not getting about things the right way. All this indicates that there are deliberate efforts by some people to change the demographic composition of some areas in the North and the East; change the linguistic religious and cultural identity of areas in the North and the East and these activities are being pursued with a vigour that is suggestive of a determination to make these things a fait accompli before too long. Before you think in terms of any political solution or arrive at any political solution, the demographic composition of the North and the East would have been so altered and the linguistic, cultural and religious identity of certain areas would have been so altered then, there will be no conflict and no need for a political solution. Is that the agenda you are pursuing? We want to know. Either you must stop these things or you must say that these things are not happening. You can come with us and we will show you these that things are happening. So, you must reverse that and put it right or you must accept that you are having an agenda which should be implemented. I am not saying that everyone of you, but certainly we are inclined to the view that there are at least some within the Government with whose blessings these things are being done and that these things cannot be done in this way if there are no blessings whatever from at least someone within the Government.

Reconciliation is dependent not merely on implementation of Recommendations of the LLRC but also on terminating and reversing actions which have been disapproved and censured by the LLRC. Repetition of similar actions would be tantamount to making a mockery of the LLRC Recommendations. LLRC is

1263 1264

recommending some remedial action in regard to what happened in the past. But, you are going on with vigour repeating the same actions, multiplying your past actions with a purpose of taking control. I mean, can you permit this to happen? That will only revive the causes of disaffection and the conflict and will not bring about any goodwill and harmony amongst the people. Of course, you are now trying to implement the LLRC Recommendations. We also know that the interim recommendations of the LLRC were not implemented at the time the LLRC came up with their Final Report and that in their final Report, the LLRC commented about the fact that their interim recommendations were not implemented.

I would like to say few words on the question of a political solution because that has also been referred to by the LLRC in its Report and we hear much talk about a home-grown solution. Undoubtedly, a home-grown solution would be the best thing. But, at the same time, a talk of a home-grown solution should not become an excuse for not finding a solution. I shall demonstrate that efforts at evolving a home-grown solution have been numerous in the past. The Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact was not grown in Norway or India. It was grown in Sri Lanka. The Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact was very much a home-grown product. The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution is entirely home-grown and home-made. Extensive discussions took place between the Sri Lankan Government and the TULF representing the Tamil people in July and August in 1986. We talked for at least 15 days each month. On the Government side, there was the President J.R. Jayewardene, Minister Ronnie de Mel, Minister Lalith Athulath Mudali, Minister Gamini Dissanayake, Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, Hon.A.C.S. Hameed, Hon. K.W. Devanayagam. On the TULF side, there was A. Amirthalingam, M. Sivasithamparam, Neelan Thiruchelvam, V. Anandasangaree, V. Yogeswaran, Joseph Pararajasingham and myself. We discussed nine drafts in July and August 1986. Mr. Felix Dias Abeysinghe, retired Commissioner of Elections, was the Secretary of that Committee. The papers must be available in the Presidential Secretariat or in some office. That was also a home-grown solution. It had the approval of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka; it had the approval of the legislature of this country; it was passed by a two-thirds majority. How can you say that it was not home-grown? It was home-grown. It was very much a product of this country; an effort by people in this country.

Of course, in the post-July 1983 period, after the riots, Sri Lanka accepted Indias good offices to resolve the conflict amicably. Indias good offices were continued. India is our closest neighbour not merely geographically but culturally also. The Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement of 29th July, 1987 was a part of that process. Of course, our

discussions with regard to the Thirteenth Amendment preceded the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement. The Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement being signed does not make the Thirteenth Amendment any less a home-grown solution. The Thirteenth Amendment was the outcome of discussions that took place between the Government of Sri Lanka and the TULF, the Party that represented the Tamil people. The TULF had strong reservations about the Thirteenth Amendment. After all, the Thirteenth Amendment was eventually formulated by the Sri Lankan Government, not by both sides and our reservations continue. We have been clamouring for improvements to the Thirteenth Amendment. We want the Thirteenth Amendment formulated so as to make the solution more acceptable. The international community has played a role; India has played a role to bring about some finality to make the solution reasonably acceptable to all sides and inevitably India being our closest neighbour and whose good offices Sri Lanka accepted, has played the most prominent and important role in regard to the matter. The rest of the international community too has played a role. This role played by the international community and by India have been accepted by the Sri Lankan Government. I do not think that can be a cause for complaint. I propose, Sir, to deal with the role played by India and the international community in regard to the evolution of an acceptable political solution and I think I can best do it by referring to some of the statements that were made in the course of this long process, which will throw much light on this whole question. It must be remembered that both India and the rest of the international community played a role for the simple reason that we were not able to solve this problem ourselves.

I will particularly deal with, Sir, the period commencing 2006 when President Rajapaksa assumed office. In November, 2006, Foreign Secretary, Shivshankar Menon, arrived in Sri Lanka and met with President Rajapaksa. He told President Mahinda Rajapaksa, that "India looks forward to an early 'comprehensive political settlement' of the ethnic issue. It must take into account the aspirations of all sections, including Tamils". At his meeting with Menon, President Rajapaksa gave details of the work being done by the All-Party Conference and the Multi-ethnic Committee of Experts to provide a framework for the resolution of the ethnic problem. President Mahinda Rajapaksa gave Mr. Menon a report in regard to the work of the APRC and the Multi-Ethnic Committee of Experts.

Then, again in October 2008, Minister Basil Rajapaksa went across to India, consequent to some issues being raised pertaining to the war, and this is what the statement issued on that occasion states, I quote:

Both sides discussed the need to move towards a peacefully negotiated political settlement in the island including the North. Both sides agreed that terrorism should be countered with resolve. The Indian side called for implementation of the Thirteenth

1265 1266

2012 22

Amendment and greater devolution of powers to the provinces. Mr. Basil Rajapaksa emphasized that the President of Sri Lanka and his Government were firmly committed to a political process that would lead to a sustainable solution.

That was the position in November, 2008. And, Sir, in July, 2009, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met with President Mahinda Rajapaksha at Shram-el-Sheikh in Egypt in the course of a conference. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told the Rajya Sabha that the bulk of the meeting was focussed on the plight of Sri Lankan Tamils. We are deeply concerned. I explained to him (Rajapaksa) that we have legitimate concern about the welfare of Sri Lankan Tamils. It has a bearing on Sri Lankas relations with India. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also informed President Rajapaksha that Colombo has to create conditions for meeting legitimate political aspirations of the Tamils under the devolution package. That was in July, 2009. Then, we had the occasion when our Minister of External Affairs, (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, went to India and that was in May, 2011. He visited India from 15th to 17th of May, 2011. The press release issued stated, I quote:

Both sides agreed that the end of armed conflict in Sri Lanka created a historic opportunity to address all outstanding issues in a spirit of understanding and mutual accommodation imbued with political vision to work towards genuine national reconciliation.

In this context, the External Affairs Minister of Sri Lanka affirmed his Governments commitment to ensuring expeditious and concrete progress in the ongoing dialogue between the Government of Sri Lanka and representatives of Tami parties.

A devolution package building upon the 13th Amendment would contribute towards creating the necessary conditions for such reconciliation."

That was your own statement made on the occasion of your visit to India.

Then, in June 2011, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had this to say in the course of a question and answer session. He was asked a question about Indias neighbourhood. His answer was, I quote:

"You have a situation in Sri Lanka. The decimation of the LTTE was something which is good. But the Tamil problem does not disappear, with the defeat of the LTTE. The Tamil population has legitimate grievances. They feel they are reduced to

second-class citizens. And our emphasis has been to persuade the Sri Lankan Government that we must move towards a new system of institutional reforms, where the Tamil people will have a feeling that they are equal citizens of Sri Lanka, and they

can lead a life of dignity and self-respect. It is not easy. Within Sri Lankas population, there are hotheads. The Sinahala-chauvinism is a reality. But we have to find a difficult balance because what happens in Sri Lanka has a domestic dimension also.

The Tamil Nadu Government and assembly have often shown great worry about what is happening. Our challenge is to keep the Tamil Nadu Government on our side. I have good cooperation with Jayalalithaa-ji. I raised this matter with her the very

first time. What she asked of me was moderate. Whatever the resolutions that were passed in the assembly, I found her fully conscious of the complexities and the realities of managing this relationship".

India is concerned. Foreign Minister S.M. Krishna made a Suo Motu Statement in the Lok Sabha on the 4th of August, 2011 and this is what he had to say, I quote:

"The Government has also articulated its position that the end of the armed conflict in Sri Lanka created a historic opportunity to address all outstanding issues relating to minority communities in Sri Lanka including Tamils. The Joint Press Release of May 17, 2011 states that all such outstanding issues had to be settled in a spirit of understanding and mutual accommodation imbued with political vision to work towards genuine national reconciliation. The External Affairs Minister of Sri Lanka affirmed his Governments commitment to ensuring expeditious and concrete progress in the ongoing dialogue between the Government of Sri Lanka and representatives of Tamil parties and that a devolution package, building upon the 13th Amendment, would contribute towards creating the necessary conditions for such reconciliation.

The Prime Minister observed recently that 'the Tamil population in Sri Lanka had legitimate grievances and our emphasis had been to persuade the Sri Lankan Government that we must move towards a new system of institutional reforms where the Tamil people will have a feeling that they are equal citizens of Sri Lanka and they can lead a life of dignity and self-respect. That is our outlook towards this issue'."

When the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission issued their Report, an official spokesman on behalf of the Government of India made a statement in regard to that Report. And, this is what he said in that Statement that was made on December 25th, 2011. I quote:

"In this context, we have been assured by the Government of Sri Lanka on several occasions in the past, of its commitment towards pursuit of a political process, through a broader dialogue with all parties, including the Tamil National Alliance leading to the full implementation of the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution, and to go beyond so as to achieve meaningful devolution of powers and genuine national reconciliation. We hope that the Government of Sri Lanka recognizing the critical importance of this issue acts decisively and with vision in this regard. We will remain engaged with them through this process and offer our support in the spirit of partnership.

We have also noted the Government of Sri Lankas intention to set up a mechanism to carry out further investigations relating to instances of alleged human rights violations and incidents involving loss of civilian life. It is important to ensure that an independent and credible mechanism is put in place to investigate allegations of human rights violations, as brought out by the LLRC, in a time-bound manner.

Recently, the Foreign Minister of India was here. There was a statement made by him in the presence of the Minister of External Affairs of Sri Lanka. The Foreign

1267 1268

Minister was here from the 16th to 19th January, 2012. This is what was contained in the statement. India is committed to the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. It is our hope that the vision and leadership that resulted in an end to armed conflict will now be employed in the quest for a genuine political reconciliation. We look forward to progress in the ongoing dialogue process in order to address this issue in a timely manner. We will continue to work with the Government of Sri Lanka and help in whatever way we can to take the process forward in a spirit of partnership and cooperation. We have noted the many constructive recommendations contained in the recently released report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, LLRC. These recommendations when implemented would mark a major step forward in the process of genuine national reconciliation to which the Sri Lankan Government is committed. Sri Lanka must seize the opportunity. The Government of Sri Lanka has on many occasions conveyed to us its commitment to move towards a political settlement based upon the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution and building on it so as to achieve meaningful devolution of powers. We look forward to an expeditious and constructive approach to the dialogue process. We believe the continuation of the dialogue between the Government and the TNA would pave the way for a political settlement including under the rubric of the Parliamentary Select Committee. I discussed this matter with His Excellency the President this morning. The President assured me that he stands by his commitment to pursuing the Thirteenth Amendment Plus approach.

This is what the Indian Government has always been saying. Even when India had to make a decision in regard to what it would do at Geneva, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made a statement in regard to that matter in the Lok Sabha and it was reported in "The Hindu" of 20th March, 2012. It states, I quote:

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced on Monday that India was inclined to vote in favour of a resolution on promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka at the ongoing 19th session of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva."

He went on to say and this is important:

That, we hope, will advance our objective, namely the achievement of the future for the Tamil community in Sri Lanka that is marked by equality, dignity, justice and self-respect.

So, the achievement of the objective was one of the factors that influenced India to take the decision to vote in favour of the Resolution at the Human Rights Council. It further states:

India had emphasized to the Sri Lankan Government that there should be a genuine process of reconciliation to address the grievances

of the ethnic Tamils and implement the recommendations of a high-level committee, whose report was tabled in that Nations Parliament.

For lasting peace, India has asked the Sri Lankan Government to stand by its commitment to broaden the dialogue with political parties including the Tamil National Alliance, to achieve a forward looking and meaningful devolution of power and genuine national reconciliation, Dr. Singh said.

I think on the next day, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wrote to President Rajapaksa to explain his position in regard to the decision taken to vote for the Resolution. This is what he said. I quote:

India, he said, spared no effort and [was] successful in introducing an element of balance in the language of the resolution.

It further went on to state:

The Prime Ministers letter reiterates Indias conviction that a meaningful devolution package, building upon the 13th Amendment would lead towards a lasting political settlement [of ].all outstanding issues, in particular the grievances of the Tamil community in Sri Lanka.and create [a] condition in which all citizens of Sri Lanka, irrespective of their ethnicity, can find justice, dignity, equality and self-respect.

So, India has been very persistent in this matter and I think there was a statement made more recently, in June 2012, where again this matter had been raised, where the Prime Minister met with the President of Sri Lanka, President Mahinda Rajapaksa on the sidelines of the Conference of the UN.

An article appeared in The New Sunday Express of 24th June, 2012 which states, I quote:

The Prime Minister once again underlined the great importance we attach in India to the ability of the Tamil people to lead a life of dignity and as equal citizens of that country, Indian Foreign Secretary Ranjan Mathai told reporters at Rio de Janeiro..

It is not the sidelines of the UN Conference but the Conference held by the UN at Rio de Janeiro in regard to certain issues.

So, this is the position. I would read Sir, finally in regard to the Indian position, the interview given by Shivshankar Menon, the National Security Adviser when he came to Sri Lanka in June this year. I quote from an article that appeared in The Hindu of 30th June, 2012:

The hopes of Tamils could only be accommodated through a political process. This was an internal political process. We have to also look at that. It is a process that has ramifications for all of us. And it is not something that started today or yesterday or a few years ago.

It started 60 years ago and India knows about it. It states further, I quote:

I have told you what we would like: a united Sri Lanka, within which all communities feel they are in control of their own destiny, and they are satisfied.

1269 1270

[ . ]

2012 22

So, you see, Sir, that is the position of India in regard to a political solution. India is a country which has been committed to the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka beyond question. As one who has interacted very closely, I can say for certain that India is a country which has absolutely no reservations, no second thoughts in regard to that matter they value at the most. But, at the same time, it is a country which feels that the Tamils in Sri Lanka must have their place as equal citizens in this country. Otherwise, it is not good for the Tamils; it is not good for the country. Having said that Sir, I would like to read what the Co-Chairs had to say in 2006 when they were still functional in Sri Lanka. This is the statement made by the Co-Chairs on 30th of May 2006. I quote:

It must show that it is ready to make the dramatic political changes to bring about a new system of governance which will enhance the rights of all Sri Lankans, including the Muslims. The international community will support such steps: failure to take such steps will diminish international support.

The Co-chairs went on to say, I quote:

The Tamil and Muslim peoples of Sri Lanka have justified and substantial grievances that have not yet been adequately addressed.

Who were the Co-chairs? Norway, the EU, America and Japan; the EU representing all the European countries, Japan, Norway and America and that is what the Co-chairs said.

Now, going further, Sir, I would like to read to you what the Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs at that point of time, Mr. Richard A. Boucher, said in the course of an interview he gave to the press in Sri Lanka on the 01st of June, 2006 during one of his visits, Mr. Boucher had said, I quote:

"We also think the government should provide a positive vision to Tamils and Muslims of a future Sri Lanka where their legitimate grievances are addressed and their security assured. President Rajapaksa has spoken of "maximum devolution." Previous negotiations have agreed on "internal self-determination" within a federal framework. However the idea is expressed, it could offer hope to many in the North and East that they will have control over their own lives and destinies within a single nation of Sri Lanka.

The Assistant Secretary of State, Mr. Boucher, went on to say in the course of the same interview, I quote:

"Although we reject the methods that the Tamil Tigers have used, there are legitimate issues that are raised by the Tamil community and they have a very legitimate desire, as anybody would, to be able to control their own lives, to rule their own destinies and to govern themselves in their homeland, in the areas theyve traditionally inhabited.

He was asked a question, Sir, in regard to Sri Lanka's constitutional framework and a statement made by the Co-chairs. His answer was, I quote:

I dont know if I can elaborate much more than what was in the statement. When you look at the situation now and the forms of government and the way things are structured now and what it would take to involve the Tamil community politically

in a new arrangement, that does require a great deal of change. A radical change in terms of movement. Now thats a change that can be considered. A vision needs to be put out and needs to be elaborated by the parties themselves and then negotiated by the parties themselves.

But, whatever you call it, it is quite a different governing structure than what you have now and one that is designed to give an enhanced political role to all the people of Sri Lanka, particularly by taking into account the desires of the Tamils and the Muslims to have more control over their own destinies and their own areas. Sir, it is not merely the view of India and the Co-chairs but also the view of America. I mentioned these matters because I think these people tend to forget that all these things happened when they are not reminded of them.

I would now, Sir, look at what President Mahinda Rajapaksa himself had to say on 11th July 2006 when he addressed the inaugural Meeting of the APRC and the Multi-ethnic Experts' Committee he appointed. This is what he said. This is in perfect consonance with all that I have quoted as having been stated by the Prime Minister of India, as having been stated by our Ministers and Ministers in India, as having been stated by the Co-Chairs and as having been stated by the US Government, by its Assistant Secretary of State. Addressing the gathering, under the caption Unity, territorial Integrity and Sovereignty, this is what President Rajapaksa said. I quote:

The unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of our country must be preserved. This cannot be open to bargain. Our approach has been widely endorsed by the international community, notably India and the Co-chairs have clearly stated and have clearly ruled out any form of division of this country. Our objective must be to develop a just settlement within an undivided Sri Lanka. Each party represented here has its own solutions to the national question. We will discuss and synthesize these different approaches and develop our own Sri Lankan model. We must explore past attempts from the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact onwards. We must draw appropriate lessons from the experience of other countries. I will not impose a solution on the country. But, you will through your developments, through your deliberations provide a solution to the national question.

Further, the President, in his speech under the heading Devolution for the People by the People, said, I quote:

People in their own localities must take charge of their destiny and control their politico-economic environment. Central decision-making that allocates disproportionate resources has been an issue for a considerable time. In addition, it is axiomatic that devolution also needs to address issues relating to identity as well as security and socio-economic advancement without over-reliance on the Centre. In this regard, it is also important to address the question of regional minorities.

Then, Sir, under the heading Some Concluding Thoughts, this is what His Excellency the President had to say. I quote:

Any solution must be seen as one that stretches to the maximum possible devolution without sacrificing the sovereignty of the country. Given the ground situation, given

1271 1272

the background to the conflict, it therefore behoves on particularly the majority community to be proactive in striving for peace and there must be a demonstration of a well-stretched hand of accommodation. Any solution must therefore address these expectations as well. The role of the All Party Representative Committee, as well as the Panel of Experts is to fashion creative options and satisfy the minimum expectations that I had enumerated earlier as well as provide a comprehensive approach to the resolution of the national question.

This is what His Excellency the President said. What he had said is in perfect consonance with what had been said on behalf of the Indian Government, what had been said on behalf of the Co-Chairs and what had been said by the Assistant Secretary of State for the US.

The Panel of Experts has come up with its Report. There were 17 persons on that Panel of Experts. Twelve of them were Sinhalese, four of them were Tamils and there was one Muslim. Eleven of them, including six Sinhalese, the Tamils and the Muslim, have come up with a majority report. That is a home-grown solution recommended by the multi-ethnic Panel of Experts appointed by the President. So, what is your difficulty in adopting that Report in framing a solution?

Before I conclude, Sir, I must also refer to the fact that bilateral talks have taken place between the Government of Sri Lanka and the TNA, which commenced in January 2011 and went on till January 2012. No talks have taken place thereafter. The Government has also talked about a Parliamentary Select Committee. There has been a Resolution adopted in Parliament in regard to the Parliamentary Select Committee. We have not yet submitted our names to the Parliamentary Select Committee. But we very earnestly took part in the discussion at the bilateral talks. I think, Sir, I need to make a statement to make our position clear in regard to what our stand is in respect of the bilateral talks and the Parliamentary Select Committee.

At the conclusion of the General Elections in April 2010, the TNA made a public request to the Government to engage with the TNA in respect of two matters: the first was the evolution of a political solution to the national question and the second was the immediate and urgent concerns of the Tamil people in the aftermath of the war. Although the President agreed with the leader of the TNA in early November 2010 to set up two separate committees for same and despite names being forwarded for that purpose, only one committee was appointed on 5th January, 2011 consisting of representatives of the Government and representatives of the TNA for long-term reconciliation.

Thus, the bilateral talks between the Government and the TNA commenced on 10th January, 2011. The TNA tabled a document at the first meeting itself indicating its position on a political solution, which was in line with the Presidents own speech at the inaugural meeting of the

APRC and the Experts' Committee in July 2006. At the second meeting held on 3rd February 2011, the TNA submitted an outline of its proposed solution and at the third meeting held on 18th March 2011, at the invitation of the Government delegation, the TNA placed on the table a comprehensive set of proposals. The Government delegation requested for time to respond to the TNAs proposals and at every meeting thereafter apologized for not being able to respond and asked for further time. This went on for five months during which time seven meetings were held. Apart from making suggestions with regard to the Senate and strengthening the Local Government bodies, no response was made to the TNAs proposals, which were mainly on devolution of power to the provinces.

In this background, at the meeting held on 4th August 2011, the TNA refused to set a date for the next meeting until the Government fulfilled its obligation to respond to the TNAs proposals. Thereafter, the President invited the TNA leader for a meeting on the 2nd of September 2011, and the following agreements were reached at that meeting: One, in view of the inability of the Government to respond to the TNAs proposals, it was agreed to bring to the table five previous proposals and the Presidents Speech at the inaugural meeting of the APRC and the Experts' Committee. The bilateral talks will recommence and continue on the basis of these documents.

Two, once a measure of consensus is reached on substantive issues at the bilateral talks, that agreement will be taken before the Parliamentary Select Committee either as the Governments proposals or as the Government-TNA agreement. The TNA would join the Parliamentary Select Committee at that point of time.

Now, the five documents referred to are these. Since the Thirteenth Amendment was considered inadequate, Presidents after the enactment of the Thirteenth Amendment had taken various steps to improve on the Thirteenth Amendment. There was the Mangala Moonesinghe Select Committee during the time of President Premadasa. There were the other three Constitutional Proposals of 1995, 1997 and 2000 during the time of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. There was a speech made by the President at the inaugural meeting of the APRC and the Experts' Committee and there was the majority Experts' Committee Report, a Committee appointed by the President himself, President Mahinda Rajapaksa himself.

These were the documents that we wanted brought into the process in view of the failure on the part of the Government to deliver its own response. The bilateral talks recommenced on 16th September, 2011 and the above agreement was minuted and later confirmed at a subsequent meeting on 20th October, 2011. The TNA also engaged in the formulation of the Terms of Reference for the PSC and the Motion for same appears on the Order Book of Parliament No. 4 of 10th October, 2011. The Committee also identified the substantive issues that

1273 1274

[ . ]

2012 22

needed discussion, prepared a timetable for same and met on three dates in December, 2011 at which the devolution of land powers to the provinces was discussed. Thereafter, three dates, 17th, 18th and 19th of January 2012 were fixed to continue with the dialogue. The Government delegation failed to turn up for talks on 17th, 18th and 19th of January 2012, insisting that the TNA must first nominate its members to the PSC, contrary to the agreements previously reached. With this, the bilateral talks came to an end.

Thereafter two attempts were made to break the deadlock. The first was at a discussion held on the 27th January 2012 between the Leader of the TNA and three members of the Government delegation at which it was agreed that the TNA would nominate names to the PSC simultaneously with the recommencement of bilateral talks but that the PSC would be convened only after a consensus is reached at the bilateral talks. This agreement was reduced to writing and apparently given to the President for approval, which did not materialize. Thereafter, another attempt was made by the Leader of the Opposition in May 2012. After several rounds of discussions with the Government as well as the TNA, an agreed text was prepared as the Agenda for the PSC and placed in Parliament by the Leader of the Opposition on 24th of May, 2012. Although the Government was supposed to endorse the said Agenda, the response of the Leader of the House did not address any of the fundamental issues suggested by the Leader of the Opposition. I make this Statement, Sir, because I want to make it perfectly clear that as far as we are concerned, we are committed to evolving a final solution to this question.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M.Azwer to take the Chair?

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena - Minister of Agriculture) I propose that the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to. , ... .

, , ... . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER took the Chair.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, we are committed to finding a negotiated political solution within the framework of a united, undivided Sri Lanka. But, it must be an honourable solution; it must be a reasonable solution; it must be a workable solution; it must be a durable solution. I regret to state that despite our having made our position very clear at the bilateral talks both in this Parliament and outside, the Government has thus far not responded in a responsible way to what we have proposed. We have never said that we will not partake in the PSC. We have only stated that the PSC - Parliamentary Select Committee - must play a purposeful and meaningful role. It must be structured in such a way that it will achieve the desired objective. We cannot have the PSC merely to delay this process and to prolong this process nor can we have the PSC to enable some parties who will come before the PSC to scuttle the entire process. That we cannot cooperate with and that we cannot do. This is our position in regard to the matter and this is why we have not been able to partake in the PSC.

At this point, Sir, I think I must refer to what the President said when he gave an interview to The Hindu newspaper. Mr. N. Ram, the Editor of The Hindu newspaper interviewed him on the 29th of October, 2008, and Mr. Ram asked the President, You have repeatedly said your government is committed to a political solution of the Tamil question in Sri Lanka. What will be the contours of this political solution? President Mahinda Rajapaksa in his answer stated, I quote:

Let me reiterate that my government is firmly committed to a negotiated political solution based on devolution of power and ensuring the democratic, political, including linguistic, rights of all our Tamil brethren within an undivided Sri Lanka. I would like to see more devolution to the people. It must go to the grassroots level, because they must decide on their development work, what they need. We must allow them to participate in the whole process.

He was asked a further question, Mr. President, what is your vision of an ethnically harmonious Sri Lanka? His answer was, I quote:

"I am absolutely clear that Sri Lanka belongs to all its citizens - Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and others. The policy of my Government is to uphold the equality, liberty, fraternity, and development of people belonging to all ethnic, linguistic, and religious communities.

What is your problem in coming up with a political solution? This is what President Mahinda Rajapaksa says. But, one of your Ministers, the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka has given an interview where he has clearly stated his position. He states, The Governments path is based on three dimensional approach towards a solution - demilitarization, democratization and development. It is the old paradigms that believed in political solutions. The vocabulary even exists only within the NGOs and the INGOs and embassy officials of western nations. This

1275 1276

will ensure that the dream of Tamil Eelam of the TNA or the dreams of the Muslim parties will not be realized when our approach works.

We are not dreaming of a Tamil Eelam. We are not dreaming of anything. We are quite sensible in what we want. He further goes on to say: The Sinhala nationalist movement has finally taken the reins; others will simply have to fall in line. Finally, he says this Government is not under any pressure to sacrifice the rights of the Sinhala people, which is the policy you are following. Is it the policy of President Rajapaksa or the policy of the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka? How can you reconcile this statement of the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka with your stated objective of bringing about peace through the PSC? This is the question we have to pose.

The LLRC has also talked about a political solution. What has the LLRC said? I will read their Recommendations, but I will not read much of it because I do not have enough time. The LLRC Report states, I quote:

"All parties should recognize that the real issue of sharing power and participating in Government is the empowerment of the people and making the political leaders accountable to the people. This applies to Sri Lanka as a whole and includes the needs of citizens of all communities, Sinhala, Tamil. Muslim and others. The effective functioning of the democratic system which fulfils these needs, together with a consensual framework of devolution will, by virtue of attributes and institutions intrinsic to it, also provide the answer to the grievances of minorities.

The Commission wishes to underline the critical importance of making visible progress on the devolution issue, in order to ensure the success of any process of lasting and sustainable reconciliation. The Commission therefore recommends that the present opportunity be utilized to launch a good-faith effort to develop a consensus on devolution, building on what exists - both, for maximum possible devolution to the periphery especially at the grassroots level, as well as power sharing at the centre.

To this end, the Government must take the initiative to have a serious and structured dialogue with all political parties, and those representing the minorities in particular, based on a proposal containing the Governments own thinking on the form and content of the dialogue process envisaged. That dialogue must take place at a high political level and with adequate technical back-stopping."

The LLRC wants you to come up with your position. The LLRC strongly urges the Government to take the initiative and to come up with its own proposal. You are refusing to even respond to the proposal that we have submitted. So, this, Hon. Presiding Member, is the position and what we find most disappointing is that while nothing is happening on the ground in regard to either a political solution or the implementation of the constructive Recommendations of the LLRC, day in and day out, in the North and the East, various things are

happening on the ground which is weakening our position; strengthening the position of extremists. I do not think, Sir, that this can be allowed to go on.

Before I conclude, Hon. Presiding Member, I just want to say a few words on the accountability issue because that issue is one that will never go away. It will remain until there is honourable peace in Sri Lanka. We certainly do not want to confront anyone. I do not say this in a spirit of seeking revenge. No! Our people suffered immensely during the time of the war. Tens of thousands of Tamil civilians were killed. We know that. They were bombed aerially. Multi-barrel rocket launchers were used; heavy artillery fire was used even after commitments were made that they would not be used. As and when they happened, we raised all those issues in Parliament. We spoke about those matters in Parliament and they are all recorded in Hansard. There was no contradiction by the Government to any one of the statements that we made because the Government at that time realized that what we said was the truth, but we do not seek confrontation. At the same time, this cannot be swept under the carpet. You must not think that this can be swept under the carpet and can be forgotten about. It was a war fought without witnesses; the media was kept out; international media was kept out; NGOs were kept out; INGOs were kept out; the NGOs and the INGOs were asked to leave Vanni in September 2008; the ICRC was not given free access; the UN was not given free access; we, the Members of Parliament, could not go there; people died of starvation; people died due to lack of medicine; hospitals were attacked; relief centres were attacked; people lived under trees; they had no shelter. That was what happened.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, I may remind you that you have taken almost 90 minutes or more. How many more minutes you would like to take? Your Party has only 100 minutes.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I am finishing my speech, Sir. So, that was the position.

But, at the same time, there must be an honourable peace. If there is to be genuine reconciliation, genuine goodwill and harmony amongst the different ethnic groups, amongst the different peoples who inhabit this country, there must be an honourable peace. There must be peace which recognizes their equality in this country and their right to live as equal citizens, with a measure of self governance that will enable them to rule themselves in matters fundamental to them in the territories in which they live. Otherwise, there cannot be an honourable peace.

1277 1278

2012 22

So, I would urge, Sir, that if the Government is prepared to address the question of accountability together with other issues in a collective way, in a responsible way, and looks forward to our co-operation, our co-operation will certainly be forthcoming. But, we want an honourable peace and without an honourable peace, you cannot sweep the question of accountability under the carpet. That cannot happen.

I thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Presiding Member) No, I am only reminding you of the time allotted to your party. Okay, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris may speak next.

[3.52 p.m.] () .. ( ) ( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Hon. Presiding Member, the Hon. R. Sampanthan spoke very emotionally. I would like to make two general observations on the tone and the content of his speech.

The first is that it is a mistake to dwell exclusively on the past. Of course, the past is important. The present emerges from the past. There is an intimate link between the two. But, to be captivated by the past and to be mired in events which have taken place in the past, in my view, is not a constructive approach to the search for solutions. I think well over 70 per cent of the Hon. R. Sampanthans speech consisted of quotations, speeches made by people at different times and documents which were produced at some point in history. It was a comprehensive chronicle of historical events. I am not for a moment denigrating the value of such a historical record. It may contribute to our understanding of complex situations. But, we do need to recognize that circumstances have changed drastically. It is a new situation that has arisen in this country since May 2009. We have to recognize that reality. Therefore, to keep talking about the past; to keep invoking quotations from the past is, I think, to restrict unwittingly ones own capability to address issues in a manner that is conducive to the emergence of viable and practical solutions. I say that with genuine respect.

The second comment I have to make is this. There really needs to be a sense of objectivity. The Hon. R. Sampanthan used strong language. I am quoting some phrases that he used in his speech. Referring to the Governments Action Plan with regard to implementation of the LLRC Report, he said, It is a cover-up, it is a concealment, it lacks credibility and legitimacy. He said that the Governments plans represent no more than a generalized tentative plan that is not results-oriented. Is

that the truth? Is everything as dark as that? The main thrust of the speech by the Hon. R. Sampanthan was an attempt of self-vindication and self-justification. The fault is all on the other persons.

It is an attempt to impute culpability to others and to set oneself up as somebody who has made no mistakes; no wrongs; lily-white and if anything has gone wrong, the blame has to be placed squarely at the door of the other party. I think that is a very facile, a very unrealistic reading of a very complicated sequence of events.

Now, I want to say, Mr. Presiding Member, on behalf of the Government, that we are legitimately proud of our achievements during the last three years. I make no apology, either here or overseas, in saying that. You compare objectively the situation on the ground in Sri Lanka with other post-conflict situations in other parts of the world. How long has it taken in those situations to reacquire some semblance of normalcy? It has always taken more than a decade. As against that, consider the extent to which things have changed in this country within the brief span of three years. Just this morning, I had occasion to give a very comprehensive briefing about contemporary events in this country to His Excellency Yasushi Akashi, the Special Representative of the Government of Japan for Peace-building, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction in Sri Lanka. I briefed him fully about what is happening at present. Last month, with Mr. Lalith Weeratunga, Secretary to His Excellency the President, I briefed Ambassadors and High Commissioners accredited to Sri Lanka about the same developments. And, again with Mr. Weeratunga, I met the local and international media and we presented a very objective, dispassionate appraisal of the accomplishments on the ground in Sri Lanka during the last 36 months. But, do not take into account what I say if you are insisting on assailing credibility and legitimacy.

Let us look at the Hon. Sampanthan and some others who are always fond of quoting foreign sources. Foreign sources are sacred. Local sources, by definition, are to be looked upon with suspicion. I do not think for a moment that that is a healthy attitude at all. But, even on that premise, let us consider a report which has been presented within the last few days to the British Parliament and to the British Government. And, let us see how that assessment of the situation, which does not come from the Government of Sri Lanka, it comes from a Western figure, who is familiar with circumstances in Sri Lanka and whose integrity is beyond question.

I refer to the Right Honourable Lord Naseby, who spent quite a long time in Sri Lanka, from the 24th of March to the 12th of April, 2010. Now, here is a peer of the realm, a Member of the House of Lords. Now, let us see what his own assessment is and let us compare it with the dark, the gloomy, the pessimistic and the totally despondent view that was presented to this House and no

1285 1286

2012 22

doubt to the world by the Hon. Sampanthan. Now, these are the words of Lord Naseby; these are not my words at all. Lord Naseby says, "There have been no bombing since May, 2010 and people of all ethnic groups travel the length and breadth of the country by day or night without fear". And we, as a Government, are very proud of that achievement. I want to tell my Friend that in no uncertain terms, we are very proud of that. The Right Honourable Lord Naseby goes on to say to his peers in the House of Lords and to the Parliament of the United Kingdom: "The investment in infrastructure is truly amazing, viewed either on the ground or from a helicopter. The Southern Expressway with extensions underway; the national grid now at Kilinochchi but in a year it will reach Jaffna Town giving it reliable power.

The railway in the northern region is on its way to Mannar and then Jaffna. The water grid in the dry northern region will, in due course, provide Jaffna District with clean safe water". He then says, These are very significant achievements mostly geared to Jaffna and the North. I ask you in all fairness, black and white, the Hon. Sampanthans achievement and the achievement of a British peer. That is not all. Look at some of the other things that he has to say about life in Jaffna. I, myself have gone to Jaffna and I know that a sea change has occurred. Nobody can deny that. What was life like in Jaffna three years ago and what is it like today. I think it is wrong; it is preposterous to deny that. By all means, criticize where criticism is legitimate. The Hon. Sampanthan said, "When there are shortcomings, when there are deficiencies - he used those two words and said - we will criticize. Of course, do criticize when there are shortcomings and deficiencies. But, have the generosity of heart, have the largeness of mind to recognize genuine achievements, to acknowledge the good things that happen and have the objectivity, whether there are elections or not, to give credit to the Government of Sri Lanka when that Government has delivered so handsomely and magnificently to your people, achievements which are being recognized all over the world and are being denied only by you.

Here are Lord Nasebys comments on the situation in Jaffna. He says, There is a buoyancy of attitude in Jaffna from all sides. Things are happening on the ground as life returns to normal. That is what he has to say about life in Jaffna. Then, he goes on to say many other things which I want to emphasize in light of the very dismal picture which was painted by my Hon. Friend.

On the subject of resettlement of internally displaced people, Lord Naseby says, Nearly 300,000 fled to the Government and were housed in Menik Camp which I visited, met the people and officials. All that now remains to be done is demining of the final area of the war and then the last 6,202 IDPs can go home and the camp can be closed". Despite allegations to the contrary, ICRC's Head of Mission confirmed to me personally that they had had

access to the camp from day one and were full of praise - not condemnation, not denunciation, not abuse, but full of praise - at the way such a huge challenge has been handled.

I want to emphasize that. You know the quality and the degree of an achievement depends on the magnitude of the challenge. Now, here by any standard, was a colossal challenge. Very few countries have had to deal with a challenge of this scale. Now, consider how the Government of Sri Lanka has responded to that challenge. Two hundred and ninety six thousand internally displaced people, and objective people, people who will criticize where criticism is justified but people who will have the detachment of mind to give credit where credit is due are not niggardly, are not grudging in recognizing the range and the quality of this achievement.

On Rehabilitation, the Right Honourable Lord Naseby says, I had a good meeting with the Head of the Delegation, Mr. Giovannoni. He confirmed that there were no problems at Boossa High Security Prison or Menik Farm Refugee Camp. Then Lord Naseby says, I visited Boossa, saw around it, spoke to some of the inmates and inspected sleeping accommodation, washing facilities and toilets. Lord Naseby has done that personally. He says, I visited the Rehabilitation Unit at Vavuniya and could find no problem. He has found no problem. He says, Indeed I was surprised to bump into two girls, who had been through the unit and were returning voluntarily to see friends. So, that is the situation that Lord Naseby encountered. There really is an insurmountable difficulty about reconciling the thrust of these observations with the picture, which for his own reasons, the Hon. Sampanthan wants the world to accept. - [Interruption.] No, no it is not one person, it is not one person. That is a very unfair comment. About three weeks ago we had 10 Members of the British Parliament led by Mr. James Warden.

What was their comment? What was the comment of Mr. Robert O. Blake, when he came back from the Northern Peninsula? When facts are presented which you do not like, to rubbish those facts, to denigrate them in that way, that is one pursuit. If Lord Naseby had said something which you like, the whole world would have been told that and you would have blown it up as only you can. But, when the judgment goes the other way, you dismiss it. -[Interruption.] I did not interrupt you and I do not wish to be interrupted. I have every right to present the Governments point of view. - [Interruption.] No, no, I have every right to present the Governments point of view. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order please! Let the Hon. Minister speak.

1287 1288

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Now, this is not an isolated view. It has very much in common with the assessments by almost everybody who went to the North and came back with their own genuine impressions. We have had Parliamentary delegations, Sir, from the European Union, from Britain and from Germany. Shrimati Sushma Swaraj, the Leader of the Opposition in the Indian Parliament led a Delegation of Parliamentarians drawn from different political parties in India. What did they have to say? Did they say everything is dark and black, there is no redemption possible, there is no light at the end of the tunnel? Did any of them express such a view? So, that is the reality of this situation, Sir.

Now, I will deal with some of the other points. I want to say this very honestly in keeping with my own conscience. I think the most serious reservation that we have about the Resolution that was adopted in Geneva by the Human Rights Council on the 22nd of March is this. This is our main reservation. Those who seek to internationalize the Sri Lankan situation are not only not doing any good but they are inflicting real harm on a political process in this country. There is a group of people. I will name nobody, I am not singling anybody in particular for condemnation. But, all of you will know that public statements have been made by political figures in this country, Sir, on these lines: Why are we interested in a domestic process? We can get very much more out of the international community. Therefore, let the domestic process falter and collapse. That is what we want. We will then be in a position to raise our voices and tell the world, here is the empirical proof. This cannot succeed within the shores of Sri Lanka. A passionate appeal is then made on the most facetious and frivolous grounds to the international community who are told, "You take over, you now exert pressure on the Government of Sri Lanka and extort, cause out of the Government of Sri Lanka a solution that goes far, far beyond the parameters of any solution that would emerge from a domestic process". I am not saying that the Hon. Sampanthan is adopting that view. I say that with honesty. But, I do say that there are others whom the Hon. R. Sampanthan is well aware of, who are certainly adopting that view and who are looking for an exit strategy out of the domestic peace process. This is a case of waiting for Godot; it is never ever going to happen. We know that and you know it. It is certainly not going to happen. The international community, whatever that means, has neither the desire nor the capability to impose a solution on this country.

I think about 50 per cent of the Hon. R. Sampanthans speech consisted of quotations from Indian leaders. If India is clear about one thing, it is this. They have said time and time again, on several occasions in my presence, at meetings with His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, they have always said, It is not for us to determine the nature of a political solution that is appropriate for Sri Lanka. We do not wish to get involved

in that at all. That is a matter for the people of Sri Lanka and for their elected Government, not for us. If India has been emphatic and specific consistently about anything at all, they certainly have reiterated that position ad nauseam. So, this is a real damage which the Resolution of the 22nd of March has done to the Sri Lankan peace process. Something can be worked out in this country. Nothing is going to emerge out of other capitals, but the internationalization of the process: the fact that Sri Lanka has been put on the Agenda of the Human Rights Council, the fact that some people are building castles in the air, envisioning, without any basis, that this journey will take them, step by step, towards a situation in which the international community will feel inclined and empowered and emboldened to impose a solution on this country. This means, Sir, the marginalization of moderates; the moderates who believe that this countrys destiny is in the hands of its people and its elected Representatives; moderates who are genuinely committed to the pursuit of a solution which will be constructed in keeping with the wishes and the aspirations of the people of this land. Those are the moderates who are now marginalized, who are deprived of authority by an international process which has kindled the hope that the international community will be a substitute for the organs of the Sri Lankan State in arriving at a solution to this issue. That is why I say, in all conscience and with total sincerity and honesty, that that is where this Resolution has failed the people of this land. I am not saying for a moment that anybody has done that deliberately or viciously, not at all. But, that is the consequence of that action.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! The Hon Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

... , .

, ... , . Whereupon THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER left the Chair and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES took the Chair. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I was saying, whatever our private hopes and expectations may be, let us all stare reality in the face and let us recognize the truth that nobody outside this country is going to impose a solution. Look at some of these situations elsewhere in the world. Sri Lanka is a land at peace. There is stability in this country; the economy of the whole Island is growing by more than 8 per cent; our people are at peace with themselves and they are in a position to contemplate a future that is filled with dignity and hope. Contrast that with other situations elsewhere in the world. I cannot, as

1289 1290

2012 22

the Minister of External Affairs of this country, name situations. I will not do that. But, it does not require much knowledge or imagination to think of other situations where there are continuing problems, day by day. Has it been possible for the international community to step in and to try to control those situations? It has not been possible for reasons which I will not go into on this occasion.

So, it is never going to happen in this country. But, the Resolution in Geneva has raised that hope, of course, without justification and that is why it has been a setback. It has really been a setback, Sir, for the vitality of a domestic peace process. A domestic peace process is the only way; there is no other way at all. There is so much misinformation. I am not saying all of it is deliberate, but some of it is. I say so without fear. Look at all the half-baked statements, the total inaccuracies which are being spread today.

I respect the Hon. Members who spoke yesterday in this august Assembly and there was a demand made that the Government should table in this House, our response to Geneva with regard to the Universal Periodic Review. Now, I want to explain very clearly what the factual position is because I am not for a moment suggesting that there was any mala fides. The Universal Periodic Review is not specific to this country at all. One hundred and ninety two countries are subject to review by the UPR once in four and a half years. It goes by rotation and our turn comes in the first week of November. So, we have prepared the document and sent it to them. This is not the only occasion on which we have submitted similar reports. We have submitted similar reports under other international instruments to which Sri Lanka is a signatory. For example, under the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, we have submitted reports. Then, under the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of the Child as well, Sri Lanka has submitted reports. The procedure is that we submit the report, then the report is translated into six United Nations languages and then, immediately it is put on their website. It becomes a public document to which the whole world has access. Nobody is interested in hiding it; nobody can hide it; it cannot be concealed. The whole world can look at that. I am now in a position to tell this honourable House that early next week, that document will be on what is called the UPR Extranet - it is not called the internet, it is called the Extranet - so that the Hon. Members of the House can access it at any time without any difficulty whatsoever. We really have nothing to hide.

I have found that it makes sense for the Government of Sri Lanka to encourage maximum mobility and exposure; the more people are able to go to the North and see for themselves what the situation really is, the more they will realize that the bleak picture painted by the Hon. Sampanthan is not a reflection of the reality on the ground. We, therefore, want people to go there and see for themselves.

Then, there has been some criticism about the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights visiting our country. Again, I want to set the record straight. I mean, we must give proper information. Otherwise, how can people arrive at the right conclusion? Navanetham Pillay was invited by us to visit Sri Lanka long before this Resolution was passed by the Human Rights Council on the 22nd of March this year. The invitation to Navanetham Pillay was not the result of the Resolution; it had nothing whatever to do with the Resolution. We had invited her in writing before that. Then, she accepted the invitation in principle and said that, in her view, to get the maximum benefit out of the visit, she should visit our country after the Report of the LLRC is available. She has now written to us saying she would be happy to come but she wishes to send a technical officer, a member of her staff, to this country to prepare the ground for her visit. It often happens.

The Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, senior officials of the United Nations system, dignitaries of foreign Governments often send somebody in advance to prepare the ground for a high level visit. We have, therefore, said we would be happy to receive that officer, Mr. Hanny Megally, and to place at his disposal all the resources and facilities he wants to go anywhere he wishes. We do not want to restrict him or curtail his movements in anyway. He can go wheresoever he pleases and see for himself whatever he is interested in.

When I was in Washington - I never ducked anything - I went and addressed the major think tanks in Washington, the Woodrow Wilson Centre for Scholars, I addressed the Heritage Foundation. It was not a tea party. Some very probing, hostile questions were put to me. I had no hesitation in answering. The US Government told me, You present your case not only to the Secretary of State, Her Excellency Hillary Clinton, but present your case to Members of the Senate, to Members of the House, engage with them, respond to the questions that they ask you and that is the way to get your message across. We did that. Then, at the end of some of these presentations, we were told, You have done good things but you are not getting sufficient credit for them and that is because there is inadequate information available in the public domain. Therefore share more information with the world. That is why it is very much in the national interest of Sri Lanka to ask the Commissioner for Human Rights to come to this country. We do not want to shut her off. We do not want to exclude her. We encourage her to come because we have nothing to fear and there is nothing which we wish to sweep under the carpet; absolutely nothing. Everything is available for scrutiny and inspection.

Again, there is another unfair criticism. I do not think that is malicious or deliberate. It is simply because the facts are not known. Some people have asked, Why do you not protest strongly about three countries being

1291 1292

selected for the preliminary review? The Universal Periodic Review is in the first week of November. The three countries, India, Spain and Benin are the rapporteurs. They are no more than rapporteurs. They are not judges. The responsibility is not cast on them to come to conclusions about Sri Lanka. They are mere rapporteurs. Now, it is not that Navanetham Pillay or anybody in her office or the Human Rights Council selected those three countries. Nobody did that. That is not the procedure at all. It is a lottery. You draw lots. So, it is entirely a coincidence. It is in the lap of the Gods. It so happened that those three countries were chosen. Nobody did it deliberately. We are not unhappy. We have confidence in ourselves to present our case fair and square to these countries or for that matter to any other countries and to vindicate the record on the ground, to explain what we have done and to elicit the kinds of responses that are contained in the Report of the Right Honourable Lord Naseby, the ten Members of the British Parliament and all the other dignitaries who have had the opportunity of visiting this Island and seeing for themselves the evolving situation in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka.

There is also misinformation about South Africa. The Hon. Sampanthan spoke of Indias connection. Of course, we are prepared to work with anybody, look at any experiences in any part of the world. But, we must have the resilience of mind, the creativity -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Minister, you have one more minute. ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva - Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management and Leader of the House of Parliament) We will give him another 10 minutes.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Okay. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) You must have the creativity of mind, the resilience of mind to adapt those solutions to suit our circumstances. I want to say categorically on the Floor of this House that this South African Delegation led by Hon. Ebrahim Ebrahim, Deputy Minister for International Co-operation

of the Republic of South Africa and Mr. Roelf Meyer, who was Minister for Constitutional Affairs in the Cabinet of former President Nelson Mandela; not one word did they speak about mediation or facilitation. They never suggested it; we never accepted it and mediation or facilitation did not form any part of the discussion that they had with the Government of Sri Lanka. They were here merely to exchange ideas about challenges and opportunities in South Africa and in Sri Lanka. South Africa, which has very substantial influence in international fora, is a partner with us. But, it was certainly not the case that there was even the remotest thought of using their services in any form of mediation or facilitation. So, that is completely incorrect.

The Hon. Sampanthan referred to some instances where the Governments statements are not entirely in line with the proposals of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. I wish to tell my Hon. Friend that nowhere in the world has a Commission report been implemented mechanically in that way. The source of authority is the appointing authority and, in this case, His Excellency the President of Sri Lanka. Of course, in some matters, the Governments thinking will differ. But, the political responsibility is that of the Government, it should be like that. Of course, it should be like that. It cannot be any different. That responsibility cannot be vested in the Members of the Commission and we make no apology for situations in which the Government has a different point of view. There is nothing to be ashamed of, there is nothing to be embarrassed about.

There is much that I would like to say but because of the constraints of time, I will confine myself to a few matters. I want to sharply and categorically contradict the Hon. Sampanthan when he spoke of starvation and lack of drugs resulting in the loss of life in the Northern Province. That is simply not true. There were foreign ambassadors. Indeed, Mr. Robert Blake was a Member of the CCHA. They are personally aware. The UN records bear that out. In fact, the quantities of food that were sent to the Northern Province were in excess of the actual requirement. So, that is a total distortion and is easily shown to be incorrect.

On the question of accountability, I will quote this one sentence, Hon. Sampanthan, from the Report of Lord Naseby which says, There is a danger that persistent emphasis on accountability from outside may well jeopardize a larger goal of true reconciliation. We are not saying that we shut our eyes to accountability. There is a way of handling it. But, we do believe that infrastructure development and the upliftment of the economic conditions of the people of the North are essential ingredients of a viable reconciliation process. They are absolutely necessary. They alone will not suffice. But, no reconciliation process succeeded anywhere in the world at any time in history unless the material needs of the people were sufficiently addressed.

On the political solution, it was a long catalogue of errors attributed to other people and an attempt, an unabashed attempt, to vindicate oneself in all respects. I would ask in all humility the Hon. Sampanthan whose sagacity, age and experience I genuinely respect, not to dwell on the past. You know yourself that the amendments that you wanted to the Terms of Reference, Government agreed to and then the Government is ready to start this process. So, without complaining about everything that has happened in the past and without imputing blame to everybody except oneself, let us make a fresh start. In life, you have to do that sometimes. You have to put the past behind you. That is baggage. Let us forget about it. A fresh dawn, a new opportunity filled with hope for the future, let us seize that with both hands and let us move forward. The Government of Sri Lanka is only too happy to reach out to you. Come in; do come in. We are not asking you to agree with us. We are not asking you to adopt any particular point of view. Come in; say your piece without fear or favour. But, do come in because we want it to be an inclusive process, not a top-down process, where we decide what we think is in the interest of the nation.

Before I conclude, I want to make this point with emphasis. The Hon. Sampanthans Adjournment Motion which consists of three pages opens with a quotation from the Joint Statement by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa and His Excellency Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations of the 23rd of May, 2009. He quoted sections of it. I want to tell this House categorically that at no time did President Rajapaksa, in any manner whatsoever, agree to any form of international intervention in this country. There is a reference to accountability. There is a reference to Sri Lankas obligations at international law and humanitarian law, but at all times, we will assert the primacy and the indispensability; the indispensability of local processes which are the only way to arrive at a solution to this question.

So, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I thank you for your indulgence. On behalf of the Government, I wish to say that we are certainly prepared to accept the position that inclusivity is essential. No solution is going to survive unless it has a spontaneous backing of all the people who inhabit this Island.

The Hon. Sampanthan, I think, has a major responsibility at this time if he looks back on his whole political career. I say with genuine respect and with responsibility that here comes a golden moment which he should not let slip through his fingers. He owes it to his people to do that. Let us rise above elections in the Eastern Province or elections anywhere else in the country because what is at stake is of far more fundamental importance. So, instead of resorting to the blame game and finding scapegoats for all kinds of situations which have arisen in the past, let us in a spirit

of freshness serve our people. Come into the process; work with us. If you do not like what we say, if you disagree with us, certainly express your dissent in no uncertain terms, but do not deny yourselves the opportunity of participating in that process by excluding yourselves at the threshold.

With those words, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I thank you for the opportunity that you have given me of responding in some detail, although not inasmuch detail as I would have liked, to the observations that were made by my Friend, the Hon. R. Sampanthan, in proposing his Adjournment Motion to this House.

I thank you, Sir.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. You have five minutes.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I was told that I have eight minutes at the time I seconded the Motion.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) No, not eight minutes; it is only five minutes.

[4.34 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am glad to speak after the Hon. Minister of External Affairs who stated, as he ended his speech, that we need an imaginative approach. Perhaps for that reason, today he propounded an incredulous theory to this House. And, I sat in amazement and listened to that theory which goes something like this, "Do not dwell on the past because past is past. You take account of the present and go forward to the future". What he means by the past that we are not supposed to dwell on is commitments made by himself, His Excellency the President and the Government in general. If his theory holds good, you could have had a meeting yesterday and agreed to do something today but you come today and say "Oh! That was in the past. Do not dwell on the past although I did give that assurance". All of those assurances that were quoted by the Proposer of this Adjournment Motion were assurances given in the last three years with regard to a political solution consistently by the Government of Sri Lanka in several instances in joint statements by the Hon. Minister for External Affairs himself.

1295 1296

And, when that is pointed out in this House and the question raised as to why you cannot deliver on your own promise, all that you are able to say to this country is, Do not dwell on the past. Those promises were given in the past. I gave it last month. I gave it a month before. Now, is this the responsible way in which we expect a response from the Government? You make Joint Statements with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. You make Joint Statements with the Hon. Minister of External Affairs of India. President Rajapaksa makes statements, all in the last three years saying, maximum possible devolution, full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and going beyond that and building on that to achieve meaningful devolution. But, nothing is delivered and when we raise that issue, you say, Oh, those are promises given in the past. Do not dwell on the past. We take that as a responsible response from the Government today to mean that you are now responsibly saying that those promises do not mean a thing to you. You have very clearly articulated your position in this House today. When specific instances were quoted and read out verbatim, all you have to say is: forget them. So, today we take what you have said as the right response from the Government of Sri Lanka. Despite all the assurances given to various international bodies, to the Government of India, to this country, to your own people, you have today very clearly said, Forget that; that was in the past. That is why you are unable to deal with any one of the situations that were raised by the Proposer of the Motion.

You dealt with Lord Naseby. Did Lord Naseby see the barbed wire fence that has cut across the Jaffna Peninsula depriving over 28,000 people of settling in their own lands for 26 long years? At least once were you able to deal with the situation in Sampur that the Hon. Sampanthan raised about Berty Perera and various other Commanding Officers of the Sri Lanka Army visiting those camps everyday? You speak of the Provincial Council Election in the Eastern Province. This morning they were there campaigning for the Government and telling the people, We will not give you food. From January to this day, food provisions have been deprived to the 1,500 families who were sent out of Sampur. Now, six years have passed but they have not been given food provisions because they are not complying with the directives of the Government to go and settle elsewhere. You want to take over that land for important personalities connected to the ruling family.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Sumanthiran, please wind up your speech now. Your five minutes is over now.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I was assured eight minutes at the time I seconded the Motion.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) No, 100 minutes was allotted to your Party. The Hon. Sampanthan took 95 minutes out of that. So, you had only five minutes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) He took 92 minutes and I was assured eight minutes by the Presiding Member at that time. Anyway, let me conclude.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) But, the record says so. Please wind up your speech now. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I bow to your Ruling. Let me conclude.

So, the point is, with regard to the political solution, the TNA talked with the Government for one full year, without any response from the Government. The Hon. Sampanthan made that charge today and he gave you the dates. You are unable to respond because you were a member of the Government delegation. You know fully well that for 12 months in 18 rounds of talks, the Government did not come up with anything, and you are talking about reducing the strength of the moderates. Who is doing that? When we are able to stand up and say, We are prepared to solve this problem; when we have stood up and said, This is our reasonable solution and when we have placed it on the table, the Government has deliberately not responded and dragged its feet. While dragging its feet, the Government changed the demographic composition trying to change the ground situation and when we highlighted that, you are talking about weakening the moderates. You are the one who is doing that. You are complaining. You are lamenting about the international community.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Sumanthiran, please wind up your speech now. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will conclude in a minute, Sir. Why is the international community concerned? Because you are

1297 1298

[ .. ]

2012 22

unable to deliver a home-grown solution. It is the responsibility of the Government. With regard to all of the charges that were made today, the Hon. Minister was not able to refute even one of those except to merely say, Oh! well, all of those are bleak pictures that you like to paint. That is not the real picture.

Thank you very much.

[5.02 p. m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am happy to speak on the Adjournment Debate on the situation in the North and the East, proposed by the Hon. R. Sampanthan and seconded by the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. The Debate is of vital importance. I consider this to be a good opportunity to look into the living conditions of the people in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces, where the population is predominantly Tamil-speaking.

It has been three years since the war that ravaged the country for three decades was brought to an end. At this juncture, it is appropriate to consider whether the people living over there enjoy the same freedom enjoyed by the people living in other areas. The various projects implemented by this Government with a view to developing those areas and re-establishing the lives of the people in the North and the East are commendable. However, I wish to bring to the notice of this House, the question whether our people really enjoy the benefits of those programmes.

One wonders whether the so-called Uthuru Wasanthaya and Neganehira Navodaya projects promoted by the Government really bring vasanthaya and nawodaya into the lives of those people. Sir, I take this opportunity to voice the views expressed by a foreign delegate when she visited Jaffna recently with regard to the sufferings the people undergo there. What she purportedly meant was that the construction of roads will not indicate that the region has been developed, that the opening up of roads would not satisfy the hunger of the people there. This view will have to be taken serious note of. We cannot allow the people who were caught up in the clutches of the dreadful war that lasted for more than 30 long years to suffer any longer, even after the end of the war. I am saying this because the people should fully enjoy the benefits of the development activities of the Government. These benefits should go straight down to the people without being grabbed by middlemen or contractors engaged in road development activities.

Sir, why is the Government delaying the implementation of the Report of the LLRC? That is a Report which the Government itself has brought forward. There were certain recommendations made by the Commissioners in the Report to be implemented. Of course, the Hon. Minister of External Affairs said that in no part of the world does a government of a country enforce the implementation of such a commission report. But, I am sorry to say that these are recommendations put forward to address the suffering of the people in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. I do not understand why the Government is not implementing these reforms.

Why is the Government postponing the setting up of a Parliamentary Select Committee? What is the delay in creating an atmosphere for the appointment of such a Committee? We strongly believe that the implementation of these recommendations will open the windows, enabling the people of the North and the East to breathe the breeze of peace. The Hon. Douglas Devananda said that we are going to have the Select Committee, but the TNA Members are not cooperating by joining that. I wonder, I have my reservations on that because, on behalf of the entire Opposition, there was a statement made by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition that we are willing to join the Select Committee. So, the delay is not on our part. The delay is on the part of the Government in setting up the Select Committee to solve this problem by a political solution.

( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) So far, we have not received the names of the Opposition.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Minister, I wonder whether that is correct. I do not know whether it has not been informed to the Government.

( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) Yes. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Okay. I do not want to get into a controversy on that.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Hunais Farook to take the Chair? ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) I propose that the Hon. Hunais Farook do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to. , .

, , . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. HUNAIS FAROOK took the Chair.

1307 1308

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Sir, there was a letter sent by the Opposition asking for certain clarifications as far as the Select Committee procedure is concerned and we have not received a reply up to now.

Despite several rounds of talks between the Government and the Tamil National Alliance, we see that all efforts had proved futile. I urge the Government to act with a sense of responsibility without any further delay to draw in all sections of people together to bring about a suitable solution to the Tamil issue.

The Hon. Minister of External Affairs had mentioned that we are making deliberate allegations about Sri Lanka at the international fora. I am sure the Hon. Minister knows very much better than we do that an international organization like the United Nations is not going to accept any deliberation, suggestion or insinuation made by the TNA or the Leader of the Opposition or by any Tamil movement in this world. The United Nations Organization or any such international organization has got correct ways of assessing the situation that is prevalent in this country and it is wrong for anyone, especially for the Hon. Minister of External Affairs, a man of learning, to make a statement in this House to say that we are making submissions which are acceptable to the United Nations or any other foreign agency. That international agency has all the right to consider what is right and what is wrong and whether the fundamental rights of the people of this country are being enjoyed by them. Whether the Tamils of this country are enjoying those rights is a matter to be judged by the international community. You cannot say that the international community has no right to pressurize this Government to come to a settlement. I totally disagree with that statement.

Then, I wish to draw your attention to an excerpt of the India-Sri Lanka Joint Declaration on the official visit of His Excellency the President of Sri Lanka to India from 8th to 11th June, 2010. It states, I quote:

The Prime Minister emphasised that a meaningful devolution package, building upon the 13th Amendment, would create the necessary conditions for a lasting political settlement."

That is, the Prime Minister of India. It goes on to state, I quote:

"The President of Sri Lanka reiterated his determination to evolve a political settlement acceptable to all communities that would act as a catalyst to create the necessary conditions in which all the people of Sri Lanka could lead their lives in an atmosphere of peace, justice and dignity, consistent with democracy, pluralism, equal opportunity and respect for human rights."

All were delighted to hear these words at that time from His Excellency the President. But, I request this House to consider the present stance with regard to that

view. Mere words would not solve this problem. There should be a positive approach. That is exactly what I am asking for. The United Nations or any other foreign organization knows about the breach of human rights and the political instability in this country. We need not spoon-feed any of these organizations with what is happening in this country.

We cannot find any solution by criticizing each other. Today, that is what is happening. The Hon. Minister of External Affairs said that the Hon. R. Sampanthan was giving historical facts and I must say, with due respect, that the Hon. Minister of External Affairs also was giving historical facts. He was talking about peers who had come to Sri Lanka in the year 2010. The Hon. Sampanthan too was mentioning certain facts. So, this is the position. We need not get into controversy. We do not get a solution by criticizing each other. We will sit together and finalize it. Why are we delaying the process? That is my simple question to this honourable House. To achieve successful outcoming there should be an approach with virtuous thinking and open-mindedness.

Another important matter is relating to the release of the Tamil prisoners. You all are aware of the death of two prisoners who were brutally beaten in the Vavuniya Prison recently. In the past, the Government promised that steps would to taken to release these prisoners, but we cannot see any constructive improvements in this regard. It seems to be a gimmick of procrastination. I urge this House to initiate immediate action for the release of these prisoners.

Hon. Presiding Member, I wish to draw your attention to a few matters relating to resettlement in the North. The plight in which the people of Mullaitivu, Kaively and Thimbily have been placed and their suffering is yet another matter of grave concern. These people who were engaged in fishing before they were displaced are now settled in thick jungles. How are they going to find a livelihood there? Most of these inmates are disabled. These people living in sheds and huts are spending their lives under the cover of shadows of trees. Since they lack permanent houses during rainy days, they are marooned by flood waters.

There are 1,232 families placed in Menik Farm Welfare Centre in spite of the fact that it is three years after the end of the war. Do you witness the same miserable situation that is prevailing in the North in any other part of the country? Is this a mayhem of legacy thrust upon the Tamils alone? The question of resettlement of Muslims who were displaced during the war too has to be addressed. Most of them are still living in camps.

Hon. Presiding Member, further I take this opportunity to point out a few more matters. More than 1,000 private lands and buildings in the Peninsula are

1309 1310

2012 22

occupied by the army. We are reliably informed that the army is trying to take over 300 acres of land in Thenmaradchi and 61 acres of land in Tellippallai areas. At present, the police is in occupation of 57 lands with houses, five bare lands, one government land and one business establishment in the Jaffna District. It appears that 716 lands are under the control of the army. This includes 378 lands with houses, 283 bare lands, nine State lands and 46 business establishments. It is reported that a total of 253 lands are under the control of the navy. This includes 123 lands with houses, 104 private lands, 19 State lands and seven business establishments.

There is no objection whatsoever to ensure the security of the Jaffna Peninsula without any hindrance to the national security. We call upon the Government to hand over all the lands of the general public occupied by the security forces to the owners and ensure the safety of their dwellings. That is all we are saying. The security of the country has to be looked into and I must say the Government is doing their duty to maintain security in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. In the same way, people should not suffer because of the security of the country.

Further, our fisherfolk undergo great hardships due to frequent re-imposition of restriction on fishing that are relaxed time and again. This practice also should be eliminated. Besides that, the fishing activities of the Indian fishermen beyond their territorial waters have badly affected our fisherfolk.

It has come to a situation where the fishing nets of our fishermen are in imminent danger of getting tattered by their huge trawlers. I request that these matters be taken into consideration and positive steps be taken to resolve the problems confronted by our fishermen. I visited Karainagar a few days ago and the fishermen of the area informed me that they are facing this problem with the Indian trawlers. So, it is the duty of the navy to protect these young fishermen.

Please do not think I am utilizing the allotted time to criticize the Government, but I cannot continue with these comments without pointing out these shortcomings. The purpose of my pointing out the shortcomings is to see that our people breathe the breeze of peace. They too are the people of this land. They ought to live in peace. That is why I am concerned about these things.

I must congratulate the Hon. Sampanthan. One day I congratulated him and said that if we had a leader like him, we would have solved this problem many years ago, because he is one gentleman who said that a solution to this problem should be acceptable by all communities of this country and I totally agree with him. We are not asking for a separate state; we are not asking for a separate country. We are asking for certain fundamental and political rights that we want for the people of this

country to live in peace and that is what the Hon. Sampanthan, the Leader of the Tamil National Alliance wants. Therefore, I must say that his request is extremely reasonable.

Permission has been denied to more than 2,000 Tamils who were displaced from Sampur in 2006 to resettle themselves in their own villages. Immediate steps should be taken to resettle them with basic amenities.

Tamils are concerned about Lord Buddhas statues being erected in very close proximity to Hindu Temples. Thiruketheeswaram is one of the most prominent Hindu Temples in this country which is even recognized internationally and Lord Buddhas statue is being erected in very close proximity to that Hindu Temple. I earnestly request the Government not to give vent to ethnic violence and attempt to create turmoil in this country again.

Foundation should be laid for a bright future for todays youth of the North and the East. All what had been echoing in their ears since their birth is the sound of bomb blast, shelling and aerial bombing. They do not want to hear those horrifying noises anymore. Let them hear the sweet melody of Veena and Melam. This is what they prefer, not the sound of bomb blast and gunshots again.

According to the Report of the International Red Cross of 2011, up to the month of December last year, 15,780 people have disappeared in Sri Lanka. A significant number of disappearances have been reported in the East. The Government must try to clarify this matter. It is a matter of concern that even after the end of the war, a substantial number of robberies, kidnapping and disappearances have taken place. The people fear about the movements of some armed gangs in the East. This too has to be curbed.

There is so much to be desired where the development in the fields of education, health and culture are concerned. Jaffna being an agricultural district, the benefits of the welfare programmes of the Government should be extended to the farmers of the district. The farmers face difficulties during the time of harvest due to declining prices. It is also reported that the people of the East are emotionally disturbed. So, positive steps should be taken in this regard as well.

The students in the North and the East are also among the students affected by the Z-score mess. If our students in the areas of the North and the East who study under difficult conditions are deprived of admission to the universities, their future will be at stake. You know that the young boys and girls of the North and the East, even during the war, were entering the university amidst the turmoil and agony in their minds. So, if this is not addressed, in brief, they will not have a future at all.

1311 1312

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Give me one more minute, Sir.

I request that justice be done to the students affected by implementing the judgment delivered by the Supreme Court with regard to the Z-score and not create an upheaval among the young Tamil and Muslim students in the North and the East. We should not forget that during Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaikes regime, standardization was introduced and that was one of the main causes for the youth of the North to have been involved in an armed struggle because they were unable to enter universities.

I also wish to mention one other matter. The Kapilavastu Relics have been brought to Sri Lanka by the Indian Minister of Cultural Affairs and they were accepted by His Excellency the President of Sri Lanka. It has a great history. In 1978 too, the same Relics had been handed over to Sri Lanka. But, I was made to understand that the Kapilavastu Relics had been exhibited in all parts of the Island during the period 1978. But, today, many of the main temples have not got the opportunity to exhibit the same and I wish to say that the Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara too has not been given an opportunity to exhibit the Relics for the public veneration. By doing so, you are depriving a large number of people of paying their veneration and tribute to the great Kapilavastu Relics that have been brought to this country.

Finally, please address your mind to these matters carefully, dispel the sufferings of the Tamil of this country and pave the way for all to live in peace with equal opportunities.

Thank you.

I normally like to listen to our veteran politician, the Hon. R. Sampanthan, the son of the late Mr. Rajavarothiam, with whom I associated a long time ago whenever I went to Trincomalee but I had not seen the Hon. Sampanthan at that time. Today, I am sorry to say, as a retired university professor of the bygone era, the Hon. R. Sampanthan meandered through his script to place his case before the Tamil diaspora. Today, he made use of Parliament only as a propaganda platform for his election campaign in the East to woo the Tamil voters to

1321 1322

[ ]

2012 22

vote for the TNA. His speech today lacks tenor, substance, aim, vision and objective. I always considered him as a versatile and an able orator, but he failed to impress me and the House today.

Sir, never in the history of this country or for the last 2,500 years, - let that be recorded - has the North and the East been developed as it has been developed today under the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime. That is the fact they want to hide. They created a problem and the Hon. Sampanthan and others run away to Tamil Nadu, Norway and other places, leaving the poor Tamils to suffer in this country. They have no schools. But, the Hon. Sampanthan and other TNA leaders had attended universities in England and other places. This is the actual truth. So, why do you not realize even now that you cannot go on like this?

The best place to solve the Tamil problem, the minority problem is this Parliament. The whole world has accepted that. What happened to the Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact? What happened to the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact? Those were entered into outside Parliament, only between two parties - the Tamils and the Sinhalese. But, Sir, all shades of opinion are represented in this Parliament. There is no other representative body in this country that could solve this problem amicably. Therefore, our President has extended the hand of friendship; our Minister of External Affairs and others have told them, Come, our doors are open. Our tables are bare now. Come and discuss these things". This is what everybody wants. After that, you can find fault, if you want to.

What do all the leaders who come here from abroad say? Today, Sir, we had the pleasure of receiving the President of Seychelles, James Alix Michel. He was received by the Hon. Speaker, and the Hon. John Amaratunga, as the Chief Whip of the Opposition, made a good Vote of Thanks. What does the President of Seychelles say? The President of Seychelles, James Alix Michel, who heads a country of about 90,000 people, a man of vision and wisdom, congratulated President Mahinda Rajapaksa for resolving a very difficult conflict in Sri Lanka and restoring peace in the country. Conflicts of this nature cannot be solved very soon. What you have done so far is remarkable and Sri Lankas phenomenal economic growth of 8 per cent is a clear result of that, President Michel said. Out of this income, out of this revenue, the Government is spending a large portion - you cannot hide yourself from that truth, from that fact - on the North and the East. .

Sir, the Hon. Minister Chandrasiri Gajadeera spoke. He is one person, if you give him the chance - take him to your fold - who will solve your problem because he understands the aspirations of the Tamil population.

The other day, he invited me to come to the Fort Railway Station. On a friendship tour titled "Thalruppawen Polruppawata", hundreds of boys and girls from the North who took up guns earlier, ex-LTTE

cadres, were transported from Jaffna to Matara and everywhere they were garlanded by other released girls and boys in the Sinhalese and other areas. They played a match with a team captained by the Hon. Sanath Jayasuriya. Can you believe they defeated the Hon. Sanath Jayasuriyas team from Ruhuna! That is the capability and the ability of the Tamil man, we know. There was a time - even now - when the Department of Inland Revenue, the Department of Railways, the Sri Lanka Customs, the police force and other institutions were manned by the Tamils. There were people who were born in Malaysia and who came here like the great Hon. G.G. Ponnambalam and the Hon. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam. They came here and made a home for themselves. Today, after following the long history of the Federal Party in this country, I would call upon the Hon. Sampanthan and his party to follow in the footsteps of the Hon. Chelvanayakam at least now. The Hon. Chelvanayakam faced much trouble at that time; they were stoned. They had what were called "ahimsa Satyagrahas". One of my Friends, Mr. Mashoor Moulana, was thrown into the Beira Lake. But, what did the Hon. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam do? He went to the Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, sat across the table and discussed with him. Why can you not follow in the footsteps of the late Hon. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam? I ask you. You cannot carry on this campaign to the wishes of the diaspora, for your own selfish motives. You just cannot do that.

Sir, the other day, in the presence of the Leader of the Opposition of the Lok Sabha, Shrimati Sushma Swaraj, when she came here and all were seated there, I told the Hon. Sampanthan, "The Indian Government is giving 50,000 houses but you are not prepared to give a single to the Muslims. The Muslims were driven away, do not forget. Due to whose fault? Hon. Vijitha Hearth, where are you? Where is the JVP? The Muslims were driven away. One person, the late Hon. M. Sivasithamparam - I had my greatest regard for him; I associated with him and what an orator he was! - being in his wheelchair said in this House, I will never return to Jaffna until the Muslims return. Hon. Sampanthan, if you have forgotten this, I am reminding you of it. But, it has not happened.

Now, what is happening? When the Muslims wanted to go back to Mannar, they were driven away from Mannar. I must strike a personal note here, Sir. When the Jaffna Muslims were driven away, they came to Puttalam. I was the Minister of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs at that time. We received your people who came from the Vanni, Mr. Presiding Member - you are from the Vanni - and gave them coconut lands in Kalpitiya. By force, we took the lands and gave them; we rehabilitated them; we made them live; we gave them water; we gave them mats to sleep on and we gave them even power supply illicitly.

Sir, I have with me the Sudar Oli newspaper, of which you are the owner, are you not, Hon. Member? The owner is here in this House.

What did that great Ceylon Moor leader say? He said, Leave us alone. We are the leaders of our own Moor community. We can decide on our destiny. Do not interfere with us". But, Hon. Member, you are saying that you are our master. No, we will never accept that! The Muslim people of the Eastern Province and the Northern Province or anywhere else will never accept the TNA as their leader. This was stated in the State Council by Sir Razik Fareed, the great Moor leader.

Then, Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan said, "No, no, you are speaking Tamil. Therefore, you are part of us". I beg your pardon? We are Muslims. We speak Tamil but we are not Tamils; we speak Sinhala but we are not Sinhalese and we speak English but we are not Burghers. We have a separate identity, a religion, culture and aspirations of our own. Sir Razik Fareed told Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan to his face: "If you are insisting that you are our leader, listen to what I have to

say. Do not be mistaken. We do not want a leader. If ever we want a leader, we would choose a Sinhalese, not you. Hon. member, you respect Sir Razik Fareed. Why did you say so; those are his prophetic words?

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have only two more minutes. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I am taking the time allotted to the Hon. P. Piyasena also. The Leaders agreed with that. Now, Sir, what more is needed to substantiate my argument? I have got the latest Annual Report of the University of Jaffna. What does the Vice-Chancellor, the intellectual, Prof. N. Shanmugalingam say? It is very revealing, Sir. He says, I quote:

Our academic progress and success are highlighted in the section relevant to the Faculties, Departments and other Administrative Units of this report. During the year of review we were able to create new space for research and intellectual interactions, including the Towers of teaching and learning, the World Bank initiative for the 21st Century Higher Education in Sri Lanka."

They are helping higher education in the Northern Sri Lanka.

It states, I further quote:

We also used these opportunities to cherish the valuable memories of our pioneer Leader, Prof. K. Kailasapathy,.."

I knew him.

"the Founder President. In addition, we had the privilege of erecting the structure of our first Vice-Chancellor, Prof. S. Vithiananthan in our Library. Opening of A9 .."

Mark these words.

The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Jaffna declares, I quote:

"....immensely contributed towards this kind of academic interactions"

There is a revival of the Tamils under President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Sir. Why do I say so? You go from Mattakkuliya up to Wellawatta; go to every corner of the Colombo City. There is

1327 1328

' '. There is Tamil literary . ; . - ! . , - , - . . 30 . 30 . .

When the "Vel" chariot goes round the town, who receives it? It is the Head of the State at Temple Trees. This is the hand of friendship. This is how he treats the Tamil community, their culture. This is how he honours their religious aspirations, Sir.

Then, Sir, Prof. N. Shanmugalingam further states, I quote:

It is noteworthy that the opportunities we had under Vadakkin Vasantham.

Now you are pooh-poohing the idea of Vadakkin Vasantham. But, the Vice-Chancellor of the Jaffna University says this. Please safeguard him, please care for him, please look after him.

......the rapid development programme of the North and IRQUE was also utilized for the welfare development of student facilities like refurbishment of Hostels, improved Health Centre and sports facilities including to have an Ambulance for emergency health care."

Finally he states, I quote:

Let we all share the sense of optimism

That could be the final remark by me also if I was chosen.

".. as we look to the future with a continued sense of purpose and commitment to outstanding scholarship and education in all its forms.

This is what the great Vice-Chancellor, a great intellectual of Jaffna, a son of the soil is asking us, and even the TNA, to follow.

Sir, His Excellency the President has told in Vavuniya - . All the houses, irrespective of whether they are Indian-funded or American-funded, will be given equally to the people who have lost their houses. '' .

People are allowed to travel freely in the North. The person who is in charge of security, Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in the "Daily News" of 18th August, 2012,

states, I quote:

"The restoration of the freedom of movement has been a tremendous boost not only to the North, but to all the people of Sri Lanka. Large numbers of local tourists travel from the North to the South and from the South to the North on a daily basis. Large numbers of visitors from abroad have also come to Sri Lanka over the past three years. Since July, 2011 more than 51,400

Mark the number, Sir.

.foreign passport holders from over 100 countries have visited Sri Lanka and travelled to the North, including nearly 31,500 this year alone.

If there is a problem or if there is disturbance, will they go to the North? Let us appeal to our common sense rather than capitalizing on political issues. All the leaders, the British Parliamentary Delegation, Shrimati Sushma Swaraj, even Kanimozhi from Tamil Nadu - ; . ? TESO . TESO .

I know they played safe. I am happy that at last the TNA has taken the correct decision. Although the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah went and discussed about their coming, they did not do so. On an earlier occasion, under the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, the then Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. A. Amirthalingam and the Federal Party Members lost their seats. You take oath to protect the sovereignty of the country. You can fight your issues here. You can discuss everything but you cannot go against the sovereignty and the independence of the country.. That cannot be allowed, Sir.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up, your time is over.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I will finish soon, Sir.

Who goes from here? The great champion of the Tamil cause. Who is that? Wickramabahu Karunaratne. Can you believe? He is the Leader of the Nava Sama Samaja Party.
