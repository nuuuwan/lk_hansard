Hon. Deputy Speaker, the Greek Government issued different types of securities through different Government entities. That is why, in this background, I say that there is a duty cast on the Government to inform the House of all details pertaining to these Greece Bonds.

.

1. () ? The issuer of each Bond. That is, which entity in Greece issued the relevant Bonds? () ? The date of issue.

49 50

() ? The currency in which it was issued.

() ? The date of maturity.

() ? The specific purchase date.

() ? The broker through which each of these bonds were purchased.

2. ? How were these purchases made without the consent of the Monetary Board? Thank you.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) .

() ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of International Monetary Co-operation ) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I wish to reply to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition on the matters raised by him.

The Central Bank is the authority managing foreign reserves of this country in terms of the Monetary Law Act. At present, the total reserves are about US Dollars 5 billion. The sources of our reserves are firstly, the Central Bank of Sri Lankas purchases from the local market; secondly, foreign loans received by the Government; thirdly, proceeds of international bonds of the Government and fourthly, loans received from the IMF. These funds are invested in International Financial Markets as disclosed in the Annual Report of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and I would just refer to one section of that.

On page 71 of the Annual Report for 2011 of the Central Bank it is stated, I quote:

The bank's overall reserve management operations have generated a net foreign income of US Dollars 430 million (approximately Rs. 48 billion) during the year 2011. In the midst of comparatively low interest market environment, progress

was made under challenging circumstances in generating a significant income through foreign currency trading with the maximum use of the market fluctuations and capital gains derived on fixed income activities. In addition, remarkable return

on gold trading due to significant price volatility in the global commodity market contributed the most towards the increase in the total return."

Now, the procedure of investment is as follows. This will be of interest to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition

because he adverted to that. The policy approved by the Monetary Board in the form of Foreign Exchange Reserve Management Guidelines have been the main guidelines in these investments. The decisions are made by the Foreign Reserve Management Committee, which is a special committee of the Central Bank. I will tell you who the members of that Committee are. They are, the Assistant Governor who is the Chairman, the Chief Accountant, the Director of Economic Research Department, the Director of International Operations Department, the Director of Payments and Settlements Department and the Director of Management Audit Department.

This is the group that decides on the placements of these funds. The relevant department in charge of the reserve management has its own dealers and researchers. That is, their own staffers referred to as the "Front Office" and Risk Monitoring Officers referred to as the "Middle Office", who have been specifically trained for reserve management. The investment decisions are approved by the Governor as recommended by the Deputy Governor. The performance is quarterly reported to the Monetary Board for approval in terms of the guidelines.

I would like to mention that a similar process is being followed by most central banks and actually our Central Banks procedure is a duplicate of the procedures which have been adopted by most central banks. Then, the strategy of reserve management like any other Central Bank is to diversify investments from risk-free low yielding investments to high yielding investments with high returns. You have to make a call. You have to take decisions on whether you can put all your money on risk-free, but low return or venture into a more diversified portfolio, so that there is a better chance of getting a higher return.

The Sri Lankan reserves are mainly composed of Government securities in the following currencies: US Dollar assets 25 per cent, Sterling Pound assets 19 per cent, Euro currency 24 per cent, Japanese Yen 9 per cent, Australian Dollars 10 per cent and gold 9.5 per cent. The Sri Lankan reserves have been managed with an overall rate of return of 6.6 per cent. That is, overall we have made US Dollars 430 million in 2011. No losses were reported in the past. Investment in Greece Bonds was a high yielding category in investment made in terms of the procedures with the necessary approvals. The total investment was Euro 22 million. This amounted only to 0.6 per cent of total reserves.

Now, I would like to respond the Hon. Leader of the Opposition on the specific issues that he has raised. The first question is regarding the issuer of each Bond; that is, which entity in Greece issued the relevant Bonds. The answer is that all Bonds were issued by the Hellenic Republic Ministry of Economy and Finance Public Debt

51 52

[ ]

2012 17

Management Agency on behalf of the Government of Greece. This is the official authority for issuing Government Bonds in Greece similar to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka - CBSL - in the case of Sri Lankan Government Bonds. So, all the transactions were done through the Hellenic Republic Ministry of Economy and Finance Public Debt Management Agency.

The next question is about the dates of issue. Shall I table this or shall I read this? ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) You can read that. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Okay. Here, I have the Bond series and the dates of issue and I am going to table this later. The sequence of the Bond series and dates of issue are as follows: GR0114023485 was issued on 2nd February, 2010; GR0118012609 was issued on 7th April, 2010; GR0128002590 was issued on 11th January, 1999; GR0114022479 was issued on 28th January, 2009 and GR0124021552 was issued on 17th January, 2003. These were the series of Greece Government Bonds which were being traded at the time of the CBSLs investment. There were nearly 114 series of Bonds traded in the market with a total value of about Euros 292 billion, at the time the investments were made.

Then, you asked us about the currency in which it was issued and the answer is that the Bonds were issued in Euros. The Euro is a major global currency supported by the strength of the European Union led by Germany and France. We may be having difficulties, but that is the status of the Euro. The major part of international reserves of many central banks is composed of a number of investments in Euro as it is a currency in global demand. According to data by the Bank of International Settlements - BIS, approximately 14 per cent of global reserves are held in Euro in 2011. In the overall currency market, the Euro share is about 30 per cent.

Then, you asked the question about the dates of maturity. I will give you the Bond Series and the dates of maturity. It is as follows: GR0114023485 - date of maturity is 20th August, 2015; GR0118012609 - date of maturity is 20th April, 2017; GR0128002590 - date of maturity is 11th January, 2014; GR0114022479 - date of maturity is 20th August, 2014; GR0124021552 - date of maturity is 20th May, 2013.

The remaining maturity of Bonds was relatively short end of the medium term in the range of two to six years.

Further, you asked a question about the specific purchase date. The answer is that all Bonds were

purchased on 5th April, 2011. The acquisition of the investments and its subsequent partial disposal was based on the following:

(i) These Bonds were purchased in keeping with Foreign Exchange Reserve Management Guidelines approved by the Monetary Board, initially in November 2003 and thereafter amended from time to time, to empower and guide the officials of the CBSL to manage the international reserves.

(ii) As a policy, the Central Bank manages the foreign reserves in order to safeguard and enhance the value of its overall reserves as well as generate a reasonable income from its investments. The track record of the investment activities of the CBSL over the past 25 years is set out in Table 1 of this document, which I will table*.

From this table, it would be clear that the returns generated by the reserve management activities in the past two years had been well above the benchmark of the US Fed Fund rate and had yielded US Dollars 430 million in 2011 and US Dollars 341 million in the year 2010. These are the only two years in the history of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka that returns exceeded US Dollars 200 million. Further, 2011 is also the first time in 20 years that the return exceeded 6 per cent over the US Fed Fund average. The yield in 2011 has been after making provision for losses in terms of the relevant accounting standards, which clearly shows that the portfolio management has been highly successful in enhancing the value of the total portfolio whilst also providing for any losses that had been incurred in a highly challenging and volatile global situation.

(iii) The decision to invest in such bonds was based on the trade-off between different risks faced and the CBSLs tolerance for higher risk on a very small part of its portfolio - only 0.6 per cent of its portfolio was invested in Greece Bonds - particularly in view of the substantial gains that had been made by the CBSL during the year 2010, and where such gains were continuing in the year 2011 as well, and the possibility of earning a higher yield in the context of the following factors:

53 54

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

(a) While it is acknowledged that the Greece Bonds were rated (B1) below investment grade, it would also be noted that Sri Lankas own rating by Standard and Poors and Fitch in March 2011 was B+, which is the equivalent of B1 from Moodys and even at that time, overseas investors had invested US Dollars 2,000 million in Sri Lankas International Sovereign Bonds and about US Dollars 2,200 million in Sri Lanka Rupee

Treasury Bills and Bonds. As is well known, the investments in the Sri Lankan Bonds had been made by several hundreds of investors from all parts of the world. This shows that investing in high yielding sovereign paper is an integral part of fund management of many Funds in the world and the CBSL too, had followed a similar practice in investing a small and tolerable proportion of its reserves (0.6 per cent) in the Greece Government Bonds.

(b) The decision was influenced by the fact that at that time, there was a robust framework in place for crisis management in Europe supported by a Financial Stability Package. This package later increased to Euros 750 billion contributed by the European Financial Stability Mechanism - EFSM - with Euros 60 billion, the International Monetary Fund - IMF - assistance with Euros 250 billion and the European Financial Stability Facility - EFSF - with Euros 440 billion.

So, there was this big fund that the global monetary authorities created to save Greece at that point of time.

In fact, EFSF, which enjoyed a rating of Aaa by Moodys, was specifically created by the Euro Area Member States following a decision taken on 9th May, 2010, to implement several crisis management instruments, with the specific mandate to safeguard the financial stability in Europe by providing financial assistance to Euro Area member states. As per its mandate, the EFSF had the power to provide loans to countries in financial difficulties; intervene in the debt primary and secondary markets; act on the basis of a precautionary programme and to finance recapitalizations of financial institutions through loans to governments. Therefore, the risk was considered to be reasonably low and tolerable in the circumstances, not only by

us but as you rightly know, Hon. Leader of the Opposition, many countries and many banks, including Spanish banks, French banks, German banks also subscribed to this point of view.

(iv) The Euro Zone took a turn for the worse several weeks after the investment was made and following the volatility in mid July 2011, the Central Bank sold a part of Greece Bonds with a face value of Euros 5 million at a loss of US Dollars 1.1 million. This measure was taken to mitigate the risk of the Greece investments losing further value due to subsequent developments in the Euro Zone.

(v) Subsequently, when it became further evident that the unfolding uncertainty was impacting on the Euro Bonds in general and Greece Bonds in particular, it was decided to dispose of a further Euros 10 million face value of Greece Bonds at a loss of US Dollars 5.5 million in November 2011, thereby leaving only a further Euros 15 million face value of Greece Government Bonds to be carried forward. Accordingly, all in all, the loss on Greece Bonds investment in 2011 was US Dollars 6.6 million, and such loss has already been taken into consideration in computing the profit/gains for the year 2011 amounting to US Dollars 430 million.

So, having debited that loss, we are ahead of our investments to the tune of US Dollars 430 million.

Then, you asked the question, via which broker it was purchased. I am very happy to tell you that the same Bond Series numbers are there for this as well. Do I have to go through the numbers again?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) No. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The first one was done through Morgan Stanley. The second one was done through Morgan Stanley again. The third one was done through Jefferies & Company Inc. The fourth one was done through Royal Bank of Scotland Plc and the fifth one was done through Commerzbank AG. Those are some of the major counter-parties that have been approved by the Monetary Board through whom the CBSL carries out its investments of international reserves.

Finally, you asked how these purchases were made without the consent of the Monetary Board. Actually, you left it a little bit ambiguous, not so straight like this. But, let me answer. The assumption is incorrect. The necessary Monetary Board approvals have been obtained for these investments as set out in Foreign Exchange Reserve Management Guidelines.

[3.06 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, thank you for the opportunity given me to speak on the Determination under the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act to increase the fuel allowance payable to the Members of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption.

The Hon. Minister who spoke just before me made the allegation that during the UNP regime, several Government-owned businesses, Government enterprises were sold for a song to persons who were close to the Government: to friends and acquaintances and I can confirm that what the Hon. Minister said is very true. We know that. Except that now what happens is, they are not given to friends and acquaintances but to family and extended family members.

The Minister for National Languages and Social Integration is here. At one point, he fought a battle against bribery and corruption after presenting a COPE Report in this Parliament. The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara went to court and successfully reversed two privatization deals. But, at that time itself, he asked the President to take action against the Minister who was responsible for those privatizations. That was not done because that Minister, who was in the UNP regime at that time, later crossed over to the UPFA. There are several instances even in this Parliament of court actions, indictments being withdrawn when honourable Members - the word "honourable" loses its meaning - cross the Floor. One just walked in!

Now, we are all for strengthening the Commissions work. But, as the Leader of the Opposition said the Commission must work. The Commission must do its duty that has been conferred on it in a conscientious way, in an independent way. This is the reason why even the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission has again recommended that independent commissions be appointed. As the Hon. Minister who spoke before me said, the independence of a Commission must be assessed at its root. How are the appointments made? If the appointments are not made independently, then there is a very serious question as to the independent functioning of that Commission and that is what we have today. There was once an instance when the Commission was

independent; when the Commission initiated investigation against a particular Member of Parliament as to how he came by a sum of Rs. 400 million in his bank account. He was called to come and make a statement before the Commission. Immediately, three police officers who were attending to that matter were transferred out of the Commission. They had to go to the Supreme Court and get Stay Orders to stop the transfer. I handled one of those cases and the case is now over. So, I can talk about it. When the court intervened and said to stop their transfer, mysteriously that Member of Parliament suffered a snake bite and he could not go and make his statement to the Commission on the appointed date. Today, he is a Deputy Minister in this Government and no action has been taken with regard to that incident.

You can have a list of 2,500 or even 10,000 instances where action has been taken. I have sat in courts of law and seen doctors being prosecuted for bribery when they had taken Rs. 50 for giving a medical certificate. You can fry small fish but the big ones are all here; they never get caught to the net. It is a typical case of straining the gnats and letting the camels go through. There are many complaints about which we can ask questions as to what happened to those. What happened to the famous complaint made by the Hon. Kabir Hashim after the tsunami? What has happened to the famous complaint made by then Member of Parliament, the Hon. Sripathi Sooriyaarachchi and the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera about money being paid to one Emil Kanthan? Why has no action been taken by this so-called independent Commission? Is it because they did not have enough diesel? Is that what we are trying to fix now? To give them more diesel so that they will find out, investigate whether money was in fact paid to Emil Kanthan in 2005. The United National Partys response to the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission mentions that as to how those transactions were conducted must also be investigated. How can we boast that we have a Commission to investigate bribery and corruption with the definition of "corruption" in Section 70 of that Act, which is so broad that any misdemeanour can be brought into it? Yet, it does not touch those in power. It certainly does not touch anyone in the Government or anyone who is willing to cross over and join the Government.

Talking of cross-overs, has the Commission ever investigated what motivated those Hon. Members to cross over and what is the quantum of bribery that was offered, given and taken? The Commission has not investigated, not even looked in that direction. Otherwise, what was the motivation, within a few months after an election, having stood with one party and slated the other party at the election campaign, to have such a drastic conversion of mind. That needs to be looked into.

Then, the bribery that goes on during election time. If we increase this payment towards diesel, will they investigate the reduction in prices that has just happened

71 72

[ ]

2012 17

last week? All that for elections. Is that not bribery? Why can this Commission not investigate this blatant act of bribery by the Government in reducing prices of essentials after elections were announced for three Provincial Councils? Will this Commission investigate the blatant acts of bribery that are practised during election campaign? This was done in all the Pradeshiya Sabha elections in the North when several Ministers went and camped in Jaffna. It is easy to cover it when people are being resettled and they, anyway, need to be given various facilities, various assistance to enable them to stand up on their feet. During those elections in 2011, even from election platform, sarees and vettis were distributed. Sir, you know that very well. We told our people, Take whatever that comes your way. Do not refuse because these are your due. These should have been given to you. But, do not go and vote for those who give these to you. And, our people were wise enough not to vote for the Government. But, that does not make it any the less bribery. It is such a disgrace that we have a system of open bribery such as this. Then, poor Government servants who have taken Rs. 10 or Rs. 50 are arrested and prosecuted and it is a worse shame for Ministers to come and present lists of such prosecution and boast that this country has been rid of bribery and corruption because 2,500 had been prosecuted.

The Hon. Minister was pleased to say, "You must not make wild allegations; you must prove with certainty". That happens in a court of law. But, there is something called "public perception" and is it in any doubt today as to what the "public perception" of this Government is as to corruption? When the names of one or two Ministers are mentioned, people will jump and say, Oh! He is very clean. He does not take money. That only goes to show what the others are like. Such is the state of affairs today; the whole country knows it. The question is often posed -

( ) (An Hon. Member) That is a wrong allegation, without evidence.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If the hat fits, you can put it on. Sir, the question is often asked, how come such a corrupt regime continues in office? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Ask the people. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is right. Because the Government- [Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) You must go for an election. - [Interruption.] You must go for an election without jumping from this side to that side. - [Interruption.] Go for just one election. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Because the people are constantly told that this Government won the war, and it did, are they to close their eyes to all other faults of the Government? That is why, constantly, this fear is being driven into the people so that -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) That is a wrong dream. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, it is fairly a late reaction to my comments on the cross-overs that I got now. He must have been counting how much and now suddenly it has pricked his conscience, that he is shouting. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I did not mention anybody. I only said, if the cap fits, put it on. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order please! There is a point of order being raised by the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. What is your point of Order, Hon. Azwer? - [Interruption.] Order please! Please be silent. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) My point of Order is this. Is he referring to the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, who came to this side, functioned as a Minister and crossed over? Is he referring to him? Also, he says, Sir, that the people were given sarees and they asked them to accept those. - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That is not a point of Order, Hon. Azwer. Hon. Sumanthiran, you carry on.

73 74

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is not a point of Order. Anyway - ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera was taken by them. How much was offered to him?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I was wondering, Sir, who will get excited when I talk about bribery for cross-overs. Now, it has been demonstrated in this House; the chief culprit has got excited and he is demonstrating it with loud voice in this House now. - [Interruption.] This is just what I said, but for some reason - usually it happens immediately - today it took a long time and that is, as I said, probably because he was counting what came into his pocket. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) How much of money are you getting from the diaspora and the LTTE for this speech you are making in Parliament?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act is a good Act. It was brought with a lot of fanfare - I remember the occasion when it was brought in 1994 - and its history was talked about today but all that is totally irrelevant. - [Interruption.] If you ask the people, they will even wonder whether we have any legislation at all for bribery and corruption because it is practised with gay abandon by those in authority and unless that is changed and unless this Commission is made an independent Commission, there is no point in increasing the diesel allowance for the Chairman and the Members of the Commission. Thank you.

I quote from the speech he made at the UN Human Rights Commission on 19th June, 2006:

I wish to inform that President Mahinda Rajapaksa has decided to recommend to Parliament the appointment of a multi-party

Parliamentary Select Committee with a view to resolving the procedural shortcomings and further strengthening of the democratic governance objectives of the 17th Amendment to the Constitution under which the Constitutional Council was set up. We view this exercise as a further confidence-building measure among all citizens in Sri Lanka. With this corrective action, we hope that all impediments to the effective functioning of the Constitutional Council and independent commissions will be removed.

. . . , - ( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair.

... , .

, ... , . Whereupon THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, it is a privilege to say a few words while you are in the Chair.

We have a law in this country on the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption which had come before Parliament, so that the salaries of the Commissioners could be approved by Parliament. It gives a veneer of an appearance that this Commission has some kind of independence but this Commission has no independence. That independence was destroyed when the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution was abolished by this Parliament and all Members of this Government voted for that so that this Amendment will be abolished and the independence of the anti-bribery commission was completely removed.

We signed the United Nations Convention against Corruption in 2004. This Convention specifically has a principle of independence. But, that independence has been violated. Since 2004, no law has been passed to

bring in line our Sri Lankan law with the international commitments that we have already made. By next year, we will have to make commitments and give answers as to why we have not made these changes.

I just want to give you one example. Article 12 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption states that there can be conflicts of interest if people are appointed from the public service after retirement or resignation into the private sector or into other areas. This principle of independence and avoidance of conflicts of interest must be upheld. But, this principle is not being upheld. I was specifically questioning the fact that the former Chief Justice has been appointed as an adviser to the President. In addition to that, we also have a situation where the Central Bank uses its top officials like a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank to be appointed as the Chairperson of the Hatton National Bank and another former Deputy Governor of Central Bank appointed as Deputy Chairman of the Commercial Bank. These are all in violation of the principle because it specifically says that those who have been in supervisory roles in Government should not be appointed to other roles in the private sector either after resignation or after they have retired. So, the whole issue of independence is in question here. There can be no independent commission without independent commissioners. Therefore, they should be appointed for a specific period of time so that they have the independence, knowing that the Executive will not be able to interfere in their work.

In addition to that, the Hon. DEW Gunasekara mentioned that the problem is with corruption more than with bribery because it is difficult to define; it is difficult to catch and difficult to prove. So, appointing only police officers into the anti-bribery and corruption commission will not do. You need multidisciplinary teams of people with different skill sets so that they could go after corruption.

We have good examples in the region. Though somebody said today that there is a lot of corruption in the whole of Asia, which is not in dispute, the fact is that we need to have the mechanisms to tackle that corruption and there are good examples in Asia just like there are bad examples. Hong Kong is a very good example. It was a country with high levels of corruption but now, it is probably an Asian city with the lowest level of corruption. How was it done? It was done by creating an independent commission not accountable to the Executive but to the Legislature and being given the powers of appointing officers on fixed terms so that they could probe incidences and go after things. In the Hong Kong Legislature, they are even allowed to use surveillance methods to bring to book those who are stealing the national wealth. When that case went to the Supreme Court in Hong Kong, even though there was no specific provision in the law, the Court determined that proper surveillance had been done in good faith and therefore it upheld a judgment.

101 102

Sir, today we are talking about increasing the benefits to the Commissioners. That is what we have been talking about. The question that we have is this as an Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition spelt it out right at the beginning of todays Debate. The question is, "What actually is this Commission doing?" Why are we actually giving them all these things? We have got no report. We do not see how many cases have been instituted. We have not seen what punishments have been dished out to those who have been found to be stealing the national wealth. None of this is available and therefore we are asking this House basically to relook this because those who steal the national wealth must be punished according to the law. This House must agree to do that and we all must cooperate to have a cleaner society with the implementation of the law. Thank you.

I quote:

".....he was of the view not only that there was rampant corruption in infrastructure projects both at central and provincial government level, resulting in contractors engaging in sub-standard work pilfering inputs, not using specified materials, by giving commissions and by giving kickbacks to officials or elected representatives who are overlooking such projects but also that the poor had to give bribes local officials or the police to avail themselves of public services that should be due to them without charge. This rule applied even to supply of material inputs such as fertilizer, seed paddy and water. Those who could not afford to pay were denied access to these public services and were denied justice, thereby worsening their poverty."

Hon. Deputy Speaker, today is a very significant day because the Government is trying to build up healthy traditions by strengthening the hands of Commissioners and Commissions so that justice will be done to the people and the nation under the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act, No. 19 of 1994.

Sir, during the course of the Debate, several Members in the Opposition used vituperative language on Government officials, and even the Ministers and others, who are unable to be present in this House and give them the correct reply. Everyday, Sir, in this House the Opposition has nothing to say; the Opposition has no constructive views to help the Government, or even themselves, in order to develop the country economically and provide basic needs and other facilities for the people. They come here and make sweeping remarks; they mention names of Ministers and like manthrams go on repeating names of people who are unable to defend.

I should emphasize the fact that higher officials do help the Government to maintain a clean and effective administration. There are men who help to build up the economy of the country. His Excellency the President

117 118

himself cannot earn money on his own for development schemes. It is the officials who are manning the Central Bank, the Treasury and all other relevant monetary establishments, who put their heads together to obtain necessary finances to develop the nation. The names that they bandy about are: Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Dr. P.B. Jayasundera and Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The Opposition Members know not any other names. Why are they attacking these people? Why are they targeting Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. P.B. Jayasundera and Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa? Sir, Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa is one person whom the nation would remember with gratitude forever for saving the nation from terrorists. If Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, under the able guidance and the leadership of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, did not carry on the war to victory, these people will not be sitting in the Opposition side in order to level unfounded charges against him and others.

Not only that, even ask from the TNA what the Tigers doing at that time. One after the other they were eliminating the Tamil leaders. Two days ago, the newspapers carried a huge photograph of the late Hon. Appapillai Amirthalingam, a distinguished Parliamentarian and a former Leader of the Opposition. Who killed the Hon. Amirthalingam? The whole world knows that it was the LTTE. Who killed the Hon. V.Yogeswaran, the Hon. Alalasundaram, Dharmalingam Sivaram, Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam, and a person of the calibre of a former Foreign Minister, Lakshman Kadirgamar, who had earned worldwide laurels, who brought honour to this country? Who killed them? It is the LTTE whom you are now supporting, extending your support directly and indirectly. What does the Hon. Sumanthiran say in this House? He says, All hands in the Government are not clean. A simple reply was given by the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara. He said, "I am sorry to mention the name, the Federal Party because I like that Party". The Federal Party was distributing sarees, vettis and other things during elections to the voters. This has happened in the past - [Interruption.] You were not in the Federal Party. I know you very well, you are a good Friend of mine. Do not spoil your name. From where did the Hon. Sumanthiran come? Whom does he represent in this august Assembly? I make bold to say that it is not the Tamil people - the Hon. Vinayagamoorthy is representing the Tamil people; the Hon. Saravanapavan is representing the Tamil people, not he. He does not know the villagers in the North. He does not know his own neighbours of the village. That is why I challenge him to go to the Tamil villages in the East and spend one or two weeks during the election campaign. He cannot do that because he does not know the grass-roots level. He has no regard for the common Tamil people. His only aim is to purchase or earn guineas through whatever means that he could command through his language and his professional assignment.

Now, he says that bringing down the price of essential goods is a bribe. My God! Jesus Christ must come down to earth in order to teach him what good gospel is. We have never heard this. The Hon. Vinayagamoorthy, the Hon. Saravanapavan, you will be ashamed to hear a statement of this nature from a so-called Advocate of the Supreme Court. I think after coming here, he has fallen into an abysmal depth. I recommend in this House that he must be given an award.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

. He must be given an award for the best brainless and tomfoolery statement ever made in this House or any parliaments in the world. Bringing down the price of essential goods for the benefit of the people, for the common man, for the workers, for the farmers and that also -[Interruption.] , . That is the way he looks at the common man.

Sir, they are talking about these Commissions. All these Commissions were appointed under the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have one minute left. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay, Sir.

119 120

2012 17

Article 41A. (1) under Chapter VIIA of the Constitution states, I quote:

........the President shall seek the observations of a Parliamentary Council (hereinafter in this Article referred to as 'the Council), comprising (a) the Prime Minister; (b) the Speaker; (c) the Leader of the Opposition; (d) a nominee of the Prime Minister, who shall be a Member of Parliament; and (e) a nominee of the Leader of the Opposition, who shall be a Member of Parliament: ......."

So, that is the composition according to the Constitution. Sir, the Prime Minister nominated me to the Parliamentary Council. I have attended every meeting. But, the nominee of the Leader of the Opposition, who is also an advocate and an honourable man, went on public to say that his leader had asked him not to attend the Parliamentary Council. They are violating the Constitution. They are the people who wanted the Commissions to be appointed. If you want the Commissions to be appointed, the Council must meet.

See, what a tomfoolery speech the Hon. Sumanthiran made! Is he an advocate? He has no brief and he will never get a good brief. He said this with regard to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. That Commission consists of Justice D.J. de Balapatabendi, an honourable man of the Judiciary, Justice L.K. Wimalachandra, Commissioner and Dr. Jayantha Wickramaratne, Commissioner. They are very honourable men in society and the Judiciary; they are legal luminaries. He comes to this House and says that this money is given only to increase their petrol and diesel allowances. This statement shows, as far as I can see, to what an abysmal depth he has fallen into.

Finally, Sir, I must say this and wind up. Give me two more minutes. I have attended all the meetings of the Parliamentary Council. There have been appointments made to altogether 11 Commissions and institutions by it. I table* this document titled "Appointments made by the Parliament Council (As at 12.07.2012)" to be included in Hansard.

The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and the Hon. Swaminathan never attended a single Parliamentary Council meeting. They did not attend it when appointing members to the Human Rights Commission, the Finance Commission, the Supreme Court, the Public Service Commission, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and so on. They come here and talk about the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. My foot! Your own Leader does not know the duty of attending the meetings of the Parliamentary Council to make these appointments. Then, appointments have also been made to the Judicial Service

Commission, the Court of Appeal, the posts of the Auditor-General, the Attorney-General, the Secretary-General of Parliament and the Police Commission. He attended none of the meetings of the Parliamentary Council when giving those appointments.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is the point of Order? - [Interruption.] That is not a point of Order.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) So, how can they expect justice? But, we have done our duty.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, I want to know why I was given only 16 minutes when I had 20 minutes. How did it come down to 16 minutes? - [Interruption] And he is still speaking.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you cannot question the Chair.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Chair is allowing me to. Please give me two more minutes, Sir.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Azwer, please wind up your speech now. Your time is over.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, give me two more minutes.

So, I accuse the Leader of the Opposition directly. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, you cannot challenge the Chair. You sit down, first. - [Interruption.] Order, please! You sit down.

ADJOURNMENT

. . Question proposed. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Now, the Adjournment Motion is to be moved by the Hon. A.Vinayagamoorthy.

, , , , , RESETTLEMENT IN JAFFNA, MULLAITIVU, MANNAR AND TRINCOMALEE

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I move,

The Government has announced that 95 per cent of the people who got displaced have already been resettled. This information is incorrect. There are several more villages which have to be resettled. Several persons are to be resettled in Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Mannar and Trincomalee. This House requests the Government to immediately resettle these people in their areas early.

Sir, the President has announced that there are no High Security Zones in any part of the country and that resettlement of people has to be done by the respective Divisional Secretaries and District Secretaries.

The United Nations has reported that in the districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu, 117,888 persons have not yet been permanently resettled and further in the North, the resettled people since they have no houses are staying with their friends and relatives. A total of 18,589 persons from Vavuniya, 4,928 persons from Mannar and 94,371 persons from Jaffna have not yet been permanently resettled while 4,981 families consisting of 16,401 persons are said to be at Cheddikulam Camp.

In Jaffna, in Valikamam North Division, about 40 per cent of the area consisting of 23 villages has not yet been resettled. There are about 26,000 persons who have got

137 138

registered themselves at Tellippalai Divisional Secretarys Office have not yet been resettled. They have been staying with their relatives and in camps.

The following are the particulars of persons and areas to be resettled in 23 Grama Sevaka Divisions in Valikamam North:

22. Kurumpasiddy East J/243 1596

23. Vasavilan West J/245 1336

Altogether 26,279 persons.

About one lakh of people got displaced from Valikamam North. Valikamam North consists of 47 Grama Sevaka Divisions and the people there got displaced in 1990 due to army operations. People from Myliddy are very eager to go to their village and the fisheries harbour in Myliddy is the best fisheries harbour in Sri Lanka. Those people are now staying with their relatives in camps.

About a month ago, the people who got displaced from Mathagal went there to resettle and when they started clearing the land, they were chased away by the navy. Later, when the Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman and another Member of the Pradeshiya Sabha went to clear the land, they were assaulted by the navy. What has the navy got to do with resettlement?

Two Fundamental Rights Applications were filed in the Supreme Court and it ordered them to be resettled in

2006. Six years have passed since then but nothing has been done yet. In this connection, I sent a letter to the GA, Jaffna requesting her to resettle them in 23 Grama Sevaka Divisions in Valikamam North. She has forwarded that letter to the Commander of the Security Forces of the Northern Province with a copy to me. Who is doing the resettlement? Is it the army or the Government or the Minister?

About three weeks ago, I received a petition signed by about 300 persons from Vasavilan West, stating that they have not yet been allowed to resettle in their own lands. They also complained that the army is putting up a fence starting from the Vasavilan Junction going across Valikamam West up to Koddahapulam. This proposed fence separates the garden land from the place where you find their houses. They can only go to their agricultural land but not to their houses. Who has authorized the army to put up a fence in a private land?

I took photographs of that fence. The "Thinakkural" newspaper also published this news item. Even the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission - LLRC - Report suggests resettling of displaced persons in their own villages and removing the army from the North.

Nearly 26,280 persons are living with their relatives and in makeshift huts. The majority of the people of Myliddy are staying at Vaalvaham at Maruthanamadam in makeshift huts. The former British High Commissioner went and met them and asked them what they want, and they said they want to go back to their own places.

I want to find out from the Government as to who is responsible for resettling the people in Valikamam North. Is it the GA, the Minister or the army? In Valikamam West, in the Divisional Secretary's Division of Chankanai, about 1,527 persons have registered themselves at the Chankanai Divisional Secretariat Office and they want to resettle in their own villages. The particulars are as follows: in Ponnalai West, Nelliyan in the Grama Niladhari Division of J/170 Ponnalai Part, 966 members of 270 families and in Kaddupulam village in the Grama Niladhari Division of J/174, Chulipuram East Part, 561 persons of 152 families, totalling to 422 families and 1,572 persons have to be resettled.

In Trincomalee, about 1,200 families consisting of 6,000 persons were chased away from Sampur, which was declared a High Security Zone. Those 6,000 persons, for the last five years, have been detained in camps. After chasing those 6,000 persons, the Government declared a 15,000-acre land as a High Security Zone and people cannot go there. As a result of this, people living in four villages are unable to go to their own lands. The Government declared 15,000 acres as a High Security Zone. They need only 10,000 acres for the coal power plant and in the balance 10,000 acres, those people of Sampur could be resettled.

In Mannar, people are not allowed to go and resettle in the Mullikulam village by the army. The people who got displaced in the village of Sannar in 1986 went to

139 140

India. Some of the families came back to resettle in that village. They have been there for the last three months. On Thaipongal day, army and police officers took away all the documents including the dry ration coupons from them and one week later, they were told that their names had been deleted from the list of occupants of that village and that they have to find some other place. Where can they go? They came from India.

In the Mullaitivu District, in the Puthukudiyirrupu Divisional Secretary's Division, 11,535 persons have to be resettled and the Government is trying to relocate people from Mullivaikkal East and Mullivaikkal West, not in their villages but in Kombavil. In the Maritime Pattu Division, people from Keppapulavu, totalling 1,336 persons, are not allowed to go and resettle in that village. Those people have been resettled in the Vattapalai area but the people from Vattapalai have got their agricultural lands and the cemetery in Keppapulavu. So, the people from the Vattapalai village are unable to do their cultivation and cremate the dead bodies there. I request the Government to allow the people from Keppapulavu to resettle in that village because then only the people from Vattapalai can do their cultivation.

The Government should understand that preventing a person from going and living in his or her own land is a flagrant violation of his or her fundamental rights. The Government is trying to settle some Sinhalese families in the Tamil areas in the Mullaitivu District though they do not have any documents to prove that they have been living there.

Thank you.
