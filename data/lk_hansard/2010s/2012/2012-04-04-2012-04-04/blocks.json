The Sri Lankan State has been insensitive and callous in dealing with the issues pertaining to the Tamil people, particularly in the North and the East. It was only the Tamil people who stood up politically against the Sri Lankan State, though it must be acknowledged that the Tamil-speaking Muslim people in the North and the East have also had similar issues and concerns. It is the Tamil people who have shown the resilience to stand up to the Sri Lankan State. More than six decades later, after the country attained Independence, we still show that resilience. That is because we are an ancient people with our own civilization and our distinct identity. We are prepared to be integrated into the Sri Lankan nation but we cannot be and will not be assimilated.",

The wording of the resolution was tweaked by India to say the implementation assistance the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights will provide must be with Sri Lanka's concurrence. Yet, Colombo must not misread this concession. Thursday's resolution is the first real sign that the world will no more let itself be guided solely by Sri Lankan claims that it has the will to carry out its own probe. It also means that gentle prodding and quiet diplomacy will not be the main means the world will adopt towards the island nation. Few would dispute that Sri Lanka took too long to acknowledge the allegations of extra-judicial killings and enforced disappearances and delayed moves towards a political settlement indefinitely. Ultimately, its own Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission' came out with some constructive recommendations, but these have not been followed up. President Rajapaksa may not like the Geneva resolution but he has brought it upon himself.",

What is welcome in India's latest stand is that it has outgrown its misplaced fear of the growing regional presence of China. Having voted for the resolution, the onus is now on India to remain engaged with the Lankan authorities, as its interests lie in promoting reconciliation and supporting the quest of Tamil Sri Lankans for justice, equality and dignity. The solution has to be Lankan-led. Persistent emphasis on accountability from outside may jeopardise the larger goal of reconciliation by giving a fresh thrust to Sinhala nationalism. India needs to brace for extraordinary diplomatic challenges ahead.\"",

We, for our part, respect the decision made by every country. We respect the decisions made by even countries that voted against the Resolution - I mean with the Sri Lankan Government. Well, we think it is the sovereign right of those countries to make their decision and we have no right to question that decision.

The Minister of Plantation Industries headed the whole delegation and there were so many contradictory statements which were made by different parties. Even the Government Spokesman said that their views were only personal views and not of the Government. So, today we are awaiting your response and whatever statement you are going to make is what the Government is thinking of doing with the LLRC Report. There is a famous saying that every test in our life makes us bitter or better; every problem comes to make us or break us; choice is ours whether we become victim or victorious. This is what you are going to face, Hon. Minister.",

It is in that regard that when we went there during the first phase of the high-level segment, when we had the meeting with 40 odd permanent representatives of countries at a luncheon hosted by the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, I told the attending representatives that, from my point of view, the reconciliation process as it stands, is faced with certain difficulties. But, in the meantime, the situation can get even further polarized when attempts of this nature, which are untimely and unwarranted, are made only within three months of the publication of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission Report. This is something that they have to avoid. But then, after having passed the Resolution, I am sure, those who mooted the Resolution would now see the implications in the country, and to a certain extent I feel vindicated that what I said that day has come true. As it stands today, we can see the polarization widening further, extreme forces on both sides of the divide taking very vituperative positions regarding the other and disturbing whatever that would ultimately come about. Therefore, it is important for us to bear in mind that in matters of diplomacy, it is important not to get sentimental and emotional about what happens. It is important for us to reflect on the future and to see how we can chart a path towards which we can guide this nation to ultimately achieve that objective that people want us to reach.",

The assurance given was that there would be a Thirteenth Plus approach. We did not know this till Mr. Krishna issued a press statement. Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, you were there. If it was wrong, you should have contradicted and if it is right, please tell us as to what happened at that meeting because only you were privy to this meeting.
