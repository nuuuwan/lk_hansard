".......the Select Committee reports to Parliament that one or more of the charges that have been levelled have been proved after the aforesaid charges of misconduct have been investigated.

It is an investigatory body, not a judicial body. , . . , .

Article 3 of the Constitution states that the sovereignty is in the people and that it cannot be alienated. Article 4 of the Constitution states that the people will exercise their sovereignty through the following three organs. The first is, the Executive - . The second is the Legislature - , . Then, the third is the Judiciary - .

Article 4(c) of the Constitution states that the judicial power shall be exercised through the courts, not by themselves, the Legislature. That is very important. Please bear that in mind because that is what our Constitution states. The very same Article 4 (c) - it is very clear - reserves

to Parliament, very limited judicial power to protect its own privileges, immunities and powers and it does not grant judicial powers beyond that. , .

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara - Minister of National Languages and Social Integration) - [ ] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) . Sir, this is a very important occasion. Do not try to ridicule Parliament. Do not try to ridicule the Judiciary. [Interruption.] Please wait. This will go down in history. - [Interruption.] - This will go down in history. If you make a mistake, people will blame you.

The principle here is expressio unius est exclusio alterius.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Sir, I rise to a point or Order.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) What is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Sir, the Hon. Member can read any document only after referring to the source. If he says, These are notes of my speech then, that is okay. But, if he reads from a document before the House, he must give the source. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Otherwise, how do we know from what the Member is reading?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) From the Constitution.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Let him finish, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Why can you not understand?

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) It is in the Constitution, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Give the source.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The principle here is expressio unius est exclusio alterius. That is where one class is specifically mentioned, that all others not mentioned are excluded. This is just a norm of it.

Sir, in this case, what is expressed is judicial power and its own privileges in respect of Parliament. Therefore, all other aspects of judicial power are excluded according to the Constitution. Then, if Parliament itself does not have judicial power, it is not legally possible for Parliament to delegate judicial powers to a Committee appointed by it. Now, that is the main argument that we are going to bring before you, Sir. So, you cannot give what you do not have . That is a simple principle.

Then, the Standing Order under consideration, No. 78A(2), requires the Speaker to appoint a Select Committee to investigate and report. Now, our main argument is, Sir, the fundamental obligation of the Select Committee appointed by you is a fact-finding Committee to investigate, find out what has happened and report to you. That must be very clear. Investigating and reporting has never been the function of a judicial body. Investigating and reporting is a police function. There could not be a more clear indication than the use of words investigate and report. That Standing Order has never intended to bestow judicial power on the Select

1625 1626

[ ]

2012 29

Committee. Sir, what we are trying to point out is that the Committee has been appointed and now the Committee is functioning. The Courts can entertain any application. There are three independent bodies. The court is quite independent of the Parliament and that of the Executive. So, there maybe applications; there maybe judgments that will come.

But, nevertheless, ultimately you will decide on the investigative report as to what action should be taken. So, I do not know why the Hon. Leader of the House is making this statement. It is very clear. There is nothing objectionable. The important fact as I stated, Sir, is, this will go down in history. You will go down in history as one Speaker who was fair in his judgements as against the Judiciary. That is what you have to bear in mind.

Sir, there will be other Hon. Members who would make some submissions. Please permit them to do so as this is very important.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I also take part in giving some observations as a Member of Parliament. At the moment, we are at a crossroads on a very important time where the Chief Justice of this country is impeached. It is not that this has not happened before, but the circumstances are completely different in this case. Sir, you would know that we do not possess judicial powers except investigative powers. So, on that particular basis, every person in this country is innocent until proven guilty. It is only the Chief Justice of this country - if so, desired by the Hon. Members of Parliament can bring in an Impeachment Motion - is guilty until proven innocent. That is the sole difference in this particular case. So, this is the reason why this has to be very cautiously handled and Hon. Speaker, I am happy that you are in the Chair at this moment listening to us.

Sir, Standing Order No. 78A (2) very clearly states, I quote:

Where a resolution referred to in paragraph (1) of this Order is placed on the Order Paper of Parliament, the Speaker shall appoint a Select Committee of Parliament consisting of not less than seven members to investigate and report to Parliament on the allegations of misbehaviour or incapacity set out in such resolution.

Misconduct per se is not misbehaviour. Even Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon, who was impeached first in this Parliament, was found that there was misconduct, but the Select Committee under the Chairmanship of the Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali found that there was no misbehaviour.

So, here is a situation where 117 Members of Parliament are themselves acting as the complainant, as the judge and the jury and the execution itself. So, there has to be an element of opportunity given to the person who is said to have conducted this misconduct to prove

innocence in this particular case. So, on this particular basis, the statement seems to be very cautiously laid out at a particular time when the interpretation of the Constitution is exclusively in the hands of the Courts. So, anybody who is delegated authority under Article 4 of the Constitution can go before court and obtain redress. So, what we are trying to say is that you are trying to arrogate powers as much as the Executive arrogates the powers of the Parliament and we have very meekly given in to that.

Are you saying that you are also giving the right to us which you have given to the general public under the Article 4 of the Constitution? We, the 225 Members of Parliament, are not the people of this country. The 21 million people in this land have the right to be heard and opportunity for that right is given under the Constitution. That is interpreted only by the courts. So, as a result, we do not have judicial powers, we only have investigative powers. May I take the opportunity to quote Standing Order No. 78A (8) which very clearly states:

All proceedings connected with the investigation by the Select Committee..

Hon. Speaker, that is the Select Committee that you have appointed which has only the investigative power. It further states, I quote:

appointed under paragraph (3) of this Order shall not be made public unless and until a finding of guilt on any of the charges against such Judge is reported to Parliament by such Select Committee.

Hon. Speaker, that is the reason why we asked you three days ago as to how the "Daily News" reported such happenings that were taking place in the Select Committee. So, on that basis, it is mischievous - the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva is a member of the Select Committee - to bring in this issue at this particular moment where the Chief Justice is impeached. - [Interruption.] Absolutely. I am not a lawyer but I am only reflecting this as a Member of Parliament. There is no restriction that the Supreme Court cannot entertain any complaint at this particular moment. After all, we are not the population of this country. We are only proxies of the people who have elected us to Parliament. There are 21 million of people outside who are enshrined through the Constitution the right to go before the courts and say, The Parliament is doing something crazy. We go before courts and try to get redress at this particular moment. So, where is the restriction on any member of the civil society, any person or any citizen of this country to go before Supreme Court and get an interpretation?

That is the reason why we find it mischievous, off point and out of time to bring in such a frivolous matter to Parliament at this particular moment. You are trying to tell us as to what we have got to do.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Speaker, -

1627 1628

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir. I just want to make a few observations.

I am also surprised that the Hon. Leader of the House has raised this as a matter of Privilege. I would like to remind that in 1987, his leader, a former Prime Minister (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike herself and the Chief Government Whip of today, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, went before court after the Determination on the Thirteenth Amendment was given. They went to courts - one, to the Supreme Court and the other, to the Court of Appeal - and instituted proceedings against the then Speaker. The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena is present here; he will confirm that. So, it is not a new thing for people, even for Members of Parliament at that time to go before court and seek to compel the Speaker. On that occasion, they wanted Parliament to go in accordance with the Determination given by nine Judges of the Supreme Court on the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

On another occasion, as recent as the 9th of October this year, Hon. Speaker, you yourself, making a long statement with regard to the powers of Parliament and the powers of court, set out very clearly that in terms of Article 125 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has the sole and exclusive jurisdiction to interpret the Constitution; that is part of our Constitution. So, that is the function of the court. When the court does its function as conferred by the Constitution itself and when that function is solely and exclusively within the province given to court, not to any other organ of Government, but only to the Supreme Court, that cannot become an issue of Privilege of this House. So, I am surprised that the Hon. Leader of the House has raised this as a question of Privilege when his own leader and co-Minister had done this previously and when, you yourself, Sir, about a month ago, made a clear Ruling - [Interruption.] I am entitled to make my observations, Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa. Why are you jumping the gun? One additional - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Hon. Member, you can continue. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, let me conclude soon. I also wish to draw the attention of the Hon. Speaker to Standing Order No. 78A(5), which causes a lot of concern because it says that the

judge concerned can appear before such Committee by himself "or by representative and adduce evidence, oral or documentary, in disproof of the allegations made against him. This is a serious concern because Article 13(5) of our Constitution states that all persons shall be presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. There seems to be only a special class of persons, just 23 people in this country - 11 Supreme Court Judges and 12 Judges of the Court of Appeal - who seem to be in a position where they have to disprove allegations contained in a Motion signed by one-third of Members of Parliament. That is grossly unfair; that goes against the basic norms, the basic principles of justice, on which our country has stood for almost 200 years. I can see the Hon. Susil Premajayantha listening intently. As a criminal law practitioner in the High Court, he knows that the fundamental principles of innocence until proven guilty seems to be breached by Standing Order No. 78A(5). I wish the Select Committee would take that also into account when it does its sittings. May I reiterate that this matter does not concern a Privilege of this House.

Thank you. - [Interruption.]

( ) .. ( () . . ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Mr. Speaker, the statement which was made in this House a little while ago by the Hon. Leader of the House refers to a very specific matter. Some of the matters that were dealt with by the Hon. Members who preceded me, in particular the Hon. Sajith Premadasa, are not really relevant to the specific issue that was raised by the Hon. Leader of the House. I think it is necessary to think clearly and to focus on the specific issues which are before you, Hon. Speaker.

I entirely agree with the view that was expressed by the Chief Opposition Whip, the Hon. John Amaratunga with regard to the nature and scope of the functions of the Select Committee that has been appointed by the Speaker. I agree with the Hon. John Amaratunga that the Select Committee is not in any manner possessed of judicial power, properly interpreted and understood. This is abundantly clear from the provisions contained in Standing Order No. 78A. What is the function of the Select Committee? Simply to investigate and report and further down in the Standing Order, it is declared that the Select Committee shall convey its findings,- the word used is findings - to Parliament. So, it is an investigative body. There is in law, a fundamental difference between the function of investigation and the function of adjudication. There is no adjudication that is being entrusted to the Select Committee. Its functions have to be conceived of in a fundamentally different manner.

So, the Hon. Speaker, on receiving the document that was signed by 117 Members of Parliament, has appointed the Select Committee. The Select Committee has commenced its work. It has already had one sitting. Its work is going on. Now, the specific question raised by the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva is this: What is the legality and acceptability of the action taken by the Court of Appeal in noticing no less than the Speaker of Parliament? The Speaker is the custodian of the rights of this House. I would like to remind you, Sir, of the antecedents of the high office you hold. It has a long history. When King Charles I of England tried to enter the House of Commons, there was this celebrated statement by Speaker Lenthall addressing the King of England. The Speaker said, Sire, I have neither eyes to see nor ears to hear anything other than what this august Assembly directs me. So, that is what the Speaker Lenthall said. So, Parliament is possessed of certain powers, responsibilities and functions. In pursuance of those powers, the Speaker on behalf of Parliament, has constituted this Select Committee. That Select Committee is a proceeding within the domain of Parliament. It is established law and practice that Parliament is the master of its own procedure and no institution outside Parliament

1631 1632

has a right to interfere in any manner with the internal procedures of this House. That is a sacrosanct principle which has been upheld and applied consistently, not only in this country but in legislatures throughout the Commonwealth.

In a very comprehensive survey of the law and custom of Parliament, the late Hon. Anura Bandaranaike set out very clearly the principles which govern the Speaker and this House and the duty devolving upon the Speaker at all times to ensure that no external body makes any inroad into the powers and privileges of Parliament and that no erosion of that authority can be countenanced in any manner whatsoever. Now, what has happened? Yesterday notices were served on no less than the Speaker and on all 11 Members of the Select Committee appointed by the Speaker.

They were noticed and they were asked to submit written submissions. The Speaker of Parliament is now ordered by the Court of Appeal to file written submissions. Nothing can constitute a more flagrant violation of the sacred rights, privileges and responsibilities of this august Assembly. With all respect, the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera was exactly right in saying that that is totally wrong. It cannot be defended or justified in any manner whatsoever. What the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera said is indeed self evident. There cannot be any logical argument which can be adduced against that proposition. The court has no right whatsoever to notice the Speaker of this House. It is an affront not only to the Speaker, but to all Members of this House and to the institution of Parliament because the Speaker epitomizes in every sense the dignity, the stature and the esteem of this Assembly. So, the Speaker has been noticed. He has been ordered to file written submissions and every Member of the Select Committee has received a similar notice and a similar order. Now, the question is, what is going to be our response to that?

Speaker Anura Bandaranaike has shown the way in a particularly illuminating analysis of the applicable law in which the late distinguished Speaker analysed with great perception and intellectual sensitivity the entire course of the development of the law. The English cases like Stockdale v. Hansard, Bradlaugh v. Gossett were very perceptively analysed in the Ruling that was delivered in this Assembly by the late Speaker, Hon. Anura Dias Bandaranaike. So, we have this repository of received wisdom which must guide our decision in regard to this matter.

All I wish to say to you, Sir, is that the applicable law and custom is abundantly clear and the duty now falls upon you, as it did on your distinguished predecessor, to give effect to those established principles of law and to uphold the dignity and the rights of this House. It is my respectful submission to you, Sir, that it is your clear duty to tell the whole world that this Parliament cannot be interfered with. We shall countenance no interference. It is a contempt of this Parliament. Clearly, indisputably, it is a contempt of this Parliament to have the temerity to

notice the Speaker of this Assembly and to order the Speaker to file written submissions. We must reject that with all the authority at our command. That is the only point, that is the only substantial issue that was raised in the statement that was made by my Colleague, the Hon. Leader of the House.

Many of the other submissions that were made were interesting, highly controversial, but they are totally irrelevant to the issue that was raised by the Hon. Leader of the House. It is that issue that calls for an explicit ruling by the Speaker. Therefore, Sir, with all deference, I ask you to uphold the dignity of this House and to hold that these purported notices served on the Speaker and the Members of the Select Committee are not worth the paper they are written on and that they should be rejected with contempt. That is my respectful submission to you, Sir.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Speaker, today we are discussing a very important issue. Democracy in Sri Lanka rests on three pillars: the Legislature, the Judiciary and the Executive. They are not subservient to each other and nobody can claim supremacy, I feel.

Sir, today the pubic have means of approaching their issues only through the Judiciary. So, the Judiciary, as an institution, has to be preserved. They have filed several actions against which the Leader of the House has raised a privilege issue today. Sir, no person in this country is immune to judicial control except the Office of the President and not even the individual who holds that office. As such, the individuals who have been noticed by the courts, I feel, are bound to honour the order of that court and appear before it because they have been noticed as respondents, as persons. No Parliamentarian is immune from judicial control and as such I feel they should appear before courts. If they have anything to object to, they should do that before courts but not ignore courts. Ignoring of the order itself would lead to chaos in the

1635 1636

judicial system and breakdown of democracy in the country. As such, the three institutions have to be preserved. In that regard, people have only recourse to courts and as such those who have been noticed by courts should appear before courts and answer courts; that is necessary.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) , . . , " ?" . . , " . " . - [Interruption.] No. I am referring to Lassalle, the philosopher. It is very relevant. If a hypothetical position be the case, then what happens? Will there be a vacuum? No. The Legislature has been there in any difficult circumstances that this country has faced.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Mr. Speaker, we have discussed this matter today in Parliament very vividly and it has been very clearly laid down by us that the powers that are vested with the Select Committee are not judicial powers but only powers of investigation. The three or four cases that are pending today before the court of law have been filed to find out whether the Committee that has been appointed by the Hon. Speaker has really got the judicial powers.

The Leader of the House of Parliament just mentioned to us that the court has issued notices on the Hon. Speaker and the Members of the Select Committee. The notices that have been issued by the Judiciary are in the normal course of events. If the Hon. Speaker and the other Members of the Select Committee have been made parties, the names will be mentioned and notices will be issued by the Hon. Judge to the Hon. Speaker and the Members. But, the question that arises at that stage - and it is for the Parliament to decide - is whether they are going to answer those notices or not. That is entirely at the discretion of this Parliament and the Hon. Speaker.

So, the basic idea of this whole issue is, why did they go to court? They went to court to find out whether the Select Committee that has been appointed by the Hon. Speaker has got judicial powers or not, and as it has been very clearly laid down in the Standing Orders, the powers that are vested with the Select Committee are only to investigate and report to the Hon. Speaker. These applications have been made in the Court of Appeal just to get a ruling from court whether that is in order. That is why notices have been issued and it is entirely at the discretion of the Hon. Speaker to do what is correct under the privileges of this House.

Thank you.

This is one of the main reasons why the diaspora is really unwilling to come to Sri Lanka. Also, there have been many statements made in the House as well as outside that the Tamils living abroad are trying to agitate and support the LTTE movement.

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) Hon. Member, do not mislead the House. They are running a transnational government among the diaspora. That is the main reason for them not to come to this country. We never tell them not to come to this country. We have opened the doors for everybody. Whoever likes to come, can come and develop our country. A large number of people from the diaspora are already here doing a lot of development activities.

You also complain that planes belonging to the Air Force are flying over Mullaitivu. They are flying not only over Mullaitivu but all over the island. From time to time, they have to do that.

If you do that and if you allow that to happen, I will predict that there will be a separate Muslim state, a Northern Tamil state and a Southern Sinhala state.

Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair.

[2.37 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Hon. Deputy Chairman, thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to speak during the Committee Stage Discussion. Before I speak on the subjects, I want to bring up an important matter, which is troubling the Tamil community in Colombo and other places, to the notice of this august Assembly. Last week, the Colombo Municipal Council passed a Resolution to change the name "57th Lane" to "Colombo Tamil Sangam Lane and it was gazetted. But, somebody had intervened and prevented it. We are very much worried about it. Is this the way you want to reconcile?

Sir, the main and the serious problem worrying the Tamils in Sri Lanka is resettlement. According to the President, 95 per cent of the displaced people have been resettled. That is incorrect. Nimalka Fernando, a social worker attached to an NGO, says that only one-third of the people who were displaced as a result of the war have been resettled in their own places. Though the President has told the UN Assembly that 95 per cent of those people

have been resettled, still there are a lot of people to be resettled. The United Nations has reported that in the Districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu, 117,888 persons have not yet been permanently resettled and further in the North, the resettled people, since they have no houses, are staying with their friends and relatives. Persons numbering 18,589 from Vavuniya, 4,928 persons from Mannar and 94,371 persons from Jaffna have not yet been permanently resettled.

In Valikamam North, many persons have registered themselves in the DS Office, Tellippalai for resettlement. In the Grama Niladhari Division of Palai Veemankamam North GN Division No. J/236, there are 1,502 family members; in Palai Veemankamam South GN Division No. J/237, there are 1,518 family members; in Kadduvan GN Division No. J/238, there are 631 family members; in Kadduvan West GN Division No. J/239, there are 733 family members; in Varuthalaivilan GN Division No. J/241, there are 1,063 family members; in Kurumpasiddy East GN Division No. J/243, there are 1,848 family members; in Vasavilan East GN Division No. J/244, there are 944 family members; in Vasavilan West GN Division No. J/245, there are 1,450 family members; in KKS West GN Division No. J/233, there are 663 family members; in KKS Centre GN Division No. J/234, there are 1,097 family members; in KKS South GN Division No. J/235, there are 571 family members; in Thenmylai GN Division No. J/240, there are 775 family members; in Kurumpasiddy GN Division No. J/242, there are 654 family members; in Myliddy North GN Division No. J/246, there are 3,271 family members; in Thaiyiddy East - G.N. Division No. J/247 - there are 699 family members; in Myliddithurai South GN Division No. J/248, there are 745 family members; in Thaiyiddy North GN Division No. J/249, there are 859 family members; in Thaiyiddy South GN Division No. J/250, there are 1,608 family members; Myliddithurai North GN.Division No. J/251, there are 1,521 family members; in Palaly South GN Division No. J/252, there are 1,232 family members; in Palaly East GN Division No. J/253, there are 1,806 family members, in Palaly North GN Division No. J/254, there are 1,652 family members; in Palaly North-West G.N. Division No. J/255, there are 611 family members and in Palaly West GN Division No. J/256, there are 817 family members who have registered themselves. Altogether, there are 28,270 persons who have got themselves registered in the DS Office and have been waiting for the last 25 years to go and resettle in their own places.

In Myliddy - "KP" is also from Myliddy South - nearly 5,500 persons are staying with their relatives and in makeshift huts at Maruthanarmadam and in some other camps. They have been waiting for the last 25 years to go back to Myliddy. When I went to Point Pedro, I met a lady and she told me, For the last 20 years, I have been staying with relatives. Let me, at least, die in Myliddy. I do not know why the Security Forces are putting up a fence across the lands from Kadduvan to Koddakapulam.

In Trincomalee, almost 1,200 families consisting of 6,000 persons were chased away from Sampur, which was declared a High Security Zone.

These 6,000 persons, for the last five years, have been detained in camps. After chasing those 6,000 persons, the Government declared a 15,000-acre land as a High Security Zone and people cannot go there. As a result of that, the people living in four villages are unable to go to their own lands. The Government declared 15,000 acres as a High Security Zone whereas they need only -

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran.

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) Sir, that area in Sampur is not a High Security Zone. The Government acquired that land, the 8th DS Division, for development purposes. That is not a High Security Zone; that is an industrial area.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) That is not a point of Order. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) You can reply later, Hon. Deputy Minister.

The Government has declared 15,000 acres as a High Security Zone. They need only 5,000 acres for the coal power plant and in the balance 10,000 acres, Sampur people could be resettled.

In Mannar, people are not allowed to go and resettle in the Mullikulam village by the army. In the village of Sannar, people got displaced in 1986 and they went to India. Some of the families came back to resettle in that village and they have been there for the last three months. On Thai Pongal Day, army and police officers took away all the documents, including the dry ration coupons from them and one week later, they were told that their names have been deleted from the list of residents of that village and that they have to find some other place. Where can they go?

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Vinayagamoorthy, you have only one more minute.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) In the Puthukudiyiruppu DS Division in the Mullaitivu District, 11,535 persons have to be resettled. The Government is trying to relocate people from Mullivaikkal East and Mullivaikkal West, not in their villages, but in Kombavil. In the Maritime Pattu Division, people from Keppapulavu, a total of 1,336 persons are not allowed to go and resettle in that village. The agricultural lands and the cemetery of the people from the Vattapalai village, which adjoins Keppapulavu, are in Keppapulavu. So, they are unable to go there and do their agricultural work. People from Keppapulavu in the Mullaitivu District have also not been allowed to resettle there. The last batch of displaced people from the Menik Farm Camp, who are from Keppapulavu, have been taken and dumped in a jungle. The Government intends taking over 2,500 acres from the Keppapulavu area.

Finally, I think we have to get used to implementing the Supreme Court recommendations and orders. In Jaffna and other places, almost all the lawyers boycotted the courts because they are against the Impeachment Motion.

Thank you.

[3.11 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman. The work of the Ministry of Resettlement is of crucial importance, and I am grateful for the opportunity given to speak on the subject.

Sri Lanka has implemented perhaps the most successful programme of resettlement in the world and the manner in which we have developed infrastructural facilities for people who were deprived of these for so long should be presented as a model for other countries in similar situations.

In this context, I am deeply saddened by the statements made by the Member who spoke just before me. She is much more concerned with Colombo issues than resettlement. I will not say that she misled the House because I think she has misled herself. But, if she actually

1727 1728

visited areas like Puthukkudiyiruppu, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi and Mannar as often as I have done, she would realize that what she had said is absolute nonsense. The schools there have got much better infrastructure than ever before and if she thinks that it is a pity that people should only have thatched houses, she obviously brings to bear Colombo attitudes on the situation there. Let me add that I spent nearly half of my Decentralized Budget for vocational training programmes in schools in Mullaitivu, in Puthukkudiyiruppu, in Kachilamadu and in Odduchudan and I wish people like her, instead of making false criticisms, would spend part of their Decentralized Budget as I do, in order to develop the lives of the people who have been resettled there. I would invite her to visit a place like Kachilamadu which is fantastic in its infrastructure now, much better than ever before and it is a pity to bring to bear Colombo attitudes towards the development that has been happening in the North. But, I would agree, Mr. Deputy Chairman that we should have done more to present the good things that are happening.

Systematic presentation of what we did, with exposition of the financial input of the Sri Lanka Government, the creative involvement of our armed forces, the excellent coordination of the Governors and the Government Agents in the North and the East should have been highlighted. I hope that it is not too late to make use of the reporting mechanism created by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to record Sri Lankan inputs too which are much greater than any other. This should be done at the Divisional Secretariat level because that is the unit through which progress can be seen most clearly.

It is also the unit through which we can register clearly what more remains to be done. For this reason, our records of the past should be accompanied by informed assessment of the gaps that need to be filled. That is why we need this Ministry to continue with its work though some have argued that, with resettlement almost completed, it could be wound up. On the contrary, we must now build on our achievements and ensure that those who are resettled and also those who remain to be resettled are fully empowered to contribute to their own development as well as the development of the country.

In this regard, there is much more that needs to be done with regard to human resources development, and I hope the new policy developed by that Ministry gives adequate coverage to the needs of the North and the East. At the Reconciliation Committee Meetings at Divisional Secretariats in those areas, I am moved by the needs expressed by so many people for better educational facilities. We must recognize that in the modern world, we must give our youngsters better skills with regard to English and Mathematics. Unless we do more for the rural areas of the North and the East, and indeed of the rest of this country, we will surely produce yet another

generation of disaffected youngsters, who express through violence, their resentment at the opportunities of which they are deprived.

Again let me add, Mr. Deputy Chairman, the previous speaker was talking about the difficulties that teachers face. But, she should recognize the efforts made by the Governor to provide transport for teachers and public servants in a context in which this is not present elsewhere.

We should also develop practical training at appropriate levels. I believe there is insufficient vocational training institutes in many areas in the North and the East. Though the Ministry of Foreign Employment has understood the training needs in areas where value can be added to the labour market, the failure to develop appropriate courses that include the development of soft skills is a pity. I hope therefore, that, as the Ministry of Resettlement transforms itself to deal with higher level needs than the basics it has supplied so successfully over the last few years, it will take on a forceful coordinating role in this regard too.

Another area in which it must do more is that of providing psycho-social support for the resettled. This is an area in which neglect will redouble suffering, and I have expended much energy in recent months in drawing attention to the problems and in seeking the active involvement of the Ministry of Health in promoting the training that is needed. We need more counsellors as well as community support services. In particular, we must provide support for the many single women and women-headed households in the area.

At meetings in the Divisional Secretariats, Sir, the need for women to have protection against violence is highlighted again and again. Though I am sorry to say that some critics of Government trivialize the problem by using it to attack our forces, statistics indicate that, far from the forces being at all responsible, it is domestic violence that is most prevalent as indeed elsewhere in the country. Alcoholism is rife in those areas, and we must ensure guidance and counselling and remedial measures, where necessary.

This morning I attended a Forum on Gender Based Violence where such matters were discussed, and we should make use of the assistance Non-Governmental Organizations can provide in this regard. I am happy too that Ministry of Child Development and Womens Affairs has also engaged actively in prevention work, through highlighting the remedies available. But, the excellent guides that have been produced in both Sinhala and Tamil have not reached all police stations and social workers in the North and the East. I hope the Ministry of Resettlement will assist with distribution and with training programmes to make use of them. The Children and Women Bureau Desks at police stations have recently been upgraded, and I am happy to note that while continuing with their awareness programmes, the police have also registered the need for counselling and initiated training for this. There is general satisfaction, Sir, with the work of the Children and Women Bureau

1729 1730

2012 29

Desks, but coordinated efforts are necessary and the Ministry of Resettlement is ideally positioned to take up the task.

Another area of concentration with regard to psycho-social support should be the anguish of those deprived of their loved ones. The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission made it clear that support for them should be given high priority, but I am sorry the Action Plan did not lay enough stress on this aspect. I can understand that it felt necessary to concentrate more on areas in which unfair criticisms are made. But, the need to defend ourselves against destabilizing criticism should not blind us to the real needs of the deprived. I hope that the Ministry will realize that it must ensure action in this regard, if the relatively satisfactory physical arrangements it has put in place are not to be undermined by psychological problems. It should work through the women and childrens units that the Ministry of Child Development and Womens Affairs has set up in all divisional secretariats and use the services of social service officers, educational counsellors and other workers in the field. But it must also ensure proper training in association with the Ministry of Health, and reporting mechanisms that limit people in need falling through the net.

Sir, the Ministry could also take the lead in ensuring supplementation with regard to services in which there are still inadequacies. I have noted previously how, while there is universal appreciation of new roads, electricity connections, hospitals, schools, transport still remains a problem. The President, in his Budget Speech, took note of such problems and suggested alternative mechanisms of providing services for those in need. But the experience of what happened last year, with regard to some excellent proposals in the Budget Speech, suggests that someone must take charge of implementation if good suggestions are not to be forgotten. In this case, the obvious candidate is the Ministry of Resettlement which has been given the importance of such services for resettled communities.

One other area in which, given the central role of farming in those areas, there should be greater coordination, is that of irrigation and water supply. I realize that coordination in this regard may not be easy, given that there are a couple of Ministries involved at the Centre, while provinces too have a role to play.

In Morawewa, I was told that problems had to be addressed by the Central Government in one area and by the provincial government in another. In Porativu, I was told of problems with regard to drinking water whereas the Ministry of Irrigation had other priorities. Though technical experts must reach decisions to ensure coordination as well as the attention to the needs of the people involved, we need the intervention of a coordinating ministry.

I hope the Ministry of Resettlement will undertake this. At the same time, it must bear in mind the backlog of old IDPs. We know that many of them have made new lives for themselves but there must be systematic recording of their fates with provision for return, if needed. For this purpose, we need much greater clarity with regard to laws and practices pertaining to land. Though the Ministry of Land and Land Development has begun to move swiftly and effectively in this regard, there must be clear information of the applicability or otherwise of laws and customs with regard to prescriptions and the Gazette Notification of 1989 which forbade reallocation of lands vacated because of conflict. We must also make sure that conflicting claims are dealt with expeditiously. Sir, the LLRC Action Plan lays down helpful guidelines and once the Ministry produces a new generally agreed Circular there is no reason why action should be delayed. We must move swiftly towards closure with regard to the problems caused by conflict and clarity with regard to legal provisions is vital. I have dealt with, at some length, Sir, with what remains to be done but this should not take away from the signal achievement of this Ministry and this country in the process of resettlement. It is precisely because our good name in this regard should not be sullied that I have suggested even greater attention to the frosting, as it were, on the excellent cake that this Ministry has produced.

Thank you.

[4.11 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran - Deputy Minister of Resettlement) At the outset, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Hon. Deputy Chairman for allocating precious time to me during the Committee Stage Discussion of the Eighth Budget of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance Government. Considering the value of time, I will ensure that my speech consists only of facts.

The Ministry of Resettlement was established during the latter part of the year 2005 by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa with the idea of Resettling the Internally Displaced People in a dignified manner in their places of origin and providing them with the necessary facilities to ensure prosperity.

Consequent to the dynamic leadership and the political approach of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, the terrorist activities that were continuing for nearly three decades came to an end. During the humanitarian action taken by the Government to safeguard the people who were trapped in the LTTE-controlled areas, there was displacement of many people. Hence, the Ministry that was established for the said purpose had fulfilled the responsibilities with the financial assistance from the Government and the international voluntary organizations, especially the UNHCR. The Ministry, under the leadership of the Hon. Gunaratne Weerakoon, the Minister, the valuable guidance of His Excellency the President and the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa, Minister of Economic Development and with the continuous cooperation of the other concerned Ministers, departments, government officials and international voluntary organizations has succeeded in the fulfilment of the responsibilities.

In accordance with the Mahinda Chintana, in order to ensure a better living standard for the resettled people, projects pertaining to construction of houses, provision of health, drinking water, agricultural incentives, self-employment and educational facilities were implemented in a successful manner.

In order to implement the functions of the Ministry, agencies such as the Resettlement Authority, the National Projects Co-ordinating Unit and the Infrastructure and Housing Development Project were established in the District of Puttalam.

The Resettlement Authority was established in accordance with the Resettlement Authority Act, No. 9 of 2007 for planning and implementation of resettlement of the displaced people in their places of origin with their consent. The National Projects Coordination Unit was established in the year 2007 with financial provision by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for the purpose of providing necessary facilities including security and other essential services to those displaced from the Eastern and the Northern Provinces and accommodated in welfare centres. The responsibilities of this Unit had come to an end on the 30th of June, 2012. The Infrastructure and Housing Development Project was established on 27th of August, 2007 with World Bank aid - we got a loan from the World Bank - to provide houses, sanitation facilities, roads and for implementing drinking water schemes for the displaced families living in the Puttalam District. The World Bank provided US Dollars 32 million for this project and the local contribution was Rs. 22 million.

1749 1750

2012 29

The resettled people were provided with dry rations for a period of six months with assistance from the Word Food Programme, Rs. 25,000 to each family with assistance from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other necessary facilities including drinking water, transport, agricultural tools and market facilities. As the second phase of activities, damaged houses were repaired and renovated in coordination with the governmental and Non-Governmental Organizations. At present, the Ministry is engaged in development of human resources and livelihood activities.

The Government and the Ministry had taken action on a priority basis in coordinating the activities with the World Bank, the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations International Childrens Emergency Fund, the International Organization for Migration and other international voluntary organizations for successful implementation of resettlement. The Foreign Missions have been duly appraised of the projects carried out for the said purpose.

Around 222,726 families consisting of 753,651 persons had been resettled in the Eastern Province and around 150,615 families consisting of 498,084 persons in the Northern Province. It should be mentioned that due to non-completion of the process of demining in the District of Mullaitivu, resettlement has not been done in some places. Also, in the District of Jaffna, because of the High Security Zone - we have already done resettlement of nearly 8,737 families in 39 divisions - there is delay in the process of resettlement. We have to resettle only in 14 GS Divisions in that area. The setting up of the High Security Zone is solely for security purposes and the lands will be released to the owners in the course of time.

On invitation by the Government of Sri Lanka, a delegation of 12 Indian Parliamentarians led by Mrs. Sushma Swaraj, the Leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party of India, visited the Menik Farm in Vavuniya on 18th April, 2012. The delegation was informed of the progress of resettlement. The members of the delegation had extensive talks with the remaining Internally Displaced People with regard to their resettlement, economic, social and educational issues and the delegation expressed their utmost satisfaction over the actions taken by the Government for provision of the necessary facilities to those concerned.

Resettlement activities continued in accordance with the recommendations made by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. At present, the refugees in India have started to return to the motherland. Around 924 families consisting of 2,779 persons have returned. They have been provided with permits and air tickets to travel. Also, a sum of Rs. 10,000 to each person over 18 years of age, Rs. 7,500 to each person under 18 years of age and Rs. 4,000 per person for transportation is being granted on their arrival. Further, each family is provided with non-food relief items to the value of Rs. 10,000 at the time of resettlement.

The following projects have been proposed for implementation during the year 2013: relocation of 6,959

families, who are at present living with relatives and friends and 1,336 families in 44 open welfare centres in the District of Jaffna at an estimated cost of Rs. 28 million, provision of a housing scheme for 375 families under the second phase of resettlement in Welioya at an estimated cost of Rs. 107 million and implementation of a project for relocation of 109 families at Keppapulavu in the District of Mallaitivu at an estimated cost of Rs. 32 million.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Deputy Minister, please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) Please give me one more minute, Sir.

Then, provision of water and health facilities to the resettled families in the Districts of Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Mannar and Trincomalee at an estimated cost of Rs. 116 million.

It is a well-known bitter truth that the diaspora gave large sums of foreign currency to those concerned to purchase weapons as they were very concerned about the continuation of the war in this country solely for their own benefit.

There is a saying in the English language that, "War means destruction and death" and it has been proved in our country. It is plain to any sensible person as to what was the outcome of the useless and bloody war that not only caused loss of many lives but also made people displaced and dispossessed.

Hence, the diaspora who gave funds to purchase weapons should be responsible for the consequences of the war and come forward to help the innocent victims of circumstance. They are invited to visit war-affected places and to learn truth from those very affected people. The urgent needs of the affected people are development of their livelihood facilities and proper education. It is regretted that some media in some countries try to mislead the world by their untruthful utterances. It should be understood clearly by those concerned that nothing can be achieved by violence. Further, it should be specially mentioned that because of the magnanimity, goodwill and discretion of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, around 12,800 militants who surrendered at the end of the war had been rehabilitated comparatively in a short period of time and were handed over to their relatives. Also, they are provided with financial assistance to enable them to start livelihood activities and such acts of generosity by the Government will be an example to some countries where such surrendered militants are detained for years.

Eventually, it is very much appreciated that some Hon. Members belonging to the Tamil National Alliance had been generous enough to participate at the

1751 1752

programmes for grant of relief by the Government to the affected people by floods in the Northern Province. We are hopeful that such gestures of goodwill from the TNA Members would continue in the future and thereby we would be able to work together for the prosperous future of the country.

Why should a remembrance day not be celebrated by the Tamil people of Sri Lanka? Today, in this country, on the 19th of May each year, you are having a triumphal celebration of the "Victory Day". You should not celebrate the "Victory Day" at all on the 19th May. It should be a national remembrance day for all those who sacrificed their lives during the 30-year war. If you do that, you will create reconciliation, and reconstruction will become a reality. Without reconciliation what you are doing is, divide the people forever. It would be magnanimous on the part of the triumphalists to embrace those who were defeated or who are perceived to be defeated and create a situation where true reconciliation can take place without treating this as a continuing war. When anybody says something today, you say it is the diaspora or the leftovers of the LTTE, who are speaking. This is very unfair. Instead of that, try to embrace those people, the people in the North and the East. They have genuine grievances; they have stated their grievances; they have put forward their proposals. Look at them with an open mind. Otherwise you will divide the people of this country forever and you will always have a situation where the people will be continuously divided.

Today, we are discussing the Votes of the Ministry of Resettlement. The Hon. Suresh Premachandran, while he was speaking, talked about certain things that were done by outsiders. He did not quote from any document, he just spoke. But, all that is here on page 22 of the English version of the Performance and Progress Report of the Ministry of Resettlement. According to that, a cash grant of Rs. 25,000 was provided by the UNHCR; dry ration by the World Food Programme; packets of non-food items by the UNHCR; agricultural tools to the value of Rs. 208 million by the Government of India; cement and roofing sheets by the Government of India; transport facilities by the International Organization for Migration and necessary fertilizer and seed material had been provided for commencement of agricultural activities. So, all these are given in your Report. When Mr. Suresh

1753 1754

[ ]

2012 29

Premachandran stated it here, the Hon. Minister got excited. Hon. Minister, he was quoting from your own document. Please do not forget that.

Today, the Government is talking about 100 per cent resettlement. It is not "resettlement" you have achieved, you have only achieved return to their homes.

There is a statement from His Excellency the President in your Report. It states, I quote:

The Displaced people from the Northern and the Eastern

Provinces are Back in their Villages."

He has stated the fact. He has not said a word more because you have not provided proper housing for them to be called, resettled. Even your Minister, in his statement in the same Performance and Progress Report says, I quote:

In terms of the functions and responsibilities entrusted to this

Ministry, the displaced people have been resettled mostly in their original places of residence and provision of necessary relief have been effected with great care and responsibility. In the process of Resettlement activities, the basic requirements including the infrastructure facilities have been provided.

But, he does not talk about housing because you have not provided housing. You yourself have in your Performance Report stated that deeds of 87,000 houses were destroyed in full. According to page 23 of your Report, 87,264 houses which have been totally demolished have to be rebuilt and 27,121 houses partly damaged have to be repaired. So, this is the situation. Just because the war went on for 30 years, it does not mean that you have to wait for 30 years to rebuild them.

You should build them within a period of three years. It is a very fair period. We did not ask you to do it in one year.

We had a Tsunami in 2004. It lasted only a few minutes, or maybe, one hour but rebuilding was done within three years. Sixty thousand houses were built. Why can you not do that today?

On page (i) of the English version of the Performance and Progress Report of the Ministry of Resettlement, His Excellency the President has said, I quote:

Each of the resettled families is being provided with

Rs.50,000/- to enable construct temporary shelters.

For each destroyed house, a sum of Rs. 350,000/- is being

granted ...

Where is this Rs. 350,000? He further says that for renovation of a house that has been broken a sum of Rs. 100,000 will be granted. Why is this not forthcoming?

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) Hon. Member, we have to coordinate with other line Ministries to do these things.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) But, no other Ministry has done it. Hon. Deputy Minister, your own document states that 123,000 houses

have to be built. - [Interruption.] Hon. Member, you sit down. You are a person who jumped from this side. -

[Interruption.] Let me speak. Please sit down. I will tell you how to do it. Do you want to know? India has pledged 43,000 houses. Are you facilitating it? After a long, long period, just now, the implementing agencies have been identified. Who are the implementing agencies? The UN-Habitat, International Federation of Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity and the NHDA.

( ) (The Hon. Palany Thigambaram) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Thigambaram.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Only now the Government of India has been authorized to identify the four implementing agencies. They have told that they will be implementing work on these 43,000 houses very soon. Still there is another 80,000 houses to be built. The President has said that for

each house, he is going to give a grant of Rs. 350,000. For 80,000 houses, you will need Rs. 28 billion only. You are spending Rs. 280 billion through the Ministry of Defence. Can you not provide Rs. 28 billion, maybe during the next two years, at Rs. 14 billion per year to complete these houses? Do you not think you have to do this? If you can spend Rs. 280 billion for defence, can you not spend Rs. 28 billion to reconstruct the houses that were broken during the war?

It is not that those people broke their houses. When the army was sweeping through the Vanni chasing the LTTE, people also travelled up to Mullivaikkal with them and that caused the destruction of these houses.

So, the Government has a responsibility in this regard. Twenty eight billion rupees out of Rs. 280 billion is just 10 per cent of your defence expenditure. Spend that; build these houses. Hon. Muralidaran, as Deputy Minister, ask this amount of money from your President. Take that responsibility yourself under the Ministry of Resettlement with your Hon. Minister. Redo it; build it. Do your duty to your community. Thank you.

[5.39 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Mr. Presiding Member, we are discussing the Votes on four Ministries today and in the interest of time, I will just confine myself to comment on the Votes on the Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration. I am privileged to speak after the Hon. Minister, whose comments and observations I mostly agree with. I ask myself the question, sitting through the Discussion today, listening to many Hon. Members of Parliament, whether this country is actually more reconciled today than it was on 19th of May, 2009, and the answer is not very clear.

There are two important documents which I would like to refer in this very short period. One such document is the National Policy Framework for Social Integration which has been put out by the Ministry. I think it is a very good document which states, I quote page i :

Differences are inherent to human nature, enriching

societies. It is important to embrace and respect diversity as integral to social development by inspiring transformation.

The Minister, Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara has also mentioned this in his Message, I quote page iii :

Sri Lankas diversity demands a conscious effort

towards social integration: the responsibility of upholding the pillars of ethics, education and empowerment; and to be pursued by all Sri Lankan people.

It also talks about a proactive cooperation between the State and the civil society, something which we lost somewhere in 2006 and 2007, but has been identified as an important component in the work of social integration. I would say, we need to develop the plans, the timeframes and the monitoring mechanisms of this policy document.

The other document that I would like to refer to is the Report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation

Commission - LLRC. They were tasked to look at events leading to the CFA from February, 2002 to the events concluding on 19th May, 2009. They were also given the task on Presidential warrant, to make recommendations on institutional, administrative and legislative measures, that would help the country avert a recurrence of such conflicts and also forge unity and reconciliation. The UNHRC in March, 2012 welcomed the constructive recommendations of the LLRC Report and it actually tabulated it into eight constructive suggestions. One was the credible investigation of allegations on extrajudicial killings and also on disappearances; the demilitarization of the North; implementing an impartial land dispute resolution mechanism; revaluating the detention mechanisms; strengthening independent civil institutions; reaching a political settlement on the devolution of powers to the Provinces; promoting the right of freedom for all and enacting the Rule of Law. Subsequently, the Government came up with the National Action Plan to implement these recommendations on the 26th of July, 2012.

As we compare the recommendations of the LLRC with the National Action Plan, out of the 167 recommendations - originally, there were 180 recommendations, but it came down to 167 after the removal of the Land Circular - we see that about 69 of the recommendations are fully included in the National Action Plan; 51 recommendations are partly included and 47 of them have not been included. In the interest of time, I am not going to go into the details of it. But, what I would say is, within the time frame for implementation, some recommendations could be implemented fairly quickly; some can be implemented within a year and some will take more time than that.

I suggest because the Hon. Minister is also in the House that we have a Progress Report to Parliament so that, we have an understanding of how the National Action Plan is working. I think that the focus should be answering to this Parliament, not always to the international community because we need to know what actually is happening.

I would just like to comment on only two matters. One is on the language policy which the Hon. Minister spoke about. Sri Lanka has certainly moved from the Sinhala Only Policy of 1950s to a far more progressive policy in terms of language. There are many problems on the implementation of that policy from trilingual nameboards, communicating in the language of preference of the citizen to Government websites still largely being in Sinhala and lots of administrative issues but we have commenced. When we get to the discussion of a new Constitution in this country, I hope that we will be able to say that we have "national languages" not "the official language" and "an official language" but just "official languages". I heard the Hon. Minister on his views on the English Language. I would like to put on the

1777 1778

[ ]

2012 29

table that we consider the English Language not just as a link language but as an international language and that could be discussed. I have said it before and I say it again that when our National Anthem is sung, let us sing it both in the Sinhala language and in the Tamil language so that the people of this country could actually sing it from their hearts. I know with the inclusive views of the Hon. Minister that he could take the lead actually in implementing this.

Mr. Presiding Member, on land ownership, we know that land ownership and its utilization has led to many wars. The elimination of the LTTE fighters was because of their intransigency and they were unwilling to compromise and be accommodative. This has established the principle that any citizen of this country must be able to make their residence in any part of this country. Just because there is an influx of minorities into the Capital City, we do not need to be insecure because it is a phenomena in capital cities across the world. In the same way, the people of the North need not be insecure when the Muslims and the Sinhalese begin to settle in the North. The unfettered right to settle in any part of this country must be established. The traditional habitats of the people, whether they be Sinhalese, Tamils or the Veddah community, must be respected and in consultation with them, all developments must happen. Their lifestyles must be appreciated. State sponsored resettlement of people with the aim of altering the mix or the ethnic mix in any given geography or even for economic needs must be resisted as they sow the seeds of distrust. Citizens must be left to their own migratory decisions and to their resettlement decisions. Those displaced during the conflict and those dispossessed during the conflict must be assured that their lands will be restored and every legal and procedural measure already mentioned in the reports are speedily implemented, so that they could go back to their traditional lands.

I know that we are living in an era of nationalism being paramount. But, my appeal is that it is not nationalism that is important, it is the national interest that is important. Nationalism is narrowly based on ethnicity, on religion, on culture and on primordial ties. But, it is national interest, it is harmony that should be paramount. It is the collective security of all Sri Lankan people, it is the collective prosperity of those who live in fishing villages of the North to the fishing villages of the South. It is that that is important. I think we must have a foreign policy which complements our export policy if we are to have national prosperity. Minorities must be given their space like other countries have found out, so that they could live at peace with the majority.

Devolution and the principle of devolution is very important. It was set out in the United National Partys response to the LLRC Report that was published; that we believe in the principle of devolution and we believe that decisions must be taken increasingly by people about

their own future. The uncertainty that prevails on the Thirteenth Amendment is not good for this country and it is certainly not good for this economy and the Government should basically make its position clear. If people do not feel a sense of belonging, even if the streets of Jaffna were paved in gold, those people are never going to feel completely at peace that this is their land. They are never going to be able to vote or live in a majoritarian State or vote for a Sinhala president with their heart. We are far from the Obama phenomena, the unthinkable happened in the United States of America when a black man was elected to be the President of that country. The closest we got was when the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna was promoting the name of the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar to be the Prime Minister of this country, but it was not to be so. We must all take note of the fact that one kind of extremism that has been dealt with cannot leave room for any other kind of extremism whether it comes from the North or whether it comes from the South. This is the land of all Sri Lankans.

Sir, we are an ancient society in which a generation is only but a pause. I came here believing that change is possible. The era of big government must give way to big society, must give way to thinking about society at large. When we think, we will act. When we act, we will change. Let us move from reports to actions. All of us have been born by some kind of accident as Sinhalese, Tamils, Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims or Christians. We have not chosen our destiny. It is all basically given, we are all the creation or instruments of that creation. Therefore, we have a common destiny and we have a start. I have confidence in the Minister of National Languages and Social Integration and I wish you well on the path that you have set.

Thank you very much. [.. 5.53]

RULING BY HON. SPEAKER ON THE QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE RAISED BY LEADER OF THE HOUSE REGARDING

SUPREME COURT NOTICES ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, Leader of the House, raised an issue relating to Privilege on the Floor of the House this morning. This arose from an event which occurred yesterday.

I found exceedingly helpful the detailed observations which were made on this issue by fifteen Hon. Members on both sides of the House today. The range and depth of the views expressed during the Debate, which I have reflected on, greatly facilitated my task in reaching my decision on the matters brought to my notice by the Hon. Leader of the House.

Notice was served on me yesterday, as the Speaker of Parliament, and on the Members of the Select Committee appointed by me on the 14th of November, 2012 to inquire into allegations against the Hon. Chief Justice under Article 107 of the Constitution. I, as the Speaker of Parliament, and the Members of the Select Committee appointed by me have been cited as Respondents in these proceedings.

These were Notices issued by the Court of Appeal, on the direction of the Supreme Court, in the matter of an application for mandates in the nature of Writs of Certiorari, Mandamus, Quo Warranto and Prohibition in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution.

The relief sought in these proceedings includes the following:

a) Issue notice on the Respondents in the first instance.

b) Grant and issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the determination and/or decision of the 1st Respondent to place the said alleged Impeachment Motion against the Chief Justice dated 01.11.2012 in the Order Paper of Parliament on 06.11.2012.

c) Grant and issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision and/or determination of the 1st Respondent to appoint and/or assign a committee made up of the 2nd to 12th Respondents to embark upon a judicial/quazi judicial process of inquiring into the charges against the Chief Justice.

d) Grant and issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the order and/or decision and/or determination of the 1st Respondent directing the Chief Justice to present herself before the 2nd to 12th Respondents for inquiry by way of a judicial/quazi judicial process.

e) Grant and issue a Writ of Prohibition preventing 1st to 12th Respondents from taking any further actions or steps in connection with the impugned Motion dated 01.11.2012.

f) Grant and issue a Writ of Quo Warranto requiring the 2nd to 12th Respondents to display under what legal warrant or authority they intend to embark upon a judicial/quazi judicial process of inquiring into the alleged charges against the Chief Justice.

g) Grant and issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to act in terms of the Law contained in Article 107(3) to formulate and adopt Laws/Standing Orders establishing a lawful and constitutional process governing the impeachment of a judge of the Appellate Courts, that is not in violation of specifically Article 4 (c) of the Constitution.

h) Grant and issue Interim Orders;

I. Restraining the 1st Respondent and /or agents and/ or officers serving under him from taking any further steps in connection with the said Impeachment Motion dated 01.11.2012.

II. Restraining the 2nd to 12th Respondents and /or agents and /or officers serving under them from taking any further steps pursuant to the notice summoning the Chief Justice dated 15.11.2012.

Now, I wish to explain to the House the basis of my Ruling.

In appointing this Committee, I have acted as Speaker in pursuance of the powers vested in me by Article 107 of the Constitution.

The Members of the Committee appointed by me are responsible solely and exclusively to me as the Speaker. No person or institution outside Parliament has any authority whatsoever to issue any directive either to me as Speaker or to Members of the Committee appointed by me.

This is a matter which falls exclusively within the purview of Parliaments authority. The established law in this regard was exhaustively surveyed by my distinguished predecessor, the late Hon. Anura Bandaranaike in his historic ruling delivered in this august Assembly on 20th June, 2001.

It is clear from this ruling that the matters concerned fall within the exclusive domain of Parliament and that no intervention in any form by any external agency is consistent with the established principles of law, and is therefore to be rejected unreservedly as an unacceptable erosion of the powers and responsibilities of Parliament.

I am happy to note that a broad consensus emerged in the course of the debate on the central issue requiring my decision. I would like to make particular mention of the view, clearly expressed by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition in the course of his intervention, that the purported Notices constitute an unwarranted interference with the powers and procedures of Parliament, and are invalid. This was stated with great clarity by the Hon. Joseph Michael Perera as well.

On careful consideration of this matter, I wish to convey to the House my ruling that the Notices issued on me, as Speaker of Parliament, and on the Members of the Select Committee appointed by me, have no effect whatever and are not recognized in any manner.

I declare that the purported Notices, issued to me and to the Members of the Select Committee are a nullity and entail no legal consequences.

I wish to make it clear that this ruling of mine as Speaker of Parliament, will apply to any similar purported Notice, Order or Determination in respect of the proceedings of the Committee which will continue solely and exclusively under the authority of Parliament.
