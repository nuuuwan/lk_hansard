[4.59 p.m.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, it is my privilege to my pay respect to one of the greatest gentlemen that we met in this House. The Hon. Rupa Karunatillake was a man of amiable qualities, a gentleman to the tips and he never carried any malice or hatred towards anyone. He was a friend of all and enemy of none. I had established a very close rapport with him when we were together on the other side. He displayed very great, sterling qualities. He had a humane outlook. He never detested anybody.

The Hon. Rupa Karunatillake had been of great service not only to the people of the Bentara-Elpitiya seat in the Galle District in the South but also to the rest of the Island. When he was the Minister of Plantation Industries, I remember, taking several deputations to him

479 480

where the Muslims in estates wanted a piece of land for their burial grounds. When earlier Ministers refused or retracted from helping, the Hon. Rupa Karunatillake willingly came forward and helped. I think it is there in several upcountry districts. Due of the graciousness of the Hon. Rupa Karunatillake, the Muslims were able to bury their Janazas in a Muslim cemetery.

The Hon. Rupa Karunatillake had his early education, as was told, at Niyangama Government school, Ananda Vidyalaya, Elpitiya, Mahinda College, Galle and Nalanda College, Colombo. We used to see him around the Zahira College Playgrounds. When Ananda College met Zahira College or when Mahinda College met Zahira College, Colombo, he was there to cheer his own school. I remember the Hon. Gamini Jayawickrema Perera was also there and he led the Nalanda Team at that time. As a result, he understood the aspirations and the rights of the Muslim community. He recognized them. When we wanted quasi-courts established in a proper manner, he was there to help us.

He followed a course in accountancy and business principles at the Polytechnic. After completing his studies, the Hon. Rupa Karunatillake was drawn into politics quite unexpectedly. His prime intention was to be of service to his native village and, in 1957 with the help of his father, he built a school in his village and donated it to the Government. The United National Party at that time picked him as the Chief Organizer for Bentara-Elpitiya and he won the seat at the 1977 General Election by a large majority of nearly 12,000 votes.

He was a very close friend of our dear leader of the Kandyan Province, the late Hon. A.C.S. Hameed, who was a Minister of Foreign Affairs. Whenever we walked into the canteen, we could see both Rupa and A.C.S Hameed engaged in very friendly exchange of ideas. I think they spoke about local politics and international politics. He learnt a lot of things from the Hon. A.C.S. Hameed. As a result, as I told you earlier, he had a mind to help, particularly, the Muslim community.

I remember, when I last visited the Thunduwa Muslim Maha Vidyalaya in Haburugala to which he had given buildings and other facilities, they recalled, Sir, the good work that he had done. But on that day, the Milad-Un-Nabi Day, I very sadly missed him in that school. But, the principal wanted more things to be done.

They wanted a nice assembly hall because the present assembly hall was over 75 years old and in a dilapidated condition. There are very talented students in arts and crafts studying there. I saw one of their wonderful exhibitions. Therefore, I would like to urge upon you, Mr. Presiding Member, - as an Hon. Member who represents that area, following the good foot steps of your late stepfather, bappa - to help them.

I also remember another gentleman, who very closely associated with him before he went to the Netherlands as Ambassador and even after coming back here. He is President's Counsel, Razick Zarook. They were very good pals. Razick Zarook, coming from Matara and the Hon. Rupasena Karunatillake coming from Bentara-Elpitiya in the Galle District had common aspirations. They wanted to help the people of that area. They were always seen together. As a result, I think he learnt certain things about the legal profession and the intricacies of law from my good friend, Razick Zarook.

Therefore, Sir, all in all, I would like to say, he was a man for whom we can proudly raise our heads and say, Gentleman, sweet dreams to you! because he had lived as a gentleman. He lived in this world for 79 years, seven months and four days. In Parliament, he adorned these benches for a long period of 22 years, 10 months and three days.

I wish, at this point of time, to pay our respects to his beloved wife Mrs. Hethumathi Karunatillake, who is in the Speakers Gallery listening to us and also to his proud children; Amal, Sangeetha and Sanjaya. We must also recall the names of the Hon. Rupasena Karunatillakes father and mother, the late Mr. L.G.A. Karunatillake and Mrs. J. Karunatillake. Though they are no more among the living, it was they who gave an excellent politician and an excellent human being to this world. We say, Mr. Rupasena Karunatillake, your name will be inscribed in letters of gold in this House for the noble role that you played in order to give a better living for the people of this country through debates and other contributions in this House. May his soul be sanctified!

Thank you.

[5.24 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Presiding Member, if I do not say a few words on behalf of the late Minister for Plantation Industries, this process of moaning the death of one of the best Ministers of Plantation Industries would not be complete. I, as a person representing the people of the plantation areas, the people of Indian origin, consider it a bounden duty to pay my tribute to that great man. Those Colleagues of mine who spoke in this House today paid tribute to him in very glowing terms.

I had the privilege of meeting him in this House during the period 1994 to 2000. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair.

, .

, , . Whereupon THE HON. GAYANTHA KARUNATILEKA, left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER took the Chair.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) During that period, I saw the Hon. Rupa Karunatillake as a simple, unassuming person, always quiet and calm, always approachable and a person who was generous with advice and guidance when young MPs approached him. He had the reputation as a person of honesty and integrity and nobody could challenge his honesty and integrity.

The Hon. Rupa Karunatillake was Minister for Plantation Industries in the Government of the late President Premadasa. That was a very crucial period for the plantations. The plantations were run by the State. They were running at a heavy loss, a loss of nearly Rs. 400 million each month, which had to be pumped in by the Government. The Government then decided, with the consent of my late leader Savumyamoorthy Thondaman, who was the giant in the trade union movement of the plantations, to privatize the management of those estates. That crucial change was done under the supervision and guidance of the then Minister for Plantation Industries, the Hon. Rupa Karunatillake. The transition was so

smooth that, at the beginning the estates were taken over - a lot of assets were there - the companies were not allowed to just throw away or sell those. They were kept under control and monitored. Over a period of time, those estates became profitable and that was due to the close monitoring of the estates by the Plantation Ministry under the guidance of the Hon. Rupa Karunatillake.

Another issue during this period was the welfare activities in the plantations on behalf of their workers. For the first time, a Plantation Social Development and Housing Trust was created. Today, it is called the Plantation Human Development Trust and it was through that Trust that welfare activities in the plantations, using foreign aid and Government funds, were started for the first time.

The Plantation Trust was a pioneering effort in transforming the lives of the plantation people and it was done during the period of the Hon. Rupa Karunatillake. It was through that Trust, the Ministry of Estate Infrastructure became a reality later during the period of President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. But, the pioneer was the Trust which was created during the period of the Hon. Rupa Karunatillake. The people in the plantations always looked up to him as a person who considered the welfare of the plantation workers as important as that of any other community in this country. In that regard, we pay our tribute to him.

We wish to convey our condolences and sorrow to the family of the Hon. Rupa Karunatillake and also to our Colleague, the Hon. Gayantha Karunatileka.

Thank you.

[5.38 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. DEW Gunasekara - Minister of Human Resources) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I move the Vote of Condolence on the Hon. Sangarapillai Sivathasan, an outstanding politician, who represented the Jaffna District.

He was born on 21stAugust, 1934 at Tellippalai, Kollankulati in Kankesanthurai. His father was Mr. Sinnathamby Sangarapillai and his mother was Mrs. Sathasivam Sellamuththu.

He was educated at St. Sylvesters College, Kandy and the Central Colleges in Tellippalai and Jaffna. Then, he entered the Aquinas College, Colombo and graduated from the London University. He entered the political field while engaging in his studies. He languished in prisons several times having fought for the cause of his people in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the Ceylon

Labour Society and was the Jaffna District Secretary of that Society. Since he led the struggle against the caste system that prevailed in the North during the period 1967-68, he was imprisoned once again. He was appointed as an Administrative Officer in the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation in 1970. As he was engaged in trade union activities, he had to face political victimization. He was a trilinguist; he was proficient in all three languages: Sinhala, Tamil and English. He was closely associated with Mr. N. Shanmugathasan, General-Secretary of the Ceylon Federation of Trade Unions and also helped him in the Communist Party activities. He joined the EROS Party during the period of the ethnic conflict and was elected to the North-East Provincial Council from the EPRLF Party. Subsequently, he joined the EPDP.

He took steps to establish trade unions in the Ceylon Transport Board, the Plantations Sector, the Kankesanthurai Cement Factory, the Paranthan Chemicals Corporation, the Elephant Pass Saltern and was dedicated to secure employees rights.

The Hon. Sangarapillai Sivathasan contested as an independent candidate and was elected as a Member representing the Jaffna District in the General Election of 1994 and served as an Opposition Member. He championed the cause of national unity in Sri Lanka and vehemently fought against terrorism. He underwent immense suffering during the time that he was languishing in the LTTE jail. However, he managed to escape from there and thereafter lived in hiding.

He was re-elected as a Member of the EPDP in the General Election of 2000 and he was fortunate to have saved his life from the bomb attack while he was working as the Chairman of the Palmyrah Development Board.

The Hon. Sangarapillai Sivathasan who played a pivotal role for the cause of democracy passed away on the 13th of November, 2011 at the age of 77.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, I propose that this message of condolence of this House on the sad demise of the ex-MP Sangarapillai Sivathasan, who rendered a great service for the cause of the Tamil people in particular, and for the country in general, be conveyed to his family members.

Permit me also, Sir, to take this opportunity to convey my own condolences to the bereaved family. He was a close friend of mine and also a comrade-in-arms when he was a Member of our party. I am personally aware that he had devoted his entire life for the cause of the people in general, and for the cause of the working class in particular. He was a patriot as well as an internationalist.

Thank you.

[5.43 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by the Hon. DEW Gunasekara on the late Hon. Sangarapillai Sivathasan.

The Hon. Leader of the Opposition had to leave early because he had some urgent matter to be attended to. So, on behalf of him and on my own behalf, I wish to express our deepest sympathies on the demise of the Hon. Sangarapillai Sivathasan.

The Hon. DEW Gunasekara talked about his life and his political career as well his political activities and from what I gathered, he was a trade unionist and in addition to that, he was a person who fostered national unity. That was a very important activity that the Hon. Sivathasan engaged in. He had to face many obstacles, as the Hon. DEW Gunasekara said. I remember he was jailed and had to undergo many difficulties. So, today we are here to recognize all his good work. As a Member he had served the people of Jaffna and rendered them yeoman service. So, please convey our deepest sympathies to the members of his bereaved family.

Thank you.

DEFEATING NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CONSPIRACIES AGAINST GOVERNMENT ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Sir, I move the following Adjournment Motion:

"This House is of the opinion that every concerted effort must be made to defeat the national and international conspiracies hatched against the President who has been twice elected by popular mandate and also the Government of Sri Lanka.

An extensive media blitz should be launched globally to enlighten the international community of the massive development programmes which are presently in progress island-wide." Sir, the whole world has realized that the West is hell-bent in destroying the free and democratic world in all parts of the globe. They aspire to continue to be the policemen of the world. This is because of the fire-power they possess. Who gave them this power? Divinity? Nay! It is satanic power! But, let them realize that Divine power will engulf them very soon.

They conveniently forget that the greatest fire-power is the power of the Almighty. He is the Creator of the Universe. The US, the UK and other Western powers will soon realize this fact and meet their doom.

To the Muslims, I should say, Allah has very clearly endorsed in the Al-Quran that the mischief-makers, miscreants and evil-doers will come to nought because All-power, All-knowing, Almighty is Allah. The Quran states, Jalla Jalaluhu Amma Navaluhu. It is nigh time that they should realize the folly of their dastardly acts towards mankind now.

International and national conspirators are endeavouring to decimate the Islamic world. Their spurious activities in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Bahrain and Syria has spurred them to now target this serene and peaceful populace of Sri Lanka.

The international media reported their execrable and wretched act of vilification. They reported how the

NATO soldiers desecrated and burnt the Holy Quran. They were urinating on the dead bodies of fallen heroes in Afghanistan. The axiom that the dead must be respected was brazenly thrown to the winds when they urinated on the dead bodies of fallen heroes in Afghanistan. Is this a human act? Is this humane behaviour, we ask the West? If they go on doing this, there is no doubt that there will be room for Talibans to be born and Bin Ladens to come.

Sir, page 2 of todays Supplement "World View" of "The Island" with a very glaring picture states:

Quran burning incites deadly riots in Afghanistan

Clashes between Afghan troops and protesters angry over the burning of Muslim holy books at a U S military base left at least seven people dead and dozens wounded Wednesday - "

The news item further states:

In Kabul, about 2,000 people massed outside a heavily guarded housing complex for foreigners, chanting Death to America as they hurled rocks at the compounds reinforced walls and set a fuel truck ablaze. The complex - known as

green village because it boasts security equal to a military base.

We must pay tribute to "The Island" for publishing these reports.

So, Sir, this is what is happening in the world? They think they can do anything in the world and get away. These international conspirators are now restaging a new drama. What is this drama? If I may put it in cricket parlance, they are trying to dislodge the worlds best-known batsman of peace from his crease.

His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa was elected twice over, the second term with an overwhelming majority by the people of Sri Lanka. He is a man of the people and he lives with the people. Unlike what happened in the disasters of the so-called Arab Spring, Sri Lankas scenario is totally different. The writ of the executive power of our President runs through our entire Island: North, East, West, South and Central. Know ye, the West! Let America or the UK or any country knows this. Look at this, Sir: Specific towns in Syria and in Libya and other countries of the so-called Arab Spring, were laundered with money and backed by the media blitz to cause chaos and confusion against their respective regimes. In similar fashion, after the fuel price increase, which was inevitable, we saw the Chilaw townsfolk in our country, chosen by these unholy elements supported by some NGOs, being incited to revolt. The picture is crystal clear since all other fishing towns all over the island, even the worst terrorist-affected Northern Peninsula, the entire fishing community has accepted the subsidy granted by the Government as a result of the fuel price increase. A calm and peaceful atmosphere prevails all over, except in Chilaw and Negombo areas. How come, this? It is the local conspirators, local conspirators I reiterate, who are

503 504

working hand-in-glove with their international counterparts to incite and mislead a small section of the fisherfolk over here.

On the 27th of this month, mark the day, the day on which they will act the Geneva drama trying to besmirch the good name of our President, millions of Sri Lankans will take to the streets here to protect the President and to protest against these machinations of the international conspirators. Did Eugene Burdick and William Lederer not title his book, The Ugly American?

In Geneva, they pursue on endorsing an unwarranted Resolution, wishing to create a Syria-like situation in Sri Lanka to enable them to go on their spree over here.

The LLRC Reports recommendations are being addressed by this Government. In the midst of this process, we see our Opposition Leader urging the US Government and those mandarins now in Geneva to seek answers from this Government. This is decidedly a traitorous act. The Leader of the Opposition, at this crucial juncture in our history, I dare say, must be with the people of this country. Going through his past record as a political leader, we see that he had chosen to betray our national cause on several occasions. He went to the extent of asking the international monetary agencies not to fund Sri Lanka. Even in international affairs, he was pro-Zionist. What an anti-national behaviour is this? At the UN, he even justified the unjust invasion of Iraq. He is pointedly anti-national in every aspect in his actions.

Over here, Sir, the Leader of the Opposition chooses to pick on Muslims. He referred to his UNP colleague, Mr. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar as Rajapaksa Hewayalage Imthiaz Bakeer Markar" . This is an affront to Muslims. One cannot refer to a Muslim by the name of another religionist. On the other hand, a pure and noble Sinhala name cannot be desecrated. Here, he even insulted the Sinhala Buddhist community.

There is another coincidence here that I would like to point out to you, Sir. Our Hon. Leader of the Opposition addresses this House in Sinhala when he wishes to convey a message to the indigenous folk in this country, but he addresses us in English so that his Western friends would understand him loud and clear : one dish for the local populace and another dish for his Western friends. Who said Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde do not exist anymore? All such stratagems of these traitors will not do any good for them or for the community. They will remain in the Opposition for a very, very long time to come.

In the recent past we have always observed that endeavours by local or outside powers to harm our dear peoples President of our country have resulted in Providential protection. At a time when such antics are

being staged in Geneva, we find Providence has helped to unearth gems from the land of Mahinda Rajapaksa. You are trying to harm him but the God is giving gems in his own land where he was born, in the deep South. So, I am elated to call Sri Lanka, a "Gem of a Country". I am very glad to say, Sir, that our country is a "Bowl of Democracy." We sustain, protect and nurture the principles of democracy. After 30 years of a prolonged war of terrorism, the country today, Sir, is marching towards the launch of a massive development programme, unprecedented in its history.

That is why I say that we must have international media blitz so that the international community and the people who are gathering in Geneva will know - ( ) (The Presiding Member) You have only one more minute. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Yes, Sir. I will finish now. President Mahinda Rajapaksa occupies a unique position among the world leaders today. This fact was acknowledged when the person of the calibre of Ban Ki-moon met our President, in our presence, outside the UN Sessions in the UN Headquarters two years ago and suggested that our President should give leadership to South Asia since he commands the mandate of his people twice over.

In this scenario, I would suggest the Western powers, on behalf of the entire nation, to recommend the name of Mahinda Rajapaksa for the coveted Nobel Prize for Peace and Democracy, rather than resorting to their iconoclastic ventures.

Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Athauda Seneviratne) I second the Adjournment Motion but I will speak later, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) Sir, he cannot second the Motion. There should be an Hon. Member to second the Motion and an Hon. Minister to reply it. Anyway, if you are willing to accept it, I will - [Interruption.] Is there any provision to accept that kind of a -
