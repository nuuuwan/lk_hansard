( ) (The Hon. Felix Perera) . . [3.25 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Mr. Presiding Member, I was trying to bring in an Adjournment Motion during the last Sitting week and also during this week but because of a decision of the Party Leaders, I could not do that. I hope that at least in the future, I will get a chance to bring in an Adjournment Motion regarding some important matters in Jaffna.

Sir, I thank you very much for allowing me to speak on the Defence Services Command and Staff College (Amendment) Bill. Before I speak on that, I want to refer to the Gazette Notification of 6th March, 2012 issued by the President, which states, I quote:

By virtue of the powers vested in me by Section 12 of the Public Security Ordinance (Chapter 40), I, Mahinda Rajapaksa, do by this order call out all the members of the Armed Forces specified in the First Schedule hereto, for the maintenance of

public order in the areas specified in the Second Schedule hereto.

I am just asking this Government and the President whether this is the time for them to call out the armed forces. There is peace. It is because they act like that, we have gone to Geneva. Even the President is answerable to Parliament in terms of Article 42 of the Constitution. What is the necessity for him to call out the forces now? Is there a war? Are there any problems? What is the reason? I also want to find out from the Government as to when and how they declared an unofficial army rule in

Jaffna? What we have there is an army rule, not a civilian rule. Is it for this purpose that you are bringing in the army? I am just asking that. An army rule, not only do you find in Jaffna in the Northern Province, but in the other areas as well.

Now, what has the army done? Why is it that you have called out the forces? The Gazette Notification states for maintenance of public order. Can that not be done by the police? Is it necessary to call out the entire armed forces? I will tell you what the armed forces have done. For abductions, disappearances, unlawful arrests and white van arrests, who is responsible? I say that the Army Intelligence Unit and the people belonging to the army are doing this. When you commit a mistake several times, at least once, you will get caught. What happened to the Chairman of the Kolonnawa Urban Council? His brother was abducted only three days before the day on which it had been attempted to abduct him. Now, we know who is responsible or behind those white van arrests. Those continue to happen, not only here but everywhere, even in Jaffna.

For instance, todays "Daily Mirror" states, I quote:

Were Human Rights Activists Arrested? Court orders respondents to file objections by March 30.

Lalith Kumar Weeraraju and Kugan Murugananthan wanted to attend a procession that was to be held in Jaffna on the World Human Rights Day and on that day, they were abducted. Where are they now, I am asking?

Now, what has the Army got to do with the resettlement? That is what we are worried about. Take the Mullaitivu District. In the village of Keppapulavu which is close to Vattappalai, the army is not allowing resettlement of about 250 families. Vattapalai has been resettled but all the people in Vattapalai have got their agricultural lands in Keppapulavu and their cemetery is also there. What has the army got to do with this resettlement? His Excellency the President has made a declaration that there are no High Security Zones anywhere in the county and resettlement must be done by the respective Divisional Secretaries and the District Secretaries. So, why is the army preventing people from going and living in Keppapulavu? Again, from Mullivaikkal East and Mullivaikkal West, the army wanted the people to go and live at Kombavil. That is not the work of the army; the District Secretary or the Divisional Secretary will have to do that.

In Jaffna, I think you all know what has happened when we had a meeting at Alaveddi. Thank God! I was the first speaker and I got out of that place. But, the army came and assaulted the MPs and the people who were there. That is why we say we want a civilian rule. I know very well that we may not be in a position to get a suitable solution from this Government. That is another matter. But, what we ask is, at least give us a civilian rule. Why can you not do that?

In Valikamam North, there were about 47 villages which had to be resettled. Now, 24 villages have been resettled and another 23 villages have to be resettled including Miliddy from where KP hails. So, because the President has made a declaration that it is the work of the District Secretary, I wrote a letter to the GA, Jaffna to resettle these 23 villages in Valikamam North. She did not do anything; she forwarded that letter to the Commander of the Security of Forces with a copy to me. Why is the army dabbling in this resettlement? The Hon.Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran, the Deputy Minister has said - if I remember correct - that even areas where civilians are living will be taken over for the use of the army camps. Is that the position of the Government?

What happened to Mr. Lasantha Wickrematunge? What happened to Mr. Prageeth Ekneligoda? Mrs. Ekneligoda was in Geneva yesterday. What happened to her? She was scolded and treated very badly, shabbily by those people who went there to protest against the Resolution. She has gone there to protest as her husband had been abducted. If I remember correct, the former Attorney-General, Mr. Mohan Peiris, has said that Mr. Eknaligoda is in a foreign country. I kindly request Mr. Mohan Peiris to tell this lady, who is in Geneva now, as to where Mr. Ekneligoda is.

Who has done this? The army. I say the army has done it. Again, in Mannar, some people have returned from India to settle down but they were chased away by the army. In Valigamam North, in Mathakal, some people have gone to clear their lands and set fire to the shrub jungles but the navy has assaulted them and chased them away. They have not only assaulted these people but they have also assaulted the Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman who was there. Is this the way you treat the people in Jaffna? Why can you not hand over the work to the GA there? Let her administer. Do not give it to the Security Force Commander, Mr. Hathurusinghe - [Interruption.] The GA is not doing it.

Then, regarding the disappearances of journalists, we know what happened to Mr. Lasantha Wickrematunge. What happened to Mr. Ekneligoda? He is missing. So, now what can we do? Why do you not bring in civil administration and control the army? Somebody must be having some sort of a group to do this work. This is the real problem we have got in Sri Lanka.

Just after the increase in the prices of petrol, kerosene and diesel - the price of kerosene was increased by Rs. 35 - people staged demonstrations. What happened? A fisherman was shot dead. I think our President must be thanked because due to what is happening in Geneva now, people have forgotten the real problems that they are facing. So, it is with regret I am telling you that the cost of living has gone up to such an extent, that in the last month, at Varani, a mother and daughter have committed suicide by jumping into a well because of poverty. I think

there will be an economic crisis in one or two months time and again the prices will go up. At that time, there will not be a Geneva issue. You will have to bring down the cost of living otherwise people might rise up. That is all I can say.

Finally Sir, my only request to the Government is, please give us a civilian rule. I know very well that you cannot give us a solution. So, at least give us a civilian rule and please demilitarize our areas as early as possible.

Thank you.

(a) (i) The particulars of public servants from 2005 included in the Report of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka 2010 are tabled in the Parliament.

(ii) The particulars from 1980 to 2010 are mentioned in the Annexure.

(b) Can not be accepted.

The public servants are granted a special allowance of 5 per cent of their salary from 2011 taking the increasing cost of living into consideration and the Cost of Living Allowance is increased and paid every year. The monthly allowance thus paid at present in addition to the monthly salary is Rs.5,850

The public servants are provided healthcare facilities under Agrahara Insurance Scheme and the Government has rendered contribution in this regard.

The salary of the public servants has been increased by a high percentage with effect from 01.01.2006 compared to the previous year through the new salary scale implemented as per the Public Administration Circular 6/2006.

e.g: To K.K.S.

Salary received as at 31.12.2005 Rs.7,900/=

Salary from 01.01.2006 Rs.11,730/=

In addition, the public servants are provided various payments such as housing l o a n s , distress loans and festival advances in order to face the cost of living and to uplift the living condition of their families.

Steps have been taken by the Government to provide essential commodities and services at a convenient price at every possible chance. The essential consumables are provided at concessionary prices throughout the island by Lak Sathosa Boutiques and Co-operative Societies/Mini Co-op City Network.

A simple/single tax has been imposed in place of various taxes levied on 12 essential commodities as a measure to bring down the cost of living and it is revised timely taking the prices into consideration under the Special Commodity Levy Act, No. 48 of 2007.

In addition, import taxes on identified essential food items such as milk power and palm oil are cut off under the Section 19(A) of Customs Ordinance.

(c) Does not arise.
