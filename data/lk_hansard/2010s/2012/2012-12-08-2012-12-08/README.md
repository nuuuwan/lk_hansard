I have here with me the Examination on the Auditor-Generals Reports for the Financial Years 2008, 2009 and the Current Performance of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, which I table*.

It states that beyond the US Dollars 6.6 million, there are other losses. It gives the amount wiped out as Euros 8.025 million later in 2011. So, that loss is about 60 per cent of this investment!

Mr. Chairman, the important point is that the Hon. Minister misled the House and the nation reading out an untruth, a total falsehood - I will read that out - given to him by his officials, whoever the officials I do not care. What does he say? This is regarding the investment in these Greece Bonds. I quote Column 55 of the Hansard dated 17th July 2012:

The decision was influenced by the fact that at that time, there was a robust framework in place for crisis management in Europe supported by a Financial Stability Package.

Then he says, I further quote:

So, there was this big fund that the global monetary authorities created to save Greece at that point in time."

Yes, it was there to protect Greece, not to protect Sri Lanka.

He goes on:

Therefore, the risk was considered to be reasonably low and tolerable in the circumstances,..

Hon. Minister, this is bunkum, this is absolute bunkum. I will tell you why. The European Commission presented a document to the European Council on 24th/25th March, 2011 under the title, "Conclusions of the Heads of State or Government of the Euro Area of 11 March 201" and I will table* that.

It states that the European Financial Stability Facility - EFSF- that is what you are referring to here and which was going to be merged into what is called the European Stability Mechanism - ESM - gave itself preferred creditor status.

, :

In all cases, in order to protect taxpayers money, and to send a clear signal to private creditors that their claims are subordinated.."

It repeat, "that their claims are subordinated".

" ..to those of the official sector, an ESM loan will enjoy preferred

creditor status, junior only to the IMF loan.

The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris is here. He knows the law. What does it mean? When somebody is given preferred creditor status, it is like a secondary mortgage - is it not, Sir? - where the people who have preference do not have preference over the loans. It says clearly that first the IMF, then the European Financial Stability Facility were going to get merged into the European Stability Mechanism. So, it is not the Government of Sri Lanka. The Government of Sri Lanka did not have any chance in getting this money back. So, I ask you Sir, why did we make this investment? Now, it is relevant to find out when this investment was made.

The Determination of the Supreme Court case No. SC (SD) 15/2012 states, I quote

...clause 2(1), the Bill, recognizes expenditure estimated at Rs. 1335 Billion. Clause 2(1) (b) authorizes the raising of loans, whether in or outside Sri Lanka, not exceeding Rs. 1295 Billion."

Then it further states, I quote: This Court finds that the use of the term "hereby authorized", appears to be limited only to prescribing a ceiling .... and does not contemplate Parliamentary supervision, scrutiny or control of either the terms of the loans, the interest payable or the period of repayment. We find therefore that clause 2(1)(b) constitutes an abdication of the power of control by Parliament over fiscal matters, especially the control over the source of the finances which creates a debt of the Republic, as envisaged under the terms of Article 148 of the Constitution.

Therefore this Court finds that the provisions contained in clause 2(1) (b) and 7(b) of the said Appropriation Bill contravenes Article 148 of the Constitution and is therefore inconsistent with the Constitution."

So, what you have provided here is not a solution to the question raised. The amendment has nothing to do with the directives given by the Supreme Court.

Today, we have been given an amendment with regard to the Supreme Court Determination. ( ) (The Chairman) Amendment . () ( ) (The Hon.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , - ( ) (The Chairman) . [11.00 a.m.] () ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of International Monetary Co-operation and Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning) Sir, I would like to address some of the concerns raised by my Friend Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva and earlier by the Leader of the Opposition, regarding the Government's stand on the Supreme Court determination pertaining to the Appropriation Bill for 2013. You will recall, that the Hon. Leader of the House, at the Vote for the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill clarified to the House that the appropriate time for this discussion is the Committee Stage of the Budget. Therefore, I would like to explain the relevant facts pertaining to the two sections in the Appropriation Bill, to which the Supreme Courts attention has been directed.

Sir, the Supreme Court has directed its attention to two sections. One is, Clause 2(1)(b) of the Bill, which authorizes the Government to raise loans in or outside Sri Lanka subject to specified annual ceilings. The second aspect is Clause 7 (1), which permits the Hon. Minister of Finance, subject to the approval of the Cabinet - that is the Government - certain actions in the event of an unexpected fall in Government revenue or under expenditure in certain provisions.

Sir, the Appropriation Bill for 2013 is not the first of its kind in this Parliament. Over the years, Appropriation Bills have been presented to this Parliament using the same language and format and hence the 2013 Appropriation Bill is not an exception to this practice and procedure.

Sir, Hon. Members would note that the content of Clause 2(1) (b) of the Bill, referred to in the Determination are identical, except for figures, with the provisions embodied in previous legislation enacted as far back as the year 1961, and loans are raised adhering to the provision of respective applicable legislation. You would further observe that the proposed amendment in the determination with regard to raising of loans to meet cash flow requirements and the conduct of regular Treasury operations in a timely manner is impractical.

3161 3162

2012 08

Hon. Members would also note that the content of Clause 7 of the Bill, referred to in the Determination has been introduced in 1975, and has remained identical to date, with the addition of the words, to meet any authorized expenditure in 2002 consequent to a determination made by the Supreme Court in 2002. It should be noted that the Ministry of Finance and Planning has not come across the application of this Clause for a long period of time, underscoring that such provisions are generally of a stand-by nature and are used only when grave circumstances so demand in an eventuality to facilitate the management of public finance in the country.

You would note that Section 2 (1)(b) of the Appropriation Bill 2013, as in the case of previous Appropriation Acts, specifies the maximum amount of loans to be raised whether in or outside Sri Lanka on behalf of the Government. All loans are raised in terms of the provisions of various statutes subject to the ceilings specified in the respective laws and within the overall authorized limits specified in the Appropriation Act for the respective year. All these activities are managed by the Department of Public Debt of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in close consultation and coordination with the General Treasury in terms of Annual Budget operations. Since all loans are serviced in accordance with the provisions of the respective special laws, debt servicing aspects will not be carried out under the Appropriation Bill.

As far as domestic loans are concerned, under Section 89 of the Monetary Law Act, No. 37 of 1947 (as amended), the Central Bank of Sri Lanka provides Provisional Advances, on the basis that every advance shall be repayable within a period of not exceeding six months, and the total of such advance outstanding at any time shall not exceed an amount equivalent to 10 per cent of the estimated Government revenue in the Budget Estimates of the financial year in which they are made. Such advances are free of interest.

The Government also raises loans under the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance, No. 8 of 1923 (as amended) with a maturity not exceeding one year, subject to authorized outstanding limits under the Ordinance. The Public Debt Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on behalf of the Government, conducts this operation through primary dealers recognized by the Central Bank. The Treasury Bills operations are conducted to meet uneven cash flow situations that arise from revenue lags and expenditure leads. Recognizing such situations, the law requires that the Central Bank itself subscribes to such issues of Treasury Bills. However, depending on monetary policy considerations pertaining to domestic liquidity and money supply, the Central Bank also uses its holding of Treasury Bills to conduct monetary policy operations by trading (purchasing and repurchasing) such Treasury Bills. As the Central Bank, during the last 20 years, has increasingly moved towards conducting

monetary policy based on market instruments, such as interest rates and exchange rates, the determination of yield rates of Treasury Bills is left to market forces, unless the Central Bank considers that an intervention is necessary, in an exceptional circumstance.

Treasury Bonds which are of medium to long term maturity, are floated by the Public Debt Department of the Central Bank, in terms of the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance, No. 7 of 1937, at the request of the Treasury, to meet Government borrowing requirements as permitted in the relevant Appropriation Act. The maturity and interest rates of these bonds depend on the medium to long term yield curve, assessment of the availability of liquidity at different maturities and Governments cash flow needs. These operations are also conducted through primary dealers recognized by the Central Bank. The rate of interest of Treasury Bonds is therefore market determined. Both Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds also have secondary market transactions. As in the case of Provisional Advances, a fair amount of Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds are floated to re-finance existing loans at maturity. Further, Rupee Loans are also issued under the said Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance. However, these administrative debt instruments are no longer issued as the country has shifted away from such instruments in the backdrop of financial reforms carried out since 1977, and only a declining stock of Rupee Securities remains under this category. Up to a 12.5 per cent of outstanding Treasury Bills are also permitted for foreign investments as per a Monetary Board decision to reflect global integration of the countrys financial market. Hence, you would agree that loans raised in Sri Lanka to meet expenditure itemized in detail, in the Budget Estimates submitted to Parliament following the presentation of the Appropriation Bill and refloating of existing loans are subject to complex operational processes but are carried out within Parliament approved ceilings, in compliance with the applicable statutes, and also well within the overall ceiling prescribed in the Appropriation Act for the relevant financial year.

On the other hand, foreign loans are raised in terms of the Foreign Loans Act, No. 29 of 1957 (as amended). The Government raises such loans under four categories. The first category consists of loans raised from Multilateral Development Agencies such as the World Bank - WB - and the Asian Development Bank - ADB. The terms and conditions of these loans are common to all member countries, based on accepted categorizations. Selection of various projects and programmes are determined through a consultative process between respective agencies, line ministries and the Ministry of Finance and Planning under the guidance of the Cabinet of Ministers. Such projects and programmes and the related financing arrangements are reflected in the Annual Budget Estimates submitted to Parliament.

The second category involves Government borrowings from well-established bilateral Government

3163 3164

development agencies. The terms and conditions of these loans are determined by such bilateral Government Development Agencies and are common to all countries eligible to borrow from such agencies.

Currently, Sri Lanka borrows from Japan International Cooperation Agency - JICA, Economic Development Cooperation Fund - EDCF - of Korea, Saudi Fund for Development - SFD, OPEC Fund for International Development - OFID, Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development - KFAED - and Kreditanstalt for Wiederaufbau - KfW - of Germany.

The third category consists of borrowings from EXIM Banks of various governments - that is, India, China, Korea, USA, Malaysia, Hungary, Japan and reputed credit agencies which lend for project financing. The maturity structure, interest rates and other terms of such loans are negotiated through an intensive process under the guidance and approval of the Cabinet of Ministers. The term-structure of such loans also varies from project to project, depending on the socio-economic benefits and gestation periods of such projects.

Sir, it should be noted that the Sri Lankan economy has graduated to a middle income country status exceeding its per capita income well beyond US Dollars 1,000 and the available concessional funds are fast depleting. In fact, many Scandinavian and European countries no longer provide outright grants and concessional loans to Sri Lanka as the country is no longer an LDC. They lend through export-import banks and their terms are largely market guided. The available funds from UN Agencies such as the World Food Programme are no longer accessible unless in very exceptional circumstances. Truly concessional funding from ADB and World Bank are also on the decline. Middle income country status and the post-conflict situation would further reduce the access to concessional funding and outright grants. Therefore, a greater flexibility in loan operations should now be recognized more than earlier.

Each foreign loan is examined by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank as required in terms of the Monetary Law Act on monetary implications, with special reference to debt servicing capacity and Balance of Payments. All loan agreements are approved by the Attorney-General and the final legal opinion is issued by the Attorney-General confirming, inter alia, compliance with the laws of Sri Lanka which is a precondition to make a loan effective. All foreign borrowing agreements are executed after having obtained the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers and the special authorization by His Excellency the President, in terms of the Foreign Loans (Amendment) Act.

The fourth category of borrowings are raised from foreign financial markets under the Foreign Loans Act,

No. 29 of 1957 (as amended). Foreign Currency denominated Sovereign International Bonds are issued in international markets, with the participation of internationally reputed financial and legal advisers and fund mangers selected through a competitive bidding process. All related contractual agreements are entered into by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the Ministry of Finance and Planning with the approval of the Attorney-General and the Cabinet of Ministers. Such borrowings are all within the overall ceiling specified in the relevant annual Appropriation Act. The tenure and the interest rates of such loans depend on the size of the loan, market conditions and the international sovereign country rating. These ratings are given by internationally reputed rating agencies having examined the countrys economy and finance as well as the relevant legal provisions to operate in international capital markets.

Sir, you will agree that debt raising and its management is a continuing process that involves complex operational aspects and warrants a fair degree of confidentiality which cannot be maintained unless the operational freedom is fully secured. Hence, obtaining prior approval for such transactions or seeking ratifications for transactions already concluded is not practical and is likely to have an impact on the national interest and the economic stability, since it is likely to have implications on the continuous operations that are being carried out with checks and balances.

Sir, I am sure that Parliament would appreciate that during the past several years, the Ministry of Finance and Planning has expanded its reporting coverage in the Report published in terms of Section 13 of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003, providing a comprehensive coverage on the conduct of public finance and associated Government accounts and financial statements duly certified by the Auditor-General. In addition to this Report, a separate report is also submitted to Parliament together with the submission of the Budget Speech in compliance with the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act. This Fiscal Management -

This Fiscal Management Report consists of the Fiscal Strategy Statement in compliance with Sections 4, 5 and 6 and the Budget, Economic and Fiscal Position Report in compliance with Section 8 and 9 by the Hon. Minister of Finance. A mid-year Fiscal Position Report contains the performance of Government revenue, expenditure, cash

flow operations and borrowings during the first four months of the year. This Report also provides updated information, depending on the availability of information, price development, foreign aid, Government debt and official reserves. This report is issued by the Ministry of Finance and Planning under Section 10 of Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, which requires the Ministry of Finance and Planning to present the mid-year Fiscal Position Report to the public and thereafter lay it before Parliament. All these reports have been submitted well on time and under no circumstances has Parliament made any -

But, you are not providing estimates and actuals. So, Hon. Minister, do not mislead this House.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, according to the Standing Orders, he cannot mislead the House. ( ) (The Chairman) . () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I cannot be wasting my time.

Sir, there is no doubt that the Constitution stipulates that Parliament shall have full control over public finance. In doing so, I am sure that the forefathers did not expect this. That responsibility is vested in the Government through different legislations enacted by Parliament in respect of revenue, borrowing, debt servicing and expenditure authorization. Hence, these are time-tested provisions used by successive Governments being essential for the effective management of public finance. Operations carried out in terms of such Acts are subject to scrutiny by the Parliamentary Committees on Public Accounts and Public Enterprises. The Appropriation Bill is also one such arrangement through which Parliament authorizes limits on expenditure as well as borrowings for each year. Successive governments, therefore, have come to Parliament following a well established tradition, practices and legislative processes to get Parliamentary sanction for the Budget process, conduct of public finance and its multifaceted operational aspects have been carried out within that framework.

Therefore, Sir, if every decision envisaged in Clause 2(1)(b) of the Appropriation Bill is to require the prior approval of Parliament, it is a reflection that Parliament itself is required to be engaged in routine operational aspects of Government and the powers vested in the Cabinet and respective Ministers by the President would serve little purpose. In modern governments, delegation subject to proper reporting and accountability has been recognized for greater efficiency. Hence, this interpretation seems to have put the Government in reverse gear. As we all know, transactions connected with public finance are an ongoing process, as explained earlier and take place on a daily basis. If this interpretation eventually causes default payments of salaries, pensions, contractual obligations and debt services owing to preoccupation in micromanagement, the entire country will have to face consequences, to which

the Government is ultimately answerable. It should be noted that in this country, every successive Government has maintained the credibility of honouring debt obligations, both domestic and international, as well as other contractual obligations and public accountability. Sir, in this background, the Government is of the view that it is not advisable to compromise the operational freedom provided in Clause 2(1)(b) of the Appropriation Bill to the Government since it has far-reaching implications on the management of the economy and finance of this country.

It should also be noted that although Article 123 of the Constitution requires the Supreme Court to stipulate which Article in the Constitution should be complied with to pass the Bill as it is, this Determination is silent on that. However, in view of the total impracticability that stems from the incorporation of suggested amendments in the Determination that make the Government to require obtaining approval of Parliament for each and every loan transaction and considering the far-reaching implications on the conduct of public finance and, furthermore, that the Appropriation Bill is an annual authorization for borrowing and expenditure, the Government considers that Parliament should recognize the flexibility accorded to it to conduct public finance while, at the same time, respecting the concerns raised by the Supreme Court.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) So, are you ignoring the Supreme Court Order? Are you ignoring it?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Let me finish. Do not jump to conclusions. I am giving all the details. Relax.

However, considering the extensive coverage, including public finance-related information, given both in the Annual Report of the Ministry of Finance and Planning and periodic reports, which are prepared in compliance with the reporting requirements prescribed in the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act and since the honourable Judges have also noted that adequate information about such loans are not included in such reports, greater details of transactions relating to Clause 2 (1)(b) could be disclosed in the Annual Report of the Ministry of Finance and Planning.

As regards Clause 7, it should be noted that this Clause was incorporated in the Appropriation Bill in 1975. The Ministry of Finance and Planning has not come across any usage of this Clause. Successive Governments have managed fairly heavy expenditure involved even in national security under trying conditions. The general practice in incurring

3169 3170

2012 08

unauthorized expenditure is to take approval for Supplementary Estimates from Parliament. However, if there is an unexpected fall in Government revenue of unmanageable magnitude or authorized programmes need more expenditure, which could be financed from non-performing Votes elsewhere, it may serve as a useful contingent instrument to mitigate unforeseen circumstances. Nevertheless, the use of Clause 7(1) requires the approval of the Government, of the Cabinet, and hence, it is always a collective decision of the Cabinet. However, Sir, the Government sees no reason why such action could be placed before Parliament for ratification.

In this background, Sir, I wish to state that on the issues raised by concerned citizen groups and the views expressed by the Supreme Court in this Determination regarding the Appropriation Bill of 2013, the Government would like to place on record that due recognition of the practicability of the Government to function must also be recognized in the Budget-making process by the Legislature. Therefore, we have proposed two Amendments to the Appropriation Bill of 2013 and I hope that Parliament will extend its full support to adopt these two Amendments to ensure greater fiscal accountability from those who are engaged in such work. - [Interruption.]

Sir, I would also like to refer to some macroeconomic aspects that must be recognized and deliberated in a Budget Debate, since in addition to the legislative responsibilities vested in Parliament, the most important aspect is the control it has over public finance. Traditionally, we blame each other in these debates and concentrate on mundane issues, sometimes, wasting our productive time. What is important, however, as Legislators and as people representing the masses in this country, is for us to see that the conduct of public finance focuses more seriously on the underlying financial and economic considerations of the Budget.

As we are all aware, the world is in an economic crisis. The most advanced economies have gone into recession due to a variety of reasons. One major concern, however, is running high deficits and also the under-funded banking and financial systems in these economies. These countries are also debating the manner in which such crisis can be managed to bring about sustainable solutions to maintain economic stability. In the United States, there is a major debate to address what is called a fiscal cliff, which involves raising taxes and cutting expenditure to bring about some meaningful solution over time. The 17-member European Union is struggling to bail out their troubled sovereign Governments.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) You are sympathetic about the economic crisis in America.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Sir, can you not shut him up? He does not know what he is talking about. - [Interruption.]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I have asked you several questions and you are not giving answers. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Do not disregard Parliament like this.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The economic growth in neighbouring India has slowed down and their Government is making several attempts to introduce reforms to regain the lost growth momentum. China is also experiencing a moderation in their growth and is examining various measures to revive their development activities. The global economy is also confronted with high oil and commodity prices that have made countries to adjust to a new economic order in terms of food and energy prices and consequential adjustments in living conditions.

Sir, it is in this background that at least the 225 Members in Parliament should look at our Budget. We may have political differences and hence, different solutions. Some probably prefer a more Left policy and

3171 3172

bringing revolution to address economic challenges. Nowhere in the world have such revolutions brought any economic progress. Some parties want Centre-Right views, like our Friends opposite. But, they are also shy to say that they want privatization, liberalization, regulations, giving lands, downsizing governments and limiting subsidies.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is what you are doing now.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is your policy; that is the policy you have followed. Sir, if they are not for these policies, then they must explain where and how they differ from us. I cannot see whether they are in the Centre-Left or in the Centre-Right. Whether they are radical or "medical", we do not know.

Now, I want to refer to our Colleagues in the -

( ) (The Chairman) , .

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I want to tell our Colleagues from the TNA that the people, whether they are from the North or South, want equal opportunities for education, health and employment. That is why economic development is crucial. It is not ideology-based models but models based on hard reality that is needed and that is where our Government is succeeding. We have created a wide range of infrastructural projects. They are not only for urban townships and commercial activities but also for the villages which will create a revolution in irrigation, water, agriculture and the environment.

Hon. Members of the TNA, think of the Moragahakanda Irrigation Scheme. We have mobilized US Dollars 300 million to divert water to the North and certain parts of the Eastern Province. This water will feed

the Iranamadu Tank, in addition to several un-irrigated areas in the North Central Province. People in Jaffna and Kilinochchi will have drinking water from a water scheme which is now in the process of procurement which needs US Dollars 300 million investment. Consider the diversion of Deduru-Oya with an investment of US Dollars 50 million. This is being done with local funds and this project will irrigate most of the unirrigated lands in the North Western Province and bring 27,000 acres of land under cultivation. Think of Uma-Oya will divert water to the South and feed the Ruhunupura Water Supply Scheme which is now under construction with an investment of US Dollars 76.3 million. These schemes will generate medium-sized hydro-electricity. The Government has also committed itself to implement Yan-Oya and over 30 major irrigation schemes are also being rehabilitated. These are some of the projects reflected in the 2013 - 2015 medium term development framework and think of the economic transformation in those rural areas which are struggling due to lack of regular water supply. Looking at the benefits of environmental change, think of what Gal-Oya has brought to Ampara. That is what irrigation will bring to the North and to the rest of Sri Lanka.

Sir, I will not go into details of all sectoral investment activities that have been reflected in the 2013 - 2015 medium-term development framework. Let me dwell on one serious macroeconomic aspect. The 2013 Budget has committed itself to a Budget deficit of 5.8 per cent of GDP, which is the lowest since 1977. We have committed ourselves to this having proved ourselves that deficits can be reduced without cutting welfare and development spending. The Government has not privatized any enterprise. This year, in 2012, we are pleased to announce that despite many challenges and particularly the drought, the Government has kept the deficit target of 7.2. The deficit of double digit is a thing of the past. The same is proved for inflation, the same is proved for unemployment and poverty. Should the Minister of Finance and Planning not take credit for this? Look at the struggles that other countries are making to bring the deficit down. They are going through painful, unstable, violent paths. This has not been the case in Sri Lanka.

Look at the banking system here. All the banks are well capitalized and remain sound. Non-performing loans of all banks remain below critical levels. The banking system does not remain vulnerable which is also not the case in many other countries today. Should the Central Bank not take credit for this? They have performed well, in terms of our regulatory responsibilities. Many of you spoke about debt. Our debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen to about 80 per cent. Our intention is to bring this below 70 per cent of GDP. This can be done only by maintaining a higher economic growth of well above 6 per cent, gradual reduction in Budget deficit and managing well-distributed debt portfolio not only in terms of domestic and foreign debs but also in terms of proper maturity structures.

3173 3174

[ () ]

2012 08

This is what the Government has done in the last several years. While the Government has reduced the debt-to-GDP to 80 per cent, most of our debts are payable over 15 - 20 years. Out of this total debt stock, only 0.13 per cent is payable within one year, and 54 per cent is payable over 15 years. Therefore, taking the entire debt stock and dividing that by the years GDP is not going to give a justifiable indication of economic health. The debt-to-GDP ratio matters for countries where debt is payable in the shortest period of time. We do not have such risks. Further, we do not have commercial or other debt instruments which are on demand. Even the commercial loans the Government has raised are now at ten-year maturity instruments. They are currently trading around five per cent though we raised this at around seven per cent. This improvement is because the Sri Lankan economy remains buoyant and reflects a positive outlook. The Governments entry to the international capital market has established a benchmark for the countrys financial sector internationally. Following the issue of Sovereign Bonds by the Government, the Bank of Ceylon and the private sector have lined up their entries. The leading corporate sector and the development banks are expected to move in this direction. When this happens, excessive demand for borrowings from domestic banks will decline. When that happens, small and medium sectors access to finance will improve and that is how the economy will move forward.

Therefore, Sir, the attempt by the Government to systematically bring down fiscal imbalances, excessive borrowings, public debt, money supply, inflation and unemployment are economic aspects that every one of us in this House must value and this Budget must be viewed in the context of these very positive outcomes.

I would like to end by thanking His Excellency the President, who is also the Minister of Finance and Planning and also the Secretary to the Treasury, the Governor of the Central Bank and all those hard-working officials in the financial sector who have been successful in bringing this country to the level that I have described.

I thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Chairman) Yes, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Chairman, my previous interjection whether this meets with the Supreme Courts requirement was not

addressed by the Deputy Minister of Finance. I would greatly appreciate if you could get the Attorney-General to confirm to you that the Supreme Court Judgment is fully met with through the amendments that have been given to Parliament.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Sir, who is he to advise you on what you should be doing with the Attorney-General?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Who are you to be asking him? We have a right as much as you have.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Deputy Chairman, the Business of the House is conducted by the Speaker. Now, when he says that Parliament sat till morning, it is not a new practice. It had been happening in the old Parliament. Parliament sat the whole night during the Bandaranaike regime. Therefore, he is criticizing the Speaker because the Speaker is the guardian - [Interruption.] Money is voted for Parliament and it is an essential thing. That can be used for emergency. It is not - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Okay. If there is anything against the Standing Orders, it will be expunged. Hon. Anura Dissanayake, you continue with your speech.

Speaker has stated that no reference should be made to the PSC. So, it must be expunged. He is trying to defend Mrs. Shirani Bandaranayake. How can he do that?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Mr. Deputy Chairman, I think the matter with regard to the Supreme Court decision on the amendments to the Appropriation Bill was discussed in the morning. Has the Attorney General approved them and sent a letter of approval? May I know about it? I do not see the Minister or the Deputy Minister here. This is an important Debate. Who is going to answer?

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Attorney General has been consulted and he has approved the amendments.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Can I see the amendments?

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Amendments have been approved and they are on your table.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No, I do not see the letter of approval on amendments.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) It is on your table.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Why do you not send him a copy of that?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes, please.

Sir, there are some important matters which we raised during the last few days in Parliament. I raised a question on the 30th of November, 2012 in Parliament directed at the Ministry of Finance with regard to certain transactions of the share market and the purchase of the shares by the EPF and the ETF. The Hon. Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning did answer it but it was not a comprehensive answer; some vital information was withheld. He has not given the reasons as to why the EPF bought 33 million ordinary shares on the 10th of October, 2011 of Laugfs Gas (Pvt.) Limited at Rs. 48 when the share price was only Rs. 40.70 between the 4th and the 7th of October, 2011. That question has not been answered. So, we would like to have, before the close of the day, an answer to that. Subsequently, within a few days - this is on the same transaction - the share price dropped to between Rs. 38.30 and Rs. 41.40. So, we would like to know why this transaction took place.

Again, as at 5th December, 2012, the market price of the Laugfs Gas PLC was Rs. 23 and the loss to the EPF,

3209 3210

2012 08

to the workers, is to the tune of Rs. 575 million. These are factual matters I would like the Hon. Minister to give a reply.

Again, the same question. He did not give reasons as to why the EPF has bought on 1st April, 2010, Galadari Hotels (Lanka) PLC shares, which was around Rs. 20.75 each, at Rs. 34.20. As at 5th December, 2012, the share price of Galadari Hotels (Lanka) PLC was Rs. 13. The loss to the EPF, accordingly, is currently Rs. 400 million. That also has not been answered and we would like to have a reply as to why this transaction took place and the loss that was incurred.

Then, also he has not answered why Ceylon Grain Elevators PLC shares was bought 20 per cent beyond the market price.

These are some gray areas and we would like to know the reasons for the purchase of these shares.

Then, the next question was why the EPF bought shares of companies listed in the Diri Savi Board going against its investment guidelines, for example, Raigam Wayamba Salterns PLC and Sierra Cables PLC. There are basic guidelines that the EPF has to follow, but they have completely ignored and gone against them. So, please tell us what happened and how it happened.

Furthermore, he did not answer as to why the EPF invested in non-blue chip companies like Ceylon Hotels Corporation PLC and Lanka Orix Leasing PLC and what the current loss to the Fund on these investments is. So, it is another matter that we would like to have a direct answer.

He also did not name the brokers who were responsible for making these questionable transactions, the officials responsible for these investments and what action has been taken so far against them for causing losses to the Fund. He has also failed to answer that.

Finally, I would like to say that he did not answer on what basis, Mr. Jeyram Perumal who is responsible for running down Translanka Investments (Pvt.) Limited and Mr. Preethi Jayawardana, who is one of the parties to the "The Finance-NSB" fraudulent investments, were appointed to represent the Government investments in private sector bank boards.

These are some questions that we raised. Very unfortunately, the Hon. Deputy Minister read out a long answer and tabled it. But, he has not disclosed the most vital information. I would have been very happy if the Hon. Deputy Minister was here. I hope, before the end of the day, he would be able to enlighten us on the issues that we have raised.

Thank you.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe - Minister of Plantation Industries) Mr. Presiding Member, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity. I would like to congratulate His Excellency the President for having committed substantial financial resources of Rs. 763 million and a further Rs. 500 million, which will have a profound

impact on the promotion and protection of human rights, including funding required for the implementation of reconciliation initiatives identified by the Presidential Task Force, which was based on the recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. So, this has been given the highest priority. The initiatives to promote a trilingual Sri Lanka, social integration programmes, rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-combatants, issuance of land title documents and resolution of land-related issues, providing housing needs and strengthening local authorities and public services, have been and are regarded as priority areas by His Excellency the President and our Government. A Budgetary allocation of this magnitude has been provided under the Heads of respective disbursing agencies to address the above issues.

Sir, His Excellency the President, in presenting his eighth Budget Speech to this House, proposed a supplementary provision to enable the Government to fast-track the resettlement, reconciliation and peace-building process. Sir, when I delivered the statement on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka in Geneva on the 1st of November during the Universal Periodic Review Process, I placed on record specific examples of progress achieved in implementing two Action Plans. One is the National Action Plan for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and the other is the LLRC Action Plan, devised by the Task Force. Sir, I am proud to say that 98 countries made interventions on this occasion and out of those 98 countries, 90 per cent of those who spoke acknowledged that progress had been made in overcoming the post-conflict challenges and moving towards comprehensive reconciliation. I noticed during the course of the Budget Speech that some Members who took the Floor had not actually read the final document that was adopted by the Human Rights Council. They were giving all kinds of wrong interpretations to what really happened there but anyone who is interested in finding out as to what I am saying is correct or not, has only to go to the official website of the Human Rights Council and see very clearly that 90 per cent of the countries who took the floor on that occasion - some of them in fact had not voted with us - placed on record the tremendous progress that our Government had achieved in facing up to the challenges in the post-war conflict phase.

During the course of the interactive dialogue, two countries expressed the expectation that due process should be adhered to in the impeachment of the Chief Justice. I am not going to talk about the Chief Justice and I am not going to talk about the Select Committee. I respect the Ruling of the Hon. Speaker but I am just placing on record what was put forward when the UPR on Sri Lanka was discussed in Geneva on the 1st of November.

So, I immediately took the floor to answer these two delegations, and I pointed out that our Constitution

3251 3252

provided for an impeachment of a judge. I explained further that one-third of the Members of Parliament have to sign a Resolution identifying grounds for removal, which has to be handed over to the Speaker. Thereafter, a Select Committee of Parliament would be constituted from among Members of both sides of the House and a Resolution had to be then adopted by Parliamentary majority, after which removal is permitted. I simply put on record the legal position governing this whole issue of the impeachment. Sir, I stressed that what had been set in motion was a constitutional process envisaged by the supreme law and Standing Orders of this House. Any process that follows the predetermined process set out in written law cannot be said to be violative of any principle of due process.

So, the process leading to the removal of a judge of a Superior Court in Sri Lanka - known as the impeachment process - has been envisaged in the 1978 Constitution and has been given specific ambit and scope through the Standing Orders, specifically as amended in 1984. This process has been used on two previous occasions. Whatever the academic and theoretical arguments on the merits of this process are, at this point of time this is the constitutionally mandated process.

As I mentioned earlier, I will not speak on the substantive matters regarding the Resolution to remove the Chief Justice nor the proceedings before the Select Committee appointed by the Hon. Speaker to carry out the process mandated by Standing Order 78A pursuant to Article 107 of the Constitution. We are yet to receive the report to Parliament, which was forwarded only this morning. However, I would like to refer to international experience and comparative practice in other jurisdictions of interest. This is important in the context of underlining our commitments to the Rule of Law, which has a significant bearing on the economic stability this Budget has set out to further consolidate.

One of the questions that has occupied the attention of many persons interested in the matter is the competence and propriety of the House conducting this process. In several jurisdictions, including those within and outside the Commonwealth, including the US and the United Kingdom, the process leading up to the process of removal of judges, the Legislature - at national or state level - has a role in gathering evidence and addressing the Executive in removing judicial officers. So, we are no different.

An example of immediate relevance is the recent removal of Chief Justice Renato Corona of the Philippines in May this year. This is a very recent example, Sir. A majority of Senators found Supreme Court Chief Justice Corona breached the Constitution by not declaring assets worth US dollars 2.4 million in

foreign currency accounts. This is culpable non-disclosure of approximately Sri Lanka Rs. 310 million. When Mr. Corona applied to the Supreme Court of the Philippines seeking a halt in proceedings before the Legislature, the Supreme Court held that the process was a matter for the Legislature and not one for the courts. The Supreme Court cited the well-known judgment of the US Supreme Court in 1993 in the case of Judge Walter Nixon Vs. United States, that the impeachment trial before the US Senate was a political question and not one over which the Supreme Court could exercise any authority. Further, Sir, I would like to stress that both in the United Kingdom and in the United States, it is recognized that impeachment is a matter for the Legislature and is wholly consistent with the approach in Sri Lanka.

Sir, the Ruling of the Hon. Speaker, in response to purported notice being issued by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka cogently upheld these principles in the Sri Lankan context. Citing his predecessor, the late Hon. Anura Bandaranaike, he upheld the preeminent role of Parliament as set out in the Constitution with regard to the removal process of judges. Academic arguments to the suitability of the present process as set out in the Constitution and Standing Orders, must be translated into written laws by a process of Constitutional reform, legislative change and amendment of Standing Orders. Those who felt that the process of removal of judges was deficient, should not have stayed silent for years. There are avenues to generate discourse and initiate reforms. It is less than useful to challenge processes only when such processes are put in motion when calls for reform could have been made over the course of 25 years. We are now talking about reforms when the Standing Orders of Parliament have been there for 25 years. Now, everyone is paying attention to the Standing Orders and they are talking about reforms.

What is of primary importance Sir, is that Parliamentary procedures and practices are adhered to and the authority of Parliament to discharge its constitutional responsibility is adhered to. No matter who is involved, the law and dignity of this House must be upheld. Participation and the mounting of a principled and detailed defence is what may normally be expected of a person wrongfully accused by any tribunal. Disengagement and withdrawal from an investigative process can only lead to adverse inferences being drawn, especially when there is acceptance of, compliance with and participation in the process. Subsequent withdrawal on an insubstantial excuse is an affront to the constitutional process.

Sir, the reason that I referred to international practice on this issue of impeachment was to stress the point that we are no different from a number of other countries who pride themselves as being five-star democracies and as examples for others to emulate. No one is above the law

3253 3254

[ ]

2012 08

of the land. If one is innocent of charges levelled against one, the correct response should be to clear ones name by staying within the legal process and proving ones innocence with substantive facts, instead of stage managed withdrawals. Those who try to defend such behaviour or show solidarity with such conduct, only expose themselves of having other agendas other than seeing justice being done and democracy upheld.

Thank you very much, Sir. [3.21 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Sir, the Government and he Opposition Members have deliberated within the last two weeks of the Committee Stage Discussion, the salient features of the Budget, which was presented by His Excellency the President on the 8th of November, 2012 and the Vote for the Third Reading is to be held today.

Mr. Presiding Member, today, when we are discussing the Votes on the Ministry of Finance and Planning, I wish to stress one single factor here.

Today the country is facing a great trade deficit of US Dollars 10 billion. The export earnings are estimated for about US Dollars 10 billion. The cost of imports amounts to about US Dollars 20 billion. By the year 2015, the Government hopes to reduce the trade deficit to US Dollars 3.5 billion. That means, the export earnings will have to reach US Dollars 15 billion and the import earnings US Dollars 18.5 billion. I wish to ask the Hon. Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning, what steps will the Government take to reduce the trade deficit?

Sri Lanka has a very small domestic market. Entry to global markets can be only reached by improving the productivity and national competitiveness. According to the Global Competitiveness Index published by the World Economic Forum for the year 2012-2013, Sri Lanka ranks in competitiveness to 68. In the previous year, we were at 52. Malaysia is at 25 and Singapore is at 2 out of 144 countries. Sri Lanka may have to achieve at least Malaysias competitiveness if we have to bridge the deficit. The important features to gain national competitiveness are as follows: Raise productivity and competitiveness to improve the economic environment. Today, in Sri Lanka, the tariff barriers are very high and the procedures on documentation should be simplified. The Sri Lankan private sector has to compete on equal terms with the rest of the world. The creation of development of human resources labour, knowledge, science and technology inclusive of land, infrastructure and capital resources are essential. Regarding the trade barriers, Sri Lanka is ranked at 101 and Singapore stands at number 3. Regarding the burden of custom formalities, Sri Lanka ranks at 59, Singapore at 1 and Malaysia at 23.

Spending on research and development by the private sector should be much improved and our ranking index is 82 and Singapore is 8. The cost of agricultural policy should also improve tremendously if we are to achieve our target rates in exports. The Government should gain the confidence of the private sector and, in return, the direct investment by foreigners could be improved.

The sale of the State land to foreigners has been prohibited. The lease of the State land to foreigners will be permitted, subject to the tax payment of 100 per cent on the lease value determined by the Government Valuer and that should be an upfront payment. This restriction will also be one of the main causes for non-availability of Foreign Direct Investments in Sri Lanka. In this predicament of the financial status of this country, there have been specially-designed racing vehicles being exempted from the Excise (Special Provisions) Act.

At this juncture, I wish to ask the Deputy Minister of Finance why these exemption provisions are not provided to the private bus owners and to the public sector corporations to import vehicles worthy for the citizens of the country to travel in comfort in the urban areas and outstations.

Sir, if you consider the state of the farmers, an allocation of Rs. 1,000 million to assist thousands of farmers is commendable. But, at the same time, the farmers who are benefited by the fertilizer subsidy will be made policyholders of this compulsory insurance scheme by requiring them to pay Rs. 150 per every 50 kilogram of chemical fertilizer issued by the subsidy. Therefore, the benefit gained by the farmer is subsequently curtailed by this compulsory tax payment.

There should be lower unit costs of goods and services exported. The innovative ability will depend on the level of technology. At present, Sri Lanka ranks as 58; it was at 42 in the previous year and Singapore is at 2 in terms of level of technology. We have a long way to go to achieve the goal of competitiveness. Our Sri Lankan labour productivity is very low. The cost of labour is US Dollars 6.7, in Malaysia it is US Dollars 15 and in Singapore it is US Dollars 40.2. We should utilize our low cost of labour and the private sector should invest in construction and maintenance of infrastructure facilities. The improvement of governance by mainly setting up of public institutions including the Judiciary that are politically non-biased should be achieved. This is the reason that the United National Party has always advocated for the independence of the Judiciary, independence of the Police and independence of the Elections Commission. These powers which were embodied in the Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution have been repealed.

The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe just mentioned to us the procedure that had been laid down by Parliament

3255 3256

regarding the Chief Justices impeachment. I thank him for covering the legal aspect in the impeachment procedure. I totally accept the position that the impeachment had been carried out, to a great extent, in accordance with the laws and Standing Orders of Parliament. But, there is one major issue that has to be considered. When the Chief Justice was presented with the charges, I was made to understand, that she had to reply to the charges within about six hours, not even 24 hours, from the time of presenting the charges. Can that be the correct procedure? Is that audi alteram partem, where both parties are heard and is justice being given? That is the question.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) I did not touch on the Select Committee proceedings because we were not part of it. You were also not a part of it. I suggest that you wait for the Report, read the Report and then when we have the Debate, we can certainly talk about it. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Yes, okay, I will do that. ( ) (An Hon. Member) He is talking about the -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I am not talking about the contents of the Report. I am only saying that the charge sheets had been given to the Chief Justice -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Swaminathan, you go on with your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) How the Select Committee acted on that occasion would also be a part of the Report.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I am only talking of the procedure.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Let the Hon. Member speak.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) The procedure even in a court of law is that you are given at least two or three weeks to file the objections. Here, the charge sheet was given and within three hours time she had to reply to the charge sheet.

( ) (An Hon. Member) Hell of a court!

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I do not want to sit in judgment of this situation. These are matters watched by the international community. We are supposed to be a democratic country. The Chief Justice is one of the most important holders of office. I am not trying to defend her nor am I going to support her but the position is, there must be a democratic outlook and the procedures must be correctly maintained.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Exactly.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) That is what I am trying to maintain in this House. That should be looked into and it is an obligation on the part of this House to see that they are maintained.

In the democracy index, Sri Lanka falls into the category of flawed democracy with 6.58 points.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Banana republic.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Japan, South Korea and Mauritius have full democracies in Asia. This is not told by me. This is told by the Economic Forum. Therefore, we should be careful.

() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana) What about Malaysia and Singapore?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) They probably are No. 1 but they are not mentioned here.

3257 3258

[ .. ]

2012 08

() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana) Hon. Swaminathan, you should mention Malaysia and Singapore because you were quoting Malaysia and Singapore for all other things.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) You are in the wrong seat. Come to your seat and speak.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) I will give you the correct position. You can refer to it. I am sorry, I am not going to answer that question now. I am not going to answer that question.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Come to your seat and speak.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Our judicial independence receives 56 points whereas Singapore receives 20. This is what I am trying to say. As far as Sri Lanka is concerned, we have got human rights violations. The democratic process for inquiry is wrong. The Seventeenth Amendment has been amended. The President of the country after two terms can contest again for the presidential election of this country. Nowhere in the world, as you correctly said, except - [Interruption.] That maybe.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Two-thirds were not taken by votes.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) It was passed by this very House.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) How did you get the two-thirds?

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) We got two-thirds by legislators raising their hands.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Crossing over was not for voting. They crossed over for money and other reasons. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you continue with your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe) You cannot - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Why not? Two-thirds was by giving money and by giving other benefits.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please!

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) How can you have two-thirds?

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, please do not disturb the Hon. Member. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Sir, with regard to public trust in politicians, Sri Lanka ranks 112th compared to rank 17 of Malaysia. The magnitude of corruption was 9 per cent of GDP in 2006, according to our former President (Mrs.) Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, who was from the Government party. She had stated that 40 to 45 per cent of government expenditure was siphoned off due to corruption. Our foreign investment inflow has decreased from US Dollars 750 million to US Dollars 300 million. How are foreign investors going to invest in this country when the fundamental requirement of protection for human society is not available? If so, how do you expect Foreign Direct Investment to come into this country? That is all I am asking.

We are in the Opposition. Our duty is to oppose when the necessity arises. We are doing our duty. We are not trying to ridicule the Government. We really commend the Government where due. There are so many things that are commendable. But, this is a fundamental issue and we are being looked at internationally. Countries are looking at us jealously. In the month of March, next year, the United Nations might take up these issues. Then, who is going to give answers? That is my simple question. The present debt of our country -

3259 3260

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Member, - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) This is only for intellects, not for you. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Members, I do not want to be disturbed, please.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Azwer, please do not disturb him. - [Interruption.] Let the Hon. Member speak.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I just need a clarification.

( ) (The Presiding Member) No, no. He is not allowing it. So, please be seated. - [Interruption.] He is not allowing it.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) The present debt of this country amounts to Rs. 6 trillion. That is, Rs. 6,000 billion. That means, the per capita debt is Rs. 300,000; each person in this country is liable to pay Rs. 300,000. During the UNP regime from 2002 to 2004, the per capita debt was only Rs. 50,000 to 75,000. Today, the interest cost is Rs. 400 billion. But, according to the Budget Speech, it only amounts to Rs. 350 billion. One Hon. Member from the Government Benches got up and asked what we did during the UNP regime.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you only have another two minutes.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Okay, Sir.

Half of the debt of this country is on a commercial loan, the interest rate of which amounts to 8 to 10 per cent. What is the reason for this? Can the Hon. Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning give me an answer for that position? The reason for taking this commercial loan at a high interest rate maybe because the present total cost

of constructing one kilometre of road, which would have cost only Rs. 30 million to Rs. 50 million, amounts to Rs. 120 million to Rs. 180 million. Can you answer why that cost has gone up? That is why our per capita debt is increasing. Can the Hon. Deputy Minister explain why the cost of constructing one kilometre of road is Rs. 120 million to Rs. 150 million, which would otherwise have cost only Rs. 30 million to Rs. 50 million?

The repealing of the Seventeenth Amendment and the introduction of the Eighteenth Amendment, as I told you earlier, is one of the main problems created as far as the authenticity of the country is concerned. The promises given by the Government to the minorities from the year 2005 to date have not been fulfilled.

Sir, in my speech made on 15th November, 2012, I raised a very pertinent question regarding the presentation of this Budget. Winding up his Budget Speech, His Excellency the President had said, I quote:

Honourable Speaker, the journey towards poverty reduction and upliftment of our lower income people has become rough with the Parliament being dragged into a long process in passing the Bill to establish Divi Neguma Development Department. This amply demonstrates that we still have not reached the milepost that permit us to rest as a nation free of risks. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please conclude your speech. Your time is over.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Please give me one more minute, Sir.

His Excellency the President went on to say, I quote:

There will be more political, economic and natural Tsunamis.

I want to know from the Government, what did the Minister of Finance and Planning mean by There will be more political, economic and natural Tsunamis? - [Interruption.] Tsunamis do not come in an economy. - [Interruption.] Then, why do you present a Budget? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Is that to get Rs. 80 million of tsunami funds again? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please conclude your speech now. - [Interruption.]

3261 3262

2012 08

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Then, why have you presented a Budget and why is it being debated for weeks, if there is going to be a political or an economic tsunami? - [Interruption.] Then, why are we sitting and taking a Vote on it? -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Swaminathan, you time is over. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) With these words, Sir, I wind up. Thank you. [.. 3.36]

Hon. Chairman, at a time when inflation is increasing at a very rapid pace, the balance of payment is having a huge deficit; trade deficit is increasing, exports are declining, the stock market is reeling and also the confident factor is eroding, I do not understand what the Government has presented in the Budget for 2013 to this House. There are inputs made by the Ministers but has this Budget been able to defend them? That is the biggest problem that we are faced with. We mentioned that there is a huge erosion when it comes to the revenue factor. The costs are understated; the revenues are overstated. The Budget deficit is contained at 5.8 per cent in 2013 Budget whereas in 2012, the Budget deficit is over 8.6 per cent of the GDP. So, Hon. Minister, it is necessary for you to come forward and tell us as to how you are going to overcome this problem. You basically live in the past and say, "This happened, that happened, this is how it happens in America, and this is how it happens in India", but the least thing that you do is, you do not explain what is happening in Sri Lanka - [Interruption.] I have no time. Hon. Minister, your job is to wind up the Discussion. Rather than reading out a written speech, be practical. You are a person who is competent to make an impromptu speech. So, all you have to do is to listen to us and respond. These days you are carrying a bad brief and singing hosannas for dinner thinking that you can end

up as the Finance Minister of the country. Now, the problem that you have is, your Government -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) It is all speculation.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, you may be living in that speculation. The problem in your Government is, you have collusion, you have corruption and you have nepotism. You have not addressed any of these. This is the problem.

, . 2012 "Daily Mirror" . "Government Tax Default Rs. 40 Billion". 4,000 , ? 10, 12 , 4,000 ? ? , . . Then it states, "The Central Bank warns the Government". Now, is he taking up the economic role when he should be independent? He is warning the Central Government, "Do not borrow more than what you can pay". Is he a part of the administration or has he suddenly found out that he cannot defend himself after listening to a better and a knowledgeable person as the Finance Secretary and is now talking a different language.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) , . . . Sir, may I say that on examination of the proposed Amendment submitted by the Government, it is clear that it does not meet the conditions laid down in the Supreme Court Order. We have a duty by this House to meet the conditions laid down in that Determination by the Supreme Court on the Appropriation Bill. I do not know what the Hon. Deputy Minister has to say on that. That applies to Postponed Clause 7 as well, which is yet to come up.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Chairman, regarding both the Clauses, we have consulted the Attorney-General and he suggests that these two Amendments are in order.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) If you had done it, where is the letter you have received?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Sir, generally, the AGs opinion is made available to the House. But, Article 77(2) of the Constitution states, I quote:

If the Attorney-General is of the opinion that a Bill contravenes any of the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 82 or that any provision in a Bill cannot be validly passed except by the special majority prescribed by the Constitution, he shall communicate such opinion to the President:

That is, when we move an amendment and if Parliament is of the view that it contravenes the said requirements. But, we are not governed by that. There are two matters I want to raise. Sir, Article 123 (4) of the Constitution states, I quote:

Where any Bill, or the provision of any Bill, has been determined, or is deemed to have been determined, to be inconsistent with the Constitution, such Bill or such provision shall not be passed except in the manner stated in the determination of the Supreme Court:

The Supreme Court may or may not give the amendment. But, here they have suggested it. If you read page 5 of the Determination, it states, I quote:

This anomaly could be rectified if the impugned clause is amended to read, that prior to the obtaining of the loan, the terms of such loan must be approved by Parliament. If not this Court is of the view that clause 2(1) (b) would be unconstitutional as under its scheme, Parliament would fail to exercise the due and full financial control envisioned under Article 148.

That is Article 148 read with Article 4 and Article 3. Now, they have very specifically - [Interruption.]

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha - Deputy Minister of Technology and Research ) . . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) You listen to me and then reply. I have no problem. Then, the State in its submission has said that the reporting requirements of Financial Management (Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003 is sufficient. In this one, the Court says, it is not sufficient. Furthermore, what is unconstitutional? Unconstitutional is what they have deferred to. If you look at the term unconstitutional, it has already been defined. Unconstitutional is which is contrary to the Constitution. If you do not have it, it is contrary to the Constitution. If you take Norton Vs. Shelby, State of Tennessee which has been now done, it states:

An unconstitutional act is not a law; it confers no right; it imposes no duties; it affords no protection; it creates no office; it is, in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed.

It was also defeated in Edward Vs. Allen. So, there is a series of cases where it is inoperative. We have to take note of Article 123 which says this is unconstitutional, not anything else, it is unconstitutional. If it is passed in accordance with "unconstitutional", it is in conflict with Article 148 together with Article 4 and Article 3, and we have the cases. So, even if you try to act under this, it will be challenged like they challenged the Inland Revenue (Regulation of Amnesty) Act. What I would like to know is, has the Attorney General gone into the cases of Norton Vs. Shelby County, State of Tennessee, Edward Vs. Allen and the others in advising this House? It is not a question of special majority. - [Interruption.] You all can reply. I am asking you this question. If you have raised this - [Interruption.] What I am saying is that Article 123 (4) is a block. Has the Attorney General gone into this matter? If he has not, then we are in conflict with the courts because the court has given a decision under Article 123 (4). When the court uses the word, unconstitutional it has already been defined as to what "unconstitutional" is. Therefore, can you -

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

3321 3322

2012 08

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I am already on a point of Order.

Therefore, we have to ask whether the Attorney General gave his mind to this. Otherwise, this is illegal and the country cannot raise money. That is all that we have to find out.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Chairman) . () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Sir, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition has given his views on this matter. He is a learned Leader of the Opposition. But, unfortunately or fortunately, we have to go by the views of the Attorney General.- [Interruption.] Of course. His views maybe interesting but as a Government, we have to go by the advice given to us by the Attorney General.- [Interruption.] Sir, we listened to the -

( ) (The Chairman) .

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) As far as the Government is concerned, we have to comply with the decision given by the Attorney-General.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Let me finish first. The Attorney-General has had the benefit of looking at the order of the Supreme Court. He has studied it, interpreted it and given us the decision in writing. Sir, when this Bill is put to you for final signature, you will also be guided by the opinion of the Attorney-General as in the case of all bills. So, we must now proceed on the assurance by Government that the Attorney-General has said that it is not inconsistent with the Constitution. So, we must proceed.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Sir, there is no point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, I am on a point of Order.

( ) (The Chairman) There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Faiszer Musthapha.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) The Hon. Deputy Minister stated that he has brought this to the House in terms of what the Attorney-General has said. A written communication is not needed anymore and citing an authority is not going to help because very clearly the Hon. Deputy Minister of Finance has brought the advice of the Attorney-General to the notice of the House and there is no point in debating what the Attorney-General has said. With respect, Mr. Chairman, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition cannot debate the advice of the Attorney-General. That is not open for debate. The advice of the Attorney-General is not open for debate. You cannot cite case law and debate that. The advice of the Attorney-General has to be acted upon.

( ) (The Chairman) .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Chairman, referring to what the Hon. Deputy Minister has said, I would first like to say that this is a matter which came to the Supreme Court and it is exercising its jurisdiction in respect of Bills that have been placed before Parliament. Then, what we have here is the Determination made under Article 123. We have to go according to that Determination and in that, the Supreme Court may, under Article 123 (2), suggest the amendment. Now, the Supreme Court has given an amendment. If you do not follow that, then you cannot go ahead because you yourself said, Sir, that it is not the Attorney-General but the Supreme Court which can interpret the Constitution, except in matters concerning the powers of Parliament. Therefore, the question of interpreting this Bill is definitely within the province of the Supreme Court and we are governed by the Article 123, not by anything else.

So, all I am saying is that we have to go according to that and you can change the amendment if you want.

3323 3324

But, now you have got into a position of going by the Attorney-General. We have to be governed by the Court, not the Attorney-General. The Court has given the order with three judges: Mrs. Shirani Tilakawardane, Mr. Priyasath Dep, former Solicitor-General and Mr. Eva Wanasundera, former Attorney-General. This is a very learned court that has given the order. - [Interruption.] I am only interpreting the word, unconstitutional, not the rest of it. The word, unconstitutional has already been interpreted in law. Once the word, unconstitutional has been interpreted, has the present Attorney-General looked at these laws in determining it? What I am asking is whether the Attorney-General has -

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Chairman) There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. D.M. Swaminathan.

( ) (The Hon. Faiszer Musthapha) Sir, I raised it first.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Hon. Chairman, I want you to please clarify to this House, under what circumstances can the Attorney-General overrule a decision made by the Supreme Court of this country? In what circumstances, can he interpret it? He cannot interpret it. The order has been made by the Supreme Court and what right has the Attorney-General got to interpret that?

The Hon. Speaker will have to decide that, not the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General has no right to interpret an order given by the Supreme Court. - [Interruption.]

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama)

. . rose.

( ) (The Chairman) .

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Sir, the reformulation was done by us and submitted to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General is of the opinion that this formulation cures all the problems that were referred to by the Supreme Court. - [Interruption.] You may have other views on this matter but that is entirely a matter for you. As far as we are concerned, the amendments that we are presenting have addressed all those issues that were brought by the Supreme Court. -[Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Chairman, this is not a question of expressing opinions of the Members - [Interruption.] Please listen to me. The only issue is, the Supreme Court has very clearly said that permission must be obtained prior to the loan being negotiated. But, the amendment that has been suggested is to report to Parliament after the loan is obtained. There is no need to ask for opinions. It has been said very clearly said that permission has to be obtained prior to negotiating the loan but the amendment that is now being proposed is to report to Parliament after the loan is obtained. So, that does not in any way comply with the opinion expressed by the Supreme Court. This is not an opinion that we are expressing. That is an opinion that has been expressed by Supreme Court and unless it is amended in a manner that has been prescribed by the Supreme Court, it will not become law. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) . . rose.

( ) (The Chairman) .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Chairman, I want to make one matter clear. There are other Members on both sides who want to express their views. All I am asking you is to find out from the Attorney-General or his representative whether they went into the case of Norton Vs. Shelby County. [Interruption.] We have a right to ask. We are at the

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Chairman, with all respect, knowing that this issue would arise, today at 9.37 in the morning, I asked this question from you. Knowing that the answer would come from the Deputy Minister of Finance and he will stealthily, sleazily get out of this, we asked the Attorney-General to give the letter because in the case State Vs. Waters Edge and with regard to the Divineguma Bill, it was revealed that the information given by the Attorney-General was wrong. So, we, the Parliament, must satisfy ourselves that what is interpreted by the Supreme Court is carried out. There is no right of the Attorney-General to go above the Supreme Court. So, that is why we wanted that letter. The letter is addressed to you and you will tell us, "Yes, I have got it in my possession" - [Interruption.] I mean what is this sense of urgency? - [Interruption.] Just because they want to ruin the economy, they are doing this. These have been referred to as "intergenerational loans". Sir, Standing Orders were there in 1977; they were amended in 1982. Loans were then taken from multilateral agencies through bilateral agreements. But, today they are commercial loans. So, that is why quite rightly, the Supreme Court has interpreted that the exposure is too great. Hon. Deputy Minister of Finance, the rupee devaluation this year has impacted around 85 million. So, this is why the Supreme Court has said that we, the Parliament, that upholds the supremacy of public finance under Article 148 of the Constitution, have to do this. So, we must be told - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) Let him finish.

" This anomaly could be rectified if the impugned clause is amended.

And, it further states, I quote:

If not this Court is of the view that clause 2(1)(b) would be unconstitutional..

That means, this strikes at the heart of the Constitution - that Parliament powers of taxation and controlling finances are taken away, I do not know whether you can change it even with a referendum. You cannot change it at all.

Then, Hon. Chairman, the second matter is, the AGs representative is here in the Public Officials Box. The Hon. Swaminathan spoke to him. He has not got the AGs opinion. He does not know about Norton Vs. Shelby or anything. So, now, we are being told that the law is being given by the Hon. Minister, not by the AG or his representative. - [Interruption.]
