( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, with the present climate of the Greece Bonds that were bought and lost out, with the EPF which is an ill-timed investment that has been made, you are basically defending that the Central Bank has the capacity to buy and sell gold at the proper time. But, with what has happened in Greece and the EPF matter, is it not prudent that it goes through a more open tender process? This happens in all countries.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you just ask the Question. The Hon. Minister will answer it.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) For the last two years, as I have explained here, we have not sold gold.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Have you explained it?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What I am saying is, in terms of the financial prudence which the Central Bank seems to have - [Interruption.] In the case of Greece Bonds what has happened? EPF and ETF -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, I appreciate your contribution to this matter. But, the fact of the matter is that these are procedures which are followed by all banks. If you make this suggestion, certainly I will convey it to the Central Bank and ask whether they could consider it because they can always improve the situation. But, this is the way that it has continued for a long time. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Please ask your Supplementary Question No. 2.

171 172

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It maybe the procedure followed in Sri Lanka but all central banks in the world do go on an open and transparent basis which is professional. But, that is what is lacking here. When you were the Minister of Finance, none of this nonsense ever happened. What I am basically saying is this. When there are people who do not understand the transparency, that is the problem we face. So, I am telling you - () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, I am very grateful that you put me on the murunga aththa, but we will consider what you say. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I do not want to put you on the murunga aththa.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, please ask your third Supplementary Question. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The third Supplementary Question that I would like to ask is this. You basically did not answer the Question I asked about the gold that was confiscated in 2010. There were many instances where it was mentioned that "KP" had 19 vessels and almost 110 tons of gold. Also, it was on record that the army managed to seize two containers of gold. So, where is that gold now?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You have asked a Question and I have answered it. If you ask another specific Question - [Interruption.] No, that is not related to this Question.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) So, I am disposing of the grants. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I want to know what the total grant is and I certainly know that there is no payback on grants. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Okay. I have the details of the grants as well as the loans here with me. - [Interruption.] No. Do not jump the gun. You have asked for grants and loans. So, I cleared the air by saying that we need not discuss grants because there is no payback on that. But, since you wanted further information, I wanted to give you the details of grants. If you are not interested, I can leave that out and it will be included in Hansard. So, I will now deal with the loans.

UNFAIR MEDIA REPORTING OF PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES : STATEMENT BY LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) I want to raise one issue. On Thursday, 5th July, 2012, the Chief Government Whip raised a question about speeches not being covered in the Daily Mirror. At that time, I also got up and referred to a speech that I had made, which had received only one sentence in the Financial Times. If at all, it is a question of correcting it.

Anyway, I find that on the 9th of July, there has been a reply. If whatever I said was wrong, they could have corrected it or if they had some other position, I do not mind. But, I find that this statement involves all the Members of the House. They want to educate all the Members of the House on what the "Financial Times" has done and about the economy. I think that is completely uncalled for. If I have said something and they want to talk about me, that is a different matter. I can always reply. So, you must stop this habit of the newspapers who feel that they can educate the whole House.

I know some of us have been here from the time the economy was opened; the different Debates we had; the second round of liberalization in 1989/1990 when the economy had a downturn and a negative growth in 2001; thereafter how the monies were spent and how the economy was handled during the war. Even yesterday, I made a statement to which the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama replied. Today, there was an argument between the Government and the Opposition. So, if there is anything more that the "Financial Times" can contribute, other than a swollen head, I am sure that we are more than willing to listen. When a statement is made to say that they want to draw attention to something that is wrong, there is no problem about it as long as it does not amount to misleading the House.

Firstly, they said that it is recently that I started speaking on it. I want to tell the Hon. Deputy Speaker, I have been speaking about these issues in Sinhalese, both in the House and outside the House. It is only recently I addressed in English. Therefore, anyone who had read the

Sinhala or Tamil media could have followed it. I am sorry if the Editor, "Financial Times" and the staff are unable to understand Sinhalese or Tamil.

Secondly, he has said that the charge I made is that these people are all covering up the manipulating of the stock exchange and they will not expose it because they are part of it. Now, he claims he had done it and given a whole lot of exposure. But, none of them had any reference to the share market being manipulated. It is just a sale of prices and comments. Once they said, when the stock exchange was dipping Browns shares were purchased by the State. There were a few references to Laugfs Gas, but nowhere have they said that there was a manipulation or there were hints of manipulation or some people suspect it. If they have done that and I have missed it, I would certainly be happy to stand corrected on that matter.

On the same day, Monday 9 th July, 2012, when they replied, I find that they have also taken two pages out to defend the Stock Exchange in a way that even some of the members of the private sector are quite ashamed of. But, I do not want to go into the details on it. As far as I am concerned, if there is professionalism in the "Financial Times" or in any other business page, there has to be ethics for the journalists, ethics for the editor and ethics for the directors. If the "Financial Times" have those ethics, I will be more than happy if they can publish that. Then, we can judge their professionalism. Without that, we cannot. There are ethics for Members of Parliament and when we do not follow them, everyone shouts from inside the House and outside the House. So, if they have the ethics, first publish that. Then, we can see whether they have followed that.

When I happened to travel to Beijing on a visit, I did meet the Editor of the "Financial Times". He was going for the IOTA Conference on a delegation which was with the SriLankan Airlines. There was a representative of the "Daily News" Business Page - that is a State enterprise, I would not talk about it - and the Editor. SriLankan Airlines, as you know, has made losses. The Government might defend it in this House. We will attack it. But, those are issues that have to be discussed in any financial paper. So, if you are found travelling on it - whether the "Financial Times" paid for the ticket or whether SriLankan Airlines paid for the ticket - I do not know - that is certainly not a position you should be in. So, if they tell their ethics, then I would like to certainly judge them by their standard. I do not want to take any more of your time.

For people who want to educate this House, all I can say on behalf of the House is, the fool who knows that he is a fool can for that reason be a wise man. But, the fool who thinks that he is wise is indeed called a fool. The second applies to the Editor. With that thought, I conclude.

213 214

2012 18

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) I will bring this matter to the notice of the Hon. Speaker and inform you as to what steps he would take. That is a very relevant statement.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

"Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem."

Sir, it is a privilege for me today to speak a few words on the Adjournment Motion moved by my good Friend, the Hon. Shantha Bandara. This is a subject that every community would agree with, because it is said in all religious teachings that all elders must be well looked after.

The Holy Prophet of Islam (Sal.) has enjoined upon us as a prime duty to look after the old aged parents. The Holy Quran also says, Do not despise them. Do not neglect them. Do not look hard at them. Do not even say chee to them because they are people who brought us into this world. They looked after us when we were young. They gave us food, educated us, clothed us and made us good citizens, as a result of which, the community developed and became virtuous So, it is the training that parents give that makes a person, good or bad.

Therefore Sir, Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem, the Holy Quran clearly states: "RABBIGH FIRHUMA KAMA RABBAYANI SAGHIRA ..." It says to look after our parents as they looked after us when we were young. These are virtuous qualities that one should follow. That is why His Excellency the President in all his wisdom, through the "Mahinda Chintana" has taken steps to help various strata of the community. That is why he has not forgotten this section of the population - the old people.

In the 2012 Budget Proposals presented in Parliament, His Excellency the President, in his capacity as Minister

of Finance, has said to pay a monthly allowance of Rs. 1,000 to senior citizens who are above 70 years of age. His Excellency the President has not neglected the old. He is following the dhamma. He is following the Islamic teachings. He is following the Vedantha - Hindu Script - and also Christianity. It is mentioned in Christian history that annually during a certain period, Jesus Christ looks after the lepers, goes to them, cares for them and even washes their feet. This is a lesson for everybody to learn. It is not just that what a great religious leader did.

The Adjournment Motion presented by the Hon. Shantha Bandara states, I quote:

Action has already been taken to put the payment of the aforesaid allowances into effect from June, 2012 and senior citizens who are over 70 years of age as at 01.01.2012 and who receive Rs. 250/- monthly as public donations and receive Rs. 350/- monthly as Samurdhi assistance are eligible for this.

My good Friend further says;

"It is moved in this House that taking such action, in keeping with Mahinda Chinthana, to grant relief .."

Sir, I have got the "Mahinda Chintana" with me . I will read the relevant section :

To grant relief to the elders who have served their families, villages, areas and the public when they had the ability to do so, and have become physically weak at their old age, deserves commendation of this august Assembly.

Now, you simply throw them - these old people - into Homes for the Aged. Sir, it is not a good nomenclature because if you look after your parents, if everybody does it, there is no need for Homes for the Aged. It has been the practice in the West. When they retire and when they are able to live another 20 - 50 years, the children despise them. They do not look after them. Sir, if you go to London, in the Oval Park, Hyde Park and in other parks, you will see elderly people - husband and wife - going around the park taking a dog. When somebody asks them, Where is your son? They say, Oh! He is there. When they are asked, How are you living? They say, We are living on the dole given by the Government. That is their culture. We despise that culture. We do not want that culture to come into our society. Whether we be Buddhists, Muslims, Christians or Hindus, we all have our own culture - a rich culture and a great heritage. This is why we must value the teachings of our religious leaders.

There is a very interesting letter written to me by a great journalist who wrote the book titled, Dossier Corea, Mr. Firoze Sameer Effendi. Now, he writes a very interesting letter to Mr. Lalith Weeratunga, Secretary to the Executive President dated 18th April, 2012. It states: Last year on Saturday, 13th August, 2011, my maternal grand aunt, Ummu Zaneera Marzook nee Shariff, passed away in London. Sadly, she would have

celebrated her 100th birthday if she had lived upto Wednesday, 31 August, 2011", and Queen Elizabeth would have sent her the traditional greetings. "The Queen's office was in touch with her..."

Sir, I visited one of his relatives, Mr. Ahmed Sheriff Noordeen, who completed 100 years. He is a centenarian. The former Mayor, Mr. Omar Kamil and Mr. Firoze Sameer took me to see him. What does Mr. Firoze Sameer recommend? He recommends to honour them like the Queen of England does to honour the elderly when they reach 100 years of age. You can get the details and the statistics of those who have reached such a milestone.

The letter addressed to the Secretary to the President goes on to state: I thought I would share this incident with your goodself with a view that you might think it fit to suggest to His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa of a similar scheme to honor any Sri Lankan citizen who reaches to such a unique milestone.

In another paragraph, he goes on to state: I have just returned from Suhail Marzook's place. His mother would have reached 100 years on 31st August.... There is an Award given by the British Government and the Queen also sends a letter congratulating.

Now, for His Excellency the President, there is no need of recommending this to him. He does that. If it is your birthday tomorrow, the first call you will receive early in the morning would be from our President even before the crow crows, Happy Birthday to You and Many Happy Returns of the Day!

The letter goes on to say, Incidentally, this granduncle of mine is also related to two of our Royal College -61 Group (English Medium) members, namely, Omar Kamil and Mazhar Ghouse... This is spotlighted because such greetings will make them feel very happy at that age.

There was another Tamil gentleman who reached 114 years of age. It is reported that he has just passed away.

Therefore, Sir, I think this is a Motion that should be well taken by everyone and it must be implemented. Sir, I will conclude my speech since the Hon. Minister is going to reply. I should also mention one other important matter. Although we do not like people to be dumped into a Home for the Aged, there is a Lady Fareed Home for Elders established long ago by Sir Razik Fareed, one of our great Moor leaders, in Makola. When Mr. A.A.M. Marleen was the Ambassador in Saudi Arabia, he got the assistance from the UAE Government. Sir, you must go and see that. If you can set up Homes like that, even we would like to go and stay now before we become too old.

It is so well mainatained like a Guest House. There are rooms, beds, separate bathrooms and a sprawling garden. Now, it is looked after by a special Committee at the Moors' Islamic Cultural Home headed by Alhaj

Mohideen Rajabdeen. Mr. Omar Kamil, Chairman of MICH guides the Committee well. There is one close to Parliament. It is called "Victoria Home for the Elders". It is also well looked after but very much crowded now.

So, what do these children do? They go either to the United States, Arabian countries, Canada, New Zealand or Australia. They send some money as to say their obligation is over.
