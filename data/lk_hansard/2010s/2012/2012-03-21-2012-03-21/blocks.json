After about four years of his election, Mano was made the Minister of Plantation Industries in 1993. I remember at that time when I was the Prime Minister, he took over the State Ministership of the Plantations Industries. Then, in 1994 we lost the election and Mano did his stint here as a Member of the Opposition. He was a very active Member of the Opposition. Amongst others specializing in defence and the armed forces, he was able to organize the party very effectively in Dedigama at the grass roots level and thereafter he took part in many of the campaigns that we had. I remember the Jana Bala Meheyuma where we marched from Kandy to Colombo and the second one was when this House was forcibly closed, we had a campaign and one of Manos constituents was among those who died in the firing. But, unfortunately, in the General Election of 2001, he failed to be elected. If not, he would have held a high office at that time. These are the vagaries of politics and unfortunately Mano had suffered much from it. Then, he came back to this House again in 2004.",

Sir Edwin is remembered not only for his tenure in this House but also as a High Commissioner of Sri Lanka. Nissanka, himself, as I mentioned earlier, was the one who was responsible for starting the Cultural Triangle and as I remember, he designed Anuradhapura when he was the GA, which was the post that was held earlier by my grandfather.

I think he did most of the grass roots work for his father and kept the electorate going. He did the same thing, as a Member of this House, both from the Government Benches and the Opposition benches. He gave us good support when he did his work. He had the organizing ability and was a team worker. I must say that he could work as a team; he could put his head down and make a contribution.

I feel triumphant that, at least in death, he appears to be now receiving the recognition and status he was cruelly robbed of in life, on more than one occasion.

The late Sir Edwin Wijeyeratne, Manos paternal grandfather, was a Cabinet Minister in the First Cabinet of the Independent Ceylon under the Prime Ministership of my great grandfather, the Right Honourable D.S. Senanayake. He was later the late Prime Minister's High Commissioner in London and remained throughout a close friend of our family. The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne's father, the late Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne, following the tradition of his illustrious father in the lines of politics and diplomacy, served our country as Minister of Education at one point and as Ambassador for the USSR at another. The brother of the late Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne, the late Tissa Wijeyeratne, himself a diplomat who served in Paris during the regime of Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaike, was married to Visakha Bulankulame, a cousin to both my parents, further consolidating the already prevalent ties that existed between our families prior to Mano aiya himself, after many adventures and misadventures, discovered his soulmate in the form of Bharathi, another cousin to both my parents.",

Therefore, former Minister, Leader of the Opposition and Speaker, the late Hon. Anura Bandaranaike was not only a close friend, but also a relative. The cheeky private notes exchanged by the former Speaker and Mano aiya on Parliamentary and Speakers stationery, while the former was presiding in the House, some of which I have been privy to, only go on to show the camaraderie that transcended petty party politics and should be an example to us all. One such note addressed to both the Hon. Rukman Senanayake and the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne amply demonstrates the Hon. Bandaranaikes quick-wittedness, which observation he scribbled in his characteristic words: I told Bharathi last evening that her affections are first for the Wijeyeratnes', secondly, for the Senanayakes' and thirdly, for the Bandaranaikes' and that the order of preference can change. On another occasion, when Mano was chairing the House, he made the observation: I was watching you on TV from my office. You are doing my job excellently. It was signed \"AB, Speaker\" and was dated June, 2001.",

    "text": "A deep sense of morality, however, swayed him in decisions of national importance. This probably found root in the early days, often referred to by him as the happiest days of his life, at a time when he spent his childhood in Anuradhapura under the guidance of his father, who was then the Government Agent there. His father did much to have the historic city demarcated and defined as the Holy City that we know of today. Later on, his father was the Diyawadana Nilame, a position which his brother later inherited. Therefore, Manos early life was much influenced by Buddhism and the buddhist culture and brought him into close contact with the Prelates of both the Asgiriya and Malwatte Chapters, and he was a life member of the Kandy YMBA throughout. But, he was probably closest to the bhikkus of the Dedigama Constituency, whom he interacted with, assisted and sought guidance from, most often. His decision, therefore, to support President Rajapaksa was one that he never regretted. He felt it was the right thing to do as a patriot even though his lineage with strong political affiliations and the pressures exerted by family, friends and colleagues would have made it harder for him than to an average individual. Believe me, Mr. Speaker, I should know something about this myself.",

His outpouring of grief was limited to his bedroom and Mrs. Wijeyeratne, gave him the strength and courage to move on. Mrs. Wijeyeratnes sisters were to him, his own sisters and sometimes accomplices in covering up little domestic crimes, which did not always meet Mrs. Bharathi Wijeyeratnes stamp of approval. Indivara, Bharathis youngest sister, in particular, enjoyed an exceptionally close relationship with Mano and she was his best friend. Mano, like everyone else, faced his share of broken promises and abandonment in the world of politics, but took it up remarkably well with a sense of equanimity. That was a Mano Wijeyeratne signature trait. Referring to such unfair treatment, the late Hon. Anura Bandaranaike wrote to him thus, I quote:",

I was a Colleague of his in the Kegalle District. When I first contested in 1994, I was a newcomer. I had not held any office before; I did not know many people; I had no experience. In my beginning, it was Mano who was like my big brother who taught me a lot of things in politics, who guided me, who befriended me and helped me along the way. It was a big boost because I could relate with Mano and he was somebody who was willing to help. That bond grew as we went along and in good times and in bad times, we worked together. There were times we won and there were times we lost, but we faced the difficult times together. That built a great bond.",

Sir, it was like losing somebody from the family. One of the things I felt that if we were to regret was that Mano should have had a better chance at proving his leadership because in 1989, when he became a young MP of the United National Party Government under the then President Premadasa, he became a Minister, I believe only in the latter end of that Government. He just had a few months to prove himself. He did not have much time. But, during that short time, he did a lot of work. Then again, in 2001 when the UNP came to power, Mano was not in Parliament or else he would have definitely been a Cabinet Minister. When he joined the present Government, he had a very short stint as a Minister. He did not have time to prove his worth. If Mano had had a continuous period, I am sure he would have done much for the Kegalle District. That is one of the regrets that the people of Kegalle have: that Mano should have had a longer chance as a Cabinet Minister. If he was there today, people would have aspired to bring him to that position.",

His brother was also a Diyawadana Nilame. His entire family was very united to one another. Mano, basically was the pivot around all his brothers and sisters. That was the life that Mano Wijeyeratne led at the early stages. Subsequently, he became a Minister of State. He had a very analytical mind. I can remember when I discussed any problem with him, he goes deep into the subject. It could be any subject - political or otherwise. Sometimes his advice, his thoughts and his way of thinking was quite different from others and therefore, he had very many ways of considering manpower as far as his political career was concerned.",

I can remember how she sacrificed her time, her energy and her finances to look after Mano Wijeyeratne. She gave him the best of treatment that was available at that time. She took him to Singapore and tried to save his life, but unfortunately, as I said, the Will of God was quite different. Even his ashes were buried in a monument which was constructed in the Wijeyeratnes' family burial ground. It was a very beautifully done monument which was personally supervised by his wife. In fact, she used to even spend some nights at that cemetery to see that the monument was being properly built. These are the basic characteristics of Bharathi Wijeratne, the Ambassador-Designate to Turkey.",

Despite his own predicament, Mano was helpful and he just said, Eran, send someone, collect the forms, fill it up, send it back and we will have it for you. The reason I said this little story is because Manos desire was always to help a friend, to help somebody, a characteristic that distinguished him from a very early age. When the school bell rang and most of us ran out in the interval with a bat and a ball, Mano Wijeyeratne could be found with a whole group of friends either walking on the grounds or walking on the corridors of the school. This was Mano. His display of concern for others and the ability to gather friends around him were the earliest signs of the politician in the making.

When the United National Party formed the Government in 2001, he was not lucky enough to get into Parliament. In 2004, again he got into Parliament, but then the United National Party had lost. There were many in the United National Party who wanted to have reforms in the party and Mano was one of them, I was one of them and Sajith was one of them.",

Some in the UNP did not like that, but we respected that view also because it was a very hard and difficult choice. We risked our political career by taking that decision.

So, His Excellency President Rajapaksa gave us that promise. Also, there were four Members from the United National Party who were later made non-cabinet Ministers.

Mano, to me, is more than a colleague. He is like a brother. He guided me, helped me and encouraged me in the numerous challenges that I faced. So, I will never forget these things in my life.
