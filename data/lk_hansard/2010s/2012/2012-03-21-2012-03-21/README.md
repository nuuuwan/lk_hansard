[2.02 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Speaker, I join the Hon. Chief Government Whip in offering my condolences to the wife and the members of the family of the late Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne.

In life, we know that only death is certain. I had a discussion with Mano last September and I did not expect to get up in this House to make a reference to him so early. We were taken by surprise when we heard that he was ill and then within a short time, he passed away.

It was nearly 23 years ago that Mano came to this House. He was elected to Parliament in the Parliamentary Election of 1989 representing the Kegalle District. He

campaigned mainly from the Dedigama Electorate and he took oaths as a Member and as a backbencher. I remember him as a Member who was active from the very beginning. He took part in all the shouting and all the brawls but also became a good speaker like his father who was here before him. After about four years of his election, Mano was made the Minister of Plantation Industries in 1993. I remember at that time when I was the Prime Minister, he took over the State Ministership of the Plantations Industries. Then, in 1994 we lost the election and Mano did his stint here as a Member of the Opposition. He was a very active Member of the Opposition. Amongst others specializing in defence and the armed forces, he was able to organize the party very effectively in Dedigama at the grass roots level and thereafter he took part in many of the campaigns that we had. I remember the Jana Bala Meheyuma where we marched from Kandy to Colombo and the second one was when this House was forcibly closed, we had a campaign and one of Manos constituents was among those who died in the firing. But, unfortunately, in the General Election of 2001, he failed to be elected. If not, he would have held a high office at that time. These are the vagaries of politics and unfortunately Mano had suffered much from it. Then, he came back to this House again in 2004.

Mano was no stranger to politics. He had served as his fathers Co-ordinating Secretary over a period of time by handling most of the affairs of the electorate. As I said earlier, he came from a political family and we all know that. But, we must also remember the outstanding contributions made by his grandfather, Sir Edwin Wijeyeratne and his father Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne to this country. Sir Edwin is remembered not only for his tenure in this House but also as a High Commissioner of Sri Lanka. Nissanka, himself, as I mentioned earlier, was the one who was responsible for starting the Cultural Triangle and as I remember, he designed Anuradhapura when he was the GA, which was the post that was held earlier by my grandfather. One of those who helped Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne at that time while he was doing the Cultural Triangle is the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama who was in Paris working for the UNESCO as an International Civil Servant and before that, as a Government servant .

Mano himself took over at a very difficult time. The year 1989 was not the time that people wanted to be elected to Parliament. He was one of those who were willing to come in and had the fortune of being elected to the House. He was a good grass roots MP. I think he did most of the grass roots work for his father and kept the electorate going. He did the same thing, as a Member of this House, both from the Government Benches and the Opposition benches. He gave us good support when he did his work. He had the organizing ability and was a team worker. I must say that he could work as a team; he could put his head down and make a contribution. This is what is expected of politicians but unfortunately we miss

1299 1300

him in politics. I think he was hoping to make a return to this House some day but that would not be so. But, all of us who are here will remember him and I join this House, the Hon. Members and the Hon. Chief Government Whip in our dedication to him and also wish that he would attain Nibbana!

Thank you.

[2.16 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Speaker, I am quite sad to say a few words on the Vote of Condolence of the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne, quite a young Member of Parliament, who unexpectedly passed away sometime ago.

He came from a distinguished family. His grandfather, Sir Edwin Wijeyeratne was a person not merely very well known in this country, but also a highly respected person. He held both the ministerial office and also served the country as an ambassador abroad. His father, the late Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne was a Civil Servant. He was subsequently the Minister of Education in the 1977 Parliament and thereafter served as the Minister of Justice. The Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne was also a very close friend of some of my leaders, the late Hon. A. Amirthalingam and the late Hon. Kathiravelupillai. I am personally aware that they were very close friends of the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne. It may also be relevant for me to mention that Hon. Mano Wijeyeratnes uncle, Mr. Tissa Wijeyeratne, was also a very popular person in this country, whom many of us interacted with.

The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne himself was a very amiable person, a very friendly person, a very pleasant person and a very easy person to get along with. He took a great interest in the proceedings of Parliament. He made contributions in Parliament quite frequently and they were very constructive and useful contributions.

It is extremely unfortunate that a young person with much promise who could serve the country for a much longer period of time, came by his demise somewhat unexpectedly sometime ago. I would join the House in

expressing our very sincere condolences and sympathies to the members of his family and request you, Mr. Speaker, that our condolences be conveyed to his family. Thank you.

[2.35 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Vasantha Senanayake) Mr. Speaker, I address this House today in a strange mix of pride, triumph and profound sadness. Foremost, I am proud of the fact that today I have the opportunity to express my thoughts and impressions on a distinguished Parliamentarian hailing from a prominent and highly regarded lineage in the socio-political arena of our countrys history. I feel triumphant that, at least in death, he appears to be now receiving the recognition and status he was cruelly robbed of in life, on more than one occasion. Sir, my sadness, of course, stems from the close association I had with Mano aiya, the Wijeyeratne sisters, my cousins, the eldest of whom, Bharathi, was his devoted wife, to whom I once again extend my sympathy, and those who comprise the family and relatives of the Hon. Manoda Wijeyeratne.

On a personal note, the association of the Wijeyeratnes' with my own family, the Senanayakes', has been both enduring and endearing. The late Sir Edwin Wijeyeratne, Manos paternal grandfather, was a Cabinet Minister in the First Cabinet of the Independent Ceylon under the Prime Ministership of my great grandfather, the Right Honourable D.S. Senanayake. He was later the late Prime Minister's High Commissioner in London and remained throughout a close friend of our family. The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne's father, the late Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne, following the tradition of his illustrious father in the lines of politics and diplomacy, served our country as Minister of Education at one point and as Ambassador for the USSR at another. The brother of the late Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne, the late Tissa Wijeyeratne, himself a diplomat who served in Paris during the regime of Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaike, was married to Visakha Bulankulame, a cousin to both my parents, further consolidating the already prevalent ties that existed between our families prior to Mano aiya himself, after many adventures and misadventures, discovered his soulmate in the form of Bharathi, another cousin to both my parents.

Mano aiya was also related to the Dias Bandaranaike clan of Sri Lankan politics through his maternal side, the Dullewe family, and their maternal clan, the Ratwatte family. Therefore, former Minister, Leader of the Opposition and Speaker, the late Hon. Anura Bandaranaike was not only a close friend, but also a relative. The cheeky private notes exchanged by the former Speaker and Mano aiya on Parliamentary and Speakers stationery, while the former was presiding in the House, some of which I have been privy to, only go on to show the camaraderie that transcended petty party politics and should be an example to us all. One such note addressed to both the Hon. Rukman Senanayake and the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne amply demonstrates the Hon. Bandaranaikes quick-wittedness, which observation he scribbled in his characteristic words: I told Bharathi last evening that her affections are first for the Wijeyeratnes', secondly, for the Senanayakes' and thirdly, for the Bandaranaikes' and that the order of preference can change. On another occasion, when Mano was chairing the House, he made the observation: I was watching you on TV from my office. You are doing my job excellently. It was signed "AB, Speaker" and was dated June, 2001.

Mano too had more than his share of quick-witted comebacks on the Floor of the House. On one occasion, when an angry Cabinet Minister responded that the President had only one Cabinet and that was her Cabinet of Ministers to a derogatory remark by the Opposition, stating that President Kumaratungas Cabinet was a farce and could be compared to a kitchen cabinet, Manos own take was that the Minister concerned would know of no other cabinet, but the liquor cabinet and that brought the House down with thunderous laughter.

1307 1308

I suppose it was his early years at Royal College, Colombo, and the sportsmanship he enjoyed in the games of cricket and rugby along with student pranks and camaraderie, which helped determine his slightly mischievous interior, cloaked beautifully by a passive and sober exterior. I have heard of times in Manos student days when he allegedly raced down certain Colombo neighbourhoods in the early hours, drinking up the bottles of milk delivered at the front doors by the Elephant House milk delivery van.

A deep sense of morality, however, swayed him in decisions of national importance. This probably found root in the early days, often referred to by him as the happiest days of his life, at a time when he spent his childhood in Anuradhapura under the guidance of his father, who was then the Government Agent there. His father did much to have the historic city demarcated and defined as the Holy City that we know of today. Later on, his father was the Diyawadana Nilame, a position which his brother later inherited. Therefore, Manos early life was much influenced by Buddhism and the buddhist culture and brought him into close contact with the Prelates of both the Asgiriya and Malwatte Chapters, and he was a life member of the Kandy YMBA throughout. But, he was probably closest to the bhikkus of the Dedigama Constituency, whom he interacted with, assisted and sought guidance from, most often. His decision, therefore, to support President Rajapaksa was one that he never regretted. He felt it was the right thing to do as a patriot even though his lineage with strong political affiliations and the pressures exerted by family, friends and colleagues would have made it harder for him than to an average individual. Believe me, Mr. Speaker, I should know something about this myself.

In Parliament, Mano acted many parts at various stages. Being elected a number of times, he was a backbencher, Deputy Chief Opposition Whip, an acting Minister and also a Minister. Whatever position he held or did not hold, he was essentially the same man. His sense of humility and abhorrence of violence were indeed noteworthy characteristics he displayed. He had the remarkable gift of being able to call his constituents by name and there were often times when he returned home with an empty wallet when his constituents needed urgent medical aid, which they could not afford.

He performed well whenever entrusted with responsibilities overseas and he travelled either heading or as part of delegations to countries including India, China, Singapore, the United Kingdom, France, South Africa, Germany, Thailand, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia, Greece, Iran and South Korea. Quite apart from the fact that the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne held the position of Secretary in the Sri Lanka-Turkey Inter Parliamentary Friendship

Association, he also did yeoman service in promoting bilateral relationships. That was, of course, enhanced by the fact that Mrs. Wijeyeratne had succeeded her late father as the Honorary Consul-General of Sri Lanka to Turkey. I am pleased to note and congratulate her on her new appointment as Sri Lankas Consul- General to Turkey, a position, I believe, she will take up very shortly. I remember, with some sadness, the desire expressed by the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne to quit politics and join his wife in Turkey only a few weeks before his demise.

Politics, as most Hon. Members of this House know, is not always about winning. Sometimes, it is as much to do with losing. The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne also faced his own ups and downs in the fortunes and misfortunes of Sri Lankan politics. Whenever he lost, he showed hardly any emotion in public, opting by all accounts, to soothe, pacify and console his ardent supporters. His outpouring of grief was limited to his bedroom and Mrs. Wijeyeratne, gave him the strength and courage to move on. Mrs. Wijeyeratnes sisters were to him, his own sisters and sometimes accomplices in covering up little domestic crimes, which did not always meet Mrs. Bharathi Wijeyeratnes stamp of approval. Indivara, Bharathis youngest sister, in particular, enjoyed an exceptionally close relationship with Mano and she was his best friend. Mano, like everyone else, faced his share of broken promises and abandonment in the world of politics, but took it up remarkably well with a sense of equanimity. That was a Mano Wijeyeratne signature trait. Referring to such unfair treatment, the late Hon. Anura Bandaranaike wrote to him thus, I quote:

My dear Mano, Just a short note to say how sad I was for you yesterday. All the background plotting had been done by the time I got to Parliament, which enraged our MPs. Your day will come. Mine took 27 years. Chins up! Affectionately, AB.

My own recollections of Mano aiya during the last few weeks of his life and throughout last year, prior to his demise, were of a man waiting for his retirement from politics, which had worn him out. He wanted to accompany his wife to Turkey and lead a life of leisure and devote more time to his reading, for Mano aiya was a voracious reader despite being cramped by a busy schedule. I still picture him sitting on his usual chair in the verandah of his Wellawatte residence playing affectionately with Labrador, the three Dobermans, his favourite, German Shepherd - Bruno, and his numerous Persian cats.

It was Shakespeare, I believe, who said that the good that men do is often interred with their bones. Let us fervently hope then, that this is not the case with the Hon. Manoda Wijeyeratne, and that Mrs. Wijeyeratne will keep our flag flying in Turkey and draw inspiration from the lifework of her deceased husband and always carry with her, a sense of goodwill and fragrance of humility,

1309 1310

which in fact, was the spirit of the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity given to me to say these few words.

Thank you.

[3.05 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Kabir Hashim) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, it is with great sadness that I speak on the Vote of Condolence of my Colleague, the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne because I can still remember of my speaking on the Vote of Condolence of his great father, a short period ago. We never imagined that we would have to do this in the House. I was a Colleague of his in the Kegalle District. When I first contested in 1994, I was a newcomer. I had not held any office before; I did not know many people; I had no experience. In my beginning, it was Mano who was like my big brother who taught me a lot of things in politics, who guided me, who befriended me and helped me along the way. It was a big boost because I could relate with Mano and he was somebody who was willing to help. That bond grew as we went along and in good times and in bad times, we worked together. There were times we won and there were times we lost, but we faced the difficult times together. That built a great bond.

In the year 2000, when I lost the General Election, Mano was one of those who consoled me. In 2001, I remember when I won and Mano lost, we still kept our friendship and our bondage together. In 2004, we both

1315 1316

won together again from the Kegalle District and in 2005, he became the District Leader of the United National Party in the Kegalle District. He was a great strength. He brought unity amongst the UNPers of the District and he gave that leadership; he proved his leadership.

Mano was also, in a sense, a family friend. His father and his uncles were all closely connected to my parents who were also very politically involved with the United National Party. Sir, it was like losing somebody from the family. One of the things I felt that if we were to regret was that Mano should have had a better chance at proving his leadership because in 1989, when he became a young MP of the United National Party Government under the then President Premadasa, he became a Minister, I believe only in the latter end of that Government. He just had a few months to prove himself. He did not have much time. But, during that short time, he did a lot of work. Then again, in 2001 when the UNP came to power, Mano was not in Parliament or else he would have definitely been a Cabinet Minister. When he joined the present Government, he had a very short stint as a Minister. He did not have time to prove his worth. If Mano had had a continuous period, I am sure he would have done much for the Kegalle District. That is one of the regrets that the people of Kegalle have: that Mano should have had a longer chance as a Cabinet Minister. If he was there today, people would have aspired to bring him to that position.

So, in this instance we have lost a good friend, the country a good leader, and the family a very close, worthy family member. Therefore, on behalf of the Kegalle District United National Party Bala Mandalaya, I wish to express our condolences to his beloved wife, Bharathi and all his other family members.

Thank you.

[4.42 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Sir, we have heard in this Chamber today many distinguished Parliamentarians speaking about the late Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne, who was a former Member of Parliament, a Minister of State and also a Deputy Opposition Whip. In many capacities he has served this Parliament.

The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratnes family has been extremely close to my family. I think he is the third generation of family tie that we have with the Wijeyeratne family. Sir Edwin Wijeyeratne, his grandfather, was also a secretary of Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan at one stage and the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne, his father, had been a very close associate of mine for many years.

In 1983, my house was the first to be attacked during the riots and it was Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne who had come and rescued my wife and children from my house as I was at that time in Kataragama. I had stayed in his house for more than two months during the riot period. In the same way, I can remember when the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne became a Minister of State

during the late President J.R. Jayewardenes regime, he was living in my house. We were so close. He was basically living with us for about six months and we enjoyed every single second that he was with us. He was a great patriot, he was a real mentor and such a great educationalist. If one spoke to him, he would have realized that he was a source of immense knowledge and power. I think the Hon. J.R.P. Sooriyapperuma had very vividly mentioned about the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne and his capabilities. He was a great soul; he had his own way of thinking; his own way of life. He used to spend hours reading in the night. Sometimes he got late even to go for Cabinet Meetings during the late President J.R. Jayewardenes time. But, that was his way of thinking. He was a voracious reader.

At that time, the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne was a young man and was living at No. 46, Gregorys Road, where the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne used to stay. All those children of the Wijeyeratne family were really moulded by their father. Their father had such great qualities. The Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne was a man who respected all religions, a man who respected all languages and a man who respected all races. In the same manner, the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne, because he was moulded by his father, always respected every single community. He had many friends and among them were Sinhalese, Muslims and Burgers. He had a variety of friends and he was a real supporter of all causes.

The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne was an extremely genuine and good friend. He was helpful at any time. I can remember, if I wanted any help - moral support or whatever - and rang him up at any time, he would be there, day or night, spending hours with me giving me moral support. Those are certain personal issues which I do not want to mention today in this Chamber.

He was such a great individual. Unfortunately, his demise was very early. I had the opportunity of meeting the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne when he was in Singapore. His wife, Bharathi Wijeyeratne told me that he was quite serious and I took the opportunity of flying to Singapore and I met him while he was convalescing there. But, I never thought that he would pass away there because he told me, Swami, do not worry. I will be back in a couple of weeks time. But unfortunately, the Will of God was against him.

The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne, a grandson of Sir Edwin Wijeyeratne - who was in the first Cabinet of the Right Honourable D.S. Senanayake - and the second son of the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne - who was a Minister of Education, Minister of Justice and a Diyawadana Nilame - was of the third generation in the paternal side who represented the Dedigama Electorate in Parliament; the father and son both were able to represent the Dedigama Electorate. It is really an important gesture of that family because they were born in such a distinguished

1339 1340

background and they had the support of the people to serve the society and the electorate they represented with the support of the Sinhala and the Tamil community at large.

Taking into consideration his family background, I can say that his mother, Mrs. Nita Wijeyeratne, was from the Dullewe family which is an extremely conservative and distinguished Kandyan family. His brother was also a Diyawadana Nilame. His entire family was very united to one another. Mano, basically was the pivot around all his brothers and sisters. That was the life that Mano Wijeyeratne led at the early stages. Subsequently, he became a Minister of State. He had a very analytical mind. I can remember when I discussed any problem with him, he goes deep into the subject. It could be any subject - political or otherwise. Sometimes his advice, his thoughts and his way of thinking was quite different from others and therefore, he had very many ways of considering manpower as far as his political career was concerned.

At this stage, I must take this opportunity to say that his wife, Bharathi Wijeyeratne, was really a pillar to him while he was ill. I can remember how she sacrificed her time, her energy and her finances to look after Mano Wijeyeratne. She gave him the best of treatment that was available at that time. She took him to Singapore and tried to save his life, but unfortunately, as I said, the Will of God was quite different. Even his ashes were buried in a monument which was constructed in the Wijeyeratnes' family burial ground. It was a very beautifully done monument which was personally supervised by his wife. In fact, she used to even spend some nights at that cemetery to see that the monument was being properly built. These are the basic characteristics of Bharathi Wijeratne, the Ambassador-Designate to Turkey.

The Hon. Mano Wijeratne was a real friend whose demise is a loss to this society. He would have been a great leader and would have really come up in his political career if he was alive today. But, anyway we cannot wish him anything further than to pray that he attains Nirvana and may he be showered with God's blessings!

Thank you.

, , , . [4.58 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Presiding Member, this is the first time I am speaking on a Vote of Condolence and I would not have dreamt a few months ago that it would be of the Hon. Manoda Wijeyeratne.

Manoda was known to all of us as "Mano" when he suddenly and unexpectedly left us. I join the Hon. Members of Parliament in expressing my condolences and also honouring the memory of Mano as a politician, Parliamentarian, Minister, but to me as a classmate.

In 1962, we were five-year olds and were in the first row of the class at Royal Junior. We spent eight years together in the same class before we entered the portals of Royal College. Mano belonged to the most distinguished group of old Royalists, known as the 1972 Group, a group of Royalists consisting of many professionals such as lawyers, doctors, artistes, scientists, sportsmen, social scientists and Mano Wijeyeratne was the sole Parliamentary representative, not just representing the Dedigama Electorate and the Kegalle District but representing many of us who are outside that district, in this august Assembly and I am fortunate two years ago to take a seat in Parliament, in a sense, to carry that same tradition.

It was only a few weeks before Mano left us that I was on the phone with him, because I had to go to Istanbul for an Eisenhower Fellowship Meeting, to ask him whether I could speak to Bharathi, the Consul-General for Turkey to see how I could actually obtain a visa. Bharathi was Manos wife and soulmate and I had to hear from Mano that he was very ill at that point of time, which I did not know and I could hear the desperate tone in Manos voice. Despite his own predicament, Mano was helpful and he just said, Eran, send someone, collect the forms, fill it up, send it back and we will have it for you. The reason I said this little story is because Manos desire was always to help a friend, to help somebody, a characteristic that distinguished him from a very early age. When the school bell rang and most of us ran out in the interval with a bat and a ball, Mano Wijeyeratne could be found with a whole group of friends either walking on the grounds or walking on the corridors of the school. This was Mano. His display of concern for others and the ability to gather friends around him were the earliest signs of the politician in the making. Mano was not a perfect human being like all of us. He was a multifaceted individual.

Soon after leaving school and assuming his first responsibility of work, it so happened that one afternoon, when I was with the Principal of the school discussing matters pertaining to the school, there was the sudden arrival of Mano Wijeyeratne, the official. The Principal, little realizing we were both classmates, but now student and official, suddenly asked me to leave the room because he wanted to discuss matters relating to the school with Mano Wijeyeratne. There appeared one as student and one as official, at the age of only 19 years.

A few years later, while I was studying Economics at the University of London, Mano turned up to pursue his studies. Mano was very unhappy at the beginning that he had to come and study. The Motto of our school is, in Latin, Disce aut Discede, which meant Learn or Depart. Mano had to return to studies because that was what his distinguished father wanted him to do. The school song had a stanza which said, We will learn of books and men and learn to play the game.

1343 1344

Mano was more a student of men and games. All men have some creative ability and Manos was his way with the people and the desire to help people. It was years later that the Wijeyeratne brilliance was on display when Subodhana entered Cambridge and the School of Oriental and African Studies in London to read History. You could see and feel the fathers pride.

It is only fitting, in closing, to say a few words about the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne, who was known to us as Uncle Nissanka. They were men of deeds and letters; his brothers, Kuda and Tissa, left their mark in their chosen fields of medicine, administration and international relations. Nissanka was a politician and also pursued his religious interests as the Diyawadana Nilame, followed by his son, Neranjan. Mano belonged to a family which was incomparable in terms of their national contribution.

Sir, after the Elections in 1977 - I do not know whether the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena was there - there was a special Assembly at Royal College. All the old Royalists were invited. President J.R. Jayewardene spoke of Royal College and its spirit, the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne on education and I, in a very mischievous move as the Head Prefect, asked them to declare a holiday to honour that particular day. The Hon. (Dr.)Nissanka Wijeyeratne went up and declared a holiday. President J.R. Jayawardene, not to be outdone, went up to the microphone and declared a second holiday. I was very unpopular in school until that particular moment. It was a time where grades, marks and Z-scores were not talked about, but about books and men.

Mano belonged to a family which epitomized that. Today, we remember our schoolmate and this Assemblys former Representative. To his family, I would say, be consoled, for in his short life, he lived it all. Our thoughts are with Bharathi and his family. May Mano find grace and peace in his eternal journey! [5.06 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Presiding Member, I rise in this August Assembly today to pay my respect to one of my most dearest Friends and close associates; whether in Government or in the Opposition, it so happened that we sat side by side sharing adjoining seats in this House. He was a very dear Friend, sometimes mischievous and naughty too. But, that is the way he enjoyed life. When he began politics, we came to know each other very closely. At times when I used to pull out the Parliamentary authority of the Erskine May and read it out to the House to vindicate my point of

view, he would always tell me: Haji, you have done well.

On one occasion, Sir, I could not pull out the correct book; he handed over to me a book and I made my way through and succeeded in getting the Hon. Anil Moonesinghe, the Deputy Speaker at that time, to suspend the House for 15 minutes. When the House was suspended, I asked Mano, What is the book that you gave me? He had a hearty laugh and told me it was some other publication. Later, he used to relate this story even to His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, to the Leader of the Opposition and to everyone else.

Sir, he had a very kind heart. He never forgot his friends. We were together at the Mumtaz Mahal. He used to visit that mansion, which has now been declared an archaeological and a State property through the Budget Speech of His Excellency the President. The Hon. Deshamanya Alhaj M.A. Bakeer Markar was at that time the incumbent Speaker and Mano had a schoolmate, Sunil Dassanayake as caretaker of the Official Residence of the Speaker. Whatever the portfolios or the high profile positions he held, as the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne said, he never forgot his past; he wanted to relive in the past. He kept a close rapport with Dassanayake.

Sir, when he was Minister of Plantation Industries, I took him to Puttalam. He had an idea of developing the palmyrah industry there. He started an industry in Kalpantyne in the Kalpitiya area, helped those people in that village to produce handicrafts - brushes, baskets, carpets et cetera out of the palmyrah tree, and those produces became very popular.

Sir, the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne and I went round the island for politics and other reasons. His distinguished father, the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne, was a renowned scholar on so many subjects. What particularly etched in my heart was his eloquence on Islamic topics. He had at his fingertips, like a great Islamic scholar, the teachings of Imam Ghazali, Ibnu Arabi and Omar Khayyam, so much so that when there were Islamic conferences even in Kayalpatnam and Madras in Tamil Nadu, the person who was sought after to lecture on Islamic philosophy was the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne.

The Hon. (Dr.) Wijeyeratne was also a very close associate and a contemporary of Prof. S.A. Imam, the Dean of the Faculty of Islamic Studies of the University of Peradeniya and Prof. M.M. Uwise, whose 16th death anniversary will be commemorated on the 25th of this month at the Colombo Tamil Sangam. We invite even the Hon. Swaminathan, who is seated across, to attend that. So, those are the great academics and scholars with whom he associated.

1345 1346

[ ]

2012 21

Then, there was another body called the All-Ceylon Muslim Educational Conference, of which the founder Chairman was Mr. S.L.M. Shafie Marikar. The Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne explained to us, through this Conference, about Islamic civilization, about Islamic history and how those should be taught in schools. He was a guide and a philosopher. In all those activities of that distinguished great man, his son was there; like a shadow he followed his footsteps. The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne understood the importance of those great teachings. That was why he did not have any bias against any class, creed or community. He was very friendly with us and his rapport sometimes went beyond our comprehension.

Once, I was on the delegation of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa to Turkey. While on return flight, I happened to sit together with Father Kurukulasooriya in the plane. We developed an argument on religion. His Excellency turned round and asked, What is that noise? Mano spontaneously replied, "This is the problem Sir, when you carry disciples of the Christ and the Prophet together!".

Then, Sir, one thing we should not forget is about his beloved wife, Bharathi Wijeyeratne. I think after a long and distinguished service as the Consul-General for Turkey, she will be leaving this island in the first week of April to take up the post of Ambassador, Sri Lanka's representative in Turkey. She followed the footsteps of her late father, Mr. Lofty Wijeratne who served as the Consul-General for Turkey for 23 long years and he was highly decorated by the Ottoman Empire or the Turkish regime.

Sir, she will be creating history for this is the first time a wife of an MP or a Minister has been appointed as an Ambassador to represent our country and I think His Excellency the President has done proud to womanhood by appointing her to that post.

Then, another gentleman with whom Mano associated very much is our Serjeant-at-Arms, Mr. Anil Samarasekera who is also a former Royalist. He also associated with Mr. Omar Kamil and Mr. M.F. Sameer Effendi. I cannot forget how we always met in Mumtaz Mahal and in other places.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Please wind up.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Give me one more minute, Sir. Today, the country is free, but when we are facing certain difficulties, as conspirators unite internationally and locally, I must say

that the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne realized this fact earlier, and he was one person who came forward to help the President to bring the war to a complete end. He said he was so happy and that he would join His Excellency the President to accomplish his task of doing whatever possible for this country as mandated by the people.

Then, I am reminded that Bharathi Wijeyeratne brought down 157 delegates from Turkey in 2005 as the Consul-General to put up a housing scheme in Midigama, Weligama and there was a Deputy Prime Minister. Today, the Prime Minister is Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, three of his associates who came at that time are Ministers and Bharathi assured us that in keeping with the traditions and historical links and our cultural aspirations, Turkey at this hour would always help us.

Finally, Sir, I may say this and wind up my speech: The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne was a full-blooded Royalist who upheld its motto, "Disce Aut Discede" - Learn or Depart - to the hilt. He hailed from a distinguished family of three generations which adorned the legislature. He was an amiable and a witty human being, a son of a great statesman, the Hon. (Dr.) Nissanka Wijeyeratne. The Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne epitomized the calibre of the ideal politician; he was upright and straightforward; comfortable to be in company with; friendly and caring. May his soul be sanctified!

( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana. Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

, .

, , . Whereupon THE HON. PERUML RAJATHURAI left the Chair and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES took the Chair.

. . [5.24 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Navin Dissanayake - Minister of Public Management Reforms)Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, "The good die young. During their life, they give out the greatest flame". I think this often-quoted statement applies to my Colleague, the late Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne. I hope his fragrance lingers on as a humanist not only in the House but also in society and the good work that he started, will also be continued by his family.

Like himself, I am a third generation politician. Mano came from a very noble and distinguished family. Like his grandfather and father, he epitomized the values of conservatism, hard work, merit, decency and discipline. Those are the values that the United National Party epitomized but they are sadly and rapidly deteriorating now.

Mano entered Parliament in 1989 with a host of young leaders from the United National Party. The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne, the Hon. Rohan Abeygunasekera from Hanguranketha, the Hon. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar from Kalutara, the Hon. Ranjith Maddumabandara, the Hon. Harindra Dunuwila from Kandy, the Hon. Upali Amarasiri from Galle, the Hon. Lal Gamage from Anuradhapura and the Hon. Sarath Ranawaka from Kalutara were among them and they were the backbone of the second tier of the United National Party. Leaders like the Hon. J.R. Jayewardene, Hon. R. Premadasa, Hon. Athulath Mudali and my father, nurtured them and wanted these second-level leaders to come up in the party and Mano was definitely one of them. The Hon. Premadasa gave him the State Ministership of Plantation Industries which was also held by my father for a brief time. But, unfortunately he could not complete the work that he started because of the length of time.

1349 1350

[ () ]

2012 21

Mano had so many good qualities in him. He was also a very lucky man, in the sense of his birth, education and humane qualities. Unfortunately, in 1994, the United National Party lost and he was not able to get into office. He had to stay for another six years till the elections came in 2000. See the vagaries in politics. When the United National Party formed the Government in 2001, he was not lucky enough to get into Parliament. In 2004, again he got into Parliament, but then the United National Party had lost. There were many in the United National Party who wanted to have reforms in the party and Mano was one of them, I was one of them and Sajith was one of them.

I remember, at a UNP Group Meeting when Sajith proposed that leadership should be elected and not be selected, I seconded that. Mano was very much with us and his thinking was also that the United National Party has to be progressive. In 2007, I remember very well that we had a lot of arguments and discussions within the party. A group of us felt that we should extend our support to President Rajapaksa. Some in the UNP did not like that, but we respected that view also because it was a very hard and difficult choice. We risked our political career by taking that decision. Nevertheless, I want to emphasize that Mano was one who argued very strongly for the move that we made.

Then, I also remember very well - I have to state this in Parliament - that once when I and Mano met President Rajapaksa, we told him very categorically, We do not want positions; we do not even negotiate ministries with you, but we want one promise and that is, if you start the war, it must be continued and finished. So, His Excellency President Rajapaksa gave us that promise. Also, there were four Members from the United National Party who were later made non-cabinet Ministers. Mano was one of them, I was one of them, the Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena was one of them and the Hon. Hemakumara Nanayakkara was another of them. Today only two of us are in Parliament.

Mano also contributed immensely along with the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama in the Ministry of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion. He did solid work there, particularly in the Gem and Jewellery Authority. So, his contribution in a way did not reflect his ability, because I know that if he was lucky enough to win in 2010, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa would have given him a substantial portfolio to continue his work. Mano, to me, is more than a colleague. He is like a brother. He guided me, helped me and encouraged me in the numerous challenges that I faced. So, I will never forget these things in my life. These are the qualities that made the man very strong, independent and also honest and his integrity can never be questioned. So, we sincerely miss him. I hope that Bharathi, who also comes from a very noble family, will be able to continue his good work. I understand that President Mahinda

Rajapaksa has appointed her as the Ambassador- Designate to Turkey and she can obviously be in a position to enable facilitation of investments and to aid the Kegalle District so that Manos good name could be continued. I will always remember Mano as a gentleman, as a man who stood by his principles, as a very humble human being who was never consumed by power and as a man who always served the masses. So, I hope Bharathi and the Wijeyeratne family will continue his good name.

May the Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne attain Nibbana! Thank you very much. [.. 5.32] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena - Deputy Minister of Economic Development) , , . . , . .
