[3.22 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Mr. Deputy Speaker, we - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is your point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I would like to bring to your kind notice that when the Hon. Kiriella was speaking, he said that nowhere has pardon been granted by the President himself. It is granted according to Article 34 of the Constitution. Sir, there has been no precedent where the President in his imaginary thoughts has granted pardon. Somebody must ask for it. . They say publicly that they will not ask for a pardon. Who is he? Is he the son-in-law or the son of Mr. Sarath Fonseka? ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not a point of Order. Hon. John Amaratunga, you may continue.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Mr. Deputy Speaker, - [Interruption.] Sir, please ask him to sit down.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Azwer, that is not a point of Order.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) According to Section 78 of the Prisons Ordinance, a prisoner who has been convicted cannot speak to the press and he cannot even gesture, and this is what Mr. Sarath Fonseka is doing. You want him to do that and be like that. .

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not a point of Order. Hon. John Amaratunga, you may continue.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, the Opposition is not opposed to this Order. We welcome this. There are a number of reasons today why we should encourage and support this situation. Sir, now you can see that even the President has said this in the front page of todays Daily Mirror newspaper. It states, I quote:

I dislike the word Diaspora

He said so in a statement that he has made earlier. He also goes on to say, I quote:

...there is a strong Tiger network spreading throughout the world,

The regrouping and rejuvenation of Tiger activities are taking place throughout the world and Thailand was one place where they were harbouring some of the criminals who were involved in terrorist activities and he goes on to state that they are trying in a different way to destroy our country. Now, that is one reason that has struck the Government.

Then, the Defence Secretary also says in the Daily News of 18.01.2012, I quote:

Sri Lanka is still under threat -warns Defence Secretary

Sir, in the light of that situation there are some serious developments, which I would like to bring to the notice of the Government. Particularly these days you will see it is widely reported in the press and elsewhere that France had issued stamps commemorating the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and its dead Leader Velupillai Prabakaran. Sir, this is rejuvenation of the LTTE.

Then, when the matter was raised by the Sri Lankan Government, it was followed by denials and then apologies. Some countries apologized; some countries denied and some countries did not. Not long thereafter, it was discovered that Canada too had taken steps to do the same by issuing a set of commemorative stamps. Now, this is spreading throughout the world. We have to stop this. - [Interruption.] This was compounded by the United Kingdom following suit. - [Interruption.] Please do not disturb me. I am speaking in support of your Government. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Are you supporting us? ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I am supporting this Order that is before the House.- [Interruption.] This person does not know what he is talking. - [Interruption.]

633 634

Those countries too denied, apologized and gave assurances that it will not happen again. No one is quite sure what the exact position is in the rest of the world in regard to the Tiger movement. All this was happening while our Ministry of External Affairs under the learned Professor, and more particularly our Missions in the respective countries, were blissfully unaware of what was going on. So, this is the problem.

All this is in the context of the Defence Secretary himself stating that "the LTTE diaspora is still active, that we need to be ever vigilant that they do not raise their heads again". This is what is important. As if this was not bad enough, it is now reported that some local political party with a violent past has established links with the LTTE. This is another news item that appeared. This is also a serious situation.

None of this bodes well for Sri Lanka. They are not in our favour. What is our Ministry of External Affairs and our representatives abroad doing about all those matters that are taking place outside this country?

For the moment it is the commemorative stamps. One does not know where it will stop and where it will end. The next step may be the opening of a consular office of the LTTE. This may be followed by a full diplomatic representation of a government in exile. These are very serious situations. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. (Alhaj) A.H.M. Azwer to take Chair? ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I propose that the Hon. (Alhaj) A.H.M. Azwer do now take Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to. , ... .

, , ... . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER took the Chair.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! Acting Leader of the Opposition, you may continue with your speech.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, this question of issuing of stamps, regrouping of the LTTE and all that is a matter of intelligence that the Ministry of External Affairs should follow up. They should not allow these things to happen in the other parts of the world where we have representation. All that means either our intelligence unit is not working or our representatives are ineffective.

It is time that we take a hard look at these missions and take remedial steps before it is too late. Now, this is what is important. We need to assess the appointments and see that trained and competent persons are appointed to handle these missions. That is important. It is the duty of the missions, the embassies or the consulates of Sri Lanka to look into these matters.

Will the Minister of External Affairs inform this House as to how many other countries have issued similar stamps? We would like to know. Now, we are aware of only these three countries. But, there maybe many other countries that are issuing stamps in the name of Velupillai Prabhakaran, which is a very serious situation. I would also like to know from the Government what steps they intend taking to prevent any future occurrences of this nature. It must be stopped and not allowed to continue. France and Britain, particularly, have not taken adequate steps to prevent the issue of these stamps. Especially in the context of what the Defence Secretary has stated, we would like to know what steps the Government intends to take to prevent the regrouping of LTTE cadres here and abroad.

Now, this is the situation, Sir. I remember in Thailand these people were harbouring the LTTE and even KP was hiding. So, this piece of legislation, the Order that is to be approved by this House today is very important. We are under the impression that the LTTE problem is all over, that there are no Tigers in this country and that movement has been destroyed. But, from the evidence that we see and what is going on in other parts of the world, this is a very serious situation. Of course, the Ministers here or the President or other officials here cannot do anything. Therefore, the missions, the embassies and the consulates that are operating in other parts of the world have to take adequate action in order to prevent the issuing of these stamps, regrouping of the LTTE organization and other activities that are taking place. So, this piece of legislation is very important though it may not directly apply to other parts of the world.

I would very earnestly request the Hon. Minister of External Affairs to kindly take immediate action to see that the issuing of these stamps is stopped and prevented without allowing it to spread to the other parts of the world. It is very unfortunate that he is not here today. I

635 636

[ ]

2012 20

mean, I would like to have an answer on that. I want to know what measures he has taken, what action they have taken to prevent any further LTTE uprising in this country as well as in other parts of the world.

Thank you, Sir.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . . [5.36 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, I must thank all the Members who participated in todays Debate, which is in reference to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, No. 25 of 2002 and the specific Agreement that we have signed between Thailand and Sri Lanka to bring into effect the application of the Act in relation to criminal matters between the two countries. I am sure that this Agreement itself is not a matter of any controversy. Therefore, I would recommend that this House approves the request of the Ministry.

Having said that, there had been many other issues raised today in the Debate, which pertain to the administration of justice and which refer to the law and order situation and law enforcement matters in the country. I must very categorically state that though there were various allegations meant to be directed at the Government, there are specific issues which merit some response.

I must at the very outset assure this House that as regards the Tangalle incident, the Criminal Investigation Department has conducted a very thorough and impartial inquiry. I am already informed that the investigations are all complete and the file is now to be sent to the Attorney

675 676

[ - ]

2012 20

-Generals Department for necessary action to charge sheet the accused accordingly. An identification parade has been conducted and those who have been identified are still in remand. So, we will await the action by the Attorney-Generals Department on this issue. The British High Commissioner also saw me in this regard and he appreciated the action that the Government has taken to keep the British High Commission informed about the ongoing activities of the Criminal Investigation Department into this incident in Tangalle. Since it has far reaching implications for the countrys tourism industry, the Government has taken whatever action that needed to be taken to see that no such things are ever repeated in any place in our country. I must also say that the Hon. Dilip Wedaarachchi also referred to and thanked the Secretary, Defence for having acted very decisively on the issue.

I must refer to the fact that when the Secretary, Defence a few days ago opened the new Police Station at Narahenpita, he very categorically said that nobody in the police should ever give reasons of any political interference as an excuse for not completing investigations or not pursuing their official duties. So, that was very specifically said. - [Interruption.] Sometimes, there are elements within the law enforcement machinery conveniently hiding behind the excuses of this nature. Therefore, I believe that a very open and public statement made by the Secretary, Defence will go a long way and, if at all, there is any culture of impunity, that culture would never be there in this country. Therefore, it must be borne in mind that these issues of impunity should never occur anywhere in the country and that is something that we, at the Ministry of Justice, are very keen to see that it should be implemented properly.

There were also references even to the Judicial Service Commission by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, various others and particularly the Hon. Anura Dissanayake, when he was referring to matters in the judiciary, he was commenting that the Judicial Service Commission was not independent enough. I must very clearly point out that the practice in this country for several years under different Constitutions have been to constitute the Judicial Service Commission with the Chief Justice and two other senior most judges of the Supreme Court. That practice still continues and I must very categorically state that the functions of the Judicial Service Commission is a matter regarding which no outside interference is ever permitted and they have conducted their affairs with dignity, decorum and responsibility.

Having said that, it is important for me to respond also to some of the allegations that were brought about by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella referring to a Report in the Wall Street Journal about our judicial system. Apparently, that particular news item refers to some weaknesses in our judicial system and has complained about certain misgivings about the rule of law concept in this country.

While reading the Report, there was reference made to delay in our judicial system as well as certain commercial disputes being settled out of court since the litigants were not happy about the speed of disposal of cases in our court system. I must very categorically say that when it comes to commercial disputes, we have now set up Commercial High Courts within our court system. There are three Commercial High Courts functioning in Colombo. It is now proposed to expand the Commercial High Courts to Kandy and other capital cities, provided there are sufficient number of cases which exceed a monetary value of Rs. 5 million, to see that commercial disputes are brought to a conclusion expeditiously. In this regard Her Lordship the Chief Justice had several discussions with the Ministry of Justice and we are also in the process of looking at the causes of delays in our judicial system and have taken steps to introduce very important structural changes regarding which I have already apprised the House several times on previous occasions, particularly the new amendments to the Civil Procedure Code and the proposed amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code, wherein we are introducing new concepts such as mediation into our judicial system. I do not think that I need to elaborate on those matters since I have already mentioned about these matters previously in the House. But, I must very happily inform the House that the Cabinet has already given approval to the new amendments to the Civil Procedure Code and as soon as the Cabinet Subcommittee on Legislation approves those amendments, we will submit it to the Legal Draftsman to prepare the necessary legislation to be brought before this House.

Together with that, it is also important for me to refer to another issue that was brought up pertaining to the general climate of peace and normalcy that prevails in the country and the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella attempted to say that in setting up hotels in Kalpitiya, that there are no takers.

As a matter of fact, a few days ago, when the Emir of Qatar visited this country, they have agreed provisionally to set up three resorts in Kalpitiya in the islands that are available to set up resorts and provisional agreement has also been reached on even building a highway direct from Katunayake to the Kalpitiya Tourism Zone. And, I believe these are issues that show the confidence the international community has in the potential for the tourism industry in this country. I am sure these comments by the Hon. Member will certainly be disapproved very soon.

Having said that, we must also refer to the issues pertaining to legislation that sometimes are brought up as being considered urgent in the national interest and that is a very extraordinary provision. Sometimes when the Cabinet approves certain Bills to be of national interest, there is provision in the Constitution to bring the legislation to Parliament not within 24 hours, but there is 48 hours available for anyone to complain. But, that is only an extraordinary provision and that will certainly be used only in exceptional cases.

677 678

Mr. Presiding Member, there have also been references to the LLRC Report and the Hon. Leader of the House who is here, did make a statement to the House about the Governments intention on the LLRC Report; he did make an original statement and certainly there are a variety of recommendations regarding good governance, issues pertaining to law and order and law enforcement. The Ministry of External Affairs is currently studying the Report very carefully and we will soon be taking steps to implement the recommendations wherever possible, within the shortest possible time so that concerns expressed will be attended to.

The important issue that was raised by the Member, Hon. Ajith P. Perera, refers to a matter which he raised several times at the Consultative Committee on the Ministry of Justice. That was pertaining to the so-called Panadura Magistrate's Bungalow now being used as a restaurant. This matter came up today too in the House. I must very categorically state that though I asked for some time - I asked for two months' time - to reply the Question, I will attempt to answer it even sooner, if possible, and see that we attend to this issue, because I am sure, though he pointed the finger at various elements for having been involved in corruption, in this issue up to now, my Ministry has not shirked its responsibility. But, there are some difficulties in getting the information necessary at the local level. We will definitely try and probe into this matter and take effective action. If at all, has there been any undue practice which borders on bribery and corruption, we will definitely take the necessary action that needs to be taken.

Having said that, I do not think I must take anymore time of this House. I must thank once again all the Members who took part in the Debate and assure those Members that whatever concerns that have been expressed will be addressed, and wherever possible we will send them the necessary response.

Thank you.
