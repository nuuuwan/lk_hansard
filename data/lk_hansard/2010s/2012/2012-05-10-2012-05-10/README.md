asked the Minister of External Affairs:

(a) Will he state-

(ii) if so, the names of such companies;

(iii) as to when they were contracted;

(iv) whether they were selected on tender basis;

(v) if not, as to why it was done so;

(vi) the amounts paid monthly to each company in Sri Lankan rupees; and

(b) Will he state-

(iii) the owners of those companies; and

(iv) whether those companies are attempting to engage in foreign policy making too?

(c) Will he admit that the Ministerial employees will de-motivate owing to assigning one of their duties to the outside firms as per above?

(d) If not, why?

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Sir, on behalf of the Minister of External Affairs, I answer the Question.

(a) (i) No. The Ministry of External Affairs has not contracted, employed or disbursed any funds to any Public Relations Company.

(ii) Does not arise.

(iii) Does not arise.

(iv) Does not arise.

(v) Does not arise.

(iii) Not applicable.

(iv) Does not arise.

(c) Not applicable.

(d) Does not arise.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Speaker, I must commend the Hon. Deputy Minister for getting away very skilfully from the main Question. What I posed from Question (a) (i) could have been blocked by Question (b) (ii) because what I have asked is whether there is any engagement with outside sources? I have got a document here with me from Bell Pottinger which has been addressed to Ajith Nivard Cabraal and copied to the Ministry of External Affairs and the Presidents Office. You, as the Deputy Minister and the Acting Minister of External Affairs is telling in this House that you have not engaged Bell Pottinger which prepared the speech for the President at the United Nations. How can you be stealthily misleading this House?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Member, your Question is, I quote:

Whether the Minister of External Affairs has contracted or employed Public Relations (PR) companies to perform work for Sri Lankan government overseas.

I am categorically saying that the Ministry of External Affairs has not engaged or paid any funds from our Ministry to any of them.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is the answer for Question (a) (i). Look at Question (b) (i).

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Yes, Question (b) (i) is, I quote:

whether any more PR companies will be employed in overseas work;

The answer is, I quote:

No such decision as at present.

So, this is the present situation.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) This document has been copied to the Ministry of External Affairs.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) But, we have not employed them. You had better ask it from the relevant Ministry, not from the Ministry of External Affairs. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) , . The first one is : when I was in London, Bell Pottinger told me that they were working for the Government of Sri Lanka. The second is: () (ii) , " , .." . .

. . , . , . () (ii) . . , " ." . . . , . . , "Are you willing to work for us?" . "No. We are working for the Government of Sri Lanka" . . . . .

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) The Question is not whether we met them or had any discussions but whether we are employing them. We are not employing them. Hon. Leader of the Opposition, the Ministry of External Affairs has not employed or requested for their services.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Acting Minister of External Affairs, can you read the Sinhala version of the Question? . ()(ii) , " , ?" . , . . ? () (ii) .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . [ ] . - [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) I cannot answer on behalf of other ministries. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My third supplementary Question is: the Hon. (Prof.) G.L Peiris said that he would not go to the United States to meet Hillary Clinton. But, now suddenly he is going. With this I am informed that Mr. Ravinatha Aryasinha and a US company is trying to do a way forward with a document. I am informed that it is more likely that you have got to spell your policies out before you go to the US. Is another PR firm being engaged by the Presidents Office, by the Government of Sri Lanka, by the Ministry of External Affairs or by anybody you know, on Hon. (Prof.) G.L Peiriss visit to the US? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Mr. Speaker, it is not relevant to the Question asked by the Hon. Member. I answered the relevant Question and said that our Ministry has not engaged any PR company.

"We, the Board of Directors of the National Savings Bank wish to state the following..."

. . . I quote:

The offer from TFC initially came to NSB to subscribe for their voting shares in January 2011. The Bank carried out a detailed analysis on the TFC and was willing to purchase the voting shares up to approximately 8.33%. However, since the share issue had been over-subscribed, we were not in a position to proceed.

415 416

Similarly, the Bank received an invitation from a stock broker to purchase voting shares in March 2012. Since, the Bank had already carried out a detailed analysis in January 2011, the Board Sub Committee on Corporate Lending and Equity Investment decided to re-look at the investment from a strategic initiative point of view with further analysis. Having done a further analysis, a favourable consideration was given to purchase voting shares of TFC, amounting to 10% - 15%.

However, since the Board was of the view that benefits of this investment is not as strong enough to proceed with, a decision was taken not to make the payment, due on this transaction.

The above decision was conveyed to the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr. P.B. Jayasundara at the meeting held on 8th May 2012 with the entire Board of Directors of NSB.

That means, the Secretary to the Treasury has met the Board of Directors of the NSB.

It goes on to state, I quote: Other relevant parties too have been informed of this development, accordingly. The Secretary advised the Board that the Bank should not move out from its core activity and advised to promote NSB as a premier savings bank without exposing its risk profile to maintain public confidence.

As far as that transaction is concerned, no money has been paid. As you know, under the normal stock exchange operations, if the money is not paid, then that arrangement lapses. That is the situation. Then, I want to tell you something more. That is not the only position

, , , , , , . [2.45 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, my Colleague, the Hon. Leader of the House gave an extensive history of the late Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte. As there are nearly 30 Members to speak, I do not want to take too much time of the House by repeating it. Especially, the Hon. Anurudha Ratwattes services to the SLFP are best known to the Members who worked with him. All I have to say is that he did play a leading role in ensuring the victory of the SLFP back again in 1994. He certainly must get credit for part of the ground work that was laid during the period when they were in the Opposition.

Sir, the Hon. Anurudha Ratwattes father was a founder member of the United National Party, like your father. He was a Member of the State Council for Kegalle and subsequently represented Mawanella in the first House of Representatives when the late Hon. D.S. Senanayake was the Prime Minister. The Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte also started his politics in the Kandy Municipal Council as a Member of the UNP. Subsequently in 1970, over differences of the party in preparing the nominations, he joined the SLFP and to his credit he thereafter served that party loyally as earlier he had been in the UNP and his father served the party.

I got to know him well in 1989 when he entered Parliament. I had met him earlier briefly. I had met him on a few occasions but in 1989 I got to know him. As a Member of Parliament, there were times when he himself took an interest in the affairs of the House. In 1988-89, when we insisted that this House should sit and we should not stop because there were disruptions elsewhere, he was one of those who supported it. I must say that much. He had a very close dialogue with the late Hon. Ranjan Wijeratne.

Thereafter from 1990, when the fight was going on, when the battle started again with the LTTE, despite the arguments and the differences that were held in the House, in the Chamber, there were many occasions which I found the Hon. Ratwatte together with the late Hon. Ranjan Wijeratne discussing the strategy where they agreed and where they disagreed. That was a healthy relationship. Thereafter, the late Hon. Ranjan Wijeratne would take the matters up with the Hon. D.B. Wijetunga, late President, who was the Prime Minister and the Minister of State for Defence at that time and latterly I, as the Prime Minister, answered the questions on defence and he did take an interest and in some of the few instances that I spoke in the House at length on defence strategy and also got his comments. I must thank him for the interest he has always shown in these matters. Sir, during this time, for nearly an year, he could not participate in the affairs of the House since he had an accident and had to undergo surgery.

It was in 1994 that you could see the Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte blossoming out when Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the President made him the Deputy Minister of Defence as well as the Minister of Irrigation, Power and Energy. I laughed and said, You were originally in the uncle-nephew party. Now, you have gone to the niece and uncle party. That was the only difference that was there. But, I must say he was quite jovial about it.

One issue I must mention is the Kukuleganga Scheme which we opened when I was the Prime Minister but nevertheless the groundwork was done when the Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte was the Minister. He did show interest in irrigation works, mainly in restoration and renovation, which were an important aspect because we build canals and tanks and forget to renovate them. He did pay his attention to that.

Also in the power sector, I remember him with regard to the Muthurajawela Oil Storage Scheme and more so, the way in which he handled the electricity strike. I remember that it dragged on and the country was without electricity. We took it up in the House, from this side. Some of the engineers came and met us because they were frightened. So, we took it up. All other assurances were given, but with regard to that, he said, No, I am going to break this strike and that is what he did. The relationship between the engineers and the Minister is a

very difficult one. I have never been the Minister of Power but I have been at the receiving end as Prime Minister from the same engineers' union. Those are difficulties every Government has to face. The less I have to say about it these days, the better. But, he found time, despite his involvement in conducting and overlooking the day-to-day campaign against the LTTE, to look at the other aspects of the Ministry and that says a lot of his dedication to the task.

It was here, as Deputy Minister of Defence, that he conducted the day-to-day strategy and as the Hon. Leader of the House mentioned, he took the blame for some of the setbacks in handling the security of the City, but we disagreed and said, Your resigning is not sufficient; the President and the whole Government should resign. That led to another big argument in the media for another month as to whether we were traitors to ask for the resignation of the Government or not. But, we had similar arguments when the Hon. Ranjan Wijeratne was the Minister of State for Defence.

The Hon. General Anurudha Ratwatte's name will be remembered with all the major operations that took place at that time, beginning from "Riviresa" and then going on to "Agni Keela". I did have my differences of opinion with him on the strategy that was followed. How can you take over Jaffna when you did not have a supply line? That was one of the bigger arguments. Then, whether there should have been "Riviresa II and III" or should we cut a road to the Vanni along the coastal lines were some other issues. Finally, it was "Jayasikuru". He did come up most of the way but we did not have the troops. Finally, the setback came and that was when most of the bitter debates took place between the two of us in the House. But, I must say this much. Though the Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte took responsibility for "Agni Keela", I do not know whether he was actually responsible for it. Up to date, I have a question mark. The Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte was such that he took responsibility for everything that was under the Ministry. In fact, for defence, he was not merely the Deputy Minister, but also, in my view, a de facto commander of the combined forces.

That is how he functioned and he was always on the field. That is one thing we have to appreciate. He was there on the field and he took the risk, including the risk of landing once in an area which was under the control of the LTTE. We all were wondering what would happen if the Deputy Minister of Defence and the IGP were all taken captive by the LTTE. That was one of the big worries we had. Whatever be the differences, we could not have Ministers being held hostage but fortunately, he got through.

As a Minister, he was, I would say, a controversial one and he loved being a controversial Minister. He styled himself from the late Hon. Ranjan Wijeratne. The debates were very hard; we hit him hard and he replied

427 428

hard. That was the way. Maybe at Trinity, he was used to playing a hard game, it was nothing new to him. But, that would not matter because at the end of the day, he came to the House and took responsibility; he was available to answer within the week Parliament met. You know that. We used to ask him questions and he used to come and answer; because he was in charge, he answered them, thereby carrying on the tradition the late Hon. Ranjan Wijeratne, the late Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali and all others followed earlier, that the armed forces should be responsible to the House and their control should also finally come to the House because the Army, the Navy and the Air Force have been raised by Acts of Parliament. We sometimes have Service Commanders who think they are above Parliament. It is not so. When we raised questions, he was always available to answer. Any question that we put, he never ducked. If someone was at fault, he removed him. I must say that during his time, a lot of young new officers came up, who proved their capability and showed their best in the next phase of the fighting after 2007. There were three periods. The first was between 1984 and 1993, when a large number of officers learnt about the war.

Then came a second lot of officers who had got into the Army at that time but whose command responsibilities as colonels and brigadiers came under the first group. And finally, they themselves led some of the divisions and brigades in the last part. So, he had to be given the credit not merely for what he conducted but also for building up a group of officers who, subsequently were able to fight these battles.

There were times when he had to take difficult decisions. When bodies were found in the Diyawanna Oya, he had to take that responsibility. We blamed him for some of the things he did but as a Minister, there were no half-hearted answers from him. I feel sorry when I hear some of the answers given today. If the President and his Secretary says that the NSB deal was wrong, then you have to remove the persons who did it. The Minister says, "I do not know whether it is wrong and I am waiting for Stock Exchange to look into that". And, the Stock Exchange is looking at what Dinal Wijemanne did. I do not want to talk about Dinal Wijemanne and his activities because there is an investigation going on. Basically, you cannot get up and say he should have been removed. You remember what happened during the Diyawanna Oya case. The Hon. Ratwatte took a lot of flak on it at the way it was handled but he took the responsibility. Today, you do not find that. You are trying to whitewash a group of people who have given money out and you do not want to tell the House whether the money is with the NSB or with the Sampath Bank, when we all know that it is with the Sampath Bank. That is not the way to handle it. For whatever he was responsible as Minister, he answered and that is the way Parliamentary democracy has to function.

He appreciated it. He liked Parliamentary democracy. He knew how his father functioned; he was a part of the game. It was a part of his life blood. He loved it. How he managed without being in Parliament, I do not know.

But, as a controversial figure, he loved being in the centre of the controversy. I always wondered how two Trinitians were managing these: one, handling foreign affairs and the other handling defence. But, those are questions that are best not be elaborated now. But at the end of it, he was a character in Parliament and Parliament needs those characters: people who stand out, who answer questions and who become a part of the institution. The latter part of his career was in the Opposition, including a stint he had to do in the remand prison. We did our best on that occasion. Those are ups and downs of politics. Nevertheless, after 2004, he ceased to be in the House. So, when we met him, it was more as a former Member, an Adviser to the former President and the present President. We will miss him because whatever be our differences, he upheld the traditions of the House. He played the game in the House as he should have and he left behind something for the future to remember.

Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I would like you to convey the Oppositions condolences to the members of his family and I, together with my party, again pray that he attain Nibbana!. [.. 2.58]

[3.17 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today we are taking up the Vote of Condolence on one of the outstanding politicians who hailed from the hill country, a gentleman, a developer, a warrior and a fighter. Since I have had the opportunity of witnessing his performance in this House as a Member of Parliament and as a Minister, I appreciated it though we were on different sides. Looking at his record of activities as a Minister of Power and Energy, there were some landmark developments that he had embarked on whether it be electricity through thermal power or hydro power. There is a long list of projects that he had implemented during his tenure of office. I have no time to go into details to mention about those projects. They were really important projects most welcome to this country when we talk of industrial development and rural electrification. The tribute for whatever he had done during that period must go to him, irrespective of our political differences.

Then, in the field of irrigation, there were a number of irrigation projects that he had initiated in almost all the districts of Sri Lanka. I have got a full list here. But, I am unable to give a detailed list of all the irrigation projects that he had done since I have limited time. With all these responsibilities, he never neglected that aspect either.

Finally, I would like to come to a more important responsibility that he discharged as Deputy Minister of Defence, when the country was in very serious danger of losing certain parts of the North and the East. I must mention highlights of some of those operations that he did spearhead and gave leadership. Without merely sitting in an air-conditioned office, he went to the field and gave all the encouragement to the commanders of all the three forces. Some of those operations were, Operation Thunder Strike, Operation Riviresa, Operation Jayasikuru and Operation Rana Gosa. Those were the names that were used. Like that there were a whole lot of operations that he conducted and brought in very valuable results to ensure independence and safety of our country and to safeguard democracy. I could go on mentioning quite a large number of operations that he conducted but now there is no time for it.

Sir, unlike these days, the STF at that time embarked on unearthing landmines but today they are going for treasure hunting. That is the bad part of the whole thing. That is the difference. Whatever it maybe, there is a young Parliamentarian from that family, none other than the Hon. Lohan Ratwatte. He is a charming personality. He also looks a fighter. I hope he will achieve great heights and reach the positions that his father had in the near future. I wish him good luck!

May I convey our deepest sympathies on the demise of this great man from the hill country to his wife and children. May he attain Nibbana!

Thank you.

[3.28 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I came to know the late Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte very closely in 1979. That was the time of the Municipal Election and he was a mayoral candidate during that period. Thereafter,

we had a very close association for nearly 20 years. Just like any other relationship, we had brilliant times and difficult times. But when you look back, it is fair to say that we had more good times than otherwise.

When you look at Anurudha's political life, there were two periods where he shone as a politician. The first period was in 1994, when he became a very powerful Cabinet Minister or the most powerful Cabinet Minister of the 1994 Government and handled five or six Ministries. During this period, he did a great service not only to the people of Kandy but to the entirety of Sri Lanka. If you refer to the Kandy District, I think the most significant achievement was the giving of jobs to the youth. Nowadays there are arguments to say that State jobs should not be given and employment should be generated by the private sector. But when you look back, giving State jobs is a way of distributing wealth, giving a share of the cake to the people of this country. It is no exaggeration to say that he gave nearly 10,000 jobs to the people of the Kandy District, which I think, was a great achievement. In the field of giving electricity, most of the Kandyan villages were neglected because it was difficult to erect power lines in the terrain; the cost was very high. But, I know several instances where I had made representations and approval was given to lay power lines even at a loss to the Government.

With regard to the irrigation schemes, it is well-known as stated by the Leader of the House the efforts he made with regard to the farmers of the Minipe area.

Then, the other significant period in his life was the "Jayasikuru" operation. I remember, at that time I was the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. I was with the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar and there was a discussion in the Foreign Ministry together with Anurudha about this "Jayasikuru" operation. I remember the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar telling Anurudha, "Anurudha, you can prosecute the war. But remember, there must not be civilian casualties because if there are civilian casualties, I, as the Foreign Minister, cannot go round the world. You can destroy the terrorists but human rights must be protected and there must not be civilian casualties". That advice, Anurdha followed to the hilt. You, as a person from Jaffna, are aware of how the "Jayasikuru" operation was conducted. People were flown to move on to safe areas and those safe areas were never touched. The operation was a success. There were hardly any civilian casualties. The United Nations did not make a big fuss; the NGOs did not make a big fuss; the political parties in Sri Lanka did not make a big fuss. Why was that? Because it was conducted in the correct way. Wars have to be conducted in accordance with international law and international human rights conventions and that is why the Jaffna Operation, I would say, is a model operation in the annals of our military.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would like to mention that in his political life he was supported very strongly by his wife, Carmen. Between the years 1977 and 1994, the difficult times, he was in the Opposition for 17 years and Carmen stood by him and supported Anurudha in all his political fabric.

However, as the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake said, he was the architect of the PA Government in 2004. He was the main architect. No other person can get the credit. He was the one who went abroad and got Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga to come back to Sri Lanka to join politics. But, the very party he brought to power denied him nomination in 2004. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Was it in 2004? ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Yes, in 2004. I think that affectively ended his political career. But, I think towards the latter part of his life he was a very happy and contended man because by that time two of his sons were well established in politics. His eldest son, the Hon. Lohan Ratwatte, is a Member of Parliament and his second son, Mr. Mahendra Ratwatte, is the Mayor of Kandy. I might mention that with Lohan entering Parliament, it is the third generation: Lohan's grandfather was also a Member of Parliament; then his father, Anurudha and with himself, it is the third generation in Parliament, which I think is a rare occasion and we all appreciate.

One thing I noticed about Anurudha in his entire political life is that he was a very fearless person. He knew no fear whether it was political opponents, terrorists or whoever. He never shunned or moved away from problems. He always faced them bravely and courageously.

Finally, I might mention that at a certain point of time in his life, he was an acting Diyawadana Nilame of the Sri Dalada Maligawa. It is a rare privilege for a Buddhist. I am sure the merit he gained by serving the Dalada will help him in his journey through Samsara and as a Buddhist, I wish him the supreme bliss of Nirvana during his journey through Samsara.

Thank you.

[4.35 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Speaker, on this occasion, I stand up to pay tribute to a great leader who served our people and this country without any bias or favour.

The late Hon. General Anurudha Ratwatte was a friend of my family. As the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama said, my brother, Rajendran, the Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte and he were Trinitians who schooled together and my brother always considered him a friend who was very helpful and who was there during need.

In the 1970-77 period, though there were so many inhibitions to travel abroad, the Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte, who was then a Coordinating Secretary to the Prime Minister, was of great help to the people of Indian origin in Kandy, who had so many needs to go to India on several occasions. I can remember, in 1994, there were nine Trinitians in Parliament and there was a felicitation

453 454

[ () ]

2012 10

ceremony, on which occasion I first met the Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte.

During his period in this House from 1994 to 2000, he was a very powerful Minister, the Minister of Power and Energy as well as the Deputy Minister of Defence. He was an aristocrat with a majestic personality, but we were able to approach him and he would never say no. He always obliged us to serve our people or even on personal matters. That way, we were able to relate to him as a friend, to look up to him as a leader and he was a great personality.

When he was Deputy Minister of Defence in 1998, there was a request from the Hindus that they wished to visit the Thiruketheeswaram Temple on Maha Shivaratri Day. This was a special request because that area was under the control of the Army and there were no civilians living around that temple. But, there was a request that we wished to visit the Temple on the occasion of Maha Shivaratri. It was the Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte who gave us permission to go there and participate in religious ceremonies on that holy day. At that time, though it was under the control of the Army, the temple had been maintained so well and clean. We were able to perform our sacred duties without hindrance and with great appreciation at the way that temple had been protected by the forces at that time. This, we thought, was because of the unbiased leadership of this great man who was then Deputy Minister of Defence.

Subsequently, the people of the plantations had electricity. They see light today mainly because of the Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte who was then Minister of Power and Energy. In 1989, the Hon. Ranjan Wijeratne made a speech in this House and said that though the plantations brought in 60 to 70 per cent of foreign exchange at that time, no money from the State had been spent on the upliftment of the life of the plantation people. But in 1994, when the Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte assumed office as the Minister of Power and Energy, electricity was supplied to the plantation houses by the State from State funds. Prior to that, every estate was considered as private property and to draw electricity lines from the street to the line rooms, the workers themselves had to pool their resources or draw loans from banks to pay for the pulling up of electricity lines from the road to the estate housing. It was the Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte who made a change for the first time and from 1994, electricity was provided by the State at State expense up to the doorstep of the plantation houses. This was a major change because before that they did not receive State assistance for this. In 1994, only 30 per cent of the houses in the plantations had electricity but today 80 per cent of plantation houses have electricity. This is solely because of the initiative taken by the late Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte. His breakthrough in providing State funds for development in the plantations was followed through later by the Ministry of Livestock Development and Estate Infrastructure which was created in 1996.

On this occasion, we pay tribute to a great leader, a leader who shone as a Deputy Minister of Defence, who was elevated to the position of a General in this country. We also pay tribute to him for the services he rendered to the people of Kandy, the people in the plantations, the people of Indian origin who cherish his memories and will always be grateful to him.

On this occasion, I convey my sincere condolences to the family of the late Hon. General Anurudha Ratwatte. We are glad that his services are going to be continued by his two sons who are in politics today: one in this House and one leading the people of Kandy. The Hon. Anurudha Ratwatte started serving the people of Kandy from 1971 and during the period 1970-1977, he was the person whom the people of Kandy approached because Kandy was then represented by the UNP and with a Government of the SLFP, he was the link to provide services to the people of Kandy. I wish to end my speech by saying that we hail this great man.

Thank you. [.. 4.44]
