Improving the performance and efficiency of loss-making state enterprises will help free resources for infrastructure investment and lending to the private sector. Newly reconstituted management in key public enterprises is expected to improve the performance of these enterprises. A separate Ministry of State Resources and Enterprise Development has been established to concentrate on under-performing state assets and addressing the issues in loss-making enterprises.

[Interruption.] - Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Minister may intervene if he wants to, but I do not want others with subservient attitudes to join the Hon. Minister in trying to create a problem in this Parliament. - [Interruption.] .

It further states,I quote:

Electricity prices are comparatively high ..

Standing Order No. 27 states, I quote:

the reply will be then given by the Prime Minister or the Minister to whom the question is addressed.

I do not think we ever contemplated that a Question was going to take this long.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) . 26 27 . . . ; . , . . If you take the position that it should be answered, then it is okay. We must be clear on what you are trying to raise. We will facilitate giving answer to a Question but sometimes, we need time.

, , 29. , . Standing Order No. 29 (2) states, I quote:

(2) A question must not be made the pretext for a debate.

Are we following that? Are you agreeable to follow that? These are questions over Parliamentary practice and procedure, on which we have extended and given enough room to adjust and the Chair decides on these matters. Just because you have asked a Question and the Government has asked for time, it does not imply that the Government is not ready to answer. We have given enough reasons because we have to collect information. Therefore, you should not rush and say that we are trying to avoid a Question. We have always obliged and answered every Question that you all have asked. When some Answers are already given as printed mattter, which are placed either in the Library or on the table of the MP, the Questions is asked and we still reply.

I would like to canvass, Hon. Speaker, that you appoint a Committee to go into these matters. New procedures must be evolved. We cannot be following these old practices, on which you can rest today with 225 MPs and a limited number of Sitting Days. This is one problem we are having. If all the backbenchers ask Questions, how can we list them? How can we search for information? So, Hon. Leader of the Opposition, I would like you to rethink of the issue that you canvassed on Standing Order No. 27, which we have already amended, with the consent of the House, to give time.

Secondly, as per Standing Order No. 29 (2), no debate is possible. You have agreed and I have agreed on that, but the House continues to have debates. So, Sir, we should reconsider all these matters if the issue is raised.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . , -

1591 1592

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, I do not think there is a serious disagreement between the Chief Government Whip and myself. I did not say that the Answer should be given immediately. I said that there must be a time limit. Okay, if you want time, you can ask for time once or twice. We do not mind that. But, as some Hon. Members pointed out, the time taken to answers some of the Questions has gone up to one year. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Over one year. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Yes, over one year. That is not possible and it is not good.

Secondly, with regard to the practice where some Ministers say, We require a long time as this involves details, I think such issues can be taken up by the Minister at the very first time the Question is asked. He can say, We will table it as a written answer. You can decide that at that stage. What I am saying is, do not wait till the last minute or after six months to say, It requires a long answer. As far as what is considered an answer and what is considered a debate is concerned, the Chair has to finally decide. This is because in Sri Lanka, the nature of a Question is quite different from that of England, where it is a general Question that is asked. But, we are very specific; we even ask about someones pension.

I certainly have no problem sitting down with the Hon. Member and talking of the time required. Another matter is, when Sittings were at 10 o'clock in the morning, everyone said, We must sit in the afternoon because then we can finish our lunch and come back. Now, we sit in the afternoon, but it is the same number and the same Members. The few of us who were present in the morning then are the same Members who are now present in the afternoon. . .

stock exchange . . . . There are a whole lot of Questions in the Order Book. How do we cut through those? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , ,

. , . . . , .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Speaker -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Speaker, may I draw your attention to the fact that there is a Committee sitting on revision of the Standing Orders, of which I am also a Member. There have been certain suggestions made. I think the Committee originally sat under the Chairmanship of the Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena.

Now, that apart, this Parliament is duty-bound to go by the Standing Orders that are before us. Sir, you have to only give a ruling by interpreting the Standing Orders that are in force at the moment.

With all due respect, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition misquoted Standing Order No. 27. It does not compel, as he says, any Minister to answer questions forthwith. The Minister has all the right to ask for a date, because perhaps he had to collect so many information, sometimes running into hundreds of pages. Therefore, it is not a new procedure. Even during the time of the UNP Government, of which I was a Member, the Prime Minister and other Ministers asked for longer time to answer Oral Questions. Sometimes, they never answered any question at all. That was the procedure that they followed which they thought was right at that time. You have to go by the Standing Orders that we are following. Standing Order No. 28 (1) states, I quote:

Provided that not more than three supplementary questions shall be asked on any answer :

How many hundreds of questions are they asking in the morning? It is not three as stipulated in the Standing Orders. Then, there is another matter. As the Hon. Chief Government Whip pointed out, Standing Order No. 29 (2) states, I quote:

A question must not be made the pretext for a debate.

Now, today what happened? When a Question was asked from the Minister of Power and Energy by the Hon.

1593 1594

Ravi Karunanayake, it went beyond the description of even a debate. Sir, that shall not be allowed. We have to strictly follow the Standing Orders. I am going to raise a point of Order everyday because they are asking more than three Supplementary Questions. Sir, you are very liberal; you are very generous and therefore, you are allowing it. But, it cannot be allowed. - [Interruption.] Wait, I am speaking; I am on my feet. We will strictly follow the Standing Orders and if there are any changes to be made, any deviations, then the Committee can sit, discuss and finalize the report and present it before Parliament. Until then, we cannot deviate from even one word of the Standing Orders, which is before us. Once again, I tell you that under Standing Order No. 27, the Minister has all the power to ask for time. It can be one month or it can be even one year. There is no time limit. Sir, after all, we follow this procedure. According to the Standing Orders, you cannot read papers; you cannot read your speech. But, we are deviating from that and doing it. Therefore, Sir, we will agree upon the revision of that Standing Order and then when it comes before the House, we can get the whole thing re-assessed. The British Parliament is quite different although we are following the Westminster system. These Standing Orders are quite different. Our Standing Orders are unique because they are relevant only to the Sri Lanka Parliament. We do not quote from other Parliaments to substantiate our arguments.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Member who spoke prior to me on a Standing Order, said that I had asked a Question from the Minister of Power and Energy and that it went on for long. Just because it is beyond his comprehension, it does not mean that I have got to ask questions that are in his mental framework. I ask questions on behalf of the people that we represent, we are not like him who has got to sing hosannas for dinner to survive in Parliament. That is the difference between the two.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, there is another matter that I would like to bring to your notice.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, could you please give me one minute?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Yes.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) When the Hon. Leader of the Opposition raised this question about the stock exchange - apart from the Questions asked in Parliament, he made a statement as the

1605 1606

Leader of the Opposition - I gave a very comprehensive reply. That is now tabled in the Library. Have you taken a look at that?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Of course, I have. Thank you very much and I appreciate what you have done. But, I am also a Member of Parliament. I too have a right to ask questions and I have asked a Question on the EPF almost one year ago, which is getting delayed and delayed. Now, for the fifth consecutive time, it has been delayed. What I am trying to say is that the reason behind not answering these Questions is not that the Government does not have the answers; the Government very much has the answers. But, it does not want to let the country know what it is up to and this is one example that I am giving:

The Employees Provident Fund owns 8.4 per cent of The Finance Company. The Finance Company is a company that was in the news in the recent past due to a transaction between that company and the National Savings Bank. This is important and I am going to say this. In a statement issued on the 2nd of May, the Chairman of The Finance Company, a gentleman by the name of Mr. Preethi Jayawardena, who is also in one of the Consultative Committees of the Central Bank says, "When I was appointed as Chairman of the company and the new Director Board took over, upon intervention of the Central Bank, The Finance Company was in great financial difficulty. From Rs. 1.7 billion loss-making venture, the company has witnessed a significant turnaround, making Rs. 15 million profit during the last three quarters". This is important and you keep this in mind. Then, he further says, "This company is the largest and most sought-after financial institution in the country. Today, the monthly intake in deposits of the company has exceeded Rs. 1 billion, which mirrors investor and public confidence in the company".

This is also important, Sir. Soon thereafter, the Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions of the Central Bank issued a statement on the 27th of May, 2012. I will table* the whole document and would like to read some parts of it to be included in Hansard.

The document states, I quote:

"Clarification issued by the Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions regarding certain politician's statements about The Finance Co. PLC"

We do not know who the politician is but accusing an Opposition politician. It further states:

"The Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions (DSNBI) of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka continuously supervises and monitors all licensed finance companies and specialized leasing companies licensed by the Monetary Board."

It further states:

"..........The Finance Co. PLC is today among the top five finance companies in the country in terms of its asset base, and is fulfilling its obligations satisfactorily in accordance with the restructuring plan and the conditions imposed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka."

It states that it is satisfactorily fulfilling the obligations laid down by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Then, it further goes on to state, I quote:

"In these circumstances the public is hereby informed that The Finance Co. PLC is a stable finance company and therefore, not to be misled by statements about the company's progress and functions, as made by certain politically motivated persons."

Now, this is the position. This was issued on the 27th of May 2012, which is after the date that the Central Bank knew the exact position of the finances of The Finance Company as at the end of 31st March, 2012. Now, somebody can argue how is that possible because these accounts have to be audited and so forth and the Central Bank may not know the real position of The Finance Company until much later. But, I would like to read from the Annual Report for 2011-2012 of The Finance Company, released on the 15th of August. On page 24 of the Report it states, I quote:

"The Central Bank also conducts its audits to ensure that the Company complies with the regulations laid down by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. In addition, a reporting system is in place, which requires the Company to submit detailed reports concerning key areas of operations on a weekly/monthly/quarterly/annually to the Non-banking Supervision unit of Central Bank."

This means, on a weekly basis the Central Bank is aware of the internal happenings of The Finance Company. Therefore, when the Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions of the Central Bank released that document on the 27th of May 2012, it certainly knew whether The Finance Company was actually fulfilling the obligations in a satisfactory manner or not. Now, Sir, this is what I want to show you. The opinion of the auditors of The Finance Company is given at page 45 of the Report. It states that the Companys accumulated losses incurred during the year was Rs. 9.8 billion and the net assets show a negative balance of Rs. 3.8 billion and so on. What is important is not that. What is important is this. That is, the auditors say that these matters raise doubt in the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. , . So, this is a company that elicits deposits from the public.

So, that is what I wanted to point out. The reason the Government Ministers are not answering Questions has nothing to do with their having to look for the Answers. The answers are already there. The only reason why they are not giving the Answers is because they know that they have done something wrong. That is why they are scared to give the answers to the public.

[4.45 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Presiding Member, today we are speaking again about levies and custom duties imposed by the Ministry of Finance and Planning on the people of this country. Sir, taxes in the past were used to equate the poor and the rich. By taxing the rich and giving concessions to the poor, all people will have a fair opportunity to live as equals in the country. Sri Lanka being a Democratic Socialist Republic, I think, should follow this socialist policy by a party that is supposed to be left-of-centre. But, what is happening in this country? The people are being burdened with more and more taxes to increase the revenue of the Government, but not as a fiscal policy or as a means of bridging the gap between the rich and the poor.

We see taxes being imposed on the day-to-day essentials. In the past, it was an accepted practice that no taxes are imposed on food items so that people can lead their basic life which needs food as the most important sustaining requirement. But today, in fact, every other day, we see that taxes are imposed on food items. Yesterday, there was a tax increase of Rs. 20 on a kilogram of potatoes. The total tax on a kilogram of potatoes today in Sri Lanka is Rs. 50 which is unimaginable. In a country like India, you can buy a kilogram of potatoes for Rs. 10. But, you are imposing a tax increase of Rs. 20 on a kilogram of potatoes. Are potatoes a luxury item? Are they like apples? Even apples today are not considered as luxuries, but essentials. You impose taxes stating that you are going to protect the local farmer. Protecting the local farmer does not mean that you can burden the majority of the people who are consumers. The consumer also has the right to be protected as much as the farmer. So, to protect the consumer, you must provide subsidies to the farmer so that he can sell his produce at a profit while the consumer receives his goods at a fair and reasonable price. This has been totally forgotten by this Government which is only interested in raising revenue so that they can spend without any care. This Government is wasting the resources of the country by having tamashas to hoodwink the people and keep them always entertained. The Government is spending billions of rupees on all sorts of entertainment items, whereas the basic needs and the daily used consumer items of people are being taxed at exorbitant rates.

Sir, recently, the Government imposed higher taxes on motorcycles and small cars. In any country, it is the small cars which are taxed at the lowest rate. Also, motorcycles are today considered as a means of transport of middle-class or lower middle-class families. So, to impose such large taxes on motorcycles is unreasonable. Most of the motorcycles are imported to this country from India and most of the small cars or 50 per cent of

1645 1646

the cars are imported from India because small cars are manufactured at reasonable prices in India. Some people believe that this tax was imposed on small cars and motorcycles, more as a foreign policy initiative, to hit back at India that voted in the United Nations Human Rights Council against Sri Lanka. Is it fair to impose burdens on the people of this country because your diplomacy with India has failed?

Today, an ordinary citizen who goes to India is attacked. It is because of the wrong policies followed by this Government; not that Indian people have any animosity towards the normal citizens of Sri Lanka. It is all a failure of this Government. You yourself appointed the LLRC. You got a Report. You were refusing to implement that Report. Then, the US had to bring in a Motion in the United Nations Human Rights Council to force you to implement the LLRC Report. India, which stands by the affected people in this country, has a moral duty to support a Motion that has been brought to urge the implementation of the Report that was created by this Government. So, when India does that, you hit back at India by imposing taxes on motorcycles and small cars just because you think that it is going to affect the Indian economy.

The Indian economy is the fifth largest economy in the world. It is emerging with China to take first and second places in the future. Ours is a small country whose largest supplier of imported goods is India. But, you are trying to hit back at India imposing taxes on motorcycles and small cars. This is exactly what this Government is doing without knowing what is right and what is wrong.

Recently, you increased the duty on milk food by Rs. 136 which is Rs. 61 per 400-gram packet. You increased the duty on milk food saying that you are going to protect the local milk farmer. What is happening? Are you having the means to distribute the milk produced in this country to the ordinary consumer? You do not have the capacity to do that. You are throwing milk into the drains as the Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana said. You are burying milk in the ground using backhoe machines because you do not know how to distribute milk. But, before finding a way of distributing this milk you are throwing it out and you are imposing taxes saying that it is to protect the milk farmer. See the economics of milk production in this country. The National Livestock Development Board and Milco - both Government-owned institutions - are buying liquid milk at Rs. 50 and selling it at Rs. 120. The value addition or the price addition to the Rs. 50 milk is Rs. 70, which is 140 per cent. What exorbitant profits are the NLDB and Milco trying to make? Is this fair? If you can sell liquid milk that you buy for Rs. 50 at Rs. 70, then nobody is going to buy powdered milk which is being sold today at Rs. 260 for a 400-gram packet, which works out to about Rs. 78 per litre when you mix it and make the liquid milk. So, if milk that is produced abroad is

converted to powdered milk, packetted, sent to this country, advertised, marketed with all the commissions and still sold at Rs. 80, you all are buying local liquid milk at Rs. 50 and selling it for Rs. 120 with a value addition of Rs. 70 or profit addition of 140 per cent. Is this fair?

If you know how to manage the milk industry, then you will not be in this type of a situation. You are taking milk from the upcountry maybe to Pannala, Colombo or Kandy, converting it into powdered milk and then it is sent back to Nuwara Eliya. Then, again in Nuwara Eliya, they add water and they use this powdered milk. But still, it is cheaper than buying the liquid milk that is produced in Nuwara Eliya itself. The way to handle this issue is to have liquid milk-processing plants all over the country so that you do not have to transport it from Nuwara Eliya to Pallekele or from Nuwara Eliya to Colombo and then send it back to all the areas in the country. If you had a decentralized set up where liquid milk can be processed locally and distributed to the consumers at the local level, the milk that you buy at Rs. 50, you will be able to give the consumer at Rs. 70.

Even today, in India, a litre of milk is sold at Rs. 16 after conversion to Sri Lankan Rupees. That is because they buy at Rs. 10 and distribute at Rs. 6. But here, it is not that way.

. . ( )( . . - , )(The Hon. H.R. Mithrapala - Deputy Minister of Livestock and Rural Community Development) Hon. Member, who destroyed the local milk industry in this country?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Whoever did it, your duty today -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. H.R. Mithrapala) You started importing all these milk products - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You see, milk powder was given when we did not - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. H.R. Mithrapala) Do not worry. We will continue with this. You do not worry about this.

1647 1648

[ . ]

2012 19

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) "Do not worry", you cannot say that because we are part of this nation. We want to preserve the milk farmer.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. H.R. Mithrapala) What did you do? You imported milk powder from - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, we did not import. Even today, are you self-sufficient? Why are you throwing the milk produced in this country into the drains? You tell us that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. H.R. Mithrapala) You destroyed the milk industry. Why are you talking nonsense?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) We are not talking nonsense. Do not interrupt me. We want to preserve the milk farmer in this country.

That is what we are talking about. You do not know whether you are coming or going. - [Interruption.] So, do not talk. You are making all the mistakes. You have thrown away 800,000 litres of milk which cost you Rs. 40 million. If you had sold that at the price a litre of milk is sold to the consumer, that is at Rs. 120, you would have got nearly Rs. 120 million. But, you have thrown it into the drains. After you made the mistake, you have no right to shout here.- [Interruption.] Hon. Mithrapala, you are the Deputy Minister in charge of it and you are unable to do what has to be done. Why do you not decentralize - [Interruption.] If you have no brain to think, at least accept good advice and try to decentralize the distribution of liquid milk so that the cost of distribution will come down and the consumer will get liquid milk cheaper than powdered milk. That is the only way for you to change this and do not get angry just because we say the right thing. If you still cannot understand it, then give up your Ministry and we will get somebody else to manage it.

Then, I am going to speak about another issue - flour. This Government is trying to force people to eat rice. Again, the same reason is given. Does a citizen of this country not have the choice to eat what he likes? Do you want to burden the man who wants to eat bread or roti made out of flour, to eat rice? He is eating that not because he likes it. Anybody in the plantations would like

to eat rice but when they go for work in the morning, the women are unable to cook rice and take it with them. For convenience, they take roti made out of flour. But, the President comes to Nuwara Eliya and says, People should learn to eat rice. It is not that we do not know to eat rice. The up-country Tamil people know very well how to eat rice. They are people who eat rice at all their big functions. They do not eat just rice. They have a five-course meal with rice. They make so many forms of food using rice. It is not that they do not know it but for the convenience of their lives, they have to eat flour. But, you impose taxes on flour to make it as expensive as possible.

Talking about sugar, recently the international prices of sugar dropped. But, you will not let the man who takes sugar, to have the benefit of it. The sweetness of the sugar price coming down cannot be enjoyed by an ordinary man in this country because you immediately imposed a tax of Rs. 10 on every kilo of sugar so that the price of sugar does not come down. Maybe it is not good for you to take sugar since most of you are maybe having diabetes and cannot eat sugar, but the ordinary man does not have that problem. He wants to have a sweet meal, a sweet drink or a sweet cup of tea.

( ) (The Hon. Johnston Fernando) Hon. Member, we have no diabetic problems. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Not you, Hon. Minister. Maybe you are too big and it is bad for you to take sugar. - [Interruption.] No, for your height you are too fat, Hon. Minister, and because of that, maybe you should not take sugar. But, 45 per cent of the ordinary people are less than 25 years. They would like to have sweets; they would like to eat more ice-cream or more cakes. Let them have that. Do not impose taxes on sugar. By doing that, what are you gaining? You are getting revenue. Your only concern is to gain revenue, which is very unfortunate.

The other issue is about the tax imposed on IDD calls. We say the economy of this country is sustained mostly by our young women and men who are working in the Middle-East. They bring enough foreign exchange to bridge the gap. Our deficit is wiped out only through the remittances these people earn for this country. Today, due to the competition between the different service providers in the mobile telephony industry, the rates for international calls have come down very rapidly. It has come down to Rs. 3 and Rs. 2. If you have a regular number, it is less than Rs. 2. But, what do you do? You impose a tax of Rs. 2 on every minute that you speak on an IDD call. In addition to this, you also have to pay 20 per cent Telecommunication Levy. Why are you taxing

1649 1650

the people who bring money to this country to save your economy in this manner? What is the concession you have given to those who go to the Middle East and earn so much of foreign exchange for this country? They get a paltry duty-free allowance when they come back. Other than that, they have nothing to gain. Even though they have a duty-free allowance, they cannot buy these luxury goods with the money they bring. They bring it back to build a house or something like that. So, they do not use that duty-free allowance even to the full value. Other than that, they get nothing. At least, let them make a telephone call to their families who are far away, who sacrifice the life they would enjoy with their young children or their husbands or their grandchildren. You deprive them of all that happiness they could get by making a telephone call. Even that, you are depriving them by increasing the taxes. If the companies can provide the service at Rs. 2, you without doing anything take away another Rs. 2 to the Government and what do you do with that money? You enjoy the luxuries. The Ministers enjoy the luxuries. The Government is entertaining the people with all the costly shows that you can put up. Is this what you are trying to do?

Then, talking about the EPF, when the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne was the Minister of Labour Relations and Foreign Employment, he brought in a law. He proposed it at the NLAC to amend the EPF Act, so that any person who wishes to build a house or needs medical treatment, could withdraw one-third of the money in his EPF account, in advance. At the moment, we have a law which permits a person to borrow against the EPF balance in his account. When he borrows from a bank, he has to pay interest and also a monthly payment for the loan that he takes. If you borrow Rs. 30,000 and when you repay the loan, you are paying Rs. 78,000 including Rs. 48,000 as interest. Instead of that, the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne brought in a good law which permitted one to withdraw one-third of the amount remaining in his EPF account, in advance, if he had been a member of the EPF for 10 years. That is a very good piece of legislation. I commended that legislation when it came up in this House. But today, after 10 months, the Treasury has still not permitted the Ministry of Labour and Labour Relations to issue the circular and to issue the application forms for a person to withdraw this one-third from his own account. Why? Because the EPF is no more liquid. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I will wind up with this point. The EPF is not liquid. You have invested it in the share market. You have

invested it in other investments where your cash is not liquid. If the people are allowed to withdraw one-third of the amount remaining in their account for the purpose of building a house, then the whole EPF might collapse because this Government is sustained by the EPF only. Also, you have made unethical investments in the share market to buttress the share market mafia. So, with all this, the fate of the EPF that every employee in this country contributes towards, has become suspicious. The ordinary worker is today thinking whether he will be able to withdraw his EPF or not. If he cannot be paid one-third of his balance today, when he applies for total withdrawal of his balance, will he be permitted or will the Government have difficulty in repaying? This is the question in the mind of every worker. So, if you brought in a law, implement it. Let the Treasury permit the Minister of Labour and Labour Relations to issue the necessary circulars. Allow people to withdraw their money to build their own houses. Unless you do that the confidence that the people have in the EPF will be lost and that will be disastrous for labour relations in this country.

Thank you. [. . 5.09] ( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) ! , . , , , .
