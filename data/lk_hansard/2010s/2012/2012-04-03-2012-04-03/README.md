... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Speaker, the Mover of the Adjournment Motion accepts a portion of the Motion. That is with regard to the LLRC Report. - [Interruption.] Wait, let me finish - [Interruption.] The most important fact is that he - - only accepts a portion of the Motion that he has moved. The Motion cannot hold water because the Seconder of the Motion also does not accept the whole report. In toto, the whole of the LLRC Report must be accepted. But, the Mover of the Adjournment Motion says that he partially accepts the LLRC Report. Therefore, Sir, the Motion cannot go on.- [Interruption.] Either the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella must totally accept it or he must withdraw whatever he stated all this time - [Interruption.] Sir, I am making a valid

point because the Hon. Kiriella is the Seconder. Is he seconding this Adjournment Motion? ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , . , . . , , 26 . . [ ] . , .

This Joint Statement states, I quote:

"Sri Lanka reiterated its strongest commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, in keeping with international human rights standards and Sri Lanka's international obligations. The Secretary-General underlined the importance of an accountability process for addressing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. The Government will take measures to address those grievances."

.. ( ) ( .. - ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha - Minister of Petroleum Industries) I propose that the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer do now take the Chair. , . . Question put, and agreed to.

, ... .

, , ... . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER took the Chair.

[4.30 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Mr. Presiding Member, today, we are having this Debate on the Adjournment Motion moved in this House on the Resolution adopted by the UNHRC on Sri Lanka and the Statement made by the Acting Minister of

1911 1912

External Affairs in that respect. But, I think we are not coming to the point; we are just going round and round the mulberry bush. We must decide on what we should speak at this Debate.

Firstly, if we take up reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka, the United Nations Human Rights Council proposes the following in its Resolution, I quote:

"Guided by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights and other relevant instruments,......"

"Reaffirming that States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism complies with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, as applicable,

Taking note of the report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission of Sri Lanka and its findings and recommendations, and acknowledging its possible contribution to the process of national reconciliation in Sri Lanka,

Welcoming the constructive recommendations contained in the Commissions report, including the need to credibly investigate widespread allegations of extra-judicial killings and enforced disappearances, demilitarize the North of Sri Lanka, implement impartial land dispute resolution mechanisms, re-evaluate detention policies, strengthen formerly independent civil institutions, reach a political settlement on the devolution of power to the provinces, promote and protect the right of freedom of expression for all and enact rule of law reforms,

Noting with concern that the report does not adequately address serious allegations of violations of international law,

1. Calls upon the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the constructive recommendations made in the report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission and to take all necessary additional steps to fulfil its relevant legal obligations and commitment to initiate credible and independent actions to ensure justice, equity, accountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans;

2. Requests the Government of Sri Lanka to present, as expeditiously as possible, a comprehensive action plan detailing the steps that the Government has taken and will take to implement the recommendations made in the Commissions report, and also to address alleged violations of international law;

3. Encourages the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and relevant special procedures mandate holders to provide, in consultation with, and with the concurrence of, the Government of Sri Lanka, advice and technical assistance on implementing the above-mentioned steps; and requests the Office of the High Commissioner to present a report on the provision of such assistance to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-second session."

That is very important. After the end of the armed conflict or the brutal war three years ago, allegations of war crimes had been levelled against the Government and the LTTE. More than 100,000 lives have been lost and 40,000 in the last month of the conflict alone.

The United Nations had brought three Resolutions in respect of Sri Lanka: the first one was in 1987, which

persuaded the parties, namely, the Sri Lankan Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, to negotiate. The second Resolution was proposed in May, 2009, days after the end of the war, congratulating Sri Lanka and welcoming the defeat of terrorism in the Island. The Resolution adopted a few weeks ago was the final and the first real attempt by the international community to put Sri Lanka on call. The international community finally decided and was ready to confront Sri Lanka, and Sri Lankas request for further time had been rejected. The said Resolution presented was co-sponsored by 40 countries of the UNHRC. The acting Minister of External Affairs made a Statement in Parliament on 23rd March, 2012, which states, I quote:

We will not, under any circumstances, allow others to impose on us their advice or solutions.

Analysing the range of opinion expressed internationally on the LLRC Report, it was evident that some consider that it had gone further than envisaged. As expected, others regret that it had not gone far enough. Pre-judging the efforts of a sovereign and independent member state of the international community, by way of such action will wittingly or unwittingly, subscribe to the efforts and agenda of the terrorist rump to derail the delicate peace and reconciliation efforts of the country.

Sir, the basic rule of International Law providing that states have no right to encroach upon the preserve of other states internal affairs, is a consequence of equality and sovereignty of states and is mirrored in Article II (7) of the United Nations Charter. It has, however, been subject to a process of reinterpretation in the Human Rights field, so that states may no longer plead this rule as a bar to international concern and consideration of internal Human Rights situation. It is, of course, obvious that where the states accept the right of individual petition under an international procedure, it cannot thereafter claim that the exercise of such a right constitutes interference of domestic affairs. This has been vividly brought out by Malcolm N. Shaw in the Fourth Edition of the book, International Law published by the University of Cambridge. It is prudent to state now when the UNHRC Resolution was presented in the year 2009, our Minister of External Affairs welcomed that. This Resolution states: "... welcomes the resolve of the Sri Lankan authorities to begin a broader dialogue with all parties in order to enhance the process of political settlement and to bring about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka, based on consensus among and respect for the rights of all ethnic and religious groups inhabiting it and invites all stakeholders concerned to actively participate in it." It further states, "....urges the international community to co-operate with the Government of Sri Lanka in the reconstruction efforts by increasing the provision of financial assistance including official development assistance to help the country fight poverty and underdevelopment and to continue to ensure the promotion and protection of all

1913 1914

human rights including economic, social and cultural rights".

Hon. Minister of External Affairs, I have the greatest respect for him, but unfortunately on some issues I may have to disagree with him on certain principles. He is a learned Gentleman, a Professor of Law but I feel that he has made two slips: the first is, to help in settling the internal problems of Maldives and Nepal. The said countries denied that they had wanted Sri Lankas help. This again is contrary to the view held by the acting Minister of External Affairs, the Hon. Dew Gunasekara. The second slip of the Sri Lankan Foreign Policy caused the withdrawal of the GSP Plus concession to Sri Lankan exports to Europe.

My point of view in this issue is that the Sri Lankan Government blew it out of proportion, the Resolution. The United States had invited the Sri Lankan authorities to join them to draft the Resolution. The United States, throughout, supported the Sri Lankan domestic mechanism. The Government had spent colossal amount of money and energy in knocking their heads against the rock, the US Government. The Resolution is simply calling upon the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the salient features and recommendations made by the LLRC Report. His Excellency the President issued a warrant on the 15th May, 2010, where he was of opinion, "that an opportune moment has arrived to reflect on the conflict phase and the sufferings the country has gone through as a whole and having regard to the common aspirations of all, we have collectively resolved that our people are assured an era of peace, harmony and prosperity." His Excellency the President was of the opinion that this warrant is issued in the interest of public welfare to inquire and report on the following:

(1) The facts and circumstances which led to the failure of the Ceasefire Agreement on the 21st of February, 2002 and the sequence of events that followed thereafter up to 19th of May, 2009;

(2) Whether any person, group or institution directly or indirectly bear responsibility in this regard;

(3) The lessons we would learn from those events and their attendant concern, in order to ensure that there will be no recurrence;

(4) The methodology whereby restitution to any person affected by those events or their dependants or their heirs, can be effected;

(5) The institutional administrative and legislative measures which need to be taken in order to prevent any recurrence of such concerns in the future, and to promote further national unity and reconciliation among all communities, and to make any such other recommendations with reference to any of the matters that have been inquired into under the terms of the Warrant.

The LLRC Report recommendation touched upon and made recommendations to prevent harassment and attacks on media personnel and institutions and to implement the Report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, appointed to investigate and inquire into the violation of Human Rights in 2005. The interim report of the Commission had also dealt with the detention of the hard-core of the LTTE suspects and recommends to forward a comprehensive database containing a list of detainees. It also recommends the establishment of an independent Public Service Commission, Police Commission, and a Judicial Service Commission. It also recommends that a political settlement should be reached in respect of devolution of power regarding the provinces.

Sir, in the background of what I have stated and the statements issued by the Government Ministers independently without a cohesive policy statement, the so-called policy statement is that no foreign country should intermeddle with Sri Lankan affairs. If that is the position of the Sri Lankan Government, it should immediately resign from the United Nations membership. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have one minute more. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Okay. Sir, it is not a feasible proposition because the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe stated at the UNHRC Session on the 30th of May, 2011:

Sri Lanka takes seriously its rights, obligations and duties and accords great importance to its engagements with the United Nations system and especially with the august body. It is in this spirit of constructive engagement that we have periodically kept the Member States, Observers and High Commissioners of Human Rights briefed throughout on the conflict and post-conflict developments.

That was the view of the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe. Sir, it is for the Governments consideration that a proper international relationship should be formulated to safeguard the rights and interests of Sri Lankan citizens. When His Excellency the President had himself appointed this Commission, it is the obligation of the Government and the citizens of this country to accept the principles that have been laid down by this Commission or at least study the Report of the Commission and inform them accordingly. If it had been done in a proper manner, this situation faced by us would not have occurred. Today we have to answer the United Nations and by the 21st Session, the UNHRC, on its own volition, can inform the United Nations what steps this country has taken to implement the LLRC Report.

Therefore, Sir, this is a very serious issue. The Hon. Minister of External Affairs is a brilliant gentleman, but I

1915 1916

think he should look into this more favourably and in a very independent manner. Although there may be pressure by so many forces, we have to look into the welfare of the citizens this country.

Thank you.
