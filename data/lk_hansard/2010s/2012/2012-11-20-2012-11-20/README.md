() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, I must also tell you in general terms - then, anybody can work it out - how we compute the transaction cost.

I am also, for the purpose of record in Hansard, giving the transaction cost breakdown. Up to Rs. 50 million, the total transaction cost is 1.12 per cent, which is made up of brokerage fees of 0.64 per cent.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Minister, those are well known statistics. You can table that.

209 210

)

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) But, I want to put it into record. Then, anybody can make his own computation.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Yes. So, you can table that. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Shall I table it then?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Yes, you can because we do not need to waste time here.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Okay. Sir, I table* that. I want to make it as comprehensive as possible so that it will be on record.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Minister, I have several questions arising from your Answer. The Answer you gave has nothing to do with the Question I asked.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) What is the Question?

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) The Question I asked was "separately, of all the purchases and sales". The spirit of this Question, Hon. Minister, you would recognize very well, is to actually pinpoint certain transactions. For instance, this entire calamity over the National Savings Bank purchasing shares of The Finance Company was one transaction. So, there have been many such transactions that we need to go into in the EPF's portfolio out of these 3,937 purchases.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) So, here, I am giving all the details.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) We need to know what these purchases and sales were - that is the Question - because, Hon. Minister, you know very well that the Annual Report of the EPF for the year 2011 has still not been presented to this House. - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister, let me finish this. Today is the 20th of November, 2012 and this involves one trillion rupees of workers' savings. They have not appeared before the COPA for six long years.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You need not make a long speech. I will tell you exactly. The Report is with the Ministry of Finance and Planning. But, today, I took the liberty of tabling it even before it is published. So, you take a look at that and if there is any other detailed question, I am willing to answer that also.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Minister, I have asked for information about 3,937 purchases and 1,453 sales. You are giving me one summary document. That is not what I have asked for. If this is not the place to ask that, where do I ask that? Hon. Minister, I am asking this Question on behalf of all the people who have saved their money in the EPF.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You are making a statement without looking at the lists that I have tabled. Listen to this. My Answer states, "As per Section 5(1)(h) of Employees Provident Fund Act, No.15 of 1958, the Monetary Board has published the statement of investment showing purchase price and market value of equity market transactions for 2010..." So, each and every one is there.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Minister, I wanted disaggregated statistics. You are giving me aggregated statistics. Let us take the Laugfs Gas PLC. You are telling me that over the period of 2010 or 2011 or both years put together -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, not together, separately; I have given two tables.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) You are giving me the weighted average price. Let me explain to you what I have been asking for. This Question has been -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Mr. Speaker, may I suggest this? We have absolutely nothing to hide. In good faith, I have given all the information which, I must say in fairness to the Hon. Member, he has not had the time to peruse. So, Hon. Member, kindly go through this and if there are any further questions, I will be more than happy to answer.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Hon. Minister, you just told me -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, you are talking before going through the documents that I am going to table. Study them and talk thereafter.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) So, that is exactly why I am answering today. Hon. Member, since I came here, my policy is to answer all the questions that have been directed to the Ministry of Finance and Planning and we have been consistently following that. So, first have a look at it.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, since the Hon. Minister has offered to answer any further questions, I would suggest that the Hon. Member puts forward the questions to the Hon. Minister and, as the Chief Government Whip has suggested, we can dispose of all these on the last day when the Votes of the Ministry of Finance and Planning is taken up, which will also give us time to debate the details of it.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is a good idea.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) If you can submit the Annual Report of the EPF for 2011 also by that time, - if you are willing to do that - then, we will discuss all that at the Committee Stage.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You must have a look at this.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I will do that. I have no problems with that. If you can table the Annual Report of the EPF, we can put forward all those to you at the Committee Stage when all the officials of the Ministry will be there.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is a good suggestion, Sir.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I did not extend the time as accused by the Leader of the Opposition. Time was allotted to the DNA and the DNA Leader in the House wrote to me, - I have the note - to give him five more minutes. So, that is wrong information. He cannot accuse me.

The other matter is, he wanted to raise a point of Order and I allowed that. After that, he was attacking the Member concerned, which is against the Standing Orders. So, I called him to order.

[5.18 p. m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman, for giving me an opportunity to speak today. I wish to take up an issue that was raised this morning. This morning the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara asked Question No. 4 about Supervisory Members of Parliament in Sri Lanka and the facilities provided to them. The Hon. Chief Government Whip

373 374

)

answered to that merely saying " , " and explained that there is no such position as "Supervisory Member of Parliament". But, today I was here in this House listening to the Hon. Mohan Lal Grero who thanked His Excellency the President for appointing him as a Supervisory Member of Parliament for the Ministry of Education. I do not know whether the Minister - [Interruption.] No, you cannot mislead this House. This morning when the Minister gave an answer -

( ) (An Hon. Member) Is it relevant to the Budget Discussion? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is definitely relevant. There is somebody who is sitting here and saying that he is a Supervisory Member of Parliament for the Ministry of Education and he talks with so much of authority whereas the Minister of Water Supply and Drainage who is the Chief Government Whip says that there is no such position as "Supervisory Member of Parliament". Who is misleading the House? Is it the Minister of Water Supply and Drainage and Chief Government Whip or is it the person who calls himself a "Supervisory Member of Parliament"? This question has to be answered by either of them.

( ) (The Hon. Mohan Lal Grero) , ? [

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I am not giving way. You find some other time to reply. - [Interruption.] No, he cannot. Hon. Azwer, it is not fair.

-"Monitoring Member of Parliament - ) , . [ )

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) What is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) There is a procedure by which an Hon. Member could correct any answer given in Parliament. Sir, under the general debate if he wants to take up this issue, you will have to give me time to answer him. But, there is no time because the Hon. Minister has to - [Interruption/] Please listen to me. I have stood on a point of Order. Listen! You are a senior Member who understands these procedures. This is a very important Discussion which is on the Votes of the Ministry of Education. You should have raised it tomorrow morning. If there was a grave violation of Standing Orders. - [Interruption.] Do not come with irresponsible statements. I did reply. I did quote from a reply that I had given last year. If the Hon. Member does not know that, you had better re-read the Hansard and come tomorrow morning.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Yogarajan you may continue. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, if there was no such position as "Monitoring Member of Parliament" - [Interruption.] Now, he claims to be a Monitoring Member of Parliament for the Ministry of Education. This is totally misleading the House. Further, this morning there was a sitting of the Court of Appeal.

( ) (The Hon. Mohan Lal Grero) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Mohan Lal Grero. What is the point of Order?

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) If there is anything against the Standing Orders, it will be expunged. Hon. Yogarajan, you carry on.

( ) (The Hon. Mohan Lal Grero) ) -

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Senasinghe, what is the point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, the Hon. Member can make whatever recommendation he wants in his speech. After that, they can reply. All he is saying is, -

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Yogarajan, you carry on. - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Even if they do not reply that, let it go on record. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Let him speak. - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I will use my time. Do not worry.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Yogarajan, you carry on and get back to the subject, please. - [Interruption.] , . - [Interruption.] No, he has 10 minutes; he has time.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) This morning, there was a case filed in the Court of Appeal.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) He is talking nonsense! Let him sit down. - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) A Judge of the Court of Appeal said that he would not sit on the Bench because it was unethical as he was a batchmate of the President. He said that it is unethical.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Very good. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Similarly, how can it be ethical for the -

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Member, you are talking of something irrelevant to education, which is being discussed now.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I am coming to that. You allow me to speak. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You had better sit down and give the Minister the opportunity to make his speech.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You allow me to speak. Why are you jumping?

377 378

)

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Talk about education. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Let me talk. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) There are hundreds and thousands of plantation children. You are not talking a word about them.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, please sit down. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Please do not disturb. I can talk about what I want. This is about education. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, Hon. Azwer, please sit down. He is going to wind up now.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Unethical practices are taking place. - [Interruption.] . .

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Yogarajan, please wind up now. - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Why do you want to restrict me to the plantations? I can speak about anything I want. Education is a common subject. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) The Hon. Member has the knowledge and the background to speak on any subject.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes, on any subject. Why should I talk only about the plantations? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Yogarajan, you have only one more minute. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) As usual, ) , . .

What I am saying is, it is unethical to sit on the Bench, the Judge thought. Similarly, the Hon. Mohan Lal Grero should have thought that it is unethical for him to be a Monitoring Member in the Ministry of Education while he is running a private school. The Government schools and the free education system in this country are being destroyed; schools are closing down. How can you expect a man who depends on the breaking down of the free education system to function in the Ministry of Education? His life, his profits depend on the failure of the free education system and a person like that sits as a Monitoring Member in the Ministry of Education. How unethical it is! He must think. If he is an ethical person, he should resign tomorrow from the post of Monitoring Member of the Ministry of Education.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Yogarajan, your time is over.

CASE JUDGMENTS AND ARBITRATION AWARDS AGAINST

GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I move the following Adjournment Motion:

Will the Prime Minister advise:

The Government resisted a Public Interest Litigation on the basis saying the Government has a very good case and Local Courts do not need to interfere in this process.

393 394

)

However, since then many litigations have taken place and one such liability was Deutsche Bank, used the arbitration process against the Government of Sri Lanka. Please table the award made against the Government of Sri Lanka by the arbitration process between Deutsche Bank and the Government of Sri Lanka where US Dollars 77 million have to be paid by the Government of Sri Lanka.

Likewise, please table the CITI Bank and Standard Chartered Bank judgements. Also, advise any other cases, arbitration OR direct debts that have been awarded against the Government of Sri Lanka, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation OR Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

Therefore, please provide information for the following:

1. Table Deutsche Bank arbitration award,

2. What is the total impact and how is it going to be paid?

3. What are the other cases pending?

4. Who is held responsible for this which has placed the country in a huge debacle?

Hon. Deputy Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on this Adjournment Motion. I think it is timely and important and I am sure that the Minister of Petroleum Industries, who has got to carry this burden, will give a satisfactory answer as to how the impact be looked at in overcoming the problem in the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, as you know, there was a huge price escalation and the prices of oil were varying in great degree in 2005 and 2006. As a result, the then Government decided that there was a necessity to ensure that they protect themselves through hedging or advance booking in order to minimize the shock and the price increases that were going to take place. As a result, in 2006, information revealed that the Governor of the Central Bank deemed fit to ensure that there is a hedging process that is introduced to the country.

At the outset, I must say that these are mechanisms used worldwide, but it has to be used very cautiously because it is a double-edged sword. If it is used properly with professional knowledge, it can certainly be used for the benefit of price escalations and reductions. On the reverse course, if it is badly handled or unprofessionally handled, the impact that is being spoken of today is what you are going to face. So, what was told then was that you go in for zero cost collar hedging. I think the Hon. Minister knows more than me on this hedging area because he has been a banker. So, I leave him that part to be looked at. But, as the Minister responsible, he cannot basically exonerate himself as to how he is going to extricate the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation or the Central Government or any other entity that may deem fit, to ensure that they overcome this liability.

So, in 2006, while the hedging was the desired fashion, the Governor of Central Bank submitted it to the Cabinet, showing that that was the best way forward, and

gets its tacit approval. Later it gets the formal approval and then it is forwarded to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. Hon. Deputy Speaker, I will table* Annex 1, with your permission and I want this to go into Hansard, where Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Governor of Central Bank writes to Mr. Ashantha De Mel in early January, on the15th or 16th if I am not wrong, stating, Please ensure that you expedite this hedging process. Mr. Ashantha De Mel writes back on the 16th of January stating, I acknowledge your letter. I will do the best. On the 18th, in his eagerness in trying to do this, he sends a confirmation saying, Thank you for expediting this as it will help to reduce the oil impact that is being paid at the moment against the country.

This was the background to it. Hon. Deputy Speaker, we basically saw certain benefits that were there at that moment. Rs. 100 million was awarded through the hedging process. We saw the then Minister - not you because you are carrying somebody elses baby - coming and showing cheques of Standard Chartered Bank, and saying We got Rs. 100 million coming as the hedging award for the price escalations and the price reductions. So, they thought that that was a step in the right direction not knowing, before too long, the oil prices would take a reverse course of action: instead of going up, it came drastically down. Then, you got caught up owing to the zero collar. That was deemed best fit because there was a less exposure from an entity point of view and they went and basically got themselves into the zero collar hedging contract. With that, the prices came down and there was a huge turmoil. Seeing this, myself and the Venerable Theeniyawala Palitha Thero from Nalandarama decided that the public interest litigation was the best course forward to ensure that the country is able to stymie or basically cancel the agreements that the Central Bank, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation or the Government of Sri Lanka had entered into. Now, at this moment, I am sure the enthusiasm to go into hedging did not look at the ramifications that could follow if, by chance, it works to the reverse benefit of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. That is what we are speaking about at this particular moment.

Went we went to Supreme Court in September, 2008, we got a very favourable response because it was obviously something which was very unprofessionally handled, ill-timed and most importantly, it had been taken from a more rupees-cents point of view in terms of billions that could have impacted on the country. So, as a result what happened was, the Supreme Court decided in 2008 that there was a case forward and, Sir, they permitted us to go forward. There was two-pronged attack. One was,-

If we went forward and ensured that public litigations took place and prevented the banks in Sri Lanka from engaging themselves with foreign banks on the hedging deal, today, I am sure my Colleague would not have a problem on his head. Unfortunately, owing to the arrogance of the Government that they know better than anybody else and decided to set aside the judgement of the Supreme Court, what happened today is that you are faced with billions of rupees as claims against the country. It can be the Petroleum Corporation, it can be the Central Bank or it can be the Government of Sri Lanka, which we do not know because you all are the ones who negotiated, but the burden comes on to the taxpayers of this country. That is the sad reality. So, what happened was that, with the termination of the Supreme Court decision to give injunctions to all these banks, the banks were free to go ahead and do all their work. On that basis, they collected monies and when the Central Bank, the Petroleum Corporation or the Government of Sri Lanka decided not to pay, it obviously went into a collusion recourse. Then, they had to go to litigation; whether it was international arbitration, whether it was a negotiated settlement or whether it was a Commercial Courts action was left to each bank to pursue. The Deutsche Bank decided to go ahead with arbitration. Today, you find that there is an arbitration award made against - to my knowledge - the Government of Sri Lanka. I may be subject to correction because we do not know with whom the agreement was signed. It is US Dollars 77 million. I am informed that it is US Dollars 67 million by way of direct impact on hedging, US Dollars 7 to 8 million on interest and the balance being the legal costs related to the arbitration. Anyway, the net impact is US Dollars 77 million for which either the Government, the Petroleum Corporation or the Central Bank has to make good; whether it is in appeal or whether you can go beyond that is not my knowledge but I would like to be educated on this. At this particular moment, I want you to table the arbitration award that was made against the Government of Sri Lanka. That is very clear.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) But, I have to object for tabling the arbitral award in this House because it is confidential.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I am asking him to table it. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, are you not tabling it? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Well, I have a right, I can do that. If he says that he does not have it, I will table it. How can you not table it when I am asking for it specifically in this House?

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) I will explain that. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, I do not need an explanation. I want the arbitral award that was made against the Government and I have a right to ask for it because I am a taxpayer and a Member of Parliament.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) No, wait. It can be tabled at the appropriate time, not now.

397 398

)

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Why is this not the appropriate time? .. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) That is because we can file petitions on the same institution until the 28th of February.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, this is a public document. .. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) My good Friend, I am advised by the Attorney-Generals Department that the arbitral award is confidential unless both parties agree to its publication. So, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes has sought the views of the parties on the publication of the award.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) How do I have a copy? .. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) This is, of course, how I have been advised and neither party so far has responded to this request. So, this cannot be tabled by me or you.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, you are an eminent lawyer. Hon. Minister, you are also a lawyer.

All I say is, if the award has been made against the taxpayers and the country, Sri Lanka, you do not need to hide this. Is it because the award has been made against the Cabinet of Sri Lanka? Is it because it has been made against the Executive of this country?

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) That is the legal practice, of course. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, if that is the case, then it has been made against the Government of Sri Lanka.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, if there is a case pending in some court, we never take it up in this House as it is sub judice.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I object to that because when you defended yourself on the hedging deal, you said, This was done by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. We, the Cabinet of Ministers, did not know about it. That is what the Standard Chartered Bank did; it went against the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) I will explain that. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) And, your defence was that the Cabinet of Ministers had not given the authority to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation to do that. Now, you are saying that the arbitration is made against the Government. So, if you want to withhold classified information from the general public, I think it is a sorry state of affairs.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) I will speak about it here and table any document, if I am permitted to do so.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But, why can you not table that arbitration award? .. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) I will explain that. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, you are left with only three minutes. The other Hon. Member has to second the Motion.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I will take only one more minute and then the Motion will be seconded by the Hon. R. Yogarajan.

So, Hon. Minister, I would greatly appreciate, if you, with the true spirit of upholding the Parliamentary Privileges and in keeping with past precedents, would table the arbitration award that has been made against the Government and the Cabinet of Ministers of Sri Lanka because it is very important. If you had allowed me at that time to go for public litigation, you would not be defending youselves here, but would be supporting me saying, Thank you for saving billions of rupees. Now, the country is saddled with an almost US Dollars 65 billion charge. You are negotiating with the Standard Chartered Bank over US Dollars 177 million. On the other side, you have the Department of Exchange Control imposing US Dollars 324 million fine on them. So, you have to negotiate. You have already entered yourselves into a negotiation process. With regard to the Deutsche Bank, we do not know what the outcome would be. Of course, we got US Dollars 1.5 million from the Citibank as legal fees in litigation. The fourth bank, the Commercial Bank, and the Peoples Bank basically wrote off Rs. 4 billion. That is not brought in. There was also a fifth bank involved in the hedging deal and I am not able to remember, at this particular moment, what it was but I think it was the HSBC. The countrys liability is increasing by the day.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have got one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) There is one and a half minutes more. I will take another half a minute and hand it over to the Hon. Yogarajan.

On 1st of January, 2005, the total liability of this country was US Dollars 1,784 billion. Today, it is about US Dollars 6,894 billion. To add to this, you have 65 billion more in dollars terms. With the dollar devaluing by the day, you do not know at which level it would stop. Hon. Minister, thinking about the country and as an Opposition which is responsible, I am not going to table the award. It is not because you just say so. But, if you do not give a satisfactory answer, I will certainly table it at the Committee Stage. So, I am pre-warning you that I have the information, but I am refraining myself from tabling it because you made an appeal. I hope that your answer would be satisfactory.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The Opposition will be left with only one minute. Then, the Hon. R. Yogarajan.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I second this Motion as it is a very important Motion. I also wish to state, as the Hon. Karunanayake mentioned, that you defied the Supreme Court and you could have been taken up for contempt of court. But, today, again you are clashing with courts. This is going to be the beginning of the end for you, I wish to warn you on that.

Thank you. .. ( ) ( .. - ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha - Minister of Petroleum Industries) , . 2008 . , , , . 2008 . 147.50 , 50 . ) ) . ) . , SC (FR) 535/2008 SC (FR) 536/2008. ) . , ... . ) -2009 27 - , proceedings .

The Deutsche Bank instituted proceedings against the Republic of Sri Lanka before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, claiming a sum of US Dollars 60 million plus interest and legal charges. So, the Deutsche Bank alleged, inter alia, that the claim it had against the CPC, on a derivative agreement entered into between CPC and Deutsche Bank, had been interfered with by the State due to the actions taken by the Supreme Court and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The two members of the arbitral tribunal awarded Deutsche Bank a sum of US Dollars 60 million plus interest and costs. The third member of the tribunal dismissed Deutsche Bank's claim. The annulment of the Majority Award is under consideration by the State. So, it can be filed before the 28th of February, 2013; we have time till February, 2013. Therefore, we are considering that action to be taken before the expiry date.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, what do you mean by "considering"? You have to take action.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) Yes, we have to. Now, we are preparing the papers and all that. Hon. Member, there, we have a strong case, we - that is, the AG's Department - believe, because out of three members, one gave his decision against the view taken by the other two.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Descending that, is it? .. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) Yes, descending that. So, there, we have a good chance of going for annulment.

The Arbitral Award is confidential unless both parties agree to its publication. The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes has sought the views of the parties on the publication of the award. Neither party has so far responded to this request. That is why I say that at this stage I am not in a position to table the award. That is because still we have not been sent that. So, what I can say is, as I have already said in this House, this is what had happened. Of course, it will be on record.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What is the directive?

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) Still, I have not been provided with all these details. But, I have been given a brief note about the award.
