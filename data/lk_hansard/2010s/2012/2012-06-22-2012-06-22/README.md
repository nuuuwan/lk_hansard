. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Now, Hon. Minister, you have given the two lists I have asked for under (a) and (b).

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yes.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I want to know how many marks each person got? Have you given that in your list? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I answered that. At the interview, 40 marks was given for seniority. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) That is the total.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yes.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Have you listed the marks each candidate got in your list?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, I am unable to divulge that because this is a confidential document. So, I stated; I replied you.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) So, you are not going to reveal those, are you?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, it cannot be tabled because it is a confidential document. If you want, you may come to the Consultative Committee and request His Excellency the President to answer your question. But, normally we do not divulge the marks except in confidentiality.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) In that case, I cannot decide anything on the basis of what you have given; you have just given a list of names.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Sir, this is in relation to the promotions of DIGs and Senior DIGs. If the Hon. Memeber thinks -

1181 1182

[ ]

2012 22

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) In relation to DIG promotions from the rank of SSP upwards.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) If the Hon. Member thinks that it can be divulged, I can only say, sorry.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) This Question has been asked from the Minister.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) This is confidential information in relation to security.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The applicants informed that they were asked only the name and the village from which they came. So, how did they grant marks at the interview? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I answered saying that 40 marks was given for seniority and 60 marks for merit.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) So, what is the criterion for that? There should be a criterion. You have sat on interview boards as well as I. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The criterion is before the interview board. When an applicant - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, the criterion has to be spelt out. Is it available or are you not giving us that also?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) What?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I am asking about the criterion for deciding the 60 marks and 40 marks.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You ask the Question afresh again. Then, I will answer it.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I have asked that.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Not now. It is not listed as a Question today.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I have already asked that.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, it is not listed as a Question. The Question you have asked is very clear. You have asked how 70 marks and 30 marks were granted. But, now you are asking about the criterion. Sir, 40 marks for seniority and 60 marks for merit have been granted respectively at the interview board. If they want to challenge it, there are other legal procedures that they could follow without just making a complaint about an officer. If you could divulge the name of the officer who told you that he had been deprived of his promotion, we will very well try to go into that matter. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, he may be fixed then. That is the reason why we are not willing to disclose the name. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No one will be fixed. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, I will get on to the third Supplementary Question. No Tamil-speaking officers have held the rank of the SSP. Therefore, these officers feel discriminated and are losing the morale due to unequal treatment. What is the action you are going to take to overcome this situation? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The Answers to (a)(i) and (a)(ii) which I just tables includes the name of Tamil officers.

1183 1184

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, the Answer (a)(i) and (a)(ii) include the names of the people who attended the interview, not those who were selected. Nobody has been selected out of that. No Tamil or Muslim officer has been selected. This is the whole problem. That is why we are coming before this House and asking you these Questions. The Tamil and Muslim officers feel discriminated in this country. They feel that they are not treated equally.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No. The Answer (a)(ii) includes the names of the officers who have been promoted and Answer (a)(i) includes those who have applied. Please read through and correct yourself.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You are not giving that for me to go through. So, how can I ask a fresh Question?

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Do you want me to read it out now? At the outset, I asked you whether you wanted me to read the whole list. Then, on the request of the Chair, I tabled it since it is a long list. Now, you are saying that I am not giving it to you. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No. The Chair permitted you to - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) This file will be available to you in a moment, after the Questions are over.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) But, then I cannot ask Supplementary Questions.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You can come before the Consultative Committee. We are meeting next week. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I am not satisfied, Sir. Anyway, what is to be done?

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I want to bring to your notice that all proceedings in Parliament must be reported in the newspapers as true and accurate reports. For this, many of the newspapers have provided a separate page, a lobby in which proceedings of the day are recorded. If we find something wrong, we raise it up here and it is corrected. All the Sinhala and Tamil newspapers provide such pages for the proceedings of the House. So, does the "Daily News". But, unfortunately many of the other English newspapers do not have full proceedings of the House. I found yesterday, the day before and even earlier, that speeches made in this House are not regularly reported. They select one or two speeches and publish it. That goes against the principle of true and accurate reporting and it is unfair by backbenchers on both sides of the House, whose speeches do not appear in these newspapers. If you read any of the Sinhala or Tamil newspapers, their speeches are included. I must say that it appears in the "Daily News", though of course, what we say here is twisted. But, it does not appear in the other English newspapers. There is no reason why they cannot publish it because after all, there is no stand-alone English newspaper. They are all connected to a sister Sinhala newspaper. So, it is possible to publish this and devote a page separately for proceedings.

Now, I find that in the "Daily Mirror" for instance, if a Member of Parliament has spoken, whether it is from the Government side or from the Opposition side, a caricature is put. I do not know why they do that. They should put a photograph. And, I must say in fairness to the Members that at least our photographs look rather respectable unlike some of the staff photographs that are put, which will be mistaken for caricatures.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would ask you to go into this and lay down guidelines. If they want to report, all proceedings in this Parliament must be reported otherwise it is unfair by many of the backbench Members of Parliament on both sides who do not get reported. What I say will get reported but that is not fair. It is also not fair by the English-reading public who read these newspapers who would not have an idea of what the proceedings are. Therefore, I would ask you to speak to the Hon. Speaker because these newspapers can afford to set aside a page to report each days proceedings in Parliament. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Thank you, Hon. Leader of the Opposition. I will take it up with the Hon. Speaker and make necessary arrangements.

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) , , . . . ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) At 6.30 p.m. we have to start the Debate on the Adjournment Motion.

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) . . . ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Do you agree to that, Hon. Chief Government Whip? ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) If they are ready to concede on the principle on which they are canvassing now, I would rather propose, with the consent of the House, that we do away with the Adjournment Motion and allow the rest of the speakers to speak because there is a decision taken by the Committee on Parliamentary Business - Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, you are also a Member of that Committee - which I cannot reverse. But, in order to accommodate more time, we can do away with the Adjournment Motion. If any of the Hon. Members who wish to participate in this Debate have not come today, I do not see why they should have another day, which matter should have been canvassed by their Leader or the Chief Opposition Whip. They never canvassed such a thing. The House must also take certain steps within its purview. So, why do you not withdraw your Adjournment Motion and take that hour too? If you are canvassing for that, we are ready. The Hon. Minister is here. That is the best thing to do rather than trying to make a joke out of it. Do not play games; you are just trying to play games.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, the Opposition Members did not ask for more time. Had they asked for more time, we would have adjusted it to reduce the time of the Government side speakers. At the end of the Vote of Condolence, you are asking permission to continue it on another day. That is not reasonable.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Without wasting anymore time, let us continue. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Let us continue with it. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala, you continue with your speech. I can give you only five minutes.

[6.21 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Sir, I begin with the words or Deshana of Lord Buddha:

Na hi verena verani - sammantidha kudacanam Averena ca sammanti - esa dhammo sanantano

In this world, hatred never ceases by hatred; it ceases by love alone. This is an eternal law. Five thousand years ago, the great Sage called "Thiruvalluvar" in a similar fashion wrote: " ?" " ?" , .

Sir, it was a tragic end for the Hon. Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra, who was our dear Colleague in this House. The two involved in the incident: one was a former Member of the House and the other is a sitting Member, the Hon. R. Dumindha Silva. If they, according to the teachings of the Lord Buddha were able to avoid hatred, both would have been amongst the living today.

I do not want to cast aspersions on the court. Several Hon. Members are asking for justice to be meted out. That is what is happening in the court and I believe, it will happen. That is why the court is there for. We have full confidence in the judiciary that the correct judgment will be given, no doubt.

I should mention that the Hon. Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra was a close friend of the Muslims, in particular, in the Kolonnawa Electorate. He had established a close rapport with his Muslim brethren, so much so, he visited Mosques during the month of Ramazan, which is approaching next month, on 19th July. If he had been alive, we would have met him again. He went to the Mosques and broke fast with the Muslims there.

Not only that, at one time when there were certain problems faced by the Muslims of Kolonnawa and Wellampitiya regarding the recital of Azaan - - in the mosques, the Hon. Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra very bravely went in there and said, I am there to look after your interests. Please go ahead with your performances. You are also my people who are in my Constituency.

1267 1268

The people of Kolonnawa, Wellampitiya, Gothatuwa, Meetotamulla and all other areas remember him with gratitude and they will remember him forever. I am aware that he was fighting with the Ministry of Cultural and Religious Affairs at that time to get more funds for the running of Ahadiya schools in his area and also in the Colombo District, in general. As the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne said, he knew no communal differences.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please wind up now. There is one more speaker. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Yes, I will wind up. He was a man of vitality, valour and value. Sir, I will for the moment, quote the Motion that he moved on 9th January, 1995 to reintroduce the death sentence, which I seconded. I would only remind the House of what the Hon. Sarath Kongahage, our distinguished Colleague, who is now our Ambassador in Germany said on the Motion. I quote:

Yes, Sir. Thank you very much for affording me this opportunity. What I was trying to say is that this is a very timely thing that Hon. Lakshman Premachandra has introduced in this House and I do hope that both sides of this House

will accept the position that there was a time when the punishment for offenders was taken away from the law enforcement authorities.

He served this House as a very distinguished and law abiding Member for 09 years, 02 months and 30 days. May the Almighty grant him mercy!

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Athauda Seneviratne, you have four minutes.

I shall direct the Secretary-General of Parliament to send a copy of the Official Report, Hansard, to the members of the bereaved family.
