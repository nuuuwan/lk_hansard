() . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Now that you told me the name of the person, I have some Supplementary Questions to ask. Hon. Minister, thank you very much for sharing your knowledge and answering the Question. You stated that there are no companies that have gone bankrupt. But, that is rather strange because companies such as The Finance Company (Pvt.) Limited and others went bankrupt. It is not that they went bankrupt but they were made to go bankrupt. As a result, you have expropriated the assets in those companies such as the Fingara, the tower near the Temple Trees et cetera. But, none of the depositors - all those who have deposited monies in those companies - has got a single cent yet. So, what happened to those assets? How has the money been utilized? Already, even the ownerships of those companies have gone to some other people. The Chairman of the Export Development Board took 50 per cent of shares of a Ceylinco company. He was faulted by the Supreme Court for that. Where have the monies gone from these companies? To whom has it been paid? And, you are saying that not a single company has gone bankrupt.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) What is stated here is the position with regard to those companies registered with the Central Bank.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Finance Company (Pvt.) Limited is a registered company. Are you telling me that it is not?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) We are clearly told by the Answer that no financial institution registered with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has gone bankrupt from 2005 up to the present.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Then, my second Supplementary Question is this. Hon. Minister, you know that Mr. Nivard Cabraal came before the Committee on Public Enterprises on the 18th of December, 2006 and assured us that not a single finance company would go bankrupt owing to the fact that we, as the COPE, asked certain questions, fortifying the depositors' confidence. But, even after one year, the Governor of the Central Bank did not comply with what he told us. Whether those companies, as you say, are registered or not - I do not understand how they have been taken out of this registration process - what is the action being taken on the supervisory section of the Central Bank? As you had been Minister of Finance, you know about it.

The other question that could be added on to this is, as the Central Bank does foreign exchange management et cetera, on instructions of the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, have the US Dollar and the Indian Rupee been taken out of circulation now?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Let me answer that. Hon. Member, you know this very well. You are asking about the liability. There are two matters. It is very clear that the Government cannot take up the liability of any company that is in distress. We try to help. The financial authority which is mandated by its charter, the Central Bank, will try to resurrect the situation. Not only here, you know that it is the same with the Federal Reserve also. You know what happened in America in recent times. They had to intervene to try to sort that situation. But, that does not mean that they take the full liability. No authority in Sri Lanka can function if they take the liability for every single financial institution. The other day, you raised a question here about the Grameen Bank, the rural level bank, asking why it is not called a bank and so on. So, there is a question of liability. There are certain institutions for which the Central Bank can accept liability. Then, there are other institutions also. As you very well know, many of our depositors do not read the fine print when they deposit money. Sometimes, there are other needs because there maybe other structural factors. They may prefer to get more money with a higher interest through those deposits and so on. But, the crux of the matter is that the Central Bank cannot accept liability for any of those institutions. We can punish and do all those things to the people who have maladministered those organizations.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Including those public officials who are running amok. Is that not so?

I will ask my third Supplementary Question. I understand, Hon. Minister, that you have a bad brief to defend, but you did it to the best of your ability.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, no. You always say that. That is not so at all. I am explaining a situation which is very well known to anybody.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I understand. You did it to the best of your ability.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) And you are choosing to cover that. You are expecting the Government to take the liability of all those institutions, which is never done.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, a government is there to shield people from that type of things.

My third Supplementary Question is this. The Central Bank gets money as loans at half per cent interest from Norwegian banks, Euro banks et cetera targeting certain portfolios saying they would like to help poverty alleviation, agriculture and so on. All this money comes to the Central Bank and normally it is channelled, you know, through the commercial banks of this country. This Central Bank and this Governor have decided to stop this pyramid investigation. He uses those monies to give to the non-commercial banks such as -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Those are your opinions, which are not based on this Question.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am posing that question on behalf of the monitoring institution in this country because the banks told me - () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I can answer the non-personal side of your question. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The question is: the companies that are involved in the PFI, the commercial banks, do not get this half per cent loan. They give it to companies such as Taprobane Investments and LOLC because of the connections between the Governor and the people like Ajith Devasurendras'. As a result, these commercial banks are giving loans at 10 - 11 per cent to innocent people instead of half per cent interest. Please ensure that this type of misuse is rectified.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You may not be aware but I would like to clarify the situation. Until recently, all governments, including your government negotiated with the lending agencies and accepted those loans and then for specific purposes like housing and maybe for various other purposes, they were diverted or made operational through various banks. In the process, it maybe a good thing or a bad thing, as an

administrative cost they also added on as you know. But, now, we have taken a step by asking those banks to directly negotiate with the lending agencies. Earlier, there were problems of foreign exchange controls - [Interruption.] No, now, they are allowed. That was in the past. -[Interruption.] Take my word. They can negotiate with foreign lending agencies.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) This is the -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Let me finally explain this. In the past, it was the Government that took the responsibility and the lending also was done on the understanding that these were issues made to the Government. That is why the German Banks like the KfW, the Japanese Banks and so on released money to us. I am telling you the position. Then, the Government, because it was not in a position to directly lend to farmers, householders, school students and so on, mediated through the banking system. Now, we have done something more. We have now asked the banks, if necessary, to expand their capital by direct borrowing. So, this is the situation. In the past, Hon. Member, all the Finance Ministers negotiated these issues and lent the money.

: : RESOLUTION ON SRI LANKA BY HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL IN GENEVA : STATEMENT BY ACTING MINISTER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. DEW Gunasekara - Minister of Human Resources and Acting Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Speaker, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to make a Statement on behalf of the Government relating to the Resolution on Sri Lanka that was adopted at the 19th Session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva.

Mr. Speaker, the priorities and principal aims set forth by the Government of His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa for the country and her people, for the new era that has dawned since the end of the thirty-year long brutal terrorist conflict have been very clearly and sincerely expressed to this august House, in particular, in December last year, when we presented the outcome of the domestic mechanism for reconciliation - the LLRC Report. It is with deep satisfaction that we witness today, within a short span of less than three years, that our considered efforts to bring the peace dividends to the grass-roots and in re-establishing the livelihood and normalcy in the conflict-affected areas have begun to bear fruit. It is this sense of practical reality that motivates us to do what is right for the country and our people amidst outside interferences, unfair and undue pressures exerted by some countries.

Mr. Speaker, as a responsible partner and a founding member of the Human Rights Council that has contributed to the institutional building mechanism of the Council during its formative years, Sri Lanka, while making clear and definite steps towards peace, development and reconciliation, made conceivable efforts to engage with the rest of the world, especially through the Human Rights Council, to brief and apprise those who have expressed concerns on the Sri Lankan situation. We have extended an invitation to the High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit Sri Lanka and to see the developments for herself.

However, Mr. Speaker, the decision of the Council taken yesterday on Sri Lanka provides the credence to the fact that even genuine efforts by the Government are not

recognized. The same countries that approved action, urging Sri Lanka to implement the LLRC recommendations were among those that relentlessly criticized the LLRC when the Government commissioned it. Analyzing the range of opinions expressed internationally on the LLRC Report, it was evident that some consider that it has gone further than envisaged, as expected, and others regret that it has not gone far enough.

Mr. Speaker, the Council, by its action, has countered the cardinal principle of international law that domestic remedies must be exhausted and should be the first resort, prior to invoking intervention by external mechanisms. Moreover, it sets a negative precedent, for any country that thinks that might is right, to reopen any of the previous decisions of the Council for collateral purposes. Mr. Speaker, pre-judging the efforts of a sovereign and independent Member State of the International Community by way of such action will, wittingly or unwittingly subscribe to the efforts and the agenda of the terrorist rump to derail the delicate peace and reconciliation efforts in the country.

Mr. Speaker, irrespective of the decision that emanated from Geneva, what is crystal clear is that, we will not let this country roll back to the era of terrorism that devastated the entire country eluding it from harnessing the fullest benefit from its natural strengths, and in particular, the unique calibre of its human resources. By defeating terrorism, we have now protected the right to life for every person - one of the foremost human rights for any living being. The people of this country representing all walks of life, irrespective of caste, creed and ethnicity, who rallied to express their protest and dismay on the unwarranted action by the Council amply demonstrate their will to stand by the country and its democratically-elected Government, to defend their right to freedom from terrorism. The challenge in front of us today is expediting our action in consolidation of this hard-gained peace in achieving peace that is stable and sustainable. It is in this spirit that the Government has genuinely embarked upon a reconciliation process addressing issues related to economic development, rehabilitation and resettlement, livelihood development as well as redressing the agony and sufferings of people who lost their loved ones due to terrorism.

We are not surprised, Mr. Speaker, by the move of certain Member States, for their action yesterday, against Sri Lanka in the 19th Session of the UN Human Rights Council. When Sri Lanka made headway in ending terrorism in May 2009, we were confronted with similar efforts taken by the same forces to cease the humanitarian operation in order to give a fresh lease of life to the terrorists. I must reiterate that we have always been open to constructive engagement but will not cave in to unreasonable demands. It is in this context, that we

1613 1614

2012 23

sincerely appreciate our friends who understood Sri Lankas position and stood by us at the time of need. We thank them profoundly and sincerely.

Mr. Speaker, we are mindful of certain domestic compulsions that forced some of our neighbours and traditional friends to act in the way they did. However, such reactions will not in any way strain our long-established relations with them. The action taken by the Council will not prevent us in continuing our relations and engagement with countries, even with those who could not support us. As we have done in the past, especially in trying times of our nation, we will open our doors for assistance as and when we feel it is essential and when a situation is beyond our capacity to handle alone. We will not, under any circumstances, allow others to impose on us their advice or solutions. This is what the international community has precisely agreed to adhere to, when they established the Human Rights Council in 2006. That is, to respect the consent of the country concerned and to consult it when providing technical assistance and advice.

Mr. Speaker, it is a matter of great satisfaction to us that 15 countries voted with Sri Lanka despite the intensity of pressure exerted on all of them in a variety of forms. Eight countries, by abstaining, declined to support the Resolution.

With 15 countries voting with Sri Lanka and eight countries abstaining, the final result was that 23 countries out of a total of 47 members of the Human Rights Council did not support the Resolution while 24 supported it. The margin was so narrow as this. All in all, 23 Member States refused to say, "Yes" to the Resolution.

Mr. Speaker, the most distressing feature of this experience is the obvious reality that voting at the Human Rights Council is now determined not by the merits of a particular issue or value of arguments but by strategic alliances and domestic political issues in other countries, which have nothing to do with the subject matter of a Resolution or the best interests of the country to which the Resolution relates. This is a cynical negation of the purposes for which the Human Rights Council was established in 2006.

Many countries which voted with Sri Lanka were acutely conscious of the danger of setting a precedent which enables ad hoc intervention by powerful countries in the internal affairs of other sovereign nations.

This is a highly selective and arbitrary process not governed by objective norms, objective realities or criteria of any kind. The implications of this were not lost on many countries.

As far as Sri Lanka is concerned, our policy in respect of all matters will continue to be guided by the vital

interests and well-being of the people of our country. It hardly requires emphasis that this cannot yield place to any other consideration.

Mr. Speaker, just as we were determined to free the country from the clutches of terrorism, we will take all feasible action within the practically possible time, given the nature and the complexity of issues at hand. One could no doubt agree that it is the Government of Sri Lanka, which is best placed in evolving a home-grown solution acceptable to all the citizens of this country. We will therefore not entertain alien quick fixes. We have witnessed elsewhere in contemporary humanitarian emergencies, how such attempts have led to invariable failures and further chaos.

Mr. Speaker, it is therefore the time to rise up above all differences, political affiliations, and ethnic or religious alliances. It is up to us, all Hon. Members of this august Assembly, to decide as legislators and firstly, as citizens who love this country to seize this opportunity, indeed the historic opportunity, afforded to us to work with a sense of togetherness, towards a new Sri Lanka which can be the "Wonder of Asia".
