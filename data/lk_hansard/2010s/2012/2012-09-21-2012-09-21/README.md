asked the Minister of External Affairs:

(a) Will he admit the facts that -

(i) a pledge was made by the Government at the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2006 to the effect that the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution would be further strengthened and the impediments to

1847 1848

[ ]

2012 21

the implementation of the Seventeenth Amendment would be removed;

(ii) again in 2007 a pledge was made at the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Meeting to implement the Seventeenth Amendment;

(iii) the said pledge has been breached by the nullification of the Seventeenth Amendment through the promulgation of the Eighteenth Amendment;

(iv) the breach of this pledge has resulted in the credibility of the government being eroded at the international arena; and

(v) this situation has put the country in disgrace?

(b) Will he inform this House whether the government will take steps forthwith to implement the Seventeenth Amendment and thereby setup Independent Commissions as the need for Independent Commissions has been recommended by the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission and the Resolution of the United Nations Human Rights Council on Sri Lanka?

(c) If not, why?

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Sir, on behalf of the Minister of External Affairs, I answer Question No. 7 is as follows:

(a) (i) The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, the then Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights, as the Head of the Sri Lankan Delegation to the First Session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva in 2006 informed the Human Rights Council - HRC - as follows:

Due to the present stalemate we are experiencing with regard to the appointment of the Constitutional Council, I wish to inform that President Mahinda Rajapaksa has decided to recommend to Parliament the appointment of a multi-party Parliamentary Select Committee with a view to resolving the procedural shortcomings and further strengthening the democratic governance objectives of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution under which the Constitutional Council was set up.

As such, a multi-party body was established to examine this issue.

(ii) An Answer to that question does not arise because there was no pledge made in 2007.

(iii) There was no pledge, nevertheless, the democratic governance is an evolving process. After obtaining the concurrence of the Supreme Court with regard to the consistency of the Bill with the Constitution, Parliament as the supreme body of democratic governance in the country adopted the Eighteenth Amendment with 161 votes in support, 17 votes against and 46 absentees.

(iv) As a sovereign right of the country, the required democratic steps were taken by the Government, with the Constitutional amendments being made following the due process. Therefore, the Government continues to work in tandem with the mandate of the people. In this context, the Hon. Members perception is misplaced.

(v) Does not arise in the context of (iv) above.

(b) Does not arise with the introduction of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission will be implemented in accordance with the National Action Plan endorsed by the Cabinet of Ministers on 25th of July, 2012, under the purview of the Secretary to the President.

(c) Not applicable.

question. In 2008, did the Minister, Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, give a categorical assurance that the Seventeenth Amendment will be implemented?

[3.03 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, we are mourning today the passing away of our very dear Friend, the Hon. Mahinda Ratnatilaka. He represented the people in the Ratnapura Municipal Council earlier and came to Parliament thereafter. He was a very lovable personality sharing with us all jokes and enjoyed humour. He was always conscious of his duties towards his people.

Sir, I remember attending several meetings organized by him in Eheliyagoda, Kuruwita, Ratnapura and we went

1885 1886

with him even to Godakawela, Rakwana and Balangoda. As I said, he was with full of smiles and always enjoyed laughing. He had a humane nature. He was a very good friend of our Muslims in the Ratnapura District. I know how close he was to people of the calibre of Yehiya Hajiyar of Ratnapura, who is the Chairman of the Board of Quazis, and other Muslims of the gem land.

He maintained a close rapport with the Tamil community as well, and I am aware that on several occasions when he came to this House, he met several Ministers and asked for their help and assistance to improve the estate schools. He even got teachers appointed to the estate schools in the Ratnapura area. We can see that all his efforts have now borne fruit because the educated voters of the Ratnapura District, while voting largely for the United Peoples Freedom Alliance, have voted for two candidates from the CWC, the Ceylon Workers Congress headed by the Minister, Hon. Arumugan Thondaman. But, they are part and parcel of the governing group there.

At this moment, I also wish to convey our congratulations to the Hon. Mahiepala Herath who has scored a hat-trick by, once again, becoming the Chief Minister of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council -

.

Then, Sir, as I told earlier, the Hon. Mahinda Ratnatilaka improved the schools in the Eheliyagoda Electorate. There, he associated closely with the bulath mudalali, and in Kahawatte with Guruge Mudalali, and also with the Muslim gem merchants. He always upheld the principle of living in amity with the rest of the communities. He was almost like a political diplomat in that area promoting inter-religious and inter-communal relationship amongst the Buddhists, Muslims and Tamils.

When the Hon. Mahinda Ratnatilaka became the Minister of Textile Industry Development, he was good enough, at our recommendation, to appoint Mr. M.H.M. Navavi, a former Minister of the North Western Provincial Council as the Chairman of the Lanka Salu Sala. He also accommodated as his Coordinating Secretary, Mr. C.M.M. Sheriff, a very senior Member of the Pradeshiya Sabha of Arachchikattuwa in the Puttalam District.

So, the Hon. Mahinda Ratnatilaka has served us well. He has left a very good legacy for others to follow.

2007 2010 , .

We remember the late Hon. M.L.M. Aboosaly who was returned to this House with a large majority by the Sinhala community in Balangoda because he won the hearts of the Sinhalese and the Muslims there, although they represented only about three per cent. The cordiality, relationship and friendship was so great. This is a unique feature in Sri Lankan politics.

Sir, with due respect to you, in the North we will not get a Muslim elected in any of the Jaffna Electorates. This is how we live in Balangoda, Borella, Akurana and areas of that nature. Then, in 1956, from Kadugannawa we had C.S. Marikkar called the "Sinhala Marikkar".

The Hon. Mahinda Ratnatilaka was as I told you a man of peace. He always adorned himself with the local dress - shirt and sarong. He was proud of that. When somebody jokingly said in this House, You look like a godaya", he said, Yes, I am a godaya of this country. I do not hold a brief for the jaththyantharaya. As I stated earlier, he was very close with all the Muslims and Mosques in Eheliyagoda in the Ratnapura District. We could often see him in the Mosque, breaking fast. Also, he espoused the cause of the international Muslim community. When damage was caused to the Holy Mosque - Al-Aqsa, he was one of those who led a demonstration against the Zionist and Israeli attack on that holy place.

Today, Friday, being a holy day - Jummah day - of the week for Muslims, there were mass demonstrations in all the Mosques in the Island and the call came from the All-Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama, the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka and the Centre for Islamic Studies - CIS. Next Monday, there will be a massive demonstration led by the Governor of the Western Province, Mr. Alavi Moulana, starting from the Plaza Building, organized by the Qadiriyyathul Nabavia of Beruwela, headed by Sheikh Nayagam Ahamed Alim bin Mohammed Alim.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please come back to the subject and wind up.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I will wind up, Sir. But, this is what the late Hon. Mahinda Ratnatilaka taught us; this was what he stood for.- [Interruption.] Why are they worried when we talk about Muslims? Are you for defiling the Holy Prophet of Islam? If you say so, I would like to quote The Island of 19th, September, 2012, which states, I quote:

SLMC forsakes religion, Quran for positions - Ranil

This is sacrilegious as much as much as the YouTube video clip produced by the western world.

1887 1888

[ ... ]

2012 21

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) All the Muslims must rise up and voice their opposition against the Leader of the Opposition. He does not understand what the Holy Quran is; it is the words of Allahu Tha'ala. This is what I have to say. I think the Hon. Mahinda Ratnatilaka would have opposed such anti-religious utterance in Parliament itself, because he understood well the sentiments of the Muslim community. I believe the UNP Muslim MPs, particularly in the Pradeshiyia Sabhas and the few in the Provincial Councils, must also voice their protest against it, and if possible, censor the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition, because it is such a blatant and sacrilegious statement. You cannot forsake Buddhism in order to accept another political concept. - [Interruption.] Wait, wait. ( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I am sorry, Hon. Azwer, it is better if you wind up now because you move on to different - [Interruption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I will wind up, Sir. But, let me finish this because they have been talking nonsense the day.- [Interruption.] If the Leader of the Opposition can defile the Quran - ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, this is a Vote of Condolence, not a debate. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Nobody can say that one would give up the Bible in order to accept a political philosophy. The statement of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe is irreligious. Has he got a religion? We would like to ask that in Parliament. . . . . . . Today, that is not what is happening, Sir. - [Interruption.]

The Hon. Mahinda Ratnatilaka served a total period of 9 years, 1 month and 8 days in this House.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, your time is over. The next speaker is the Hon. Janaka Wakkumbura. - [Interruption.] That is enough. Hon. Azwer, you took more than 10 minutes. Nobody speaks for more than 10 minutes on a Vote of Condolence. Hon. Janaka Wakkumbura, you can start your speech now. - [Interruption.]

I would like to mention some of the recent attacks that led to this incident.- [Interruption] Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, I did not disturb you. There were so many statements that you made against my view, but I did not disturb you. So, please do not disturb me. Let me finish my speech because I have only a few minutes left.

The recent attacks on Sri Lankans first started with a group of people attacking the Sri Lankan Maha Bodhi Vihara in Chennai in January 2011. Since then, there have been nearly 20 events of attacks or intimidation on Sri Lankans in Tamil Nadu. I can give you a list of incidents that have taken place in Tamil Nadu. Irrespective of party, irrespective of race, be they Sinhalese, Tamils or Muslims, they have attacked Sri Lankans. They have attacked the people who had come from Jaffna. Therefore, this is not an attack against the Sinhalese, this is an attack against the people who love freedom. There is freedom in the North, there is freedom in the East, there is freedom in the whole country for people to get about, do their economic development activities, study and follow their religion. Even for the Indians who come here, even for the Indian leaders who criticize us for political reasons, there is freedom in Sri Lanka. That, we have shown to the world.

In the recent past, that is, on 2nd September, 2012, a football team from Royal College of Sri Lanka which played a friendly match against the Customs Department in Chennai was sent back before completion of its tour of scheduled games. Eight students from a school in Ratnapura together with their coach who had come for a tournament with a city-based school in Trichy were also sent back prematurely to Sri Lanka. There were many incidents like this which took place.

It may be recalled that a group of Sri Lankan pilgrims, totalling 184 persons had visited Tamil Nadu to participate in the Annual Feast of the Poondi Madha Church in Thanjavur and also to worship the Shrine Basilica located at Velankanni. On 3rd September, 2012, there was an attack on these pilgrims and as they were mobbed they sought refuge in the Church. Subsequently, the pilgrims were taken to the Shrine of Basilica at Velankanni. The Central Government provided security for the pilgrims even after the attack to go to Velankanni which was about 12 hours drive and then brought them back to Trichy Airport, although certain incidents took place on their return even to the Airport. So, the Central Government has provided adequate security. The South Indian Government, the Chief Minister has provided security. The Chief Minister was not behind the physical attacks although she has protested with a view to sending the Sri Lankan people back. She has condemned the attack on the pilgrims and also, the Opposition Leader, M. Karunanidhi, has condemned the attack by the extreme LTTE sympathizers, the LTTE diaspora who funds and sympathizes with them. So, the pilgrims were taken to the Shrine Basilica at Velankanni and there too was a protest against their presence. Lately, they were taken in buses under the Tamil Nadu police protection to the Thiruchirapally Airport. On the way, the convoy carrying the pilgrims was again targeted by protesters. Tamil Nadu Police, however, intervened and arrested nine activists of the Naam Tamizhar Iyakkam with pro-LTTE leanings.

Under these circumstances, as the Government of Sri Lanka is responsible for the safety and security of its nationals, it was compelled to issue a Travel Advisory on 3rd September, 2012. It states, I quote:

The Government of Sri Lanka regrets the increasing number of instances of intimidation of Sri Lankan nationals visiting Tamil Nadu for the purposes of tourism, religious pilgrimages, sporting and cultural activities and professional training.

These visits are a reflection of people to people contact between the polity of two countries which are bound by age old friendly ties and traditions.

Most recently today, 184 pilgrims visiting the Poornimatha Church in Thanjavur have been mobbed and become refuge in the church. The Government of Sri Lanka has taken all steps required through the Indian Government to seek the safety of these pilgrims.

- which was done by the South Indian Government as well as the Central Government. On the instructions of both governments, they were provided security.

It further states, I quote:

The Government of Sri Lanka is constrained to request Sri Lankan nationals in the interest of their security to desist from undertaking visits to Tamil Nadu until further notice. In the event there is a compelling reason to visit Tamil Nadu, such a visit should take place following prior timely intimation to the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission in Chennai.

The Official Spokesman of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs responded to the Travel Advisory on 4th September, 2012, the following day, due to the friendly relationship that we had between the two countries. It states, I quote:

We have noted the travel advisory that has been issued by the Government of Sri Lanka for its nationals visiting the state to Tamil Nadu. I wish to convey here that the Government of India, in close consultation with the concerned state governments, has taken and will continue to take all measures to ensure the safety, security and well-being of Sri Lankan dignitaries and visitors to India, including Tamil Nadu.

In certain instances, it has been noticed that important visits have taken place without prior intimation to the concerned authorities. I find it important to emphasize here that people-to-people contacts are an integral part of the close historical, cultural, ethnic and civilizational ties between India and Sri Lanka. Our High Commission in Colombo issued visas to nearly 200,000.

This is what was said by the Indian High Commission in Colombo:

..Sri Lankan nationals to visit India last year, while approximately 175,000 Indian tourists visited Sri Lanka in 2011. It is this perspective that guides all our actions on such matters.

It is evident from the Indian statement that the Government of India is fully concerned in ensuring the safety, security and well-being of the visitors from Sri Lanka to India, including Tamil Nadu.

Mr. Presiding Member, I like to state that Sri Lanka has a very strong and cordial relationship with India. Our President has got utmost support from the Central Government as well as the President and all parties in India. When the Hon. (Ms.) Sushma Swaraj, Hon. Leader of the Opposition of the Lok Sabha, came to Sri Lanka on an official visit led by an all-party Indian Delegation, I happened to be with her continuously for one week. She praised the development process that is taking place. She urged the TNA Parliamentarian, the Hon. R. Sampanthan and other parties to take advantage of the two-third majority that the Government has for an amicable settlement that can be acceptable to all parties and all people living in this country, not only to the Hon. Members in Parliament, the few Members who have lost their credibility in Parliament and who have lost the credibility among the people in Sri Lanka. Those were the sentiments expressed not merely in Sri Lanka but even in the Lok Sabha by the Hon. Leader the Opposition of Lok Sabha, the Hon. (Ms.) Sushma Swaraj, and all parties including people from Tamil Nadu political parties who supported the Indian Congress Party and other parties in the Indian Government. Therefore, Sri Lankan ties are at the best and Sri Lanka is being supported, funded and helped in many spheres. These are the extreme parties who have been funded by the LTTE diaspora abroad who have no other way to fund the terrorists in Sri Lanka, since they have been defeated. They are trying to instigate a few parties and a few people from extreme parties in South India to stage a protest and flare-up insurgency once again disrupting peaceful relations between the two countries.

Mr. Presiding Member, I like to state that there have been protests even today. This is a great occasion. Not even two weeks have passed since the last incident, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa went to Sanchi in North India and laid a foundation stone to build a

Buddhist University to uplift Buddhist education. Therefore, these ties are continuing and Indians are helping us irrespective of party, creed and religion. So, the Leader of the Opposition as well as the Leaders of other Tamil Parties sympathize and regret, because they have missed the bus, that they could not be a part of the peace process and even now they say that there would have been negotiations before the war, not after the war.

So, this is the stance they are taking today. Also, they support the LTTE diaspora abroad to wage another terrorist war in the country once again and deprive the people in the North of their livlihood.

In conclusion, I take this opportunity to thank the Indian Government and its people for the safety and security they provided. We will be taking appropriate action as soon as the situation comes to normal in South India. Even today, the Central Government of India has arrested Vaiko and a few others who have been protesting in the South India against certain incidents. The Indian Government is fully aware as to who is behind the attacks. Therefore, we thank the Government of India as well as its people for maintaining the friendly relationship between the two countries.

I thank you, Sir.
