( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. A. H. M. Azwer. You have five minutes. [5.40 p.m.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Sir, at the outset, I would like to place on record our revulsion and protest not only of the Muslims but of the entire Parliament against a You Tube video that is in circulation, which vilifies, defames and insults our Holy Prophet of Islam, Muhammed (Sal.) I am getting SMSs from the Centre of Islamic Studies urging all brothers of Islam to protest against the US Diplomatic Mission for continuing with the film that was made in the United States. Sir, the former Member of Parliament, Hon. Shafeek Rajabdeen says, "The obscure, poorly made film depicting the Holy Prophet Muhammed in so many ways is at the centre of a row".

This is a tragedy in the modern world staged by the so-called colonial powers; Western blocs. The Western powers have found a man called Salman Rushdie who wrote that infamous book "Satanic Verses" in order to insult the Holy Prophet of Islam. Then, they found another ghost writer, Taslima Nasrin from the Islamic State of Bangladesh to write another book insulting Islam. This game is going on unabated. All right-thinking people and all who profess religion must vehemently protest against this heinous crime.

When the Bahamian Statues in Afghanistan were damaged, Alhaj Moulavi Niyas Mohamed and all of us took to the streets in Pettah and other places protesting against that. That is a distinct feature of all religionists, whatever the religion one may follow.

This is the work of the Zionists, the conspirators who wanted to topple the Government even in this country. This is the work of Yahudis who have been warned against in the Holy Quran. This dirty game is going on. Why should anybody hurt the feelings and the religious susceptibilities of another person? Now, you can see that the Arab Spring is in a whirlpool. It is around their neck. It has boomeranged on them. . The whole Arab world is against hurting the feelings of Muslims. I am happy that the Hon. Hunais Farook is in the Chair at the moment. You know how strong the feelings of Muslims are. You know how some people made use of Islam in order to win elections or to at least get more seats at the just concluded Provincial Election, particularly in the Eastern Province. Religion must not be made a tool in order to win wars; in order to win elections and in order to get votes and win over people. This will never be condoned by anybody. On my right is the Hon. A.L.M. Athaullah. He also joins me in protesting against this violent attack on the Holy Prophet of Islam. We, from this House, appeal to use all your influence against the United States. On my left is the Hon. Wijayamuni De Zoysa, Deputy Minister of Education, who commands the respect of the Muslims in Bibile and in other areas in the Moneragala District for helping in the education of Muslims.

I, as a Musalman, condemn on behalf of Parliament, this anti-Islamic propaganda. I do not think anybody in this House will disagree with me. We request the so-called powerful United States of America to come forward and stop this nonsense. Do not allow bloodshed in not only the Muslim countries but in the rest of the world also.

Sir, pictures of Lord Buddha had been printed in basins that were sold in Pettah and Fort pavements some years ago.

At that time, one of our greatest leaders, Dr. T.B Jayah was presiding over the Working Committee of the

1501 1502

[ ]

2012 18

All-Ceylon Muslim League and I was a member of the Working Committee. He said, Bring those basins. Dr. T.B. Jayah was the first person who protested against carrying pictures of Lord Buddha in saleable items. He said, You cannot use the pictures of Lord Buddha in such merchandise items. That is the feeling we have. Sir, we are all one in our feelings for all religions, without exception.

As far as this Bill is concerned, I must place on record that nowhere in the world - you have heard about the Korean War, you have heard about the Vietnam War, even after the war, with all respect to those governments, whom we recognize now - has anyone solved the problems of ex-soldiers as remarkably being done by our Government. Also, particularly the whole country owes a great debt of gratitude to Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa for not only winning the war as commanded by the Commander in Chief, the President of the country, but also rehabilitating the soldiers. If you to Malay Street - I was seated there once upon a time as the Minister of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs, you can see that that huge building in Malay Street, Slave Island, has been transformed into a school for the children of soldiers.

Sir, our Party, the United Peoples Freedom Alliance - UPFA - has even nominated soldiers who have lost their arms and legs to contest elections. They suffered in the war; they were the victims of the war. One of them was elected to the Western Provincial Council and another was elected to Rajarata, the North-Central Province and he always attends our meetings coming in a three-wheeler.

Sir, I went to the North with the foreign delegates who attended the 58th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. They were amazed; they were bewildered and they were surprised to see the transformation that has taken place in Jaffna. A Member of the Canadian Parliament asked me when we were travelling together in the bus, Is this Jaffna? I told, Yes, this is Jaffna. He again asked me, Is this the real Jaffna? I said, Yes, we have only one Jaffna. We do not have two Jaffnas. The Hon. John Amaratunga knows it very well. He also participated in the Conference. He was very much present in the Conference and he appreciated everything. Then, the Member of the Canadian Parliament further asked, Where are the soldiers? I said, Why, for what do we need soldiers? The role of the army is over. They have gone back home. He then said, No. I was told in Canada by certain agents of the diaspora and others not to go to Sri Lanka, and if at all I go, not to step into the Jaffna Peninsula because military officers are all over and under every tree there would be a soldier". The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan is listening to what I am saying now. But, alas! They did not find any soldier in the streets of Jaffna. They went to see the rehabilitation villages. Food was being cooked by ladies. The African lady Delegates even helped the people there to cook food. They were drawing water from the wells. Even Ahamed Shihab, the Speaker of the Maldivian Parliament told me, I have come several times to Sri Lanka but I did not have the

good fortune of visiting Jaffna. I will come back again with my family alone to spend a holiday in Jaffna. Hon. D.M. Swaminathan, please be there to receive them.

What are the soldiers doing today? A copy of the "Business Today" magazine of September, 2012 is here with me. But, I have no time to read out all the articles. This is a very good magazine. I must commend the clever editor and the contributors of the articles to this popular magazine. In one article published in this magazine, Major General Mahinda Hathurusinghe states, I quote:

The overnight transformation of the image of the soldier from the fighter to protector was thought to be necessary and crucial.

Sir, the soldier was a fighter. He was fighting to save the nation. The war was won and what is he doing now? He is acting the role of a protector. He further states, I quote:

The Army, in the in the process of reconstruction and resettlement, has taken Jaffna a long way to achieve sustainable peace.

Thank God! Thank His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa and particularly Mr.Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as far as rehabilitation of soldiers is concerned, it is being done extremely satisfactorily.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up your speech. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I will not take much time. I will soon wind up my speech.

Sir, in an another article published in the "Business Today" magazine of September, 2012, Dr. Subramanian Swamy, Member of NDA Coalition and President of the Janata Party in India states, I quote:

I am not going to give any message to the TNA. I am asking the government to go straight to the public. The public has been talking to me and corresponding with me, and they tell me that they are very happy that their children are safe and they do not have to be worried about their children being forcibly recruited.

He does not agree with the LTTE anymore. He further states, I quote:

"That they do not have to give a portion of their salary to the LTTE. The people are happy becuse they are able to lead a normal life".

I commend this magazine. The "Business Today" magazine should be read and re-read by the entire Sri Lankan nation and all our friends in foreign countries. Thank you very much.

. . Question proposed.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Then, the Adjournment Motion is to be moved by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella.

HOLDING OF NORTHERN PROVINCIAL COUNCIL ELECTIONS

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Mr. Presiding Member, I move the following Motion: In view of the statements made by the Government on several occasions regarding the holding of Northern Provincial Council Elections, will the Government make an early announcement that the Northern Provincial Council Elections will be held in February, 2013 after monsoon rains are over?

Sir, addressing the gathering at the Official Opening of the 58th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference on 11th September, 2012, the President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, stated, I quote:

It is also noteworthy that among the first things done after the defeat of terrorism, first in the Eastern Province, and later in the entire country, was to quickly hold local government, provincial and national elections to obtain a proper mandate from the people, large sections of whom were deprived of their franchise by the forces of terror."

He further stated, I quote:

"We will also hold elections to the Northern Provincial Council next year upholding the principles of democracy.

Sir, I wish to table* the speech made by His Excellency the President on that occasion as Annex I.

The principles enshrined in the Commonwealth Values and Principles have been defined and strengthened over the years by the Singapore Declaration, the Harare Declaration, the Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme, the Latimer House Principles and the Aberdeen Principles. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held in Port of Spain in 2009 re-affirmed the Commonwealth Values and Principles, which document I wish to table* as Annex II.

The Sri Lankan President also took part in that and as such, is a party to the Declaration, and we all are bound by it. Sir, I wish to table* a document publishing the photos of all the Heads of Government who participated at that CHOGM in Trinidad and Tobago as Annex III.

Sir, the Affirmation of the Commonwealth Values and Principles made at the CHOGM held in Port of Spain states, I quote:

Democracy: reaffirming our belief in the inalienable right of the individual to participate by means of free and democratic political processes in shaping the society in which they live; underlining that not only governments but all political parties and civil society also have responsibilities in upholding and promoting democratic culture and practices as well as accountability to the public in this regard; and recognizing that parliaments and representative local government and other forms of local governance, are essential elements in the exercise of democratic governance;

Therefore, the people of the North have the inalienable right to elect their representatives to the Provincial Council and to take part in the exercise of democratic governance. The Parliamentary, Presidential and Local Authority Elections had been held in the Northern Province as well as in other provinces. In the North, the security is back to normal now. Only a very small area of the North has to be cleared of mines. The people concerned live in the camps nearby and carry out their day-to-day activities. Even when the whole area was mined by the LTTE, people had the right to exercise their vote. Demining is not an excuse to hold back elections. The Principle of Democracy calls for the immediate holding of elections in the Northern Province.

The Perth Communiqu issued at the meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government in Perth 2011, has stated the circumstances which can be taken into account in determining whether there has been a significant violation of fundamental political values. I wish to table* that as Annex IV.

1511 1512

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

One such instance is the suspension or prevention of key democratic institutions. The Provincial Council is a key democratic institution in Sri Lanka. The criteria relating to the postponement of national elections without justification also apply to Provincial Council Elections. This will amount to a systematic violation of the fundamental rights of a population, or of any communities or groups - that is, the people of the Northern Province - by the Government of a member country.

Circumstances establishing such violations according to the Perth Communiqu and Article 25 of ICCPR state that every citizen shall have the right and opportunity to take part in the conduct of public affairs through freely chosen representatives and to vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections. Similarly, the Sri Lankan Constitution, under "Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties", Article 27(4) states that the State must afford all opportunities to people to participate at every level. This Article read together with Article 12 and 14 requires holding of elections at the earliest possible time. Any delay will amount to violation of fundamental rights. Therefore, in this background, the Government is duty-bound to hold elections for the Northern Provincial Council by February 2013, otherwise it will be a breach of the undertaking given by the President at the 58th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. It is also a violation of the values and principles of the Commonwealth, the ICCPR and the Constitution of Sri Lanka. Thank you.

( ) (The Presiding Member) The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan will second the Motion. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. D.M. Swaminathan) Sir, I have the privilege in seconding the Motion that was moved by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella. This is a matter dealing with the Northern Province and therefore, I will be speak in this House in the Tamil language.
