2012 2012 MID-YEAR FISCAL POSITION REPORT OF 2012

[1.30 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I have the honour of moving the Adjournment Motion today - of course early in the day - allowing a full days Debate as requested by even the Opposition. We are very democratic. We follow the Parliamentary procedures to the letter. Therefore, the Government readily agreed to the request. I move,

An Adjournment Motion with regard to the Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report of 2012

Sir, in terms of Section 10 of the Fiscal Management Responsibility Act, No. 3 of 2003, the Minister of Finance is requested to present the Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report to the public by the last day of June of the year and thereafter lay before Parliament. The purpose of this Report is to provide updated information on the Governments Fiscal performance as per the fiscal strategy of the Government. The Report contains the performance of Government revenue, expenditure, cash flow operations and borrowings during the first four months of the year 2012. The Report also provide updated information depending on the availability of information relating to macroeconomic performance, price developments, foreign aid, Government debt, and other official reserves.

Today, Sir, we are on the onward march. We are rapidly developing. The whole world is showering bouquets and plaudits on us, because after 30 years of a brutal war, within a period of nearly three years, the development that is taking place around the country is marvellous. I think we have heard about the Vietnam War, the Korean War. After the war, even now, the countries are suffering in certain fields of economic activity.

Sir, the other day 800 Delegates came from all over the world - from the North Pole, South Pole, America, Pacific countries; the whites, the blacks and the browns came. It was a very grand opening ceremony ever held in this part of the world at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Lotus Pond Auditorium. The foreign Delegates were almost mesmerized to see such a glittering function. The speech that was made by the His Excellency the President was very well-received.

I quote from the Daily News of 12th September, 2012. It states, I quote:

Sri Lanka, an inspiration to other Cwealth nations

Who says this? It is Sir Alan Haselhurst, with whom the Hon. Leader of the Opposition had a good rapport. I saw it during the session. I saw he was enjoying every moment of the Conference and even in this House, he praised the arrangements that were made marvellously well by the Hon. Speaker and you, yourself, as the Deputy Speaker of the House.

The story was filed by Rasika Somarathna and Sandasen Marasinghe. It further states, I quote:

The holding of the 58th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in Colombo is an epoch making one because it is being held in a member nation which is rising rapidly after emerging from the ravages of terror, CPA Executive Committee Chairman, Sir Alan Haselhurst said. He also identified Sri Lanka as an inspiration to other Commonwealth nations.

Can you just imagine of such sentiments being expressed by one of the great British Parliamentarians, Sir Alan Haselhurst?

He has won the hearts of not only the Parliamentarians but even the ordinary staff of Parliament. This is what he says about us. That article further states, I quote:

He also identified Sri Lanka as an inspiration to other Commonwealth nations. Sir Alan Haselhurst was addressing the open ceremony of the 58th CPA.

Then, Sir, the speech made by His Excellency the President on that occasion was brilliant. It gives us a clear insight to the new chapter that we are turning in this country. In an article which appeared in Daily News of 12th September, 2012, under the heading, World can behold SLs Progress, it states, I quote:

1703 1704

The vast resources of human experience available to the CPA, which has 175 branches and 17,000 parliamentarians at the most recent count, places it, in an excellent position to contribute to better understanding of practice and procedure in Parliaments, examine international trading systems, and look at new policies on science in an age of rapidly advancing technology.

It will also be extremely useful to explore increasing trade among Commonwealth countries and devise ways to facilitate such trade".

This is what the Leader of the nation said at the 58th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. It was held by all the Members who spoke thereafter in the Sessions, in the Workshops and even when they accompanied us to Jaffna and to several other places.

Sir, they were really amazed to see the newly-emerging Jaffna. They have heard stories about its destruction: destruction of houses, religious places and schools by the Tigers and some of them were asked not to come to Sri Lanka. They confided that in me. A Canadian Member of Parliament particularly asked me, Is this Jaffna? I said, Yes." Then he asked me, "Is this is the real Jaffna?" I said, "We have only one Jaffna and this is the real Jaffna. Then he asked me again, Where is the army? - [Interruption.] No. I am talking about the economic recovery. We have to mention all these relevant matters. My Adjournment Motion today deals with the economic recovery and economic development. Do you not understand that? Hon. John Amaratunga, I think you understood it well at the Conference, but do not forget the lessons that you have learnt there. - [Interruption.] Listen to me. You are jealous. I am quoting from the foreign Delegates - as I said the blacks, whites and the others - they came from all over the world. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Did you meet that African lady Delegate?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Did you meet her? How many times did you meet her? I only saw her at the Conference and at dinner. Sir, His Excellency the President stated, I quote:

In conclusion, I wish to state that having your conference in a vibrant democracy, where the will of the people has been cherished, and protected for eight decades and more, there is every hope that your deliberations, amidst the well springs of democracy that prevail in our land, will produce the best results for parliamentary democracy in the Commonwealth and the world.

May you be blessed by the Noble Triple Gem!

That is how His Excellency the President concluded the famous and the hallmark Presidential Address to the international community. I wish to table* this article.

Sir, an article appears in todays The Island, on page 5, under the heading, Basil gives HR delegates clear picture on IPPs rehabilitation and reconciliation, it states, I quote:

Senior Adviser to the President and Minister of Economic Development Basil Rajapaksa gave representatives of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights a clear picture on how the human rights of the people in the conflict affected Northern and Eastern provinces were restored.

I would like to table* this article before the House. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have to wind up now. You were allocated only five minutes.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Is there a time limit? Give me a little more time, Sir. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, please give him five minutes. - [Interruption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) It is my right if the Government allows. We have enough time. - [Interruption.] They are throwing mud all over. They are speaking about the Judiciary.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Azwer, why do you not speak about the Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Yes, I am speaking about the economic review. My speech is based on that. Are you getting points from the Hon. Leader of the Opposition? Well, do it. He is close to you. He identifies all those areas.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Do not worry about that. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Thank you very much, Hon. Azwer.

Sir, they mentioned it here. That is why it has been reported in the "Daily Mirror" of today. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition is smiling.

It further states:

However undue influence has been made by certain interested parties on the JSC in its independent decisions taking power."

Sir, the Supreme Court Determination of the Divinaguma Bill was read in the House by the Hon. Speaker.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, your Members are trying to mislead Parliament. You are talking about it. I want to ask these questions if that is so. Firstly, when was the Secretary to the Judicial Service Commission, Manjula Thilakaratne appointed? Tell us. Secondly, is he aware of the most senior Judicial Officer eligible to the post? Is he the most senior? Thirdly, if not, what was the procedure and basis for selection?

Let them answer. We wanted to uphold the Judiciary. When these things are traded upon in newspapers and in Parliament, I think we have to ask these questions. Therefore, I would say that the Judicial Service Commission has been appointed by the Parliamentary Council, which is a Supreme Council.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.S. Thowfeek) Sir, I second the Motion.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, I am willing to give 10 minutes to the Hon. Azwer to speak.

When we are being magnanimous in trying to listen to some economic theory that is coming out of a new Pandit, why are you holding back? - [Interruption.] This is the first time I saw such a magnanimity actually taking place. - [Interruption.]

Hon. Minister, I would like to say that there has been a contingent liability which has crystallized now. It is a happening on which you have got to make a payment of roughly US Dollars 169 million, which comes to about Rs. 23 billion. Then, there is another contingent liability over two more court cases that the Government has lost or appealed and the impact of that contingent liability has not been reflected under the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act. So, I am wondering what type of presentation the Hon. Minister and the Government have made to the House. I am not saying this to ridicule him, but as a professional, as an accountant. If you are simply

acting under the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, there must be decency on the part of the Government to respond to at least what is required by the Act. You all have given what you feel should be given, but what is expected of you has not been given. So, Hon. Minister, I will rest my case with the theoretical assumption I made.

Those are the macroeconomic factors. Since I am going to deal with some technical economic matters, I would like to speak in English for the rest of my speech.

Now, we will turn to fiscal developments. The fiscal performance of the first four months of 2012 must be analysed in the light of the impact of Government measures to reduce the trade deficit in February. These include pursuing greater exchange rate flexibility, tightening monetary policy through increasing Central Bank policy rates, and adopting strategies both to moderate bank credit growth and to adjust domestic petroleum, electricity and transport prices in line with international market developments. The depreciation of the rupee in line with exchange rate flexibility has also affected the mid- year fiscal position.

Government revenue during January - May 2012 period increased by 9.1 per cent compared to the corresponding period in 2011. This is largely due to a

11.9 per cent increase in tax revenues in line with measures implemented in the last Budget. Tax revenue increases have occurred through improvements in international trade-related taxes, and growth in excise duty and income tax. The increase in trade taxes is mainly due to higher revenue generated by the Ports and Airports Development Levy - PAL, as it was subject to fewer exemptions in 2012. Income tax increases are mostly due to a 71.5 per cent rise in Withholding Tax - WHT. Withholding Tax on interest rose significantly due to the issuance of Treasury Bonds and relatively high market interest rates which have prevailed since the end of 2011. Revenue from the Nation Building Tax also increased with its extension to wholesale and retail trade sectors in place of the Provincial Turnover Tax - PTT.

The overall Government expenditure amounted to Rs. 593,471 million during the first four months of 2012. Current expenditure increased by 24.7 per cent. This is partly due to a 22 per cent increase in interest payments on foreign and domestic debt, which is largely the result of increased domestic market interest rates on Government securities and the depreciation of the rupee against major foreign currencies. However, current expenditure was also significantly boosted by increases in public sector salary, wage and pension payments as well as by a 22 per cent increase in spending on welfare payments and subsidies. The latter consists of programmes such as Samurdhi relief, nutritional intervention programmes such as Poshana Malla and an expansion of the fertilizer subsidy programme to include all crops in accordance with Government policy.

The capital expenditure and the net lending increased by 50.8 per cent over this period. Public investment on development projects in areas such as power generation, ports, roads and irrigation increased to an amount of Rs. 152,401 million. Several of the highway projects invested in should be ready for use by the end of 2013 or the start of 2014. Rupees 1,715 million and Rs. 2,800 million respectively was spent on the development of rural road networks under the "Maga Neguma" and "Gama Neguma" Programmes.

All new capital expenditure is targeted at improving the countrys "doing-business" environment. An example of this is continued investment in three key port development projects: the Colombo South Harbour Project, the Hambantota Port Development Project and the Oluvil Port Development Project.

Public investment continued to target rural development initiatives such as "Divi Neguma", the one million home economy programme aimed at strengthening the economic base of rural families, improving nutrition and ensuring food security. The increase in capital expenditure during this period also partly reflects utilization of a higher degree of foreign funds earmarked for development projects.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order please! The Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

, [ ] .

, , [ ] . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, reflecting these developments, the revenue deficit during the first four months of 2012 was 1.9 per cent of GDP compared to 1.2 per cent during the same period of the previous year, that is 2011. The overall budget deficit amounted to 3.8 per cent of GDP compared to 2.7 per cent in 2011. This outcome reflects the impact of expenditure leads, as just outlined - higher revenue and a moderation of expenditure are expected for the second half of the year.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, what you are saying is, this years budget deficit is 3.8 per cent and it was 2.7 per cent last year. So, the difference is 1.1 per cent.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes, certainly. That was during the first four months.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You are justifying on one side the revenue and - [Interruption.]

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) First listen to this. Thus the years fiscal operations are expected to remain consistent with the targeted deficit of 6.2 per cent of GDP. So, at the end of the year, though there are disparities now, we hope we can stick to that. These are some of the undertakings that we have made.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, your Colleague, the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka stated in this House yesterday that the loss of CEB has amounted to Rs. 185 billion. In terms

of GDP, it is 2.3 per cent. According to you, the budget deficit against the GDP is 6.5 per cent and with this it will now go up to 8.8 per cent, just because of the loss incurred by one institution. So, how are you going to rectify that? () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) There are other remedial options. You will come to know about those when we present the Budget. But, I am telling you on the Floor of this House on behalf of the Government that we will end up the year with a deficit of 6.2 per cent. You have to accept that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If it is not going to happen, what are you going to do? () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, you are a good Friend of mine but I cannot answer hypothetical questions.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is what I am saying. When there are practical situations, you are taking them as hypothetical.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No. Let us not waste time. I know you are anxious to raise all these issues. But, I am not here to answer hypothetical questions. What if it comes down; what if the deficit is only 5 per cent? These are only hypothetical matters. We are quite willing to keep you informed. You have asked questions right throughout the year and we have been giving candid answers. Let us see at the end of the - [Interruption.] I am coming to the EPF also. - [Interruption.] No, no. Wait, I will come to that. So, our position is that by the end of the year we will have, as promised, only a 6.2 per cent deficit.

Then, I come to the Economy. The economy recorded a real growth rate of 7.9 per cent during the first quarter of 2012. This was mainly due to the services and industry sectors, which grew by 5.8 and 10.8 per cent respectively. Notably, the agricultural sector recorded a significant growth rate of 11.5 per cent compared to a 4.3 per cent decline experienced over the same period in 2011. Strong performance in paddy, coconut, fruits and vegetables and highland crop production contributed to this growth.

Year-on-year inflation in May 2012 increased to 7.0 per cent from 6.1 per cent in the previous month. However, annual average inflation - as measured by the

1729 1730

2012 20

Colombo Consumer Price Index - decreased to 5.6 per cent from 5.7 per cent over the same period. Core inflation decreased in terms of both year-on-year calculations and annual averages, to 6.0 and 4.8 per cent respectively.

The performance of the external sector must be considered in the light of Government measures taken in February 2012 to reduce the trade deficit, as well as of international events which have adversely affected the Sri Lankan economy, notably the Eurozone crisis. Unsurprisingly, given negative international conditions, the external sector recorded slower growth in the first four months of 2012. This is mainly due to a 3 per cent decline in both agricultural and industrial exports. An expansion of domestic economic activity caused imports to grow by 12 per cent in the first four months of 2012 compared to 2011. The resultant widening of the trade deficit was, nevertheless, partly offset by a 16.6 per cent increase in worker remittances and a 26 per cent increase in service sector earnings fuelled by higher tourism revenues. Furthermore, despite their continued growth over this period, imports have reflected a gradual deceleration since March 2012 in response to Government policies implemented in February.

Now, I come to Foreign Financing. At the end of April 2012, the Governments total outstanding external debt was US Dollars 18.9 billion. Total debt service payment in the first four months of 2012 amounted to US Dollars 378.4 million. Total estimated debt service payments for 2012 amount to US Dollars 1,630 million, of which 23 per cent has already been paid as of 30th April 2012.

Total financing commitments made by Sri Lankas development partners during January to April 2012 was US Dollars 1,054 million, of which project loans amounted to US Dollars 774 million and grants amounted to US Dollars 280 million. This is remarkably higher than the grant commitment recorded at the end of April 2011, and is due to the grant assistance extended by the Indian Government for the construction of 49,000 houses in the Northern, Eastern, Central and Uva Provinces.

Total foreign aid disbursements from January to April 2012 were US Dollars 625 million. Of this total, project loans and grants accounted for US Dollars 608 million and US Dollars 17 million respectively. Notably, the mobilization of US Dollars 608 million in project loans is significantly higher than the US Dollars 382.5 million received during the same period in 2011.

Sir, now I would like to take a few moments to answer some of the queries that were raised by my good Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake.

Persistently, the Opposition has been saying that we are not answering Questions regarding the EPF and its investments. I must say and I must admit that on several

occasions when individual Questions for oral answers were raised in this House, it is correct that we have asked for time; sometimes two months, three months and so on. But, this must be taken together with a very comprehensive reply that I gave to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition when he raised this matter. Though at that time I tabled it in the House and it is now available in the Library, I would make an earnest request from you to have it tabled* as an annex to my speech, so that it is public knowledge.

Many of the questions that were raised - I am not saying every question - in several instances were answered in my composite reply. So, kindly go through that and if there is further information necessary, I can give you a very clear assurance that we will be forthcoming with the answers. So, I would request you to first look at the reply that I have given.

Look at the situation today. If you look at many of the blue-chip companies in which these investments have been made, they have gone up in the stock market. If you take John Keells just for an example, its shares have climbed and proportionately you have to take a notional view because all these are notional. If the share comes at a particular point, then you have gained or lost a certain amount. That is, as of a given date, you calculate the number of shares and say that you have got so much or you have lost so much. But, that is continuously changing. That is like a carousel. It goes changing depending on the date, depending on the trade, depending on whether it is a bull run or a bear. There are so many things. So, this is only a notional loss. It is not an actual loss in capital. It may go up; it may go down. But, that is the nature of it.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Can you take that risk?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) What risk? ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) On the invested money? () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is a decision which was taken by the UNP and endorsed by us, that a certain percentage of the EPF

1731 1732

* . * . * Produced at end of speech.

should be invested in securities. Your economic spokesman, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva has never taken up the position, I am quite sure, that this intervention is not necessary at all. ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Three Attorneys-General have said that you are not supposed to take that EPF money for share investment. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No. You all have done and we also have done so. Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva is there. Is it your position that monies should not be invested at all in the stock exchange - [Interruption.] That is your position. But, what your economic expert - ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) According to the regulations, you are not supposed to invest EPF money in the share market. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That, we will debate later. But, consistently, both the Government and the Opposition have taken up the position that a fairly small part of it, not the whole thing, could be invested. What is wrong in investing that?

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) There is a loss. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) What is the loss? ( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Rs. 12 billion. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I cannot be giving free education here. You can ask your Colleague, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha de Silva what the exact position is. I am not C.W.W. Kannangara giving economic education to UNP MPs, because it is very clear. It is absolutely clear. Please consult the person who knows something about this. It has never been the position of the UNP that you should not invest EPF, ETF

monies in the stock market at all. That is an incorrect statement, I believe, of the UNPs position. We can argue whether this is a reasonable placement, whether this is a misguided placement or whether this is a brilliant placement; we can have a debate on that. But, on the issue of whether this should be done or not, I believe, you all and the Government are in one - that astute and prudent investment is certainly possible.

And, quite apart from what has happened, I strongly believe and I tell you, that we should do this because we are investing in Sri Lankan companies in a most manifest manner through the Colombo Stock Exchange. That is a way which many countries follow: when there are captive funds, instead of perpetuating a low-interest regime for those people, we try to find something more for them. So, we have nothing to hide. When there are problems, let those be attended to in the legal process. We have no objection. But, I strongly object to this cacophony, the constant harping on this when I have given a good answer. Please read the answer, which is now available in the Library. A comprehensive answer was given to your Leader. I must say that your Leader, especially after I mentioned about the Greece Bonds, said that he was perfectly satisfied. So, either you are having a big problem with your Leader or you are not doing your homework. - [Interruption.] But, please do not bring it to this House. Thank you.

[2.38 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for the opportunity given to speak on the Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report - 2012. Unfortunately, the Mover of the Motion only mentioned the title of the Motion, but spoke on everything other than the subject matter he was moving on and has disappeared after that. Nevertheless, we will use the time wisely and look at the Report dated 29th of June, 2012, which was tabled in this House

Firstly, I would like to draw the attention of the House, mostly of Opposition MPs and one Minister, to the fact that Section 10 of Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003 requires a Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report to be tabled and in Section 12 of that Act, the matters that must be contained in the Report are set out. Section 12(e) very specifically refers to such other statements which may be necessary to reflect fairly, the financial position of the Government in respect of the first four months of such financial year and I shall endeavour to point out that this Report before us, falls short of what is required under the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003.

Secondly, I would like to highlight the fact that Table 1.13, where the allocations provided by the Treasury for Recurrent and Capital Expenditures have been set out - which begins at page 19 of this Report and runs through up to page 25 - shows a total allocation of Rs. 8.4 billion for Capital Expenditure. Although there are many items - 185 items - listed in that, there is one item that is

outstanding and that is Item No. 176, the Ministry of Civil Aviation, which had a Capital Expenditure of Rs. 2.2 billion. Out of Rs. 8.4 billion, one item accounts for Rs. 2.2 billion and that is categorized as "Capitalization of SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Lanka Airlines". Basically, the Treasury has allocated these funds, which are said to be Capital Expenditure, in actual fact, to bailout those two institutions that have incurred heavy losses over the last few years. In order to keep them afloat, this money has been allocated by the Treasury. So, the highlight of the Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report- 2012 seems to be this particular amount, which is one-fourth of the entire allocation for the first four months and is to bailout those two loss-making enterprises.

Thirdly, I would like to bring to the notice of this House, certain important features that concern the North and the East. On page 3 of the Report under the title Government Revenue, it is stated, I quote:

"The revenue from excise duty also recorded a moderate growth during this period with the increase in the taxes on liquor, cigarettes and tobacco and the enhanced demand stemming from the improved tourism related activities, new markets in Northern and Eastern Provinces, the increase in motor vehicle imports

This is repeated on page 6, where it again states, I quote:

Revenue from excise duty on cigarettes and tobacco increased by 9.6 per cent generating Rs. 21,753 million during the first five months of 2012 compared to the Rs. 19,846 million generated in the same period of 2011. Increase of excise duty on cigarettes and tobacco on 31.03.2012 and opening up of new markets in Northern and Eastern Provinces were the main reasons behind this increase.

Although they are listed as two separate items on pages 3 and 6, the reasons for the increased revenue - the sale of liquor, cigarettes and tobacco products and the opening up of new markets in the North and the East - seem to be related as well. They are separate as well as related. The new markets in the North and the East and the increased revenue seem to be mainly from the sale of liquor, cigarettes and tobacco and this is a matter that we have been concerned about and spoken about. The consumption of these items, which were at a very low level in the North and the East, has steadily increased and one does not have to be educated on the strategies that are used by the tobacco and liquor industries in promoting the sales of these items. Basically, they target the youth. We know about these strategies; how advertisements are placed. Particularly in the North and the East, a very serious social issue is arising because markets have been opened up, as has been said here - but I am using it in another sense - in front of schools and in areas where the youth gather for recreational activities. That is how higher sales of liquor and tobacco-related products have been obtained in the North and the East and this is not

1735 1736

something we are happy about. This obviously leads to other social issues and welfare measures will have to be taken later with regard to health and so on. So, that is one of the matters that I want to highlight.

The other is with regard to increased markets in the North and the East. It is now well known that the Hon. Minister for External Affairs, on his visit to the United States of America, boasted that in comparison to the national growth of GDP, which is around 7.9 per cent, the North has recorded a growth of 22 per cent. Now, it is known very well that he was actually giving some raw figures related to the Northern Province and was comparing apples with oranges. Such an amateurish attempt at deceit! That has now come to light.

What is worse is that even that 22 per cent raw figure actually includes salaries that are paid to security personnel who are stationed in the North. It is not increased economic activity that has brought about this supposedly phenomenal growth. You start from a low base and certainly after the war ended, it should be high. But here, it is nowhere near that 22 per cent if one takes away the payment of salaries to security personnel who are stationed in the North. On that also, the number of security personnel who are stationed in the North is phenomenal. The Government states untruths. About three months ago, the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence stated that it was only 21,000 soldiers in the North and that it has been reduced to 15,000. From counting the number of Divisions that are being stationed in the Northern Province, one can see through that those are untruths. There are at least 16 Divisions stationed - 14 in the North and two in the East or 16 in the North and two further Divisions in the East - even as at date. That takes the number of security personnel of the Sri Lanka Army alone to much higher than 100,000. Such barefaced untruths will not take the country anywhere because people who visit this country are intelligent. They know to count, they know the formation and can see for themselves. The 51st Division welcomes you and then says "bye" to you. Then, the 55th Division welcomes you as you travel along those roads and we only do ourselves a great disservice if we conceal the truth. At least by now, after the passage of the Resolution in the UN Human Rights Council on the 23rd of March this year, the Government ought to have come to its senses and begun to be truthful of these matters. If we continue in this way and if we continue to show wrong figures and if we say untruths so blatantly, then surely, there will be consequences and we will not be able to avoid that.

Sir, now look at page 15 of the Report, Table 1.11 talks about WFP Food Assistance. Now, WFP food assistance was given to people in welfare centres, basically Internally Displaced Persons and -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) What is the point of Order? I am at least speaking on the subject matter.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) That should be asked by the Chair, not by you. You have to only stand up and listen.

Sir, this Hon. Member was referring to the Executive, the President, saying that he has told an untruth. He cannot say that in Parliament. He cannot say that.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) If there is anything against the Standing Orders, that will be expunged. You carry on with your speech, Hon. Sumanthiran.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is not a point of Order.- [Interruption.] ( () ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake) Hon. Azwer, you are wasting his time. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) He was not even in the House.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Sumanthiran, you carry on, please. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, the figures of World Food Programme food assistance are given in the Report. As I was saying, World Food Programme food assistance is given to Internally Displaced Persons and I want to bring to the notice of this House, a very serious injustice that is being perpetrated on the Internally Displaced Persons from Sampur who are in four welfare centres. For over six years, they have been kept out of their places.

1737 1738

[ .. ]

2012 20

The matter was raised in this House in November last year by my Party Leader and an undertaking was given by the Hon. Minister of Economic Development saying that those persons who do not have to move - apart from those seven families that may be affected due to the coal power plant project - can remain in those welfare centres until they can go back to their original places. But, despite that assurance being given on the Floor of this House, security personnel, the military personnel have been putting pressure on these people to take alternate land. When you say alternate land, these people, each of these families own several acres of land. They have been offered 20 perches to build a small house and move away and live somewhere not able to carry on with their agriculture or their animal husbandry or their fishing activity. There is no way that they can continue and have some livelihood and because they have refused to take alternate places and move, their food assistance which is given by the World Food Programme has been stopped from January this year. Nothing has been given to them. One of our Members who have been elected to the Eastern Provincial Council is an inmate of one of these camps. They complain day in and day out that their food rations have been stopped. This is inhuman. Why is the Government doing such a thing to persons who have been displaced? When they filed a Fundamental Rights application in the Supreme Court, the Deputy Solicitor-General who represented the State gave an undertaking six years ago that these people will be resettled in their original places. Several assurances were given by, including His Excellency the President at that time and most recently, as I said, by the Minister of Economic Development. But, contrary to all of those undertakings, even to undertakings given to the Supreme Court and this House, these people are being pressured to move out and their food has been stopped.

I want to highlight that your Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report proudly presents a figure that the World Food Programme gives this country. It is not money that is expended by this Government. Even the food that is given to these people is an assistance given by the World Food Programme. Even that has been blocked. It is not out of your own coffers that you give this money; it is an assistance that comes from outside. But, merely in order to achieve some political end of yours, merely in order to punish these people, you have stopped these food rations and then you have the temerity to present this Report to this House.

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) ?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) . I am thankful that the Hon. Minister of Industry and Commerce has clarified from me the question and I hope he will be able to do something about this with your Cabinet Colleagues and ensure that these people are given what is due.

Then, Sir, I want to highlight page 18 where human resource development and education is mentioned and a figure of Rs. 10 billion is given as having been spent in the first four months. Now, there is a serious crisis today in this country. It is only 1.8 per cent of the GDP that has been allocated for education. The academics are on strike for the third month. One of their serious demands is that at least 6 per cent of the GDP must be allocated for education. It is less than 2 per cent that the Government has allocated. We have not had a situation like this before running for three months. All the university trade unions are on strike not just for salary increases for themselves, not for demands of themselves, but for the change in the policy in education, for greater allocation of funding for education, for which all of us must support.

Surely, human resource development is an important aspect for the development of this country. If one is looking ahead, this is the area that requires much greater investment than the money that is presently being spent or is being wasted away for. If one looks at the Table that I referred to earlier of the Capital Expenditure, apart from Rs. 2.2 billion on Mihin Lanka and SriLankan Airlines, almost every other expenditure is on purchase of motor vehicles for some Ministry or the other. That is all. Capital Expenditure is purchase of motor vehicles. So much has been expended, but the Government is still unwilling to give a commitment of an increase. All right, they are asking for a 6 per cent increase. At least, give a commitment of an increase up to 3, 4 or 5 per cent, but there is nothing. In these three months, there has been no commitment from the Government to give even a marginal increase in the allocation of money for education or to address its mind properly to the policy on education.

Finally, I want to refer to page 32 of this Report on the stock market. It concedes - well, if there is a stock market - that there is a charade that goes on there and there is no really activity.

As has been already said, two Chairpersons of the Securities and Exchange Commission whom you appointed have resigned in disgust: one is a very close family member of a high-ranking Civil Servant of this country - his wife resigned. Then, your hand-picked person, Mr. Thilak Karunaratne has resigned and said there is highway robbery that is taking place in the stock market. Your own appointee says that publicly and that is the reason why you say that there is relatively lower performance. You have disclosed the relatively lower performance but that is not the point, whether it is lower performance now or whether it is bullish or bearish as the Hon. Minister was pleased to say a little while ago. The point is that there is highway robbery going on; that there

1739 1740

is purchasing and dumping of stocks that is taking place. There is a mafia that is controlling the stock exchange. I am not saying this, but the person who recently resigned from the post of Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission said he is unable to investigate the seventeen stockbrokers, the seventeen companies that are involved in this huge fraud that is ongoing to date. He has said that.

Surely, your own person saying that has not shocked the conscience of this Government; I do not think anything will shock the conscience of this Government. But, it has shocked the conscience of the country. People are able to see through the kind of fraud that is being perpetrated, the level of corruption that is going on. And, so as we discuss the Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report 2012, it is important to see beyond what is in print in this Report to see where the country is actually heading in terms of financial performance, in terms of financial accountability and with regard to the North and the East. I want to come back to that. It is not a matter for the Government to boast and say that there is increased economic activity while the quality of life of those people has not changed one bit.

You are able to build roads; you are able to build bridges. But, that is not development at all. That is merely construction; that is merely concrete or mortar and bricks. That does not build up the peoples lives. It is time now for the Government, even at this late stage, to change course and to listen to the people. When I say, "listen to the people", Government ought to have listened to the democratic voice of the Eastern Province that was delivered just over a week ago where the people of the Eastern Province very clearly spoke up. There was an administration of the UPFA for the last four years and at the election, they defeated the UPFA. The UPFA was able to win only 12 out of 35 seats. It was a clear defeat for the UPFA. But, democracy has been violated; democracy has been skewed and the UPFA has been able to supposedly form a Government again in the Eastern Province. That is violence done to democracy. You are not listening to the voice of the people of the Eastern Province and you will reap the results of such an action very soon.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I want to quickly refer to some comments made by the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama earlier today, that the Leader of the Opposition had accepted the explanations that he had given to the questions asked by the Leader of the Opposition on the stock exchange. He said that the Leader of the Opposition had been satisfied with his answers, which was completely misleading the House because the Leader of the Opposition himself, on an earlier occasion, had categorically stated that the answers were not received to the questions that were asked.

I would also like to say that the Hon. Amunugama said that they had nothing to hide of what is happening in the stock market. I am not going to elaborate on that but the very fact that they have replaced the Chairman of the SEC and their trying to stop the investigations into some of the share transactions and companies is evidence of the fact that there is much to hide. Also, I would like to bring to the attention of the Chair that the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, today complained to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption to investigate into the affairs of the stock exchange. Now, I would like to come to todays topic very quickly.

"2012 " . . , . " " .

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. (Mrs.) Sriyani Wijewickrama to take the Chair? ( ) (The Hon. Bandula Gunawardane) I propose that the Hon. (Mrs.) Sriyani Wijewickrama do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

, , 6 . . . I would like to make just another important point, which has been referred to by previous speakers and that is about the connection between the law and the economy.

Earlier this week, the Determination on the Divineguma Bill was conveyed by the Supreme Court to Parliament, that it has to be referred to the provincial councils. But, on the same day, we saw a demonstration at which very important Ministers of the Government, including the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, were present. It is intriguing to know whether that was some kind of a spontaneous demonstration. It is also important to know what the intention of that demonstration was and the reason for there to be such a reaction suddenly when the Supreme Court, under the provisions of the Constitution, had made a Determination. I am glad to see the Hon. Minister of Justice in the House and if he is due to speak later today, he might respond to some of the questions we are posing in the House as to why such a situation arose. Maybe, we might hear that from the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa himself, who has come into the Chamber.

There is a connection between good governance, law and the economy. There have been three major studies that have been done recently by three groups of economists. The first was done by Dani Rodrik of the Harvard University, Aravind Subramaniam and Francesco Trebbi. Dani Rodrik says that respecting the rule of law is necessary to create a just society and prosper growth. That is not a new revelation. The second study was done by Daniel Kaufmann and Aart Kray and the third one was done by two Italian economists. What is clearly stated is that there is a connection between good governance, law, prosperity and economic growth. But, long ago, Adam Smith said this, which I quote from W.A. Wijewardena's column "My View" that appeared in the "Daily FT" of 28th May, 2012.

The judge should not be liable to be removed from his office according to the caprice of that power. The regular payment of his salary should not depend upon the good-will or even the good economy of that power.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have one minute more.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Okay, I will conclude. The article goes on to state, I quote: So, according to Smith, even when an economy is in recession, judges salaries should be assured.

This was written by Smith long ago. Thus, the theoretical prognosis that both Adam Smith and Kautilya actually spoke about has been proven recently. My major point is that good governance requires an independent Judiciary and independence from the Executive. When Parliament, the Judiciary and the Executive work independently of each other, then there will be good governance as well as sustainable economic prosperity in this country.

Thank you.

Hon. Sumanthiran, you have even mixed up the figures. It is 14 seats for the Government, the UPFA. You said it is 12. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I said it is 12 out of 35. You were not listening. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) I was listening. Twelve out of 35 is not the important operative word. We had 14 Members elected for the UPFA. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, 12 were elected and two were appointed. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Appointed? I think you have got the entire democratic process mixed up. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) According to you, even in Britain there is no democratic government because that is a coalition Government. Hon. Sumanthiran, your percentages and your over-and-above calculations do not operate within the democratic process where bonus seats are ensured in order to give stability to those who get elected. That is the democratic process. You are working out recipes for instability for your purpose. That is not the purpose - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I did not make any mistake. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Anyway, your purpose will not be served. Fourteen seats were won with the seats of the Muslim Congress and the seat of the Hon. Wimal Weerawansas Party. We have the majority which we have formed and if you say

1771 1772

that this is a violation of democracy, you must be in the moon. You must be in the moon to find your own democracy -[Interruption.] There is no point in cross talk. You had your say; I am saying that your democratic specimen which you are nurturing in your own thoughts maybe something that is not in this world and if that is what you want, it is only because your separatist ideology has become so thoroughly defeated and therefore, you are pulling - [Interruption.] That is why you have to raise this kind of red herring out of a matter where the convincing victory of the UPFA is denied by you - [Interruption.] No, no there is no change. I am only telling you that your separatist ideology has been rejected by a large number of Tamil people who voted against you. Your separatist ideology has been rejected.

Now, I come to my next point. Pillayan, our former Chief Minister had obtained the highest number of the votes on the UPFA list and we are very proud about it. The Tamil people voted for us. More than 30 per cent of the Tamil people voted for us rejecting your separatist ideology. That is only the beginning; you must remember that that is only the beginning. You will see the results in the next stage when you will have to ultimately wind up with very much less than what you have got. That is my - .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We got 67,000 more votes than in 2010 and you got 53,000 less.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) All that is true. But, a large number of Tamil people voted with us and that is the beginning of the end of your story of separatism.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We got 300,000 votes in 2008 and you got 200,000. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Yes, we have got less. We have always forward movements and backward movements; that is how the world is. We have always got forward and backward movements in any process. But, you will find that your movement ultimately ends up in your separatism which ultimately is bankrupt, which you are - [Interruption.] You are disturbing me continuously. Sir, he is disturbing me continuously. That is not what he should be doing. He cannot be disturbing me continuously. I am fully entitled to say he has a separatist ideology and I tell him that he has one, and that can be seen in the speeches made at the most profound moments of their conferences.

. , kleptocracy " " . Wikipedia kleptocracy " " . Sir, it states, I quote: Kleptocracy, alternatively cleptocracy or kleptarchy, rule by thieves is a form of political and government corruption where the government exists to increase the personal wealth and political power of its officials and the ruling class at the expense of the wider population, often without pretense of honest service. This type of government corruption is often achieved by the embezzlement of state funds Sir, it goes on to explain the characteristics of Kleptocracy: "Kleptocracies are generally associated with corrupt forms of authoritarian governments, particularly dictatorships, oligarchies, military juntas, or some other forms of autocratic and nepotist government in which no outside oversight is possible, due to the ability of the kleptocrats to personally control both the supply of public funds and the means of determining their disbursal. Kleptocratic rulers typically treat their countrys treasury ...." This is very important for us. ".... as through it were their own personal bank account, spending the funds on luxury goods as they see fit. Many kleptocratic rulers also secretly transfer public funds into secret personal numbered bank accounts in foreign countries in order to provide them with continued luxury. Kleptocracy is most common in developing countries. And, as you know Sri Lanka is also a developing country. Such incomes constitute a form of economic rent and are therefore easier to siphon off without causing the income itself to decrease. An early phase of this is driven by tenderpreneur ..." not entrepreneurs but tenderpreneurs.

"....who seek to capture resources for personal benefit. The effects of a kleptocratic regime or government on a nation are typically adverse in regards to the faring of he states economy, political affairs and civil rights. Kleptocracy in government often vitiates prospects of foreign investment and drastically weakens the domestic market and cross-border trade. As the kleptocracy normally embezzles money from its citizens by misusing funds derived from tax payments, or money laundering schemes..." - which I will come to later. "...a kleptocratically structured political system tends to degrade nearly everyones quality of life. In addition, the money that kleptocrats steal is often taken from funds that were earmarked for public amenities, such as the building of hospitals, schools, roads, parks and the like - which has further adverse effects on the quality of life of the citizens living under a kleptocracy.

[6.56 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Presiding Member, I am very happy that the Adjournment Motion I moved early in the day has evinced a lot of interest from both sides of the House. I should say that very irrelevant things were said from the Opposition. My Friend, the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, said that I referred to the Judiciary. I did not mean any disrespect to the Judiciary. We uphold the judgments, the principles, the honour and the supremacy of the Judiciary and we do not deviate from that. But, they are the people who are making use of Judiciary in order to throw mud at the Government. Therefore, Sir, I have to indicate our Government's position by saying that.

Sir, the Mid-year Fiscal Position Report - 2012, which I presented formally, has not been -

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Hon. Member, I just need a clarification. This is the Adjournment Motion. As far as the Adjournment Motion is concerned, there is no -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The right of reply is there. - [Interruption.]

Sir, under the caption "Government Revenue", the Mid-Year Fiscal Position Report- 2012 states, I quote:

"The Government revenue during January-May 2012 period amounted to Rs. 386,655 million........" - [Interruption.]

Sir, I have the right to reply. - [Interruption.] No, Sir, there is nothing in the Standing Orders to stop it. As the Mover of the Adjournment Motion, which I moved early in the day, I have the right to reply. - [Interruption.] The Report goes on to state, I quote:

... recording a 9.1 per cent increase over the corresponding period of 2011. Tax revenue increased by 11.9 per cent to Rs. 353,314 million -" - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Mr. Azwer, in any debate, no Member can speak twice. But, this is an Adjournment Motion. So -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, this is an Adjournment Motion, the Mover of which, if he wants, has the right to speak again as a matter of clarification and that has been allowed by the Chair. Then, Sir, the Report further states, I quote:

.... while non-tax revenue reflected a decline of 13.4 per cent -

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Kumara) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera was speaking so much about roads. I will quote from this Report. I think he must take it home and read it over and over again. Under the caption "Spending on Development Programmes, Roads", the Report states, I quote:

The investment on national roads was around Rs. 36,894 million during the period of January-May 2012."

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! Hon. Azwer, there is a point of Order being raised. Yes, Hon. Ajith Kumara?

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Kumara) , . . [ ] .

( ) (The Presiding Member) Adjournment Motion . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay, Sir.

The Report goes on to state, I quote:

1817 1818

2012 20

This includes Rs. 11,363 million on expressway development and Rs. 17,526 million on development of highways islandwide. Meanwhile, Rs. 6,943 million on widening and improving national roads, Rs. 294 million on construction of bridges and flyovers and Rs. 768 million on tsunami affected road rehabilitation had been incurred during this period." ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Azwer, your time is up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, please give me one more minute. The Report goes on to state, I quote:

In addition, Rs. 8,939 million spent for the development of Provincial roads. Also under the Maga Neguma and Gama Neguma programmes, Rs. 1,715 million and Rs. 2,800 million were spent respectively, for the development of rural roads."

Sir, they were raising a question about the Divineguma Bill. Yesterday, before His Excellency left the Island, he referred that to the Provincial Councils. According to the judgment of the Judiciary, he had acted. Therefore, we need not worry about it. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Please wind up.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, of course, sees a ghost sitting on every road and bridge.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Azwer, you have to conclude now.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) , , . , . . [ ] .

( ) (The Presiding Member) Now, the House has to adjourn, Hon. Azwer. Thank you.
