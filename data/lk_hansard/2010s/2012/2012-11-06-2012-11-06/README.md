QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

LAND LEASED TO KRRISH GROUP

( - )

(The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Deputy Speaker, the media reported that a four-acre plot of land in Fort had been leased to the Krrish Group of India for commercial purposes under a lease payment of Rs. 5 billion for 99 years by the Urban Development Authority.

It must be noted that the Transworks House property, the former Public Works Department Building, includes a building with archaeological value. Already, the Krrish Group has put notices and billboards up in the City and they are calling for money to be invested in this venture.

A Joint Memorandum submitted to Cabinet states that 134 perches leased by the Central Bank and another 137 perches leased by the Peoples Leasing Property Development Limited, a subsidiary of Peoples Bank were cancelled by the UDA to make it available to the Krrish Group. In accordance with the Cabinet decision, the investors, namely the Krrish Group, had agreed to pay 20 per cent of the lease premium of Rs. 5 billion, that is Rs. 1 billion, within 7 days of setting up the Sri Lankan company. The Krrish Group had also agreed to pay the balance 80 per cent, that is Rs. 4 billion, on signing the lease agreement. We also note that the proposed project will cost US Dollars 450 million to 500 million in addition to the lease rental of Rs. 5 billion.

We request the Hon. Minister to inform the House: As per the Cabinet Paper, was the 20 per cent lease payment of Rs. 1 billion remitted to the account of the Sri Lankan Government? Was the 80 per cent, that is Rs.4 billion, of the balance payment remitted on signing of the agreement? How was the Krrish Group selected? What were the criteria for awarding the development project?

There have been public criticisms that a prime property in Colombo is given on a 99-year lease without advertising through the media. It appears that publicity has been confined only to a website advertisement. The Cabinet Paper does not refer to the process of inviting proposals and makes no mention of media publicity.

Fort is primarily a commercial and administrative zone with only a few houses such as the Presidents House.

The Krrish Group proposal appears to be primarily residential. Has the project been approved by changing the classification of the zone? Who are the beneficial owners of the Krrish Group? What is their business and relevant experience to undertake the said project? What is

1119 1120

2012 06

the capital structure of the parent company and subsidiary undertaking the project? Who are the Directors?

We request the information and agreements between the UDA, the BOI and the Krrish Group and its subsidiaries to be tabled in the House.

Is the Central Bank still involved in the project? If so, under what provisions in the law? What are the names, designations and places of work of the persons or officers who evaluated and negotiated this project?

They have also stated - I think you must be having information - that they are planning to develop a second property in Hambantota.

Thank you.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I thank you Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees for affording me time to participate in this Adjournment Motion.

The Hon. Minister of Technology and Research who spoke before me referred to 12,000 LTTE cadres who had been rehabilitated and been released. As I begin this speech, I must congratulate the Government for what they have done with those 12,000 LTTE cadres. We have said this before also in this House. I myself have said it twice before. That is an act that we have readily acknowledged as a good forward-looking action of the Government. Even those who were involved in the last battle, once they had surrendered after the fighting was over, were given rehabilitation for a period of about two years. We have even previously commended the type of rehabilitation that was afforded to them. It was a very good programme and this is yet another opportunity to place on record the TNA's stand with regard to the rehabilitation and release of those persons.

Having said that, one of our other concerns have been, whilst the Government has done the right thing with regard to those who surrendered, not just 100 or 200 but 12,000 of them, there are still many who are in prisons under the Prevention of Terrorism Act for several years; some for more than 10 years not accused of actually bearing arms and fighting the State but for having helped the LTTE by giving a parcel of food, by selling two coconuts somewhere, by not giving information to the police and for a variety of such offences which have not even been taken to court. Some, whose cases are pending for several years are in remand for several years. There are others who are convicted for 38 to 50 years, but all for helping the LTTE. This does not seem right. This is of concern and this is an opportune moment for us to place before the Government and ask the question, - when you have done the right thing and when you have boldly released even those who fought in the final battle which is a creditable thing - why are you not able to deal with these persons who were merely helpers? Sometimes they had no choice in the matter. Sometimes, they were forced to cut a trench somewhere. That kind of person is still languishing in prison. I appeal to the Government today in the context of this Motion to think about those persons in prison. There is absolutely no justification for continuing to keep them in prison when you have released 12,000 combatants. It is because those persons are continuing to be held in prisons that we lost two lives that of Nimalaruban and Dilrukshan a few months ago. I am not in any way justifying the conduct of those prisoners in taking the jailers hostage.

That was wrong. But, the point that I am making is, even that happened because they have been languishing in prison for so long totally unjustifiably and we lost two valuable lives. With regard to the persons mentioned in the Motion, that is one of the things that the Government must address its mind to.

The Hon. Minister who spoke before me referred to the TNA and said that TNA is getting excited because KP is being used for development work in Kilinochchi. The TNA need not get excited about that at all. Even in the recently-concluded Eastern Provincial Council Election, 11 out of 12 Tamils who were elected were from the TNA. Our people have constantly and consistently reposed their faith in us. Therefore, there is nothing for us to get excited about and we will continue to do so. But, one thing that the Government must take into account is the fact that they must also respect the democratic verdict of the Tamil people. They must learn to deal with the people who are elected by the people and they must not make deals with persons who are accused of crimes all over the world and who are wanted by the Interpol and various other forces around the world. - [Interruption.] No. You have not rehabilitated. That is the other point. You have put into place a very good rehabilitation programme for the 12,000 persons and I have looked at

that manual. It is a very good programme but others including the Hon. Deputy Minister seated there have not been subject to rehabilitation. Why have they been exempted from rehabilitation? He would have been benefited through a rehabilitation process. He would have been a better man for that. But, why have you not given him what you have given to those 12,000 people? That is the question. You subject them to rehabilitation and if they are rehabilitated, then that is a different matter. But, these are persons who have money in their hands. It is natural for people to ask questions why so many 800 or 900 people are languishing in prisons for 10 years and more whilst this kind of person who has access to large sums of money is being released without any charges. Naturally, questions will be asked. So, the Government must be careful. You do not want to work with elected representatives of the people and that is a bad sign. Even if you do not like the TNA, you must recognize the fact that Tamil people continue to elect the TNA. So, you must work with them.

Now, for the Northern Provincial Council, two names are being promoted. Unfortunately, both those persons are wanted criminals in India. Both those persons that the Government thinks of putting forward as candidates for chief ministership from the UPFA, are wanted criminals in India. Why do you want to foist such criminals as leaders of the Tamil people? The people elect whom they choose; the people elect the right people. So, why do you not work with the elected representatives rather than bringing persons with criminal records not just in the country but internationally and foist them as the leaders for the Tamil people? The Government must cease to practice this and I support the Motion that has been moved by the Hon. Member from Matara.

Thank you.

[5.30 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I welcome this opportunity to speak on an Adjournment Motion that seeks to strengthen the Rule of Law in Sri Lanka. This is an admirable aim, and I will give the Mover of this Motion the benefit of the doubt, and treat that as his principal aim. It would be a pity if we allowed ourselves to be distracted, in discussing this matter, by efforts to make petty political points, as he seemed to do in his speech, or rather his performance.

Unfortunately, much of the text of the Motion brought before this House deals with the aftermath of terrorism, and goes against one of the most important principles in the administration of justice, graphically expressed by Shakespeare in the lines And earthly power doth then show likest Gods When mercy seasons justice.

That was the principle the Government decided to adopt in dealing with former combatants. In fact, whereas earlier it had thought three of the seven categories into which the former LTTE combatants were divided might be prosecuted, it has released almost all of them. Just a few in the category of the most committed remain in custody, but most of them will soon be released. While the majority of these were conscripts - the sympathy with which we have dealt with them is understandable - the Government also decided to send for rehabilitation rather than prosecution, many of those detained on suspicion of terrorism before the conflict concluded. So, while I agree with the Hon. Member from the TNA about the need for quicker resolution of their cases, I also say that what has already been done should be recognized. That is why the Task Force monitoring the implementation of the LLRC Action Plan should have a website to set down what has been achieved as well as a timeline for future action. But, in such a context, to go on and on about extradition with regard to a particular case smacks of cynicism. It betrays an unwillingness to move forward and suggests a very old-fashioned approach to justice.

Sadly, we still have elements amongst those in authority with regard to the law, who see justice as retribution, and incarceration as the way to deal, not just with those guilty of minor as well as major offences, but even with those under suspicion. As we found when looking at protecting the rights of children, we still have mindsets springing from the old British Poor Laws system. In the old days, it was a crime to be poor and incarceration was the remedy. Even recently, we had an instance of a child being tried for reportedly stealing a pigeon. That is not, Sir, what we mean by the Rule of Law. What we mean is, equity as well as justice, mercy and reform, not retribution.

This has indeed been one of the main problems in promoting prison reform, as we found when the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka had a consultation on the matter last month. At that meeting, it was suggested we needed the following measures to limit the numbers remanded, namely, (a) Legislative changes to expand the number of bailable offences; (b) Guidelines to the police to work in terms of bailable offences where possible and recommend bail; (c) Guidelines to magistrates to allow bail whenever possible; (d) Guidelines to magistrates to ensure that records are kept of all those remanded, with reminders when they should be produced again and rulings that limit continuing remand for no good reason; (e) Guidelines to magistrates not to allow postponements except for good reason with the JSC maintaining records of statistics of case completion by magistrates.

I have been writing about these matters to the Judiciary since the beginning of this year, but their responses tended to be cursory, and they did not see themselves as responsible for finding solutions. I suppose in every political dispensation, it is difficult to ensure accountability in the Judiciary, but this must be done if only by requesting them to make clear the procedures and guidelines that are to be followed, and to make these available to the public.

I have written accordingly to the Presidential Secretariat, noting that, while the independence of the Judiciary must be sacrosanct in terms of the judgments they deliver, they must be subject to rules of procedure that are consistent and transparent. I can only hope then that the present discussion, about ensuring norms of conduct for the Judiciary, will establish principles through a process of consultation and consensus rather than confrontation.

There is another area I should mention, where I believe, we can do more to strengthen the Rule of Law, but where we are certainly not moving in the right direction. When I was Secretary to the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights and chaired a Committee on Police Training, some of the senior police officials who were on that Committee accused me of being negative about the police. Indeed, I was negative, for I felt a serious lack of professionalism in the police in general, unlike in the army, which contributed to the breakdown of law and order we experienced when terrorism lurked round any corner. But, I found that even then the senior police officials were worried about the decline in training and the shortening of courses because of the increasing need for personnel.

They noted that it was not just training in human rights, as I advocated, that was needed, but also training in investigation, interrogation and prosecution.

In the last few months, however, I have seen a remarkable transformation in the police, and it would be churlish not to record the seminal contribution of the

Inspector-General of Police in reviving a sense of professionalism. Officers in the North and the East have responded magnificently to the expectations imposed. At almost all Divisional Secretariat Reconciliation meetings I have attended in recent months, special mention has been made of the good relations between the police and the community. Whether this is true in other parts of the country or not, I cannot say, but the change from a couple of years ago is remarkable. I hope, however, that this professionalism extends also to the areas the senior police mentioned four years ago, namely investigation and interrogation, because there are still too many cases of significance where no leads have been found. This is not good enough and it would be sad if inadequacies with regard to a few cases took away the generally good record, in particular in the North.

Sir, as our National Human Rights Action Plan makes clear and as the Action Plan formulated with regard to the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission also indicates, we have a long way to go to reach an ideal situation. But, the same is true of many other countries too and not all of them have suffered as we did from vicious terrorism. If we consider the situation now in comparison to what we were suffering four years ago, we have much to be thankful for. Systemic change is essential, given the rapid decline of so many of our institutions in the 30 years before that. But, in pursuing such change, let us also remember the dark night from which we have emerged and the much better situation we are in today than we were four years ago.

Thank you.

The grant or denial of extradition is very much a part of sovereign discretion of States. We must appreciate that there is no duty to grant extradition. Extradition is granted where substantial and procedural legal requisites are satisfied in the larger interests of friendly international relations, more often than not, requests maybe in the context of suppressing or combating transnational crimes. It is also the case that where extradition is refused, it could in some instances lead to an adverse political fallout on the bilateral relationship between the requesting and requested States. My Friend, the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, certainly knows the sensitivities involved in the diplomatic relations between countries in such circumstances and this Motion is in a sense somewhat mischievous in that it seeks to imply as if we are reluctant to grant an extradition request in a specified case. I hope I have made it clear in explaining that though there is no bilateral extradition treaty between India and Sri Lanka, there is room to make an application through our courts for extradition of any individual as a commonwealth country.

The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara also adverted to, in his speech, the manner in which the operation to capture KP was carried out and that is something that we must certainly record here in this Debate. The arrest and rendition of KP from a location in a third country with a daring, precise, co-ordinated operation with intelligence operatives in a third country is a remarkably successful covert operation without a murmur about violating the sovereignty of a third country unlike some other operations, which has resulted in strained relations among certain countries. However much a fugitive may be a wanted man, you cannot violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a third country. We have not resorted to covert rendition operation using secret locations and moving suspects for interrogation in a third country. We have done this totally legally and without violating the sovereignty of a third country. Having brought KP here, we have interrogated him; we have continued to investigate matters concerning very sensitive information and have taken a responsible decision to -

( )

(The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Hon. Minister, what I really want to find out is whether Mr. K. Padmanathan is a free man because the Hon. Muralidaran, a little while ago, said that he has been given a pardon.

1201 1202

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, in the first place, to give somebody a pardon, he must be convicted. There must be charges brought against him. The Government has not decided to bring any charges. We have not proceeded - [Interruption.] No. It is quite apparent that there were no charges brought against him.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) If there are no charges, that means he is a free man. Is he a free man?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) So far, the Government has not charged him for any matter but we have continued to -

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) After the rendition in Thailand or Malaysia, he was brought back to Colombo and even according to the information published on a website on 7th of August, 2009, which I quoted during my speech, we were all told that he had been arrested on certain charges.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Out of all those who surrendered and arrested, there were many who have been rehabilitated.

So, there is nothing wrong in rehabilitating -

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) We have nothing against rehabilitation. But, please tell us what the status of K. Padmanathan is?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) KP was brought as a fugitive and then he was interrogated. We have decided so far not to bring out any charges. There are several others of similar nature who have been rehabilitated and allowed to lead normal lives .

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Hon. Minister, but he is a man who has been arrested on very serious charges. Now, we are being told that he has no charges. Who decided that? Which court of law?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) It is not a question of a court of law. It is up to the Attorney-General to consider - [Interruption.] You must understand. After interrogating a man, whether to rehabilitate him or to charge him is a decision that has to be taken by the Attorney-General. But, no such decision has been taken.
