    "text": "[2.46 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I join the Hon. Leader of the House in expressing my condolences on the passing away of the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja. The Hon. Shelton Ranaraja was one of the best examples we have had as a Member of this House. He entered the House with a high reputation for he was also the son of Mr. P.B. Ranaraja, Member of the State Council and many Members of the State Council were held in high esteem. They put their public duty ahead of their private concerns. So, when the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja entered the House, not only did he have the record of his father but when he left this House and thereafter in private life, he even gained in stature and that, Sir, I would say, is the main contribution of the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja. When we first knew, he was a firebrand in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party who crossed over in 1964 to vote against the Hon. (Mrs.) Bandaranaikes Government on the Press Bill but he subsequently left politics and Senkadagala Seat was represented by Mr. Noel Wimalasena. In 1972-1973, Mr. Wimalasena decided that he would not be contesting the next election. Therefore, the then Leader of our Party, the Hon. J.R. Jayewardene, as the Leader of the Opposition invited the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja to be our organizer and candidate for Senkadagala. He was a very good grass-roots organizer. I remember him prior to the 1977 Elections when we used to go around the country and I must say that the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja was a good grass-roots organizer at a strong organization and he joined us in the National Lawyers Association. He used to be there at every by-election, ready to go and man a polling booth and spend the night in that area itself. That was his dedication and after the elections, he and I both joined the Government as Deputy Ministers. He was the Deputy Minister of Justice and I was the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.",

(Mrs.) Sirima Bandaranaike on several issues, particularly on the press takeover. He refused to vote on it and thereafter, he resigned from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. That was how he sacrificed his position as a Member of Parliament. Thereafter, the late President J.R. Jayewardene invited him, somewhere in 1972, to join the United National Party and contest the Senkadagala seat from the UNP camp. He fared very well at that election; he obtained a majority of over 5,000 votes. That shows the popularity he enjoyed during that period for the principles he adhered to and followed. Thereafter, he was appointed as Deputy Minister of Justice and continued in that office. Even within the UNP, he did not agree with certain proposals put forward by the Party, particularly on the ethnic issue and again on another occasion, he resigned. That is the type of politician the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja was. He was a person who did not want to hold positions for the sake of holding those, but lived for the high standard of principles. He was an example to all politicians as to how a politician should shape up his life. According to these details in the Motion, he was educated at the St. Thomas College and during his tenure as a student, he indulged in sports. He had obtained colours and represented Sri Lanka on one or two occasions; he was a sportsman. Thereafter, I am told, he was the President of the Kandy Sports Club. He also did a lot of social service under the \"Gam Udawa\" programme of the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa. He was responsible for developing a number of villages around Kandy. Therefore, he was highly respected by the people as an honest and a hardworking politician. I was very sorry to hear of his demise not long ago. He was a politician to be reckoned with.",

Shelton Ranaraja was held in the highest esteem by all his Parliamentary Colleagues irrespective of party affiliations. He was, if I might say so, Sir, a quintessential gentleman, a gentleman not merely in personal life, but also a gentleman, a perfect gentleman with impeccable qualities in his political life. He was held in the highest esteem by all the political leaders of the day whether it was President J.R. Jayewardene, Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Prime Minister R. Premadasa, the late Hon. Maithripala Senanayake or the Hon. A. Amirthalingam, to mention a few of the leaders who were also in the 1977 Parliament and whom we saw interacting with the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja and according him the highest respect. The Hon. Shelton Ranaraja always stood for the truth, for equality and justice.",

Amirthalingam was the Leader of the Opposition in the 1977 Parliament. There was a Vote of No-Confidence moved by the Government against the Hon. Amirthalingam, the Leader of the Opposition. I think that was the first time in the history of Parliamentary politics that a Government wanted to move a Vote of No-Confidence against a Leader of the Opposition. The Hon. Shelton Ranaraja, though a junior Minister and a Member of the Government, refused to vote in support of that Motion. He conveyed his unwillingness to act against his conscience to his leadership and I think his leadership, recognizing the Hon. Shelton Ranarajas character, would not permit a compromise against his conviction, relented, and the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja was able to refrain on that Vote though there was a compulsion for all the Government Members to vote in support of the Motion. I can well remember the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja refused to support that Motion and he refrained from voting, much to the chagrin of some of his Colleagues, who were falling over each other to be even more Catholic than the Bishop and support that Motion. They castigated Mr. Amirthalingam for duly",

There was the anti-Tamil pogrom or perhaps, more appropriately I would call it the anti-Tamil holocaust of July 1983, following which the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution was enacted. When the violence broke out in Colombo, we were in Mannar for our Party Convention. Many of us wanted to come to Colombo. We were advised by the highest people in the Government that it would even be unsafe for us to come to Colombo and we were advised not to come to Colombo. Most of the Members of Parliament of my party did not attend Parliament after July, 1983. I had not attended Parliament from June 1983, on account of some events that took place in my own district. It was at this time that Indias good offices were offered to resolve the conflict in Sri Lanka. Such good offices have been accepted and the late Mr. G. Parathasarathy came to Sri Lanka for the first time as Prime Minister Indira Gandhis Special Envoy in the last week of August, 1983. Mr. Amirthalingam and I who happened to be in India also came down from India and to ensure our security, we were accommodated in a high-security bungalow somewhere around Wijerama Mawatha. I can vividly recall that our good Friend, the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja came to see us. He was gravely concerned that the three-month period of absence was running out and that I, not having attended Parliament from June 1983, would probably lose my Seat in a few weeks unless leave was applied for me and thereafter for the others too. He wanted to be sure that we would continue to be represented in Parliament despite the Sixth Amendment and offered to apply for leave on my behalf and later on for the others. I declined. I refused to give him my consent. Consequently, I lost my Seat in a short while thereafter and so did the other Members of Parliament of the TULF in due course.",

Shelton Ranaraja who hailed from Ranwala, Kegalle, belonged to a distinguished family. He is a man of impeccable character; a man of sterling qualities and of strong will. He called a spade, a spade. We have known that very well. He did not mince his words in politics or in any other matter. He spoke straight. As a result, he fell foul with some of the leaders at that time. When he said, \"I am quitting\", he meant it and did quit, because the political environment was not for his liking at that time.",

He was also very closely associated with our late Speaker, Deshamanya Alhaj M.A. Bakeer Markar. We celebrated the 1400th year of the revelation of the Holy Quran throughout the Island at that time. He was one person who took the foremost place in organizing the people in Kandy, particularly, Senkadagala and had a successful celebration. He was also closely associated with the Hijri anniversary celebrations organized by another former Speaker, Alhaj M.H. Mohamed.

He was a straightforward lawyer, who never betrayed clients at any time. Therefore, Sir, today for all the services that he has rendered to the country, I must say one thing.
