( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, you have not submitted anything in writing, but your Secretary has informed the Hon. Speaker -

1055 1056

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I informed the Hon. Speaker. You can ask my Secretary who also discussed this with him.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, he has informed him, but nothing was submitted in writing.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) He said it is all right; he did not ask for it in writing. There is nothing controversial in what I am going to say, except that I am tabling* our response so that it can be made available in the Library. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Okay, fine. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I have got only a few issues to raise on this. Though I would not be dealing with it in detail here in this House, I just want to mention that when I addressed the House on the 3rd of May last year, I said that the UN Panel Report is a fact, and where appropriate, we have to respond. I find that the Commission has not done so. But, at the same time, we must say that there are many positive recommendations in the Commission Report.

The Government appointed this Commission to get recommendations on the approach to reconciliation. On the 20th of April last year, the UNP stated that any genuine concerted effort by the Government to resolve the national issue would receive the maximum cooperation of the UNP. Further, we stated that there must be a lasting and amicable solution to the grievances of the minority communities. We stand by that position.

The Hon. Leader of the House, in presenting the LLRC Report, read from the Report and said that they unreservedly support the position that there must be willingness on the part of all political parties to give up adversarial politics and have consensual decision making on national issues.

Prior to the letter I sent to the President, the TNA also published its responses to the Report in January this year. There is much common ground between our responses

and the Commission Report. If the Government is serious, this is the time that we all have to get together and work out a solution because democracy is very fragile. Some in this House want Thirteen Plus, others want Development Plus, but I think all of us want Democracy Plus and that is what we are committed to.

I do not think we want what is happening in the Maldives to take place here. I must mention to the House that the President and I have both spoken to President Mohammed Waheed Hassan and President Waheed informed me that they are committed to a democratic reform and they will go ahead with it. But, we all are concerned - I must express in this House - about the safety of the former President Mohamed Nasheed and also the supporters of the Maldivian Democratic Party. Our President himself has spoken with the former President Nasheed. The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, who is here, has also spoken with the former President Nasheed. His family is here and we all are doing our best to ensure that there is normalcy in the Maldives.

At the moment, the SAARC countries, the Commonwealth countries and others, all are there to help defuse the crisis, and I think it is best that all parties in the Maldives co-operate with them. We all want a stable and a prosperous Maldives so that they can work together with all the friendly governments to ensure peaceful settlement as soon as possible.

Thank you.

[2.46 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I join the Hon. Leader of the House in expressing my condolences on the passing away of the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja. The Hon. Shelton Ranaraja was one of the best examples we have had as a Member of this House. He entered the House with a high reputation for he was also the son of Mr. P.B. Ranaraja, Member of the State Council and many Members of the State Council were held in high esteem. They put their public duty ahead of their private concerns. So, when the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja entered the House, not only did he have the record of his father but when he left this House and thereafter in private life, he even gained in stature and that, Sir, I would say, is the main contribution of the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja. When we first knew, he was a firebrand in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party who crossed over in 1964 to vote against the Hon. (Mrs.) Bandaranaikes Government on the Press Bill but he subsequently left politics and Senkadagala Seat was represented by Mr. Noel Wimalasena. In 1972-1973, Mr. Wimalasena decided that he would not be contesting the next election. Therefore, the then Leader of our Party, the Hon. J.R. Jayewardene, as the Leader of the Opposition invited the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja to be our organizer and candidate for Senkadagala. He was a very good grass-roots organizer. I remember him prior to the 1977 Elections when we used to go around the country and I must say that the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja was a good grass-roots organizer at a strong organization and he joined us in the National Lawyers Association. He used to be there at every by-election, ready to go and man a polling booth and spend the night in that area itself. That was his dedication and after the elections, he and I both joined the Government as Deputy Ministers. He was the Deputy Minister of Justice and I was the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.

The Hon. Shelton Ranaraja was an experienced Parliamentarian who devoted his time. I think Justice and Parliament suited him well. He and the Hon. Devanayagam made a good pair as the Minister and the Deputy Minister of Justice, especially in explaining to the House the Bills that were presented and taking them through the Committee Stage. His contribution, as a Parliamentarian was mainly through the Parliamentary associations. He always insisted that we uphold the high standards of Parliament, which had been established long before. He always pulled up Members who he felt had let down the high standards that should be maintained by a Parliamentarian.

It was an exciting period during which we took part in the transformation of the countrys political system and the economic system and the Hon. Ranaraja, like all of us

1069 1070

[ ]

2012 10

who were MPs, had resources at our disposal for the development of the electorate. He did a lot for the Senkadagala Electorate, much of which has been mentioned by the Hon. Leader of the House so that I will not go into it again.

But, he also decided in 1988 that he would leave politics. He informed us; he left politics never to return. He was active in civil society; he was active in many organizations and he expressed his views from time to time in civil society. I must say that he never departed from his principles, which is a rare occurrence in Sri Lankan politics and in Sri Lankan civil life. The time he was in Parliament - from 1977-1988 - was one that all of us remember him, for the contribution he made. We also know that in his own way, he made an impact from 1988 onwards till about a few years ago when he withdrew from public life.

Therefore, I would like our condolences to be conveyed to the members of his family. I would like to mention the services rendered by Mrs. Ranaraja in the Kandy Municipal Council. I will not deal with them at length.

All what I have to say before I end up is, may he attain Nibbana!

Thank you. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The next speaker is the Hon. John Amaratunga. Order, please! Before that, the Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair. , [ ] .

, , [ ] . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair.

[2.51 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I also associate myself with the sentiments expressed by both the Hon. Leader of the House and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. I had the good fortune of associating the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja, former Deputy Minister of Justice. On a number of occasions, I even had the opportunity of accompanying him on some of the trips abroad as delegations representing the United National Party.

Going through the life of the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja, one would always say that he was outspoken and upright as a politician. He always, as stated by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, stuck to his principles. He was originally a Member of Parliament representing the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, but he disagreed with the late Hon. (Mrs.) Sirima Bandaranaike on several issues, particularly on the press takeover. He refused to vote on it and thereafter, he resigned from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. That was how he sacrificed his position as a Member of Parliament. Thereafter, the late President J.R. Jayewardene invited him, somewhere in 1972, to join the United National Party and contest the Senkadagala seat from the UNP camp. He fared very well at that election; he obtained a majority of over 5,000 votes. That shows the popularity he enjoyed during that period for the principles he adhered to and followed. Thereafter, he was appointed as Deputy Minister of Justice and continued in that office. Even within the UNP, he did not agree with certain proposals put forward by the Party, particularly on the ethnic issue and again on another occasion, he resigned. That is the type of politician the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja was. He was a person who did not want to hold positions for the sake of holding those, but lived for the high standard of principles. He was an example to all politicians as to how a politician should shape up his life. According to these details in the Motion, he was educated at the St. Thomas College and during his tenure as a student, he indulged in sports. He had obtained colours and represented Sri Lanka on one or two occasions; he was a sportsman. Thereafter, I am told, he was the President of the Kandy Sports Club. He also did a lot of social service under the "Gam Udawa" programme of the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa. He was responsible for developing a number of villages around Kandy. Therefore, he was highly respected by the people as an honest and a hardworking politician. I was very sorry to hear of his demise not long ago. He was a politician to be reckoned with.

May I extend my condolences to his beloved wife, who was the first Mayor of the Kandy Municipality and all the children who are present here in this House today. May he attain Nibbana!

Thank you.

[2.55 p.m.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am happy to have this opportunity of saying a few words on the Vote of Condolence moved in this House by the Hon. Leader of the House on the demise of the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja, a Member of Parliament for Senkadagala in the Kandy District.

1071 1072

Sir, I had the good fortune of being able to come to Parliament in 1977, when the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja himself was elected from that Constituency to Parliament at the same time. He was also appointed Deputy Minister of Justice in the Government of the late President, His Excellency J. R. Jayewardene. The Hon. Shelton Ranaraja was held in the highest esteem by all his Parliamentary Colleagues irrespective of party affiliations. He was, if I might say so, Sir, a quintessential gentleman, a gentleman not merely in personal life, but also a gentleman, a perfect gentleman with impeccable qualities in his political life. He was held in the highest esteem by all the political leaders of the day whether it was President J.R. Jayewardene, Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Prime Minister R. Premadasa, the late Hon. Maithripala Senanayake or the Hon. A. Amirthalingam, to mention a few of the leaders who were also in the 1977 Parliament and whom we saw interacting with the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja and according him the highest respect. The Hon. Shelton Ranaraja always stood for the truth, for equality and justice.

He was a close friend of the TULF. He had a deep appreciation of the legitimacy of the political aspirations of the Tamil-speaking people, particularly the Tamil people. He was a true friend of the Tamil people. He travelled frequently to the North and also to the East, both before the war and during the war, and personally learnt about the true situation in those areas. He did not hesitate to frankly express his views on the basis of the knowledge he so acquired during those visits.

Sir, I cannot but refer to a few anecdotes that truly display the character of this rare personality, the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja. The Hon. A. Amirthalingam was the Leader of the Opposition in the 1977 Parliament. There was a Vote of No-Confidence moved by the Government against the Hon. Amirthalingam, the Leader of the Opposition. I think that was the first time in the history of Parliamentary politics that a Government wanted to move a Vote of No-Confidence against a Leader of the Opposition. The Hon. Shelton Ranaraja, though a junior Minister and a Member of the Government, refused to vote in support of that Motion. He conveyed his unwillingness to act against his conscience to his leadership and I think his leadership, recognizing the Hon. Shelton Ranarajas character, would not permit a compromise against his conviction, relented, and the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja was able to refrain on that Vote though there was a compulsion for all the Government Members to vote in support of the Motion. I can well remember the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja refused to support that Motion and he refrained from voting, much to the chagrin of some of his Colleagues, who were falling over each other to be even more Catholic than the Bishop and support that Motion. They castigated Mr. Amirthalingam for duly

performing his duties as an elected Member of Parliament of the Tamil people. I can recall that there were some horrible speeches made. They wanted Mr. Amirthalingam taken to the Galle Face Green. They wanted him dismembered into two pieces by administering some crude punishment that used to be administered by the monarchy in ancient times.

The Hon. Shelton Ranaraja stood out with courage and he remained steadfast to his conviction that he could not support any such Motion. There was the anti-Tamil pogrom or perhaps, more appropriately I would call it the anti-Tamil holocaust of July 1983, following which the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution was enacted. When the violence broke out in Colombo, we were in Mannar for our Party Convention. Many of us wanted to come to Colombo. We were advised by the highest people in the Government that it would even be unsafe for us to come to Colombo and we were advised not to come to Colombo. Most of the Members of Parliament of my party did not attend Parliament after July, 1983. I had not attended Parliament from June 1983, on account of some events that took place in my own district. It was at this time that Indias good offices were offered to resolve the conflict in Sri Lanka. Such good offices have been accepted and the late Mr. G. Parathasarathy came to Sri Lanka for the first time as Prime Minister Indira Gandhis Special Envoy in the last week of August, 1983. Mr. Amirthalingam and I who happened to be in India also came down from India and to ensure our security, we were accommodated in a high-security bungalow somewhere around Wijerama Mawatha. I can vividly recall that our good Friend, the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja came to see us. He was gravely concerned that the three-month period of absence was running out and that I, not having attended Parliament from June 1983, would probably lose my Seat in a few weeks unless leave was applied for me and thereafter for the others too. He wanted to be sure that we would continue to be represented in Parliament despite the Sixth Amendment and offered to apply for leave on my behalf and later on for the others. I declined. I refused to give him my consent. Consequently, I lost my Seat in a short while thereafter and so did the other Members of Parliament of the TULF in due course.

The Hon. Shelton Ranaraja continued to be in touch with us. He was concerned that the Tamil people in this country of the North and the East in particular had been denied their representation in Parliament and they were without their duly elected representatives in Parliament. After the enactment of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and when there was the need to appoint a Governor for the North-Eastern Provincial Council, our good Friend, the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja was our nominee for the post of Governor of the North-Eastern Provincial Council. He would have been the most suitable Governor, a Governor who would have been widely accepted by all

1073 1074

[ . ]

2012 10

the people in the North-East. In fact, President J.R. Jayewardene and the Government were inclined to appoint the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja as the Governor of the North-East. But, no sooner hostilities commenced between the Indian Peace-Keeping Force and the LTTE, the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja declined and would not accept the position of Governor. He was not interested in the office of Governor, but he was interested in accepting that office to be able to be of some service to the people of the North-East and help to consolidate the new Constitutional arrangements which have come about.

It is unfortunate that hostilities broke out and the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja was not able to become Governor of the North-East because under his stewardship as Governor of the North-East, I think much progress could have been achieved in the matter of restoring permanent peace in this country. Since then, as everyone knows, the North-East has had a history of military Governors, very much unlike the civilian Governors appointed in other parts of the country, where I think, I would not be wrong if I say - that all other provinces in the country have had civilian Governors but not the North-East. We have been burdened with military Governors, who have been totally insensitive to the feelings and aspirations of the people of the North-East.

I remember, Sir, I used to once in a way go to Kandy and spend a long weekend with my good Friend, the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja and one day when I was so with him doing a morning walk around the Kandy Lake, I recall his telling me, Sam, when the JVP insurrection was on and many politicians were crouching under their beds, I used to freely walk around the Kandy Lake. I had no problem at all. That was the man, Shelton Ranaraja. Not even the young rebels of the Sinhalese community saw him as an enemy or a foe or as an unfriendly person. While many politicians had to go into hiding, the late Hon. Shelton Ranaraja was able to walk around the Kandy Lake without any fear. That was the man, Sir. His life was an indication of the opportunities that always existed for genuine goodwill and harmony amongst the different peoples who inhabit this country. We held him in the highest regard, in the highest esteem, as I said before, as a quintessential gentleman, a gentleman to his fingertips. We have lost a genuine Friend.

This country has lost a very valuable citizen, a type of person who cannot be too easily replaced. I join the House, Sir, in expressing my deepest condolences to Mrs. Shelton Ranaraja, whose hospitality we have enjoyed several times, and to his children and family on their grave loss which, I am sure, they will find difficult to cope with.

I would request, Sir, that a record of the proceedings of this House be sent to the family. Thank you.

[3.17 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I first came to know the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja very closely when I started practising in Kandy in 1974. From 1974 to 1977, he used to sit on my left side. Even at this very moment, I recall his capabilities as a lawyer and his professional standards were very high. While associating myself with the sentiments expressed by the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, Leader of the House and the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, Leader of the Opposition, I would like to mention about the amount of social service he has done for the people of the Senkadagala Electorate.

At that time it was very easy to be a Member of Parliament because a Member of Parliament was only for a particular area. When we entered Parliament in 1989, it was the district system that prevailed and we had to look after 12 to 13 electorates. But at that time, from 1977 until he left politics, it was the electorate system and the Senkadagala Electorate received a great deal of support through the efforts of the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja in regard to housing schemes, water supply schemes, many new roadways and pathways. More than anything else, the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja will be remembered for a very long time as an honest Member of Parliament and all of us who enter politics would like to be so remembered. During my years of politics in Kandy, I am yet to come across a person who could question the Hon. Shelton Ranarajas integrity, not only as a Member of Parliament but even as a lawyer. Having associated with him closely more as a lawyer than a politician, I know that his professional standards were very high. He showed the true colours of a Kandyan gentleman and never undercut other lawyers.

Having started his education at Trinity College, he moved on to St. Thomas' College and played in the Royal-Thomian Cricket Match of 1945. He got colours in boxing and cricket and I remember that there were many cricket matches that were played between the doctors and the lawyers, and old Royalists and the old Thomians. He always played a very active part in all social activities.

As I said earlier he was a gentleman and a person who loved personal freedom. He spoke out fearlessly. When he was in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, I remember when

the Government at that time wanted to muzzle the free press, he had the guts to oppose it and he voted against it. Then, when he was in the Untied National Party also, I remember, when the civic rights of the Hon. (Mrs.) Sirimavo Bandaranaike were to be removed, he openly spoke out against it at the UNP Group Meeting. So, he was a rare type of politician, a politician we do not see amidst us today.

Then, with regard to the minorities, the Hon. Ranaraja had a very good relationship with the minorities and he was a person who believed in devolution. I remember, when having long discussions with him around the bar table, he said, The first people to ask for a separate Federal State were the Kandyan Leaders. As far back as 1931, when Lord Donoughmore came to Sri Lanka and then, in 1947, when Lord Soulbury came to Sri Lanka, the Kandyan leaders went before the Tamil leaders." That is the irony of it. Before the Tamil leaders asked for a Federal State, Hon. Sir, it was the Kandyan leaders who first asked for a Federal State on the ancient divisions of Sri Lanka; Ruhunu, Pihiti and Maya. So, he openly supported devolution and said, Going back to devolution is the real solution for this country today.

He hailed from a very old Kandyan family. He had good schooling. He had an excellent marriage and as the saying goes, Behind every successful man, there is a supporting wife. Mrs. Ranaraja always supported Shelton in his endeavours to succeed as a politician. About two weeks ago, I attended a temple ceremony in Katugastota and I was told by the high priest that that particular temple was built by the Ranaraja family and it had been maintained by them for nearly 75 to 80 years.

Sir, in concluding my speech, I wish to offer my condolences to the members of his family: Mrs. Ranaraja who served as a Mayor for a very long time and is now living in peaceful retirement and to the other members of his family, in particular, to his son-in-law, Thilina Bandara Tennekoon, whom I associate very closely in politics.

As a Buddhist, I wish and pray for him so that he may attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana!

Thank you.

[3.39 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I was privileged to have associated with the late Hon. Shelton Ranaraja for a long time. We toured the country together addressing meetings from the same platform. The Kandyan Kingdom and the Kegalle District has produced distinguished Sri Lankan leaders. The Hon. Shelton Ranaraja who hailed from Ranwala, Kegalle, belonged to a distinguished family. He is a man of impeccable character; a man of sterling qualities and of strong will. He called a spade, a spade. We have known that very well. He did not mince his words in politics or in any other matter. He spoke straight. As a result, he fell foul with some of the leaders at that time. When he said, "I am quitting", he meant it and did quit, because the political environment was not for his liking at that time.

I, particularly pay tribute to his memory for the great services he rendered to the Muslim community, and that too, especially, to the Muslim schools. He put up buildings for the Katugastota Maha Vidyalaya. He always had a liking for the Al- Azhar Vidyalaya in Akurana. He was also very closely associated with our late Speaker, Deshamanya Alhaj M.A. Bakeer Markar. We celebrated the 1400th year of the revelation of the Holy Quran throughout the Island at that time. He was one person who took the foremost place in organizing the people in Kandy, particularly, Senkadagala and had a successful celebration. He was also closely associated with the Hijri anniversary celebrations organized by another former Speaker, Alhaj M.H. Mohamed. We used to meet him quite often at Senkadagala at the residence of Mr. Mohamed M. Ismail, who is now in the United States of America.

The Hon. Shelton Ranaraja was a man who was deeply involved, not only in law and politics but in sports as well. As a Trinitian and a Thomian, he loved cricket, hockey, soccer and involved himself in those sports. He respected the traditions of these great educational institutions. He was a straightforward lawyer, who never betrayed clients at any time. Therefore, Sir, today for all the services that he has rendered to the country, I must say one thing. That is, he was deeply national-minded. That, we knew. If he had lived, he would have hailed at what is happening around in certain areas today.

Now look at this - ,

Sir, the Hon. Shelton Ranaraja was a distinguished Member of this House and served his people very well, while in Parliament and the country at large.
