. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Mr. Deputy Speaker -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Sampanthan.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, I wish to seek a clarification from the Hon. Minister. It is three years since the war has come to an end. Surely in the past three years, your Government could have taken some final action in regard to all these persons in custody: charge them, have them convicted, punish them if you want to, or if you cannot do that, release them. Let them get back to their families. Their families are starving. We are much more concerned with the families outside: their parents, their wives and their children. They are undergoing immense hardship. This is a humanitarian problem. We would appeal to the Government to be a little more sensitive and to realize that this is a matter of grave urgency. It is cruel, it is inhuman to make these people suffer in this way; not merely the persons in detention but their families, their wives, their children, their parents, their brothers and sisters are all suffering. So, I would earnestly request -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Leader of the House, please. ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I explained very clearly the circumstances under which about 11,000 detainees were released and why the small amount of balance detainees cannot be released at the moment. You being a lawyer, Hon. Sampanthan, you know very well that when we have filed 368 indictments, it is up to the courts to go through the normal procedure and then act upon them, either discharge them or punish them. - [Interruption.] No, no. There are about 350 -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) You must charge them.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) You know very well, Hon. Sampanthan, even under the normal law there are certain cases which are pending for a long time and in the Attorney-Generals

921 922

Department, there is a long list. But, now we have taken action to give priority to those cases and a modality has been worked out.

I explained in detail that within one month certain things will happen and there will be special persons who will be appointed to handle these files et cetera. But, the laws delays are not only in the case of the LTTE detainees but also - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Let the Hon. Minister answer. You cannot convert this into a debate. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) You are not appreciating the fact that we have released thousands of detainees; you are only harping on a few people, the hardcore LTTErs, who are in custody and could be released only according to the law. That is all.

ADJOURNMENT

( ) (The Hon. Felix Perera) , " " .

. . Question proposed. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva will now move the Adjournment Motion. PURCHASE OF THE FINANCE COMPANY SHARES BY NSB AT INFLATED PRICE

[3.40 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I move:

All deposits and interest earned thereon of the National Savings Bank (NSB) is fully guaranteed by the Government of Sri Lanka as a charge on the Consolidated Fund as expressed explicitly in the statute governing the Bank: NSB Act No. 30 of 1971. It is therefore imperative that the NSB is extra cautious in its investments to ensure that the funds of its Rs. 16.7 million deposit accounts are safeguarded.

Thus, a transaction on 27th April 2012, where NSB had purchased close to Rs. 8 million shares of the loss-making and high risk The Finance Company (TFC) at a price of approximately 65 per cent above the established market price at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) raised immediate alarm bells. The fact that it was later revealed that proper procedure was not followed in the decision to purchase the said shares at such an inflated price and the fact that the sellers, buyers and brokers were all connected in one way or another triggered massive

951 952

[ ]

2012 23

protests from various parties including depositors. With confidence in the NSB falling and depositors beginning to withdraw deposits from the Bank, the unprecedented decision by the NSB to unilaterally cancel the CSE transaction on the directive of the Secretary to the Treasury created a new crisis of confidence in the financial markets. Ironically, the NSB is now attempting to shift public attention from the allegedly corrupt transaction to taking credit for having stopped the same.

Article 148 of the Constitution gives Parliament full control of public finance. Given the unique Act under which the NSB was established the said transaction and the fallout of the same becomes directly relevant to this House. The UNP publicly urged that the Board of Directors of the NSB be removed immediately and the "fit-and-proper" criteria of the entire Board of Directors of TFC re-examined to assess whether they should remain as Directors. We also demanded that all persons found guilty of this transaction be punished by law based on the alleged frauds committed by them individually and collectively.

However we note that none of the above has happened. Therefore, we ask the Minister of Finance the following questions:

1. Why was the transaction wherein the NSB purchased almost Rs. 8 million shares of loss-making TFC on or around 27th April, 2012 stopped?

2. Why has the Board of Directors of the NSB not been removed for having committed the allegedly fraudulent transaction? What is the justification for these individuals to remain on the Board given the clear criteria for the assessment of being "fit and proper" to serve on a Board of a financial institution?

3. Will he table the applications filed with the Central Bank and the Central Banks assessment of "fit-and-proper" criteria of each Director of TFC and justify on what basis no member of the Board has been removed on reassessment of the said "fit-and-proper" criteria?

4. What action has the Securities and Exchange Commission taken on the various parties involved in this transaction and what action is it proposing to take on those found guilty of the alleged securities fraud in the sale of TFC shares to the NSB at almost a 65 per cent premium.

5. What action is he proposing to rebuild the lost confidence in the nations premier savings bank?

( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. M. A. Sumanthiran. You have got 15 minutes. [4.58 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me the opportunity to speak on this Motion moved by the Hon. Member from the National List of the United National Party.

I am particularly pleased to speak after the Hon. Deputy Minister of Health, who very correctly described the confidence of the public in a bank to that of the virtue of a woman. He should have actually added that the standard of virtue is that of Caesars wife; in this instance, perhaps, a husband as well.

Sir, this is a transaction that has been suspended by the Hon. Minister of Finance and today the Government is taking cover under that act of the Minister. The Minister took that decision because this is a transaction, as has already been very clearly articulated by the Mover and the Seconder of this Motion, stinks to high heaven and there was nothing else that could have been done by the Hon. Minister of Finance and so he cancelled this transaction. He said so. Whether such a transaction can be so cancelled is a matter that is in dispute.

I take the view that this transaction cannot be cancelled in this manner and in the coming days, perhaps there will be some judicial decision on the matter. But, of course, going to the Judiciary on this matter itself has many pitfalls. Sir, this transaction is, prima facie, a fraud. That is conceded to by the act of the Government in cancelling the transaction. But, the question that needs to be asked is: how was it at all possible for such a blatant and bold act to be done by the appointees of the Government? Handpicked men, each of them handpicked by the very person who now seeks to suspend and cancel this transaction; the very person who is holding out to the country as though he is the saviour and who has stopped this transaction from proceeding, is the very person who appointed the directors to all of these institutions.

Therefore, the public is not deceived by this. When a transaction of this kind comes to light, there is nothing else that can be done and so the Government acts in this way. But, all of these handpicked persons were put in those places for this very purpose. This is one instance where they have got caught red-handed. But, in every transaction that they involve themselves, they stuff their pockets, they steal from this country, and I say again, that they have been appointed by this appointing authority for that very purpose and not without any benefit to himself.

If one is to look at the objectives of the National Savings Bank Act, one can see - as has been pointed out in this Motion - that this is a premier savings institution of the country. It is one that ought to be preserved and protected by every organ of this Government and corruption levels of this Government has gone to such an extent that it has affected even an institution such as the National Savings Bank. That is the truth. That is a big picture.

This transaction does not stand alone.This transaction is only an eye-opener to the fact that things have deteriorated so much in this country that it has even touched an institution like the National Savings Bank.

Investment decisions of any bank must be regulated, particularly that of banks that are owned by the State. We know the state of play in the Bank of Ceylon and the Peoples Bank - bad debts, loans that cannot be recovered, loans that have been granted to politicians and - [Interruption.] Yes, during both the UNP and the SLFP regimes. I will agree with you, also during the UNP regimes. But, that does not make it right for the present Government to continue in that vein and try and improve it as well. Each time an instance of corruption is raised in this country - I have been here for two years - the only answer that the Government gives is: Ah! In your time you did that. That is the only answer, conceding thereby that what they are doing is also wrong. They shouted about these matters when the other side was in power and today when this is highlighted, all that they can say is, Well you did it, why are you complaining? You stuffed your pockets. Why can we not stuff our pockets now? This is our turn. The level to which the governance of this country has come is such pitiful state, when responsible Ministers cannot give an answer, give an honest answer in this House when an issue like this is raised. All they can do is to say, Well you robbed, so why cannot we?

Regulation is important. As I said, Banking Regulation is important. The division in the Central Bank that supervises the banking functions is important and this is a savings bank. None of these institutions function properly.

I am going to speak about the other regulator, which is the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka. All of these have been put in place for a purpose. But, the purpose is totally lost when you appoint your own henchmen to those posts, to those institutions. They are there to function as independent institutions to have a check and balance, particularly in issues of finance; how good the governance of the country is often tested by its financial transactions such as these.

The Securities and Exchange Commission says, the objective of that is found in Section 12 of Act, No. 26 of

981 982

1991. It states, I quote:

(a) the creation and maintenance of a market in which securities can be issued and traded in an orderly and fair manner;

That is the very first objective. Then,

(b) the protection of the interest of the investors;

(c) the operation of a Compensation Fund to protect investors from financial loss arising as a result of any licensed stock broker or licensed stock dealer being found incapable of meeting his contractual obligations; and

Here is a case where this stockbroker was not found incapable, he is conceded by the Government to have deliberately indulged in a fraudulent transaction. It further states:

(d) the regulation of the securities market and to ensure that professional standards are maintained in such market.

"Professional standards to be maintained". Not your friends and your relatives. That is not maintaining professional standards. This is the crisis of governance and if this situation does not open the eyes of the good men in this Government, - I believe that there are many good men in this Government - then we have no hope and this Government has no hope. If the good men in the Government choose to keep their eyes closed because they think

that is the only way they can secure and remain in the positions that have been afforded to them, that position will not last long. It will not last even a year from today and I can predict that with utmost confidence. - [Interruption.] You have been put there for the very purpose of disturbing this House. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) He is the clown in the House. - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Every pack of cards has two jokers. But, this House has just one. This House has only one joker.- [Interruption.] Mr. Presiding Member, I wish to state that we are discussing the governance and we are discussing a serious issue. -[Interruption.] Now, the same thing is applicable to this House. This person who speaks like this has just demonstrated to this House and to the country what levels this Government has brought this House down to. So, it is not only in the financial sector, it is also in the Legislature. He demonstrates -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Azwer, what is the point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, this Hon. Member, though an advocate, cannot gauge my potentials. What happened to Raju Rajaratnam who has - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I certainly cannot gauge your potential. I concede, Mr. Presiding Member, I am not in that league. - [Interruption.] I do not know anything about his potential. I just cannot understand his behaviour. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Azwer, please, sit down. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) So, I will not take up that challenge. He is put there for a particular purpose and that is not my cup of tea. He is very good at that and as I told him a year ago in this House, if he does his job very well, he will remain in that row; he will never advance forward. So, he will remain for the rest of the - [Interruption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is worried about my advancement. He cannot advance himself in his Party itself. We know what happened to him in Jaffna. They are all - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Hon. Presiding Member, he further illustrates - I mean, just to prove my point - and I am thankful to the Hon. Member that he keeps confirming what I say by his clownish behaviour. - [Interruption.]

If the Securities and Exchange Commission had made regulations properly, this transaction would not have happened. If the Bank Supervision Department of the Central Bank had functioned properly, we will not be in the situation that we are in with regard to the NSB-The Finance Company deal. Today, we are in a predicament and I wonder whether any Minister can enlighten this House as to how this transaction can be reversed legally. It cannot be reversed; it cannot be reversed under the present regulatory system. So, extra regulatory measures are taken. The Minister has no role to play in this at all according to the rules that have been framed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Once the transaction goes through, T+1, as was explained by the Proposer of the Motion, you have to withdraw from the transaction within one day. T+3, within three days the payment has to be made, and that is it. You cannot reverse it. The Minister absolutely has no role to play. But, just to show the country, just to give the impression, as I said earlier that he is the saviour of the country, and because this transaction cannot be defended in any manner howsoever, he makes a purported order cancelling the transaction.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Sumanthiran, you have only one more minute. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir.

So, today, concerning the Stock Exchange, the whole regulatory system of the securities has been put in serious jeopardy because if the cancellation takes place, you will be driving a coach through this entire system that is in place. On the other hand, if the transaction is allowed to stand, then you would be allowing a huge patent fraud to take place. We wish to know, as Members of the Opposition what the answer of the Government is. Thank you very much.
