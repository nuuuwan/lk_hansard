(vi) the names, designations and academic qualifications of the nominees of government and/or Employees' Provident Fund to the Boards of Directors of each bank in which the shares are being held?

(b) If not, why? () ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of International Monetary Co-operation and Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning) Hon. Speaker, on behalf of the Minister of Finance and Planning, I will reply to the Question asked by my distinguished Friend.

(a) (i) The values of shares held by EPF in local commercial banks as at 31.12.2011 are as follows:

* Value including transaction cost The EPF does not hold any shares abroad.

(ii) A large number of transactions have been carried out by EPF through the Colombo Stock Exchange - CSE - in purchasing banking sector shares.

If the Hon. Member of Parliament requests for the dates on which shares were purchased of a particular bank, such information can be provided because it is such a large amount of information.

(iii) Since the transactions of the CSE are carried out through an automated system, the seller linked to each transaction cannot be identified unless it is disclosed by the CSE. (iv) A large number of transactions have been carried out by the EPF through the CSE in purchasing banking sector shares. Hon. Member, if you request information about a particular transaction of a particular bank, such information can be provided. (v) In 2007 and 2008, EPF sold 174,600 shares of the National Development Bank. Since the transactions of the CSE are carried out through an automated system, the seller linked to each transaction cannot be identified unless it is disclosed by the CSE. (vi) EPF has not appointed any person to the Board of Directors of any bank. The Government nominees to the banks in which the EPF shares are held are: NDB - Ms. G.D.C. Ekanayake, Director-General, Department of National Budget, Ministry of Finance and Planning. DFCC - Mrs. H.M.N.S. Gunawardana, Director-General, Department of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Finance and Planning. Sampath Bank - Ms. Dhara Wijayathilaka, Secretary, Ministry of Technology and Research. HNB - Dr. Willie Gamage, Secretary, Ministry of State Resources and Enterprise Development. Commercial Bank - Mr. Lakshman Hulugalle, DG, Media Centre for National Security and the DG for NGO Secretariat.

(b) Does not arise. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Thank you very much for the information. It was long outstanding, but today you were good enough to answer. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I explained my policy of trying to answer all the Questions that you raise. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes, I know. The Hon. Leader of the Opposition will pose a couple of Supplementary Questions.

415 416

No. of shares million

Value (Rs. million)* Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC 71.7 7,631

DFCC 23.8 3,329

Hatton National Bank 29.9 4,956

Sampath Bank 15.1 2,446 Seylan Bank PLC 14.3 939

Seylan Bank (Non-voting) 15.3 560

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Minister, since some of the answers, like the answer for (a) (ii), deal with the Colombo Stock Exchange, shall we ask the Colombo Stock Exchange to come with the relevant information for the Committee Stage Discussion of the Ministry of Finance because we are entitled to question anyone at the Committee Stage. Hon. Speaker, with the agreement of the Hon. Minister, we will ask the Colombo Stock Exchange to come here on the last day when the Votes of the Ministry of Finance will be taken up.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Mr. Speaker, I will take that. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Speaker) 15 . . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, the second Supplementary Question I pose to you is this. You have not revealed the value at which each lot of shares was purchased. But, by now you know that the balance sheet must reflect the purchase price or the market value of the shares, whatever is lower. At this particular moment, EPF has incurred a loss of almost Rs. 6 billion due to purchase of shares. As the Leader of the Opposition stated, when they come in they must bring the purchase value, the market value and the true reflection in the balance sheet because the loss is what we are concerned about. The EPF has lost Rs. 6,000,000,000.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Speaker, I think for purposes of record, I must give a reply to that. These profits and losses are notional figures. - [Interruption.] Let me answer now. I am replying. Be patient; let me reply. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) 2 . () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I want to only place on record that all these dialogues and debates that are going on are based on notional

figures. We buy shares - [Interruption.] Let me answer. Hon. Member, I have listened very carefully to what you have said. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) So, now, you must listen to what I have to say. You only speak to television cameras and give the impression that we have no answers. So, it is very necessary, Hon. Speaker, that my Answer also be given the same prominence as these Questions. It is on that understanding that we take Questions and give Answers. This is not a teledrama; Parliament is not a teledrama. We are trying to explain a reasonable Question. So, I just want to answer this point.

This whole dialogue is based on notional figures. That is, we invest and the EPF is a long-term investor. We are not interested in what the price is today and what the price will be tomorrow. At a certain point of time, if we just made that computation, we would have had Rs. 19 billion profit, but we did not realize it at that time. It is a long-term investment which is meant to support the local banking sector and with a 8 - 9 per cent growth, we are quite confident that these are safe and quite useful investments. Later on, you can express your view on that matter. That is all I have to say, Hon. Speaker.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The third Supplementary Question is this. The EPF has a shareholding in the NDB. Only a court can issue an order to disclose information on a persons banking accounts. Would you tell us as to how the banking information went out? The Impeachment Motion was able to come in with the information that was revealed by the NDB. I am asking this because EPF is a shareholder of NDB.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) The whole matter is subject to inquiry and your valuable ideas are always in our minds. We will try to, as much as possible, accommodate these ideas. When we proceed with this, you will have a reply to this. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) 3 -2243/'12- (1), .

With regard to large-scale productions like tea, rubber and coconut, I am asking you whether you have adopted the "One area, one product" concept or whatever. You keep talking, but I am very sorry to say that people are not benefited today. We had the highest number of livestock in 1977 because we developed and promoted that sector. Then, Nestle' Lanka came in. That is how you have to raise the income of the poor man. You can do that. But, you are only talking. You said that you are importing cattle. I am asking the National Livestock Development Board whether they have distributed 100 animals in the last year. I am challenging you. You have not distributed. I feel very sorry. You have spent billions of rupees on importing Australian Jersey cattle. They do not suit our country. I had a herd of about 50 cattle that suits Nuwara Eliya. So, what is this? Import cattle from India and Pakistan.

They said, Your Excellency, this is the revolutionary, marvellous tractor". What did the Rt. Hon. D.S.

Senanayake say, Sir? He nodded and said - my father told me this when I was a school boy. He was there. We bought two tractors at that time. We were involved in the agricultural production - Yes, very good. But, it will not give cow dung. See that great man's vision, how he saw the future. Now, there is neither dung nor cow; only barking is taking place. I am saying, Sir, it is a very sad situation.

Sir, now I want to talk about what is happening in Sri Lankan Missions abroad.

( ) (An Hon. Member) There are rats there.

( ) (The Hon. Gamini Jayawickrama Perera) There are rats in this House also. - [Interruption.] Yes, I know. You came yesterday to our Leader's meeting with the Indian MPs. Be careful! He came to our Leaders room. He met the Indian MPs also. What are you talking about? Just keep quiet. I will not give the other things out. - [Interruption.] No, no. I will not give them out. Do not worry. I said you are trying to satisfy our young gentleman. That is what you are trying. Just keep quiet.

Sir, what are the representatives of our Missions doing? See their performance. His Excellency the President summoned all the ambassadors here and said, You do your work. I am asking, what is the task and target of our Missions? Look at the way the late Presidents, Premadasa and J.R. Jayewardene acted. They said, No, you have to attend to this". "You do this or go out. They were removed if they had not acted accordingly. That is how they got the work done. We will show you the vision into mission and target or hire-and-fire system. We will not keep satisfied individual people. Our policy is different from yours. We got the result.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Are you mad?

Now, time is the problem. So, Sir, if you can give me another half an hour's time, I would teach them a lesson. I can conduct some classes for them on how to do the work, how to get the work done and how we achieve that. You can learn a lot from me. I will teach you. - [Interruption.] You are the student and I am the lecturer here. Just sit down.

[10.36 a.m.] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda - Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development) Hon. Chairman, the Budget Proposals for the year 2013 presented by his Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa focus to transform Sri Lanka into a poverty-free, upper middle income country with a per capita income of US Dollars 4,000 by 2016. The objective of this transformation is to make Sri Lanka an Emerging Wonder of Asia as set out in the "Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future". The country has already graduated to a middle income country with a per capita income of US Dollars 2,800 in 2011 complemented by an economic growth rate of 7 per cent. A considerable progress has been achieved in the macro-economic indicators. The unemployment rate has been brought down to 5 per cent. Poverty levels have declined from 23 per cent in 2001 to 8.9 per cent in 2011. Inflation has declined to a single digit of 7 per cent. Sri Lanka has climbed to the 81st position in the ranking of Doing Business Index out of 185 countries. The country has reached high performance level on Millennium Development Goals Indicators.

With a view to alleviating disparity in the development of the Northern and Eastern Provinces, the Government initiated accelerated development programmes known as Vadakin Vasantham and Killakin Uthayam. By now, the Government has not only resettled a large number of people who were displaced due to the conflict, but also is in the process of rebuilding the entire infrastructure of the North and the East under these programmes.

Temporary sheltering, feeding, and resettling in their places of origin about 212,146 families consisting of 752,114 members within a short span of time and providing them with means of livelihood assistance is a massive task which the Government is nearing completion. Even the Budget Estimates for 2013 envisage a similar development drive towards the Northern and Eastern Provinces.

Rehabilitating and integrating about 12,000 former combatants into the social fabric within a few years of ending the conflict is another achievement of this Government. It is an excellent achievement.

Vaalvin Elluchchi" - Divi Neguma - is another programme aimed at uplifting the economic strata of the poorest section of the society. The people of the North and the East, who were worst-hit economically due to the prolonged conflict, benefit most out of this programme. All these achievements could not have been possible, if not for the vision and guidance of His Excellency

President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the directives of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa.

In order to find a political solution to the problems faced by the people of this country, the Government has appointed a Parliamentary Select Committee with clear guidelines and a time frame. It is the intransigency of the TNA Parliamentarians, that stands in the way of the whole process.

Then, moving on to Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development, Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future emphasizes strongly on the need to strengthen traditional industries, micro, small and medium industries and enterprises and the handicrafts sector to enhance inclusive economic growth and rural economic development and to improve regional development with a view to reducing poverty.

The Ministry will establish 60,000 cottage industries and micro enterprises in the medium-term, and work towards upgrading 5,000 small enterprises to medium-scale enterprises and 200 medium-scale enterprises to large enterprises annually as set out in the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future.

My Ministry provides support to micro, small and medium industries and enterprises and handicrafts through technology transfer, advanced training, provision of raw materials, provision of infrastructure facilities and industrial estates, provision of common services facilities, introducing market-oriented new designs and, access to credit and marketing arrangements through buy-back arrangements and sub-contracting arrangements. This programme will ensure entrepreneurship development through the process of nurturing, monitoring and guiding on beneficiaries.

My Ministry also closely works with the Ministry of Economic Development to support the Divi Neguma Cottage Industry Programme in close collaboration with four industrial cluster Ministries namely, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Technology and Research, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Skills Development and the Ministry of State Resources and Enterprise Development and 16 agencies and institutions that come under these Ministries. The programme includes islandwide district exhibitions, training, technology transfer, provision of raw material and basic tools, facilitation of access to credit through district level banking clinics and marketing facilitation involving the private sector.

With regard to Divi Neguma Cottage Industry Programme, 24 district level exhibitions have been completed. Over 10,000 beneficiaries have been trained and over 15,000 beneficiaries are undergoing training. Over 600 beneficiaries have been linked with banks to access concessionary credits through banking clinics.

Basic tools and materials have been provided to 700 beneficiaries, and 1,800 kithul tappers were provided with safety kits. This programme is an ongoing national programme and is being further accelerated. My Ministry has supported the palmyrah sector development, kithul sector development and other industrial and craft sector development islandwide.

With regard to the Northern Province, special programmes such as reactivation of Atchuveli Industrial Estate, reactivation of Palmyrah Research Institute, expansion of the production capacity of Gurunagar Fishnet Factory, development of palmyrah-based craft villages, Vathiri Leather Production Village Development, Allarai Coir Sector Development, modern saree designs based on embroidery and sequin work, pottery and ceramic village development programme and other related development efforts have been accelerated. The Palmyrah Research Institute was reactivated and started operations in July 2012. A comprehensive research master plan has been developed and implemented to support the palmyrah industry.

My Ministry has scheduled to organize a four-day national exhibition and trade fair on handicrafts and small industries at the BMICH from 27th to 30th December. This is an annual event of the Ministry. I wish to warmly invite all Members of Parliament to kindly visit this "Shilpa Handicrafts and SME Exhibition" and encourage and motivate this national initiative. It is also expected to conduct an award ceremony to recognize the micro, small and medium industries and enterprises and craftsmen. We have also planned to recognize the banks and financial institutions that are more friendly to the micro, small and medium enterprises.

In 2013, the implementation plan of the Ministry among other nationwide initiatives includes a number of programmes. Among them are modernization and upgrading of main and mini SME industrial estates; strengthening the traditional handicraft villages islandwide, covering sectors such as rush and reed, masks, jewellery, musical instruments, sesath, lacquer, wood carving, bobbin lace, coir, clay and palm leaf handicrafts. Training is being provided and new designs are being introduced. Then, revitalization of industrial production villages and enterprise villages; development of home-based economic activities through Divi Neguma Cottage Industry Programme; National Kithul and Palmyrah Sector Development Programmes; and strengthening the fishnet production capacity of Gurunagar, Weerawila and Lunuwila factories of the Northsea Limited are also underway. - [Interruption.] Anyway, thank you for the comments. Action has been initiated to reactivate the Elephant Pass Saltern also.

The Ministry has drafted its medium-term Strategic Plan for which concerned stakeholders will be consulted at district level, to get their reflections on an islandwide basis through a bottom-up process.

Then, I would like to refer to the proposed initiatives of the institutes under the purview of the Ministry for the year 2013. First, I would start with the Industrial Development Board. The IDB proposes to provide technical know-how regarding quality and hygienic requirement of products processed by rural industries in order to keep them to the national and international standards. Modernizing of industrial estates is also in the agenda. In order to improve the SMEs scattered throughout the country, the IDB has initiated action to provide technical training, technology transfer, enterprise development and other related interventions. The focus will also be on the provision of raw material and facilitation of credit and marketing with quality improvement.

Then, we have the National Design Centre. The NDC will focus its attention on developing market-oriented new designs to help the craftsmen to face the global market competition. Also, they will have special concentration to develop souvenirs and gift items to meet the booming tourism sector in Sri Lanka. The NDC will also establish craft showrooms to demonstrate and popularize the creative designs.

The next is the National Crafts Council. The NCC is the apex body to develop and promote the countrys craft sector. Programmes such as Master Craftsmen Training, Craft Training Centre based programmes, basic and advanced training, provision of raw material, product quality improvement programmes, exhibition and trade fairs will be expanded to cater to the needs of the craft sector.

Then, we have the Palmyrah Development Board. This is an important sector for the people of the North and the East for their livelihood. The Palmyrah Development Board has initiated action to expand the planting programme by providing nurseries. Further, handicraft training, pulp production, sweet toddy, treacle and jaggery production, Palmyrah-based food industry, expansion of coir production and other value-added products will be promoted. We are thankful to His Excellency the President for his initiative to obtain assistance from the Government of India and also the Government of India for their assistance to support our reactivation of the Palmyrah Research Institute. The research initiative will help in a bigger way to uplift the Palmyrah sector industries.

The Northsea Limited is another institution comes under this Ministry. This institution is responsible for the production of fishnets. My Ministry has expanded its activities by taking over the Lunuwila and Weerawila fishnet factories in addition to its Gurunagar factory. Further, the 30-year old machineries and equipment are being modernized and upgraded with the Indian grant assistance programme on the initiative of His Excellency the President. With this modernization initiative, quality

443 444

fishnets will be made available in the coming years to meet the requirements of the fishing community.

The Government has given concessions in the Budget for SMIs and SMEs. In 2011 and 2012, the Governments Budget Proposals extensively focused on micro, small and medium enterprises and the handicraft sector. Similarly in 2013, the small enterprises which have an annual turnover of less than Rs. 12 million are exempted from Nation Building Tax and Value Added Tax. With regard to the rate of income tax, a concessionary income tax of 10 per cent is applicable for SMEs which have an annual turnover of less than Rs. 500 million.

The Budget Proposals of 2013 have proposed that Kithul cultivation will be particularly encouraged in the Sabaragamuwa Province and palmyrah cultivation will be encouraged in the Northern Province to ensure increased availability of industrial products and food products in these sectors. Further, the Ministry has also taken action to strengthen the banana fibre extraction and related handicraft sector including rope and twine making. This will be further taken forward in 2013.

Further, budgetary allocation of Rs. 200 million has been proposed to support the pottery industry to gain access to new designs, technology and equipment and to manufacture specified gift items preferred by tourists for both local and export markets. The focus is also given to promote 25 women small entrepreneurs in each district under Divineguma programme.

My Ministry will ensure that every rupee allocated from the Budget is spent in a results-oriented manner to meet the aspirations set out in the Mahinda Chintana -Vision for the Future.

I take this opportunity to thank my Deputy Minister, the Hon. Weerakumara Dissanayake, Secretary, Mr. V. Sivagnanasothy, Adviser, Additional Secretaries, Chairmen and all the staff of the Ministry and the institutions coming under the purview of the Ministry. I am also very specially thankful to the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, Minister of Industries and Commerce and the officials of his Ministry for their close collaboration, partnership and teamwork extended to take the industrial sector forward. Thank you.

[11.47 a.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Deputy Chairman, in fact, today there are two Ministries under discussion: the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development. I start with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. We are much concerned about the employment aspect and, at the same time, production as well. Newspapers carry news items to attract the public and also, I think, to satisfy the President. I could read one news item which appeared in the Daily News of 7th November, 2011, under the

461 462

2012 21

heading "Paranthan factory to be revived" It states, I quote:

The Paranthan Chemical Factory which was shut down ......... had presented a project report to the government to re-establish the factory in the same location. They have estimated the cost of the project at Rs. three billion.

Paranthan Chemicals stands on a 217 acres and the factory will be established in the same location. Several foreign investors from countries such as India, Ireland and Dubai have come forward to invest in the chemical factorys reconstruction.

The factory management is ready to initiate the reconstruction activities with one of these investors who agrees with the governments conditions, Paranthan Chemicals Factory Chairman Nimal Abeysiri, said.

There is an annual need of 2,000 metric tons of Chlorine and 15,000 metric tons of Caustic Soda in Sri Lanka and the Paranthan Chemical Factory aims to manufacture around 25 tons of Chlorine and Caustic Soda per day after reopening the factory, he added.

Currently the chlorine is imported to meet the purification needs of the Water Resources Board and this can be met by the Paranthan Chemical Factory.

We do not know the fate of it. It was a news item. We do not know when they are going to commence the work. According to the news item, it seems that the agreements have been signed and they are supposed to start the work of this factory creating employment. Not only that, it very clearly indicates that foreign exchange could be saved. So, this newspaper report is only for the sake of publishing interviews and giving ideas to the public. Sir, this has to be curtailed. We could see nearly 78,000 fishing population attached to the North Sea Limited. But, there are only 18,500 fishermen actively engaged. This sector has contributed 20,000 metric tons of seafood in 2010 and the demand for fishing nets is in the region of 600 metric tons. This company currently supplies only 10 per cent of the demand and 60 per cent of it is supplied by the other companies.

So, again, one could foresee why this industry cannot be improved and why the Government cannot allocate more funds since they supply only 10 per cent of the demand. With this Budget, I think so many millions -

( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) If you have listened to my speech, you would have understood that. I have already stated that. We are going to expand that - . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Thank you, Hon Minister, for your information. Yes, I overheard. I partly listened to your speech and came to

know that you are planning to start 60,000 cottage industries right throughout Sri Lank. I am asking, did you all achieve what was targeted in the last Budget? That question arises. At every Budget, speeches are made giving some confidence to the public. So, one has to analyse their progress and if something targeted in that Budget had not been achieved, that also has to be mentioned, not only about money.

Now, I would like to ask a question from the Hon. Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development. For your Ministry, the Capital Expenditure allocated has been reduced from what had been allocated in last year's Budget. Why? It is given here. According to this document I have, for the year 2013, you have been allocated Rs. 383,000,000, but last year it was Rs. 408,000,000.

( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) Every time, you come out with false information. With one of you speeches, you had misled the House. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) But, that information is in this document given to me by the Parliament Library.

( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) Even in your last speech made on 12th November, 2012, you had said - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) I will continue with my speech. Hon. Minister, you can correct it in your speech. - [Interruption.] I gave that Capital Expenditure from the Government records. - [Interruption.] No, I am not misleading. You can correct it later. You can ask the Library from where they got this information.

Sir, then I would like to speak about the North Sea Limited. It is almost three and a half years now since it was initiated. Now, what is happening there?

( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) We got the Indian grant nd now we are - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Why can the Government not invest? Why should you wait for the Indian grant? - [Interruption.] You need not.

463 464

Hon. Minister, the other matter is, there is a firm called Ras Al Khaimah Cement Company. It is a UAE firm. They expressed their interest in reviving the KKS Cement Factory with an investment of US Dollars 100 million. A Memorandum of Understanding was sent in May to the Ministry of State Resources and Enterprise Development. The KKS Cement Factory is not under your Ministry; it is under the Ministry of State Resources and Enterprise Development . But still, since it is an industry, kindly take that also into consideration. In an article on that, The "Business Times" section of "The Sunday Times" dated 8th July, 2012 quoted an official from the Ministry as saying that the Kankesanthurai Cement Factory ceased operations 20 years ago. That official had further stated that in order to restart operations of the Kankesanthurai Cement Factory, a major overhaul and refurbishment of its manufacturing facility is necessary.

The Ministry was seeking an appropriate party to take over the plant and recommence operations. In this case, that particular UAE firm showed their interest. Under the proposed agreement, the UAE firm will arrange for a formal techno-economic feasibility study on the viability and phasing of rehabilitating the plant. This study is expected to be completed within four months, and based on the techno-economic feasibility study and UAE companys determination that the project will be commercially successful, the Ministry and the UAE firm will enter into a long-term contract of not less than 35 years, where this firm will operate and manage the plant. But, up to now - this is the new story - we have not heard anything of that. What I am trying to tell you is, if the Paranthan Chemicals Factory - [Interruption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Who destroyed the cement factory in Kankesanthurai? Can you tell us? It is the Tigers.

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Azwer, please sit down. - [Interruption.] Do not disturb me. I am talking about economic development in the North. I do not want you to interfere with me. - [Interruption] I told you the other day, you are the worst person, who is actually detrimental to the reconciliation process of this country. - [Interruption.] Yes. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Who told you?

. ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) I am telling you. Hon. Minister, what I am saying is, if those industries start their operations - ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, he was referring to me. I completely deny the frivolous charges he was making against me. Sir, I must also point out one other thing. Only his speech will be reported in the "Sudar Oli" tomorrow, which is unfair by all the other Members who have spoken in this House today. Sir, please give an Order that the speeches made by all the Members today must appear, particularly in the "Sudar Oli". My good friend, Mr. Puththirasigamoney, is also not allowed to write. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Okay, I have taken note of that matter. Hon. Saravanapavan, you carry on. - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) You start a newspaper on your own. - [Interruption.] Do not rely on others. The other day, you were accusing in front of another Muslim Minister, but he did not defend you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You are a media mogul. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Sir, what I want to say is, if all these industries - the KKS Cement Cactory, the Paranthan Chemicals, the roof tile factory in Oddusuddan and all other factories - commence work, we can create more employment and have more production, which would contribute towards the national economy. That is what I am trying to say.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! Hon. Saravanapavan, you have two more minutes. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) The other matter is, we will have to improve more on cottage industries. As you said, 60,000 cottage industries are going to be started. There are 11 million palmyrah trees overall in the North and the East. Out of that, seven million is in the North alone. That being the situation, the Government has to consider more allocations to start more cottage industries, which also could contribute towards the economy. You have proposals - I was listening to you, Hon. Minister - to commence pulp production in a large scale and also for production of sweet toddy, coir manufacturing - ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) Go through my speech. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) That is what I said. ( ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda) My speech had already been made. . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) I overheard your speech. We will be monitoring these things until the next Budget to see to what extent you will be achieving all these targets. It should not be just a flowery speech. - [Interruption.] Yes, correct. We will be monitoring these and it has to be notified to us - [Interruption.] Sir, the Hon. Azwer is taking my time. You must stop him. He is used to this type of characteristics.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Saravanapavan, you carry on. You have one more minute. - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. E. Saravanapavan) Hon. Azwer, you are here to disturb everybody. Please do not do that. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. Weerakumara Dissanayake.

Hon. Deputy Chairman, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance presented the 66th Budget of Sri Lanka and the eighth of this Government on 8th November mainly focusing on socio-economic development, relief to the poor, and consolidation of measures of previous budgets. This Budget is also indirectly supportive of export earnings, in that, measures to diversify domestic production by strengthening the SME sector, which is the backbone of our economy, enabling us to cut down on our import bills.

The Ministry of Industry and Commerce and its departments serving the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future aims to create a highly value added, knowledge-based, internationally competitive industrial sector which employs a well-paid skilled workforce by 2020, and achieve US Dollars 20 billion national exports in the same year.

With a view to facing the increasing challenges against us in the international markets, under the guidance of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, our Economic Development Minister, I propose to make the export sector, which is our lifeline, a national priority. The World Economic Outlook Report released by the IMF last month predicts a sluggish growth for 2013. Accordingly, the global recovery already started has now weakened. According to IMFs April 2012 forecast, the latest forecast for 2013, growth has been revised from 2.0 per cent down to 1.5 per cent for advanced economies, and from 6.0 per cent down to 5.6 per cent for emerging markets and developing economies.

It is in this regard that I commend His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksas acknowledgement in the latest Budget of our aim to promote the IT/BPO/KPO industry to a billion dollar industry with 150,000 direct employments in the next three years. This will strongly contribute to our ICT exports. I am pleased to state that our ICT and BPO exports last year increased by 47 per cent, earning US Dollars 310 million under the vision of Mahinda Chintana.

I am also pleased to inform the House of our latest Ministerial level initiatives to lift our exports to face the challenges in the global markets. I wish to reiterate that we are not going to remain passive at a time our export markets around the world seem to be more challenging. We are under no illusions that our exports are not going to face difficulties in the future.

In fact, we are taking active steps to safeguard our exports. I am pleased to inform the House that I have been personally meeting and consulting many top members in the Chambers of this country with regard to our future exports strategies. As a result of the consultations that I had during the last few months, we have now set up a Consultative Committee on Market

471 472

Diversification, which began its work last week with the support of Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and other Chambers. We have moved our Department of Commerce to the export battle with the setting up of this Committee which is Sri Lankas first-ever national level initiative to address the growing turmoil in its global export destinations.

More importantly, we are looking at actively joining regional production networks so that our exports become more market-driven. To this end, I am pleased to inform you that the Governments efforts to open both Indian and Chinese markets, which are seen as difficult segments, are becoming successful. As a result, the high level Indian trade delegation led by Indian Minister, Hon. Anand Sharma, that arrived here last August, announced that India wants to double the current trade volumes to US Dollars 10 billion by 2015 with new Indian investments of US Dollars five billion.

Thanks to the initiative and request of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, our Economic Development Minister. India has agreed to set up two large-scale, dedicated, export-manufacturing zones making our high-level goal of joining the regional production networks, a reality. One zone is for automotive parts and the other is for pharmaceuticals.

Our exports to China under APTA alone have increased by a massive 719 per cent, which shows our progress in market diversification to China. The high-level Chinese official delegation which arrived here last September informed us that my request to allow Sri Lankan exports to enter Chinas growing FMCG segment is being positively considered by them.

The Export Development Board - EDB - is Sri Lankas apex organization for development and promotion of exports and it has adopted a new strategic approach to increase our export earnings to US Dollars 20 billion by 2020 and thereby contribute to the objectives in the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future. There were many activities done by the EDB to accelerate export earnings in 2012. The export sector of Sri Lanka, after displaying a strong growth during the last two years, experienced a slight decline during the period January to June 2012 due to a fall in demand in our key markets. My Ministry and the EDB held a Consultative Meeting in September 2012 with key exporters of the country to obtain their views to turn around the export sector and to place it on a positive track.

Sri Lanka EXPO-2012, a mega trade, investment and tourism promotion initiative staged under the theme of Partnering with the Hub of Asia in March 2012 exceeded the set target of attracting 1,000 foreign buyers

and generated participation of 1,385 international visitors including trade buyers, ministerial delegations, investors, foreign employment agencies, tour operators and journalists from across the world.

My Ministry is taking steps to improve footwear and leather industry. Having highlighted our export strategy, now I would like to speak about our industrial development focus which is not only national but also regional. I am pleased to inform this House of several regional industrial developments thrust by our Ministry. The Embilipitiya Industrial Estate started commercial production. Stage I of the Matugama Industrial Estate has been completed and the development activities of the Trincomalee Industrial Estate have been commenced in parallel to the Nagenahira Navodaya programme and its development activities of Stage 2 are under way. The first industrial estate which commenced development activities parallel to the Uthuru Wasanthaya programme is the Mannar Industrial Estate in 25 acres and infrastructure development facilities are to be completed by 2013. I am pleased to inform the House that as part of our efforts to expand industries, work on three proposed industrial estates - Batticaloa Industrial Estate, Pallekele Industrial Estate and the Kilinochchi Industrial Estate - are in progress, .

To further enhance five agro-based industries, namely, tea, spices, coir, processed food and packaging industries, we took many initiatives. The "Lanka Pack 2012", an international packaging exhibition, was concluded successfully with the participation of local and foreign packagers, machine suppliers and material suppliers. The 11th Profoods/Propack Exhibition was conducted from 6th to 8th July, 2012 with increased participation of local and foreign exhibitors.

I am pleased to inform the House that export of tea, coir, paper and paper products, processed food and spices has increased by 50 per cent amounting to US Dollars 2,231 million during the period 2009 to 2011. In the coming year, we look forward to expand and develop this sector even further.

The Ministry, in association with the Sri Lanka Institute of Textile and Apparel - SLITA - has established the Footwear and Leather Goods Training Institute to develop the local footwear and leather goods industry.

Sri Lankas international reputation for ceramics is well known and our ceramics industry has around 15 dynamic export companies with US Dollars 38.33 million worth of exports in 2011.

The Ministry has granted Rupees six million to the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau to conduct ball clay and mineral deposits identification surveys in a few selected sectors.

Our electrical and electronic industry has about 100 companies engaged in manufacturing of electronics and electrical goods for the local and international market and about 10,000 workers are engaged in the industry with US Dollars 151.73 worth of exports in 2011.

A technical support centre has been established in association with the University of Moratuwa to improve the knowledge and technology for new incubatees of small and medium electrical and electronics with a Rs. 10 million outlay. Also, the Ministry is in the process of publicizing the rapid prototyping machine at the University of Moratuwa by utilizing the funds of the Ministry.

I am pleased to inform you that giving a strong boost to the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industry, the Government of India on the initiative of Minister of Economic Development, the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa and under the directive of the Hon. Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, Industry and Textiles, has extended support to us to set up a dedicated pharmaceutical manufacturing hub, which is the first for our country.

Sir, the Department of Commerce of the Ministry focuses on foreign trade policy formulation, coordination and implementation with the objective of developing and promoting Sir Lankas foreign trade relations at bilateral, regional and multilateral levels. It is the agency we are now enlisting to sustain our exports, and more importantly, seeking new markets. The Department reports that overall negotiations under the Doha Development Round of trade negotiations under the WTO remained slow, but the various negotiating groups continued to engage in trying to resolve the outstanding issues in agriculture, Non-Agricultural Market Access - NAMA, TRIPS, services and rules while efforts on the draft agreement on trade facilitation continued.

I am also pleased to inform the House of the new EU GSP Scheme. The EU Parliament has approved the new GSP Scheme in June, 2012 and it will come into effect from 1st January, 2014.

Sir, the National Intellectual Property Office of Sri Lanka of the Ministry registered 272 new patents in 2011 while it registered 104 patents by mid-September 2012. In 2011, it registered 1,379 trademarks while it registered 1,302 trademarks by mid-September 2012. It also Vienna coded 880 trademarks in 2012 while by mid-September 2012, it Vienna coded 491 trademarks.

Sri Lanka has a long history of textile traditions and the Textile Industry Development Division of the Ministry ensures the development process of our handlooms, powerloom and apparel sectors. I wish to praise the initiatives of the Budget 2013 on the proposal to allow such industries to claim actual expenditure incurred on product safety testing and the proposal for a

two-year depreciation allowance for apparel and other manufacturing industries to modernize with advanced technology, machinery and accessories and to reduce the Ports and Airports Development Levy on their daily-used consumable items from 5 to 2.5 per cent to be able to maintain their global ranking in international markets, which supports the objectives of the taskforce of the handloom industry established by my Ministry in January, this year. The National Level Task Force on Handlooms that was formed on a high-priority basis in December, 2012 is expected to deliver a valuable and professional structure to Sri Lankas US Dollar 13 million and growing handloom sector.

The Apparel Industry is a major export income source and is directly influenced by the changes in international markets. Despite the loss of GSP Plus, as a result of promotion of Sri Lanka as worlds number one ethical apparel sourcing destination, we have seen strong demand for Sri Lanka's apparels abroad. Exports of all apparels during January to August 2012 was reported at US Dollars 2,498 million, with 49 per cent of it headed to the European Union and another 40 per cent going to the United States. So far in 2012, we have issued 31,000 Certificates of Origin to exporters to EU countries. Seventeen new apparel factories have been registered and in the same period, 10.5 million pieces of garments were exported. We commenced the Programme of Improving Productivity by the Sri Lanka Institute of Textile and Apparel with an allocation of Rs. 11 million.

We have allocated Rs. 25 million for international and local image-building programme of Sri Lanka apparels, implemented by the Joint Apparel Association Forum - JAAF - to build markets and improve image.

Sir, Kahatagaha Graphite Lanka Limited is yet another successful story of our Ministry, since no Treasury funds are sourced to the Company.

During the last decade, despite rare earth metal price volatility on the supply side creating strong constraints, one material which was not a rare earth metal, but still appreciated in price was Graphite.

Mantai Salt Limited, which comes under our Ministry, supplies 2.6 per cent of the annual salt volume used by consumers of Sri Lanka and it has reported a profit of Rs. 4.1 million during 2011 and 2012.

I am pleased to say that the 66th Budget is a forward-looking instrument, focused on development of all the sectors of the country. Such a cross-cutting effort will no doubt result in the positive outcomes again channelled to our exports and industry sectors thereby realizing the objectives of Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the future.

Finally, I take this opportunity to thank my Deputy Minister, the Hon. Jayarathna Herath, the Secretary to my Ministry, Mr. Anura Siriwardena and Additional

475 476

Secretaries, the Chairmen, the Heads of the Departments and other officials of my Ministry. I am also very thankful to the Hon. Douglas Devananda and the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, for their valuable support in the activities of my Ministry. Thank you.

Vocational Education & Training in Europe

. . I quote:

"University education does not necessarily prepare the youth for Life;...."

. It further states, I quote:

"...also there is NO guarantee of a job after a university degree. It is for this reason that 80 to 90% of the youth, after the 10th, opt for Vocational Education & Training where they work part time [at minimum or lower wages], as apprentices, with Industry and Trade for 2 to 4 years and study simultaneously in a Vocational Education & Training Institute, for learning the theory and acquiring the relevant knowledge and theory.

This way, the business and trade get low cost manpower for 2 to 4 years, while the youth are learning a new trade, both on-the-job as well theory in the Vocational Education & Training Institute. This combination results in World Class skilled youth. There are 2500 trade options in Europe.

POPULARIZATION AND PROMOTION OF CARROM

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

May I commence, Madam, wishing the Minister of Sports, my very good Friend, the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage, a very happy birthday!

! , . .

I move the following Adjournment Motion:

Sri Lankan carrom player Mr. Nishantha Fernando brought immense prestige to Sri Lanka by winning the gold medal awarded to the 'World Carrom Champion' at the World Carrom Championship, 2012 held in Sri Lanka for the sixth time.

Furthermore, Sri Lankan sportsmen and sportswomen were able to win a silver medal and a bronze medal in the womens doubles, a bronze medal in the mens doubles and two silver medals in the mix doubles at this carrom tournament.

Therefore, it is moved in this House that action be taken to provide the support and encouragement necessary to popularize and promote the game of carrom in Sri Lanka."

. . carrom game . , , , sisters .

So, this is a very popular sport from, I can say, the hearth to the veranda and from the veranda to the hearth of the house; everybody plays it. Even the people who are serving you are also engaged in this game. I remember, Madam, during the early stage of my life, I too engaged in this carrom game and almost became a champion at the YMCA Carrom Tournament. But, I lost in the final. I played at the YMCA Carrom Tournament - double - with my classmate, M.S.M. Nizar, from Campbellabad, Tirunelveli District, Tamil Nadu, who was studying with me at Zahira College, Colombo 10. At Azhar Place "Deen Dale", in Maharagama, we used to play carrom daily. I remember the names of my cousins and nephews Saheed, Zavahir, Zubair, Azhar, Harris, Aslam, Niyas, Mueen, Atha, Hamza and also our neighbours, Berty and Henry. These were our good close neighbours with whom we developed a sense of belonging to each other and developed brotherly feelings by playing carrom together.

World Carrom Championship .

It is Mr. M.J.M. Lafir of the Moors' Islamic Cultural Home, under the dynamic leadership of Sir Razik Fareed, who brought the first World Championship to Sri Lanka. I remember the Hon. Speaker at that time, the late Hon. K.B. Ratnayake who went to the airport and brought the champion to the MICH in Bristol Street, which is now named Sir Razik Fareed Mawatha at Fort and every one of us gathered together irrespective of communal differences in order to hail the Sri Lanka's First World Champion, Lafir.

The second time we won a World Cup was when the Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga - our Colleague in this House - brought us the World Cup in the Limited Overs Cricket. Mr. Nishantha Fernando became the World Carrom

579 580

Champion in the singles event at the Sixth World Carrom Championship held in Colombo. He beat C. Bharathi Dhasan of India 2-0 in the final.

Sri Lanka was hosting the Sixth World Carom Championship, which commenced on 31st of October and ended on 4th November, 2012 at Galadari Hotel with 80 slicers from 16 nations participating. Indian mens team beat defending champions Sri Lanka 3-0 in the Team Championship finals. The Sri Lankan team were captained by Mr. Nishantha Fernando.

When anybody excels in sports, the President is the first person in the country to hail that victory and honour him. I have got a paper-cutting giving details of our carrom champion being invited to Temple Trees and being felicitated and awarded with awards that could be given by the highest of the State. That is the way he honours our champions and helps sports to develop.

I am also very happy at this moment to mention particularly the immense service that the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage is doing for the promotion of all sports in the country - be it cricket, be it rugger, be it racing, be it carrom, be it volleyball or be it Elle. He is a man who is always there. Young as he is, our budding Friend is always there to give a helping hand to the carrom players as well.

The carrom players need certain assistance in order to improve their game. We know that there was a permanent office or headquarters at Reid Avenue - presently Philip Gunawardena Mawatha. Today, it is a very big supermarket. Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa has transformed this horse-racing stadium into a large mall. That is very good. We welcome that. It is now a very impressive edifice. Visitors are amazed to see such an impressive building. It looks like a great mall in England, Australia or America.

1956 . . .

This is another game we can excel in and become World Champions over and over again. Hon. Minister, there is another sport, Kabadi. Kabadi is also a game that is very suitable to the physical composition of our people.
