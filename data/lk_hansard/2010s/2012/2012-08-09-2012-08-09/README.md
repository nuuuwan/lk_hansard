( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, I refer to "Rules of Debate" under Standing Order No. 78 regarding the speech that was made yesterday by the Hon. Minister referring to the conduct of a Magistrate.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, a ruling was given on that by the Presiding Member at that moment. So, you are not in a position to challenge the Ruling given by a Presiding Member.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, give me one minute. Besides the Ruling, the Hon. Minister went on referring to the conduct of the Magistrate. We do not know what had been eliminated -

861 862

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Even at the end of the speech a ruling was given and according to that, whatever statement that was made contrary to the Standing Orders would be expunged from Hansard. So, you are not in a position to challenge a Ruling given by the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) We want a clarification. Give us a clarification.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) There is no clarification available on a Ruling given by the Chair. As per the Standing Orders, there is no provision for such a clarification.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) How do we know what portion has been expunged and what is in Hansard.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is as per the ruling given by the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) But, we do not have a copy or any access to the minutes.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You will see it when the Hansard is made available.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, yesterday when the Hon. Speaker was presiding, there was a matter that was raised on a meeting of the Consultative Committee of the External Affairs Ministry. At that particular moment, there was an erroneous statement made by the Hon. Deputy Minister of External Affair saying that there was a Consultative Committee on a given date. Therefore, a ruling on that was supposed to be given today and I have a further clarification -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Speaker did not specify a date on which a ruling will be given.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, he said that he will give a ruling today.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What he said was that he would give a ruling taking into consideration what had been stated. So, accordingly, he will give a ruling in due course.

863 864

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, you can hear me out. This is the Parliament of Sri Lanka. This is not a Municipal Council or any other place. When we ask a matter of importance and when there is an erroneous statement that was made purposefully in this august Assembly, there is a necessity of - ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, the Hon. Speaker has given you a hearing and the ruling in respect of what you have stated is pending. Therefore, I am not in a position to listen to you. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) How long will it take? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) No, he will but he is not present today.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But, Hon. Deputy Speaker, you are competent enough to give a ruling on it and the system goes on.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) In a day or two, a ruling will be given. Thank you very much.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I have been on my point of Order much earlier.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Azwer.

Leader of the House to move the Vote of Condolence on one of our distinguished Members, Abdul Majeed who passed away. His family members are also present here.

[2.44 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) There was a question that was put to the Deputy Speaker as to whether asking questions prior to the Vote of Condolence being taken up was a means of dishonouring the late Hon. Abdul Majeed. Actually, as far as I am concerned, the proper way to have honoured the late Mr. Majeed was to have had the Vote of Condolence earlier. He passed away in November 2011. We are having the Vote of Condolence eight months later. If we were unable to have the Vote of Condolence earlier, I do not think at this moment it is appropriate to raise issues of whether following the procedure in Parliament is correct or not.

I still remember the first time I met Mr. Abdul Majeed. It was just after the 1965 Election as Mr. Dudley Senanayake was endeavouring to form a Government. While I was at home, a car turned up and someone rang the bell. I opened the door and there was Mr. Majeed getting out of the Volkswagon car together with another person who was known to me called Mr. Illanganadan, a Telecommunications Engineer. He inquired after my father. I asked him to wait. I gave him a cup of tea and rang my father who wanted me to instruct him to proceed to "Woodlands" where they were all meeting with Mr. Dudley Senanayake.

While having the cup of tea, he told me that he had come all the way from the Kachcheri there. He had the cup of tea and went off immediately to "Woodlands" where he signed the letter to support Mr. Dudley Senanayake in forming the 1965 Government.

Mr. Majeed was in Parliament earlier. He came as an independent Member in 1960. He was elected both in March and in July. I remember he was one of those who joined the UNPs campaign against the press takeover in 1964. He voted against the Throne Speech. At that time they were successful in defeating the Throne Speech when Mr. C.P. De Silva crossed over. He was coordinating his work. He was working with the UNP. In 1965, he was returned to Parliament and he agreed to support the UNP even prior to the election. It was only a matter of putting a signature on the piece of paper and thereafter in Parliament, he joined the UNP.

There was also Mr. Devanayagam who came in at that time. Mr. Abdul Majeed was a very keen Parliamentarian. He was a good backbencher who raised issues. Backbenchers at that time included Mr. Hameed, who had also come into Parliament in 1960. President Premadasa came in 1965 having missed out in July 1960. The backbenchers of the Dudley Senanayake Government were really an active lot. I remember watching them from

the Gallery of Parliament. Mr. Majeed was successful in winning his seat in 1970. We had two Members, Mr. Majeed and Mr. Devanayagam representing us from the Eastern Province, one in Ampara and one in Batticaloa and that helped the party to stabilize itself. He used to come and take part in all the events and Sathyagrahas we had organized. He took part in all the meetings. I still remember Mr. Majeed. I think Mr. Dayaratne would have known him quite well. He was the senior-most Parliamentarian.

Then, from 1977 we all associated with him as a Member of Parliament, as a Deputy Minister and as a Minister. He held many portfolios, Highways, Telecommunication, Power and Agriculture. He told me once that all of them were useful to him for his constituency also. He was able to get the basic issues of his electorate attended. In fact, every two to three years he changed the Ministry so that he could spend the money. In the first round, I think he was with Ministry of Ministry, then with the Ministry of Highways and so on. He got electrification done in his area. He was able to attend to the basic needs of the electorate. But, more than what he did for the electorate, I must say that he and Mr. Devanayagam together with Mr. Mansoor were quite instrumental in ensuring that the Tamil-speaking people in the coastal areas never moved away from the adherence to Sri Lanka as one single State, whatever be their views of how the solution should take place.

Mr. Majeed was very concerned about the Muslims and believed that their rights should be safeguarded. But, I must say that Mr. Majeed was not a person who only thought of the Muslims. He thought of the whole area. He belonged to a different class of politicians. He did not enrich himself but he enriched the Samanthurai Electorate, which he represented. He was a landed proprietor who thought it was his duty to represent the people, like many of his relatives. He had that high sense of duty as a Parliamentarian. If you listen to his speeches, if you saw his contributions in Consultative Committees and his conduct as a Member of Parliament, you will realize it. That is the type of Member of Parliament that we have been used to earlier. A lot of people are used to it and they find that that model is no longer available. He was very, very conscientious. He knew what was happening not merely in his electorate, not merely in his district but also in the country. At a time when the Eastern Province was going through - I would say from 1983 to 1992 - a very difficult phase, thanks to people like Mr. Majeed; we were able to go ahead with the development in the coastal areas and to ensure that the benefits of development went to all the people.

I think Mr. Majeed wanted to contest in 1989 but there was an agreement we had with the Muslim Congress. Therefore, he, together with Mr. Mansoor came on the National List. He had a very long stretch in Parliament. He had a good memory of what happened from 1960 onwards, during Mrs. Sirimavo

871 872

2012 09

Bandaranaikes tenure as well as Mr. Dudley Senanayakes tenure. That was a benefit that all of us, who were new Members, acquired from him.

I do not want to take too long a time of this House. There are other Hon. Members who are waiting to speak. But, we have to remember that Mr. Abdul Majeed was a model MP. He was a man who was remembered long after he ceased to be an MP and a man who will be remembered long after he left us. Because of him, development has taken place in the coastal areas of the Eastern Province both in the Batticaloa District as District Minister and as an MP in the Ampara District. Especially the Muslims of the area owe a lot to his dedication, as a Member of Parliament, to his Constituency.

Thank you.

[3. 03 p. m.] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Mr. Presiding Member, the late Hon. Abdul Majeed was an asset to the United National Party. He was an honourable Member of Parliament, a Minister, and a Member in the Local Authority. That is why he was able to survive in the political circles from 1960 onwards up to 1994, a long record. In the late 1970s, I saw him as a bodybuilder. He was such a smart man, very well dressed in the western attire. No one could point a finger at him as a corrupt Minister or a Member of Parliament who did not discharge his responsibilities.

Our Leader of the Opposition gave a vivid description of the services that he rendered to the people of the Eastern Province. I am sorry to say that only the Minister, Hon. P. Dayaratna is here. There are so many Muslim Ministers from the Eastern Province but none of them are here to speak a word about this great honourable man who did so much to the Eastern Province.

. ( . ) (The Hon. P. Dayaratna) They will come. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I do not know when they will come but it is very unfortunate. ( ) (The Presiding Member) They informed the Chair that they will come. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Maybe. But, we, from the United National Party regret the passing away of the Hon. Abdul Majeed. He was an educated man. So much so, that he was referred to as "BA Majeed". That was the name that the people used in the Eastern Province at that time. He was so popular as said by the Hon. P. Dayaratna. He never went after positions but positions came after him. See his record. He was the Deputy Minister of about six Ministries and a District Minister too. If am not mistaken, he took over the reins after you. Finally I think he was the Minister of Handloom Industries of the United National Party Government.

Therefore, Sir, I think his services will be remembered by the people of the Eastern Province. He was such an honourable Member of Parliament. He believed in gentleman politics. He did not resort to unwanted things. Recently, we saw what happened in the House: how certain people tried to interfere with the Judiciary. He never believed in that. The Hon. Majeed was not a person of that calibre. He was a very honourable Member of Parliament and a Minister. His demise, I say, is a loss to the country and to the United National Party. May I extend our condolences to the members of the family of the late Hon. Abdul Majeed on this occasion. I thank you.

[3.18 p.m.] ... ( ) ( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Urban Affairs) Mr. Presiding Member, I rise with great respect to pay tribute to the veteran politician of the East and one-time Deputy Minister, the late Hon. Abdul Majeed. I am very thankful that I got this opportunity to recall the memory of a highly-cultured gentleman politician, who had been one of those rare men with great qualities. His services to the people of Sri Lanka, particularly to the people of the East, had been unique. He was very

879 880

[ ... ]

2012 09

sociable. The Hon. Majeed was the first university graduate of the East and he was popularly known as BA Majeed. He transcended the boundaries of race, religion, caste and creed and embraced all people alike.

The Hon. Abdul Majeed who hails from a family in Vanniyanar in Samanthurai entered local politics in 1954 and was elected Chairman for the Samanthurai Town Council till 1960 and thereafter took to national politics. He contested the Pottuvil Seat in March 1960 and July 1960, 1965 and 1970 and won the seat. He then switched on to the Samanthurai Electorate in 1977 and retained the constituency till 1994. The Hon. Majeed served as a Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Lands, Deputy Minister of Power and Highways, Deputy Minister of Power and Energy as well as the Deputy Minister of Posts and Telecommunication.

As a Deputy Minister, he rendered an excellent service. As a man, he fostered fellowship among the different ethnic communities and he was an ardent believer in multiculturalism and ethnic harmony. He always looked at problems of the people with great understanding and open mind. His approach to the various issues has been unique in respect of each issue. He was particularly careful not to offend anyone. His doors were open at all times for the people and he identified himself with the problems of the people, particularly the problems of the farmers.

Sir, I join the Hon. Members of the House in paying my highest tribute to him and conveying my deepest condolences to the members of his family.

Thank you.

Sir, at this stage, I would like to strike a personal note. I carry nostalgic memories of the late Hon. M.A. Abdul Majeed - he was announced as the first Eastern Province graduate. Sir, I remember very well the day that he returned to Samanthurai - his birth place, where there was a massive reception. It turned into a very great festive moment - one of the historic occasions for the people of Samanthurai, particularly the farmers and the others. There was a mass rally and a public reception accorded to him at the Samanthurai Arabic College Ground. I happened to be in the Eastern Province on that occasion with our great national leader, patriot and educationist, Alhaj Dr. T.B. Jayah. The President of the All - Ceylon Muslim League, Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel also joined in that trip to the Eastern Province. That historic meeting was a great moment for this young man. It was coincidental that one of the greatest Muslim leaders had to preside over the reception. Of course there were Ulamas also.

Dr. Jayah spoke and he invited me to interpret his speech into Tamil and I interpreted it. Then, Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel spoke and I had the privilege of interpreting his speech also into Tamil. I was just out of school or about to step out of school. Can you just imagine my feelings? I never realized that that will also be inscribed in the life history of my humble self. Therefore, Sir, Mr. Abdul Majeed, when he came out from the portals of the university, I had the great fortune and barakah, as I would put it in Islamic terminology, to be able to be part of happiness of the people of Samanthurai.

Sir, Mr. Abdul Majeed was an embodiment of peace and harmony. He is an advocate of national unity.

Sir, I have with me a significant invitation card sent to me by the Co-Chairmen of the Forum for National Amity and Understanding, Venerable Prof. Kamburugamuwe Vajira Nayaka Thero and Alhaj M.H. Mohamed, a former Speaker of Parliament and the President of the Sri Lanka Islamic Centre at Maligawatta. This was held at the Mahabodhi Society Hall.

I categorically state in this House that we completely dissociate with the sentiments expressed by the Hon. Rauff Hakeem in this regard. We are living peacefully in this country. People from the Eastern Province come to Colombo and also their family members come without any hindrance now. They faced several difficulties during

30 years of terrorism as they were not able to come to Colombo. Their farming lands, agricultural lands, their agricultural tools and tractors were robbed by Tigers. They were killed in Kattankudi. It is also told, If you want to break mosques, vote for the beetle leaf. What a low statement! Is this in politics? This is not the civilized politics that the Hon. M.A. Abdul Majeed practised in this country. I think the Hon. Rauff Hakeem has created a very difficult situation for us. I know that a majority of Buddhist Monks and buddhist leaders, including His Excellency the President, extend much goodwill towards the Muslims. They want to develop that further in order to build a true and united Sri Lanka.

Sir, I remember the day when a stamp was issued in memory of the Hon. Alhaj (Dr.) T.B. Jayah at Zahira College. The Hon. Abdul Majeed was the Deputy Minister of Posts and Telecommunication. At that time, the Minister in charge was the late Hon. D.B. Wijetunga, who, incidentally was also the Private Secretary to the Hon. A. Ratnayake in the First Parliament and was a very good friend of the Hon. (Dr.) Jayah. So, it is a great coincidence that the stamp was released by the Hon. M.A. Abdul Majeed.

Then, Sir, when I first visited the Eastern Province, I was able to meet several leaders. One of them was the foremost Muslim Engineer, Mr. M.M. Ismail, the father-in-law of Mr. Abdul Majeed. He invited the Hon. (Dr.) Jayah and the Hon. (Dr.) M.C.M. Kaleel to lay the foundation stone of the Ampara Mosque during that visit. Together with those two great leaders and Mr. M.M. Ismail, I too had the fortune of laying a foundation stone for the Mosque at Ampara, which I will never forget in my life. My father-in-law, M.M.A. Sameen, who was the Storekeeper in the Gal Oya Board, also participated on this occasion.

The Hon. Abdul Majeed's father was Mr. Mohammed Ali and his mother was Mrs. Katheeja Umma. He had very good and well-behaved children named Faroouki, Malik, Faloona, Nasser and Laafir. His son-in-law is Mr. A.M.M. Naoshaad. He had brothers with whom I associated very much at Zahira College at rugger, soccer and cricket: Mohamed Ali, Amir Ali and Mustaq Ali. Mushtaq Ali was unfortunately felled by the terrorists at that time.

Sir, the Hon. Majeed came from a very distinguished and, may I say, almost a "royal family" of the Eastern Province. Gate Mudaliyar M.S. Kariapper's ancestry came from Kotabowe, Godigamuwa in the Bibile Electorate of the Monaragala District. During that time, King Senarath gave lands in the Eastern Province for the Muslims to settle. These are historical facts. We must revive those memories so that we can live together with friendship, amity and peace with the large majority of the Sinhala brothers. Now, the disgruntled politicians, who have no other ways of getting votes, are trying to break coconuts, plunging us into a dangerous situation..

There was another Majeed, Sir, who represented Parliament through an adjoining electorate. He was affectionately called Sweet Majeed - the late Hon. M.I.M Abdul Majeed - whose son is the Hon. A.M.M. Naoshaad, who was also a distinguished Member of this House. He was the nephew of ex-MP, the Hon. Abdul

Majeed Merza and the first Muslim Minister of Finance, the Hon. Alhaj M.M. Mustapha and also a relative of a former Minister, A.R. Munsoor. His daughters-in-law were Zeena Junaideen, Jennat Merza, Kuraisha Merza and Shanaz Majeed.

So, it is my privilege today to rise in this House and pay my humble tribute to the Hon. M.A. Abdul Majeed.

I must also mention, Sir, that the Library of the Parliament of Sri Lanka has brought out a fine brochure and it was delivered to us today.

It is very well documented. The Librarian, Mr. C. Kuruppu has taken a lot of trouble to publish it. He has mentioned about great leaders, Speakers and Parliamentarians for the last 32 years. There have been Parliamentarians in this House who have served for over 40 years. The late Hon. Maithripala Senanayake has been the longest serving Member having served 45 years, 2 months and 11 days, followed by Hon. W. Dahanayake who had served 40 years, 1 month and 3 days, then Hon. Alick Aluvihare who had served 39 years, 10 months amd 14 days, followed by Hon. A.C.S. Hameed who served 38 years, 3 months and 21 days and Abdul Majeed for 33 years, 3 months and 4 days.

All in all, Sir, today we see one by one, in and out of Parliament, taking leave of us.

Mr. Abdul Majeed has left a legacy, a great ancestry. I believe that this must be carried forward by his able lieutenant son-in-law, Mr. Naoshaad. Mr. Naoshaad. Together with Mr. Abdul Majeed, all of us helped to build the United National Party in this country.

I recall Mr. Naoshaad who was the Assistant Secretary-General of the UNP got disgusted over the leadership, over many things, which I do not want to mention here, and left the Party. He chose the correct path for the future welfare of his community and the country. Today, the people have acknowledged his leadership in Samanthurai. He followed his father-in-law, great celebrated leaders like Mudaliyar M.S. Kariapper, M.I.M. Abdul Majeed, Musthafa and others. I wish him a bright future. Today, he is in the distinguished Gallery. He was earlier in this House as a distinguished Member, amiable person, a clever Parliamentarian and a talented young man. I am very happy that he fortunately did not cut short his long political journey that is before him. Today, when I see him in the distinguished Gallery, I pray in this Holy month of Ramazan, that he should descend down and be a Member of Parliament soon and a loyal member of his community in this House in order to serve his community.

According to my religion, Islam, may I conclude by saying, Inna Lillahi Wainna Ilaihi Rajioon- "We come from Him and to Him do we return!. May Abdul Majeed be granted the highest felicity in Jennathul Firdous!

( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran. You may take the rest of the seven minutes that is left. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for the time given to me. I must thank the Hon. Member from the Colombo District who moved this Adjournment Motion to draw the attention of this House and the country to this important issue that is before us at this point of time.

Child abuse is a matter that has been growing and statistics would show that not just now but perhaps even a decade ago or more than that, this issue has been there and I am also conscious of the fact that this House has enacted a legislation like the National Child Protection Authority of which the first Chairman worked with much dedication. But, it is a matter of regret that funding to this agency was reduced despite various assurances and today, it is not as effective as it was at the time it was created.

Several sentiments were expressed with regard to children who are abused and the legal processes that they must endure. There is a balancing that is required and I am conscious of that. Yet, at no time can we compromise on the rights of an abused child and whatever be the measures that need to be taken must be taken. There is provision in the law already for video evidence to be taken. That is done in an atmosphere where the child does not have to face hostile environment. There is a psychologist present and the evidence is taken. Yet, if that video is to be presented as evidence, the child also will have to be subjected to cross-examination. That is not a matter that is desirable. Several prosecutions have fallen due to the fact that the child is unable to be cross-examined and is not available for giving of evidence, rightly so, because in certain cases the child is better off than reliving those horrendous, tormenting moments that she has had to undergo.

The abuse of women is also a matter that has now come into the limelight and several sexual attacks on women are being reported. We need to take stock of this as an urgent issue and arrest the situation. I urge the Hon. Minister to bring in, if necessary, a legislation or other administrative steps to arrest the situation. I am sure he will agree that we cannot allow this situation to deteriorate anymore.

Statistics show that in Sri Lanka, about 37.8 per cent of a girl-child by the age she is 12, has had to undergo some kind of sexual abuse. Out of the 15,000 cases that are pending in 2010, the Ministry of Justice conducted a survey and found that in about 4,000 of those, children

907 908

[ ]

2012 09

are involved. So, about 30 per cent of the cases involve offences against children and women. These studies also show that the perpetrators are generally family members. In many instances it is a father, relatives, uncles and so on. That is a factor that must be taken into account in combating this serious social evil because when these things happen in family surroundings, in domestic situations, you need special legislation, special measures to combat them. Police must be trained effectively. When police assistance is sought, they must be able to go and arrest the situation.

I must say a word or two about the situation in the North as well. There too, this is on an increase because of poverty. There have been a few instances that have been brought to our notice, where women who are widows now are forced to render services to men just for a loaf of bread or a bottle of oil. This is horrendous. We have been blaming the military in the past and I think highly militarized environment is also not conducive and there is much to be said against that as well. But, we must also acknowledge that it is not only the military; it is a relative, shopkeeper, or some other men. All of these people take advantage of this situation and therefore very stringent methods have to be taken. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, why do we not recommend capital punishment as a deterrent?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is a wholly different issue as to whether capital punishment, is in fact, a deterrent or not.

( ) (The Presiding Member) How do you eradicate it? I am asking you this because you are a lawyer?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We might have another Adjournment Debate on that subject. But, certainly a very effective deterrent must be brought in. I want to end with another sad fact and that is, religious personalities. Even members of the clergy are in recent times accused of these offences and I do not want to point fingers at other religions. I am a Christian and often times, we have come across situations where Christian clergy themselves, my own clergy, have been found to be taking advantage of situations of counselling and so on and abusing women and children. This is another issue where trust is broken and they take advantage of a situation of trust and what is worse is that in most cases, the religious authorities try and cover up

because they think this is something that brings a bad name to their organization. This kind of attitude will not change the situation.

Once again, I want to express my thanks to Hon. Member from Colombo for raising this issue in this House and across the party divide I hope we will take steps. I am confident that the Hon. Minister who is committed to children and women's affairs will take effective steps in the days to come.

Thank you very much.
