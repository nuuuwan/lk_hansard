QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE APPOINTMENT OF SELECT COMMITTEE TO SOLVE NATIONAL QUESTION ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Deputy Speaker, though three years have passed since the war in the North ended, we, in Sri Lanka, have yet to move towards national reconciliation. Long-lasting peace is possible only with a political solution acceptable to all communities. This has been the steadfast position of the United National Party throughout this conflict.

Speaking in this House on an earlier occasion, I said, All parties and all people must come together, understand the tragic, traumatic period we have gone through and commit ourselves to reconciliation and peace. The Government must take the first step to create an environment to build a national consensus based on unity, for the strengthening of democracy, power-sharing, equality and respect for the rights of all communities. All of us have a duty to respond and a role to play. For this reason, we applauded the joint statement between the Government of Sri Lanka and the United Nations, which concurred that addressing the aspirations and grievances of all communities and working towards a lasting political solution was fundamental to ensuring long-term socioeconomic development.

The UN Secretary-General welcomed the assurance of the President of Sri Lanka contained in his statement in Parliament on 19th May, 2009, that a national solution acceptable to all sections of people will be evolved. President Rajapaksa expressed his firm resolve to proceed with the implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment as well as to begin a broader dialogue with all parties including Tamil parties in the new circumstances, to further enhance this process and to bring about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka. This communiqu was confirmed by the United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution of May, 2009. In this context, the UNP supported the bilateral talks between the representatives of the Government and those of the TNA.

Similarly, when the Report of the LLRC was tabled, the Hon. Leader of the House stated, The Government seeks the support of all Members of this House, rising above party affiliation to carry forward the task of implementation with the energy that is called for at this crucial time. Despite the shortcomings of the Report, we responded positively by supporting the implementation of its recommendations. This was because we agreed wholeheartedly with the recommendations of the Report highlighted in paragraph 9.179 that There must be willingness on the part of all political parties to give up adversarial politics and have consensual decision-making on national issues. In order to meet the challenges of this opportunity, there has to be courage and political will on the part of all political parties. To us, this was the basis of a Sri Lankan solution, to which we ourselves are committed.

It is highly regrettable, therefore, that we in this House have so far been incapable of making any headway towards reaching a common solution to the national problem. The breakdown of talks between the representatives of the Government and those of the TNA has been a serious setback in working towards national reconciliation and in forging a Sri Lankan solution.

Now, however, the urgency of taking action on the repeated assurances given by the Government to this House and elsewhere can no longer be denied. We must, therefore, use the recommendations of the LLRC Report without further delay. If we fail to do so, Sri Lanka will be reviled internationally, and be forced to confront a hostile global environment.

The United Nations Resolution L.2 of the 19th Session in March, 2012 requested the Government of Sri Lanka to present, as expeditiously as possible, a comprehensive action plan detailing the steps that the Government has taken and will take to implement the recommendations made in the Commissions Report. The longer we delay commencing an inter-party, inter-community dialogue, the more we put the country at risk of severe international pressure. What I said on 3rd May, 2011 when the Report of the UN Panel was tabled, is true of today. I said then

1065 1066

that the present situation is perhaps the single-most challenging position we have faced externally since the Indian airdrops of 1987. If at all, the situation has become even more aggravated.

The Government has stated that the Parliamentary Select Committee should be the mechanism for such a dialogue. In a context where bilateral talks between the Government and the TNA have come to a standstill, it is essential that these talks be revived forthwith to run parallel to the Parliamentary Select Committee meetings. The discussion papers and the documents referred to already by the two sides provide sufficient material to build and conclude these talks. While agreeing that the Government and the TNA need to focus on the agreed core issues of devolution, the Parliamentary Select Committee can, in the first instance, deal with the other recommendations of the LLRC Report.

Furthermore, if all talks are to be concluded by the end of the year, it is imperative that sittings commence at least by June this year. Then, the six-month time period mentioned in Resolution P.145/11 will end in December this year, for what is required is not a post-mortem on why the bilateral talks failed but an immediate recommencement.

The United National Party is of the view that the Parliamentary Select Committee deliberations would be fruitful only if we seek to develop and flesh-out the agreements reached at the bilateral talks as well as the recommendations of the LLRC. We do not have time to dither or dawdle. With this in view, the UNP led by me had a productive discussion with President Rajapaksa and a team of Ministers. We discussed the need to recommence the bilateral talks that are to be inter-woven with the Parliamentary Select Committee.

Similarly, we also discussed the issues of recommencing bilateral talks as well as the willingness of the TNA to participate in the Parliamentary Select Committee with the Leader of the TNA, the Hon. R. Sampanthan. I am gratified by the Hon. Sampanthans positive response. When the Government called on the Opposition parties to participate in the PSC, the UNP took the initiative in preparing a framework for the Opposition parties to participate in it as well as the following agenda, which states, I quote:

The UNP has called on the Government to create an appropriate environment for the Opposition Parties to take part in the PSC. Such an environment is possible on an agenda based on the implementation of recommendation of the LLRC Report including a devolution package, implementing the 13th Amendment and further building on it so as to achieve meaningful devolution, taking into account the bilateral discussions between the 3-Member Committee of the Government Parliamentary Group and the TNA based on the discussion papers and the documents referred to therein.

The deliberations will be within this framework and the Report will be submitted to Parliament as per Resolution P.145/11."

I have also kept the TNA and the JVP informed of this proposed agenda.

The Government has not objected to what we proposed in the agenda in order to create a suitable environment for the PSC. Thus at this juncture, I would also like to assure the TNA that the UNP will support all decisions arrived at during the bilateral talks between the representatives of the Government and those of the TNA. Therefore, I would like to urge the Leader of the House to endorse this agenda, enabling us also to participate in this dialogue.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) As agreed, we have an Agenda. That is all. What you agreed on it, I do not know. We have only set in the Agenda.

... ( ) ( ... - ) (The Hon. A.R.M. Abdul Cader - Deputy Minister of Environment) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak and I would like to mention about the background of the preparation of Vehicle Horns Regulation No. 1738/37 under the National Environmental Act, No. 47 of 1980 as amended by Act No. 56 of 1988 and Act No. 53 of 2000.

The Environmental Foundation Limited and another individual had filed a Fundamental Rights Case No. 87/2007 in the Supreme Court in 2007, naming the Minister of Environment and the Central Environmental Authority as Respondents among others.

In this Case, the Petitioners state that Chapter III of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka in 1978 recognized the right to life as a fundamental right and the right to life of every person is recognized more specifically by Article 11 and 13(4) of the Constitution and the said Articles further implicitly guarantee the right to quality of life. They further state that the right to life includes the right to an environment conducive to the said right and further includes the right to breathe air of a quality that supports such life.

Accordingly, the Petitioners have alleged that the acts or omissions of the Respondents constitute executive and administrative action and have violated the right to life guaranteed to the Petitioners as well as the general public in Colombo metropolitan area.

Since 2005, the Court has been studying and analyzing several aspects that could cause and prevent air pollution and there was a directive by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to draft Regulations to control the noise emanating from vehicle horns. With regard to this, Regulations were drafted by the Central Environmental Authority, in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and experts of the field, to control sounds emitting from vehicle horns under Section 23 of National Environmental Act. After making amendments, the aforesaid draft was approved by the Legal Draftsman and the said draft Regulations were gazetted on 29.11.2011.

According to the said Regulations, no person is allowed to use or cause to be used on a highway or road, any motor vehicle where the sound pressure level of its

1085 1086

horn exceeds the limits specified in the Schedule of the Regulations, unless such person has obtained a permit authorizing such use, issued by the Commissioner-General of Motor Traffic or any person authorized by him on his behalf. However, these Regulations do not apply for ambulances, trains, fire-brigade vehicles, police vehicles and vehicles used by the armed forces. Thank you.

[3.50 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for granting me time to participate in this Debate.

We must commend the Minister of Environment for bringing in this Regulation which is going to control noise pollution in the country. But, we do not understand why he has limited regulations for motor vehicles only. There are so many other ways of noise pollution in this country today especially with the use of speakers and mikes.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) There are three types. In fact, they are under discussion. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Okay. There are certain people who think that the method of following their religion is by imposing their religion on others without their consent. A Buddhist, a Muslim or any other religious person would like to practise his religion in his own way. But, there are certain things that are being done, imposing your religion on somebody else. Some of them just switch on the speakers. This does not help anybody. If they choose to listen to

1097 1098

that, they can switch on their own radio and listen. To impose this on somebody early in the morning without their consent, I feel is not correct. If you can bring in some sort of regulations on that without harming the religious feelings of people, it is better. I think you should bring them in. That would be very essential.

You are the Minister of Environment. But, looking after the environment has now been taken over by the Defence Ministry, I believe, because in every street there is a policeman wearing a cloak which says, Environment Police. These people are coming and harassing our residents unnecessarily. This has to stop. Maintaining the environment is good for everyone: for public health, general cleanliness and as a hygienic measure, maintaining the environment is very important. But, when you give this to the police, they act as if all are criminals, even those who commit minor offences.

I have a house in Colombo and I work in Nuwara-Eliya. In Colombo, there is a Municipal Council vehicle that comes three times a week to collect the garbage. Those people who are going out to work have to leave their garbage by the roadside on the days it is collected, at maybe 8 oclock, and then leave for work. But, there is a policeman who comes down the road in the morning and insists that the garbage should be kept by the roadside only when the lorry is coming. The lorry comes at 10 oclock or 10.30. Can people sacrifice their jobs and stay at home to keep the garbage on the streets? ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) I do not think that is proper. You can inform the police. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is happening; it happened in front of my house. My neighbours -

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) What I am saying is, if that policeman is going beyond his powers - . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is happening regularly. - [Interruption]. The Mayor of Colombo is doing this properly. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) So, why do you not inform the Mayor to have boards erected in those places?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, it is not necessary because we are aware when the lorry comes but we cannot stay at home till the lorry comes. We go to work. ( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) Hon. Member, the schedule of the garbage collection is passed by the Municipal Council. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) That is right. There is no problem about the schedule. It is not the problem of the schedule, it is the policeman. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) I will look into this problem. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The policeman says, do not keep the garbage by the roadside; that he will prosecute. People who go to work have to keep it by the roadside.

The people are complaining. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) There is no hard and fast rule, you can keep the garbage. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Azwer, you are saying that - ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) The police are helping in the clearing of garbage. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, this is what I am saying. This policeman thinks he is - ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) The policeman seems to be going beyond his powers. Give those particulars to us and we will handle it.

1099 1100

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Please do that. It is the Narahenpita Police. You can speak to the OIC. I have also spoken to him and he says that it is necessary. This should not become a police job. It is an environmental issue. These are matters on which the police have to be educated. The people put the garbage in bags and keep them outside so that the garbage collector can come and collect them when he comes. They know the three days he is coming and keep their garbage outside on those three days. When the people go to work, they leave them by the roadside. Then, the policeman comes searching for them. He is creating problems. This has to stop.

Now, we will take the estates. In the estates every line room has a pavement and drains. These are supposed to be maintained by the management. In every estate, we have a Plantation Human Development Trust which has welfare officers and medical officers. They are supposed to look after the hygiene in the estate. But today, the plantation companies are neglecting the maintenance of these drains and they have not provided for the water from these drains to drain out properly. Most of the drains that should carry this water away are broken today. They have not been maintained and if there is water stagnant around the line rooms, the worker in the line room is taken to the police station and charged and he has to pay up to Rs. 3,000.

Sir, Rs. 3,000 means a week's salary. The whole economy of that family is totally disturbed by this process. If at all they want to prosecute, they should prosecute the management, which is supposed to build and maintain those drains. Similarly, the plantation companies are building toilets or the PHDT is building toilets, or the NGOs are coming to the estates and building toilets, always with the permission of the management. But, when they build these toilets, they provide a very small septic tank, just dug around without any building. Most of these tanks are so small that they start overflowing. If at any time a septic tank starts to overflow and a policeman happens to drop into that estate, immediately the resident is taken to the police station, produced before a magistrate and then fined, maybe Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 5,000. Sir, Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 5,000 is a large sum of money for a man who earns Rs. 500 a day. Their whole economics for the next three months gets disturbed. Their lifestyle is such that they have to sacrifice a lot to survive for the next three months to overcome this deficit of Rs. 3,000. So, this is an issue that is not relevant to the policeman. Do not use the police to oversee the environment in the estates.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Who should do this? You suggest.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) There are Public Health Inspectors. There is an EMA - Estate Medical Assistant, then, there is a Welfare Officer. These are the people who should come and - ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Public Health Inspectors are there only in towns, in Municipal Councils. They cannot go out.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I am not talking about the Municipal Council, Hon. Azwer, I am talking about an estate. The Public Health Inspector should do this or the Estate Medical Assistant or the Welfare Officer should advise people, should supervise and maintain the environment. They should be a part of a team that will ensure hygiene and not prosecute people and collect revenue for the Government through these small issues. This is building up a lot of hatred towards the Government, which is unnecessary. We understand, we agree that there has to be hygiene. But, hygiene can be introduced in a less punitive, a more persuasive way than you are doing today.

Sir, I now come to the other issue. Livestock farming or rearing cattle for milk is being encouraged in the plantations. My late Leader, the Hon. Savumiamoorthy Thondaman took the Ministry of Livestock Development under Rural Industries mainly because he wanted to promote dairy farming in the plantations because those people have the aptitude to rear these animals. There is land and there is also grass available in the estates. So, that was an ideal economic activity for the plantation worker. But again here, they have a cattle shed. The urine and the water used for the animals flow out, which is normally diverted to a hole or a large well-like thing so that the water seeps into the ground. That is the only way that they can do it economically. They have not still found a better way. Even the Animal Husbandry Department does not have a plan to have a septic tank through which only pure water will flow out. That should be ideal. They have to design something like that. It maybe costly but still worthwhile. But, it is not being done. So, the water that gets collected, if it overflows through the hole that has been dug, then the police prosecute the residents. Because these people are in an economic activity -

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Why did you not inform us? This is the first time I am hearing about it. Will you please let me know? We will instruct the police officers not to do these things.

1101 1102

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Definitely. I can even produce hundreds of receipts of the fines paid by these people.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Please let me know. I will attend to that. We can instruct the senior officials of the police to examine this.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) We have to solve this issue. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Definitely. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) So,when this gets filled up and overflows, the police come and prosecute them. They take them to court. Because they are involved in an economic activity they are fined Rs. 6,000 - Rs. 8,000. The profit for the whole month - ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. Udith Lokubandara to take the Chair? ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) I propose that the Hon. Udith Lokubandara do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

, .

, , . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. UDITH LOKUBANDARA took the Chair.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) So, if a person has one animal, he may be earning about Rs. 15,000 a month. If he pays Rs. 8,000 as a fine, then where does he go? He gets into debt. So, this has to be attended to.

Now having talked about dairy, I like to go into the issue of milk. Recently, we saw in Hatton - from where the Hon. Minister for Livestock and Rural Community Development hails - people throwing milk on the streets. Following that, there was a Deputy Minister who went to Nuwara Eliya and gave a cup of milk to each student last Friday. Yesterday, that cup of milk was not given. The reason is that those people are paid only Rs. 50 per litre for supplying the milk. The farm gate price fixed by the Government for milk is Rs. 50. Can you have farm gate prices when milk is delivered to the Divisional Secretarys Office? This is the problem. So, the milk suppliers refused to supply milk yesterday and this scheme which is part of the "Mahinda Chintana" - ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Farm gate price is a good price. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is a good price. ( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Then, what is the problem? . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Because the person who is delivering milk is the collector. He cannot supply milk at the farm gate price itself. You have to be realistic. So, the expectation has been created in the minds of these students that they will get a cup of milk everyday. Within four days, what was said in the "Mahinda Chintana" as a glass of milk for every child, has now been nullified because whoever brought that scheme did it very short-sightedly. They did not have a plan of action. They did not know how to do it. If they had originally decided how much they could pay, had a contract with the supplier, then got the milk and introduced to the children, you would not have let them down today. Last evening, we saw on TV, a lot of children saying, "This is a good thing. We were looking forward to it but we did not get it today". The good that you went to do has become bad to you. You should have been a little more conscious of the whole situation before you introduced a scheme like this. Going into the economy of milk production itself - the Hon. C.B. Rathnayake who was the former Minister for Estate Infrastructure and Livestock Development was here and he started this Debate - the whole economy of milk production in this country has to be reviewed. We have seen milk being thrown out. When you take a 400-gram packet of milk powder, on the packet it is stated that 3.2 litres of liquid milk can be made from it, and on a one-kilo packet of milk powder, it is stated that eight litres of

1103 1104

2012 24

milk can be made from it. The cost of a 400-gram packet of milk powder in March was Rs. 246. When you divide it by 3.2 litres, it works out to Rs. 76 per litre of milk, whereas the National Livestock Development Board is selling half a litre of milk packetted in polythene bags - fresh milk, just once boiled which is called pasteurized - at Rs. 55. This works out to Rs. 110 per litre. The farm gate price is Rs. 50 but to deliver a litre of polythene-packed pasteurized milk, it is Rs. 110.

So, the added value is Rs. 60. As I said earlier, Nestle produces their milk powder in Sri Lanka; Lanka Milk Foods PLC produces their milk powder, Lakspray, in Sri Lanka and Highland also produces their milk powder in Sri Lanka. They buy the liquid milk at Rs. 50 per litre, turn it into milk powder, packet it, advertise it, distribute it through distributors and retailers, allowing their profits and commissions and still sell it at Rs. 76 per litre. Why is it that the NLDB, Highland or Milco sell at such high prices? As I said, the NLDB is selling 500 millilitres of liquid milk at Rs. 55, whereas the Highland is selling 450 millilitres at Rs. 55, which works out to Rs. 122 per litre. So, how can we promote drinking of liquid milk when milk powder was available at Rs. 76 in March and subsequently in April, without getting permission from the Consumer Affairs Authority, the price was increased from Rs. 246 to Rs. 264. That means, in April, the price of a 400-gram packet of milk powder was increased by Rs. 18. At present, it is Rs. 322. Even at Rs. 322, one litre of liquid milk costs only Rs. 100. It is more convenient because we can make our milk or tea at any time from a packet of milk powder and it is easier to maintain the quality than liquid milk, which can get spoilt if you do not refrigerate it or if you boil it too much. So, with convenience and cheaper price, milk powder will continue to be sold rather than liquid milk. Therefore, for liquid milk consumption to increase, it is very important that we reduce the price of liquid milk.

Why is the cost of liquid milk so high? Because, we have two plants for Milco (Pvt.) Limited, one in Colombo and the other in Kandy. The milk is transported from various areas to Kandy, processed and then transported again to the consumer points. This should have been decentralized. If it has not been done in the past, at least hereafter it should be decentralized, so that a polythene-packed 500-millilitre of liquid milk can be sold maybe at Rs. 35 so that one litre of liquid milk will cost Rs. 70. From Rs. 50, value addition of Rs. 20 is not something which people would accept. If it is not a product of Rs. 50 or Rs. 60, then it is something that people will not accept and they will resist. So, who is going to take action on this? In addition, we all know when we were children, fresh milk were delivered to our homes but today that practice does not exist. I think we have to go back to that practice. I even asked from some people in the estates where cows are being reared whether they buy the milk from the dairy farmer within the estate. They do not do it. They themselves buy liquid milk packets or milk powder

packets. So, this has to change and there has to be a consistent policy of the Government to promote milk, not by advertisements but by making it economical. Thank you.

I quoted that section from the " ". In order to protect the environment in this country, what more do you require than the concepts enunciated in the "Mahinda Chintana"? The President has devoted a whole chapter to that in the "Mahinda Chintana". " , - " " " . " , " 53 " " . Sir, I table* the English translation of that same chapter to be included in Hansard because it is very important.

, , "". - - , .

His Excellency the President, who loves the environment, lives with the nature and loves not only human beings - children and the old - but even the animals, will be travelling within a week or so to attend the famous environmental conference - Rio 2012 Earth Summit - that will be staged in Rio de Janeiro. So, that is the contribution he has made for the improvement of environment in all fields.

Sir, we travelled with the President to attend the Doha Economic Forum for a better future - my good Friend, the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, was also there - at which he was made the Guest Speaker, the Chief Guest and he was the only Head of the nation who was given that prestigious position. To that Summit, 600 delegates attended from all parts of the world. There too, he stressed on the importance of protecting the environment, the concept, the philosophy or the principle he is following in Sri Lanka, and he would stress on it further at the Rio 2012 Earth Summit. So, he has already taken up the responsibily of guiding our Ministers and Members especially of the party in order to see that the environment is protected.

Then, Sir, my dear Friend, the worthy Deputy Minister of Environment, the Hon. A.R.M. Abdul Cader, reminded this House that Sri Lanka, in 1978, recognized the right to life as a fundamental right and that the right of every person to live is recognized especially by Articles 11 and 13(4) of the Constitution and the said Articles, further, implicitly guarantee the right to quality of life. He has studied the Constitution very well and we appreciate his comments.

Now, the Hon. Minister of Environment is seeking approval for the Regulations before the House today. Sir, the Ministry of Environment is considered very important today all over the world. The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, Minister of Environment, once attended the environmental conference in Nagoya, Japan. Simultaneously, I attended another conference at another venue. There too, they stressed the point that the environment must be protected for the welfare of the future generation. For humanity to thrive on earth, there must be a well-protected environment. Even the great Buddhist leaders, Muslim leaders and teachers have stressed on it. What did Lord Buddha say?

. " .

, :

.

. ? . . . .

, . ? ; . . . .

Sir, on the other hand, our Holy Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi wa Sallam also has stressed upon this when he says to his followers, Do not cut trees even during the time of war. Protect them. Do not remove even a leaf. Do not harm the children and the old people and also protect the nature. That is how the great religious teachers have taught us the virtue of protecting the nature, Sir. So, such a leader, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa has also stressed upon this in his political philosophy, "Mahinda Chintana".

What has the "Daily News" and the "Maubima" newspapers published today? See how this great leader has been accepted by the world community. The "Daily News" of 24th May, 2012 states, I quote :

More than 91 percent endorse Presidents policies - Gallop poll

1125 1126

* . * . * Produced at end of speech.

. , . . I further quote:

A Gallop poll revealed that President Mahinda Rajapaksa has garnered the support of more than 91 percent of the population due to his farsighted policies in terms of the economy and peace building.

Nine out of 10 Sri Lankans approve President Rajapaksas job performance, the Gallop polls website reported yesterday.

It has been told only yesterday, Sir, after the war, the whole process of development is taking place. Where was this poll conducted? You will be surprised to hear that. This was conducted in no other country than the United States of America.

This further states, I quote:

It said economic stability and peace dividends have tremendously helped retain peoples confidence in the President.

It was President Rajapaksa who put the country back on the development track after eradicating terrorism which plagued the country for more than 30 years.

What happened during the time of war with the LTTE? They cut, fell and destroyed thousands of acres of palmyrah trees.

? '' . . '' . '' ; . , child soldiers , . . . . .

In Iraq, they have date farms. It is the largest country that exports dates. The whole thing was destroyed. It is an inhuman act. It is better to kill people than destroy the environment and the trees that bear fruits.

Sir, "Daily News" of 24th May, 2012 further states, I quote:

Sri Lankas economy recorded an unprecedented growth with President Rajapaksa coming to power and it expanded further with the dawn of peace in the country.

The countrys economy grew by 8.3 percent last year.

It could have gone to over 8.5 or 8.9 percent..

We could have gone forward and reached more than that had the weather favoured the agriculture sector. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I think it should be three minutes.

Sir, the RMV handles the issuing of anti-pollution certificate. They test vehicles which are over three years old. They have established workshops to check the emission and if it is within the required range, they issue the certificate. Every year they issue this. When the Colombo Municipal Council was headed by Mr. Omar Kamil, he had taken a lot of trouble in this sphere. He used to send Dr. Ruwan Wijemuni, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health to Thailand and Australia to attend seminars organized by the UN to control emission.

The main emission is from transport. There are 200,000 vehicles coming into the City and they enter through six gates. One is from the Kelani Ganga entry point. The other gates are located in Dehiwala, Kohuwala-Pamankada area, Nugegoda, Sri Jayewardenepura and Wellampitiya areas. These are the places through which the vehicles enter the City. Therefore, Sir, it is very important to give serious consideration to the air pollution by the smoke emitted by this large amount of vehicles entering the City daily.

The Central Environmental Authority was established by the former President R. Premadasa. Its first President was Mr. K.H.J. Wijedasa. He did a wonderful job of work which is being now followed and even further improved by Dr. Charitha Herath. Maligawatta was cited as a beautiful surrounding. Now, you must pay attention to those housing schemes where you can build small parks and improve the environment for the benefit of the people there. They created those urban jungles amidst housing schemes.

While we are conscious of the fact that environment must be protected, we must also not be too cautious in this matter because a lots of development projects can be delayed due to these strictures. They sometimes take two years to give approval to some projects that need immediate development. .

Today Sir, I have got a complaint from the Valaichenai Farmers' Welfare Association. What has happened there? Anyway, our Minister was good enough to relax some of the regulations the other day in Parliament through a declaration. Now, unlicensed people come - you must pay serious attention to this. I spoke to the SSP, Batticaloa also in this regard. - dig paddy fields

and take away sand. GS, Mr. Hanifa who is known to all the Members of Parliament brought this to our notice.

The other matter that I want to stress upon is this. Wherever we go, we must be able to help Environmental Police to do their job. I do not know what the Hon. Yogarajan was crying about. It is said that there is a silver lining in every dark cloud. But as far as the Hon. Yogarajan is concerned, there is a dark cloud in every silver lining. The Environmental Police is doing a wonderful job like in Malaysia and Singapore. Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the able Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development has done a wonderful job. See how he has beautified "Diyawanna Oya" around Parliament. Let them see if they have eyes. Some of our foreign relations who came here said, This is better than the Lake Geneva in Switzerland. It is to that extent that they have developed this area. It is the Environmental Police that is carrying out the massive beautification work in the Colombo City. People do not litter roads anymore. Even in outstations people fear to do that for the Environmental Police; they will come and arrest them.

Now, I would like to quote a few verses from Salalihini Vivaranaya written by Mr. Kumaratunga Munidasa. See, how beautifully he has described the city in "Salalihini Sandeshaya" This was dreamt by Ven. Thotagamuwe Sri Rahula Himipano.

* : * : * English translation of chapter tabled: A LAND IN HARMONY WITH NATURE

A sustainable Policy for Environmental Conservation

O King, you are not the ruler of this land, but the custodian, preached Arahat Mahinda, upon arrival in this country, to King Devanampiyatissa. Had we acted according to that advice in the past, the

world would not have probably faced the scarcity of resources, environmental pollution, and the resultant droughts, floods and natural disasters.

My aim is to promote sustainable development in close liaison with the land, fauna and flora, and to bestow our natural heritage to our future generations.

Our biodiversity is among the worlds heritage. I will not let it be alienated. The State ownership of our oceanic resources, water, aquatic life, forests and natural resources will be ensured.

The Haritha Piyasa programme will be implemented to reforest the hill-country, slopes and protected watershed areas with species endemic to Sri Lanka.

I consider cruelty to animals a disgrace on humanity. I therefore propose to amend, without delay, the outdated laws on prevention of cruelty to animals.

Steps will be taken to promote commercial forestry in view of meeting the timber requirements of the nation.

I will implement an accelerated programme to solve the urban solid waste problem. Waste management systems will be established regionally within the next six years which will produce compost out of urban solid waste.

Processes will be initiated to gradually eliminate the usage of polythene, and to introduce substitutes. All State institutions concerning environmental protection will be brought under the Ministry of Environment.
