( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) , , . : : NON-BRIEFING OF NATIONAL ACTION PLAN TO PARLIAMENT: STATEMENT BY CHIEF GOVERNMENT WHIP

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena - Minister of Water Supply and Drainage and Chief Government Whip) I would like to reply to the question raised by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition yesterday. The Government has given careful consideration to the

221 222

questions that the Hon. Leader of the Opposition raised and I would like to state that our Government embarked on the formulation of the National Action Plan for Protection and Promotion of Human Rights in response to a call from our people who are sovereign and in this process, we have examined all aspects of human rights in our country which had been historically colonized for a long time and has now emerged from the blood, sweat and tears of an internecine conflict.

It must also be borne in mind that this is also our countrys response to the Vienna Declaration and programme of action adopted at the World Conference on Human Rights in Austria in 1993 in which contracting States agreed to accede to a request that each State considers the desirability of drawing up a National Action Plan identifying the steps each State would take to improve the protection and promotion of human rights.

It is important to remember that in the course of the Universal Periodic Review held before the UN Human Rights Council sessions in May 2008, Sri Lanka made a voluntary pledge to develop a National Action Plan to reaffirm its commitment to protect and promote the human rights of all our citizens. Consequent to the pledge that was made at the UPR, the then Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights was empowered with the task of facilitating the formulation of a National Action Plan. Hon. Speaker, the process began with a stocktaking of the human rights situation in the country which involved a desk review of several key documents including the Universal Periodic Review Report on Sri Lanka, recommendations of treaty bodies under various UN Human Rights Conventions and recommendations of special procedure mechanisms. This led to the identification of the following national priority areas:

1. Civil and Political Rights

2. Economic, Social and Cultural Rights

3. Torture

4. Children

5. Labour

6. Migrant Workers

7. Women

8. Internally Displaced Persons.

A number of issue-based consultations were held thereafter and wider consultations with civil society representatives were held in February 2009. Drafting committees were appointed on the eight thematic areas consisting of 6-10 experts in each area drawn from the government and non-government sectors. The legal framework, policies and practices in each area were examined by the eight committees and thematic Action

Plans were drafted. The draft plans were then reviewed by a 10-Member Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee. The plans as revised by the Steering Committee were then put to civil society. Focus group discussions on each of the eight thematic areas were held in 2010 to which over 240 organizations and individuals were invited to present their views and comments. There was also a follow-up meeting of the drafting committees and the steering committee providing an opportunity for the drafting committees to understand the rationale for the revisions to the Action Plan and for further discussion on important provisions to be included in the Plan. The Action Plan was further revised and finalized following the focus group discussions and meeting in May 2011.

The National Action Plan, therefore, has been formulated after many months of consultation in which the Government and civil society played an active role. In other words, there had been a participatory and deliberative process where all shades of opinion were duly considered on the above-mentioned eight thematic areas. It must be appreciated that the National Action Plan whilst providing a detailed policy and legislative programme to give life to fundamental rights and freedoms also contemplates the widening of the scope of these rights and freedoms.

Hon. Speaker, the Government recognizes the need to allocate adequate financial and other resources for implementation of the Plan. It is committed to providing necessary funds in view of the significance of the issues covered by the Action Plan and the need to realize its goals for the betterment of all the people of Sri Lanka. The Plan was structured with the objective in general to include priority areas and of its implementation to be completed within 5 years. Each of the eight thematic areas is in the form of a matrix consisting of focus area, goal, issue, activities, key performance indicators, time frame and key responsible agencies.

The aim in general was to include priority areas and not all areas for action as the Plan is time-bound and could not realistically cover every issue which may need to be addressed. Nevertheless, as is evident from a reading of the Plan, many aspects of each thematic area has been comprehensively covered. The responsibility of implementation and monitoring of the National Action Plan on Human Rights was given to a Cabinet Subcommittee to be supported by a monitoring committee consisting of senior Government officials from across the sectors. The monitoring committee will engage with civil society and maintain a dialogue through which problems in implementation of the Plan at ground level could be reported to the Cabinet Subcommittee. It is expected to have wider citizen participation in monitoring and providing feedback on the implementation of the Plan through setting up of a website as well as communication through other social media. After a lengthy process of review, discussion, dialogue and in-

223 224

[ ]

2012 23

depth examination of all the issues concerned, the Plan was finalized and submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers, which granted approval for implementation of same at its meeting on 14th September, 2011.

Hon. Speaker, should the Hon. Leader of the Opposition not be paying a tribute to the Government instead of throwing brickbats at an excellent document that will ensure and assure the constitutional guarantees to our people? If he is a true democratic Leader, he should be commending the timely action taken by the Government. We know why the Leader of the Opposition wants to raise all these now. The whole country knows that he works on a secret agenda to vilify the Government. But, in doing so, he, in effect, is tarnishing the image of Sri Lanka in the eyes of the international community.

I wish to remind the Hon. Leader of the Opposition that he should follow the example of his counterparts in our neighbouring countries. Leaders of Opposition in those countries in matters related to the international community or external affairs work in harmony with the Government of the day and defend the sovereignty of their countries.

Hon. Speaker, what was pledged in Geneva must go back to Geneva. The pledge to Geneva was on behalf of our people, so should be the fruits of labour of such pledge. This is not a part of our legislative process which we have been entrusted with by virtue of the sovereignty of our people. It is a process that finds roots in the sovereignty of our people. It will be well to remember that the objectives of directive principles of our State policy and fundamental duties where the State has pledged to establish in our country a democratic socialist society includes the full realization of fundamental rights and freedom of our people amongst other objectives.

Reference has been made to the Action Plan several times on the Floor of this House and I invite the Leader of the Opposition to touch his conscience with genuineness and sincerity and point to any aspect of the National Action Plan, which will not or does not enhance and sustain the fundamental freedoms and directive principles, and the high values enshrined in our Constitution and the Universal Declaration.

Hon. Speaker, one begins to wonder whether the Leader of the Opposition has become the proxy of the so-called international community, which wishes this country to be in the doldrums so as to enable them to unduly interfere in the reconciliation and development of this country, as we have seen in the case of other nations in the recent past.

Hon. Speaker, we will certainly move in this House a legislative amendment, if the need arises, to bring such an amendment that will give life to the full implementation of the National Action Plan.

This has been debated by the people. The debate has already taken place. The Action Plan has been distributed across the country. The collective responsibility that he so earnestly speaks of, we are ready to take on, having in mind our obligations under Article 42 of the Constitution. I hope that this will lay his mind at rest and induce him to join hands with us in raising our country to new horizons of freedom and progress.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, I rise to a point of Order. Sir, I raised a point of importance, as you know, yesterday. I did not refer to anyone personally. I did not criticize anyone personally. I expected the Government to reply one way or the other without going there. Unfortunately, some of the references to me are wrong and I have the right to reply in this House .

Firstly, I must thank the Chief Government Whip for giving us a detailed issue of how the National Action Plan came along. But, I still stand by if this was done under the Vienna Declaration. Hon. Minister, you should have tabled this in the House long ago so that we could have discussed it. It certainly makes it worse if it was done under the Vienna Declaration because up to date, no copy of the National Action Plan has been given to the House. Hon. Speaker you can look at it. If that was so, I would not have had to raise this issue. - [Interruption.] But, this was in 2011. So, this should have come to the House at least to be taken up in the Committee Stage of the Budget. That is all I am saying. You were attacking me because I have said that this was not placed before the House; whether it was done deliberately or by mistake, I do not know.

Secondly, I have nowhere gone near to talk about the country. As you know, Hon. Speaker, we have not even asked for an Adjournment Debate on the LLRC Report until the United Nations Human Rights Council Meeting in Geneva is over, because there are certain things we want to say and we do not want that to get confused with the meeting in Geneva. That is a different matter that you all have to deal with. We will domestically talk about democratic rights. We will continue talking about it. I have also said that we accept the LLRC Report. The Government has not even told me what they are doing, instead of which I am getting attacks saying that I am working for foreigners. What the UNP has done is to say that the Opposition parties have to get together - [Interruption.] You have to listen to me now. All I am doing is, I am only taking up this - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

225 226

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) This is an important issue for the country and for the House. This is a matter for me to talk with the Chief Government Whip. As far as I know, I think it is up to the Government to explain it to me. It is you all who have gone and agreed. On the 15th of February, the Minister of External Affairs said that the UN approach - [Interruption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, this is a Ministerial Statement. It does not apply - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) There should be a seamless connectivity between your approach and that of the LLRC. You all agreed to it. Secondly, you all agreed -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . debate . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) No, I am only explaining my position. While they agreed on that, we have said very specifically in this House - [Interruption.] Let me finish this. I have said over and over again that we do not accept war crimes. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) No, let us get to the point. You wanted the LLRC Report to be tabled in Parliament. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I did not ask - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The Government agreed to table it in Parliament and we tabled that in Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) We did not ask the Government to table it in Parliament. You all tabled that in Parliament. I thank you for that.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) One moment. - [Interruption.] We tabled it in Parliament and an assurance was given that we are ready to discuss about it in the Select Committee. You all have boycotted participating in the Select Committee. Hon. Leader of the Opposition, do not now - [Interruption.] We have been wanting you to nominate Members to the Select Committee, but you did not do so. Now, you say that there is no follow up. There has been a follow-up. I must very categorically state that there has been a follow-up. Why are you not nominating your Members to the Select Committee so that the Select Committee can proceed on the LLRC Report? - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) The Select Committee was appointed before the LLRC Report. So, do not mislead the House. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Samaraweera, the Government was ready. The Government has made an announcement that the LLRC Report can be taken up at the Select Committee. But, you all are not participating in the Select Committee. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake - Deputy Minister of Health) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) There is a point of Order being raised. - [Interruption.] .

( ) (The Hon. Lalith Dissanayake) , .

227 228

2012 23

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . . . .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. According to Standing Order No. 23(4), you clearly mentioned that it is a Ministerial Statement and there is no precedence in this House where a Ministerial Statement has been debated. Sir, therefore, all what he said must be expunged. His masters are Yankees. We know that. His masters are Yankees and the man who is doing all the damage is seated on his right. Sir, all what he said must be expunged. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . , . . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) So, Hon. Speaker, I do not want to say anything more except for one important point. I back what the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera said. But, if you say that you are going to discuss the LLRC Report, then we will be there, because this was done before the LLRC Report. We will move an amendment. After that, we can all come and take part. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Can you first tell the House why you are not nominating your Members to the Select Committee? ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) When you - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Why are you not nominating Members for the Select Committee? There are enough issues to be discussed. All issues can be discussed. The Government has very openly stated that. How can you now -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ; .

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) The Government and the Opposition agreed on the text of the Resolution. - [Interruption.] We both agreed on the text of the Resolution and you are going back on it. That is what has happened. Why are you going back? ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) No, we did not.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, I want to congratulate the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, our Member, has been elected as the President of the Bar Association. He is the first Member of the House to be elected as the President of the Bar Association. So, I would like very much to join the Chief Government Whip in congratulating him. It is an honour. Since he is a Member of Parliament, there were questions raised as to whether a politician could be the President of the Bar Association. This was done without any party politics. Taking into account the services he has done for the Bar, let him function as the President of the Bar Association, irrespective of party politics. Inside this House, he will do so in accordance with the Chief Whip of the Party. Sir, we have the oldest Supreme Court in Asia and we have the oldest Bar. Therefore, it is only proper that we should hold high standards that are associated with the legal profession, to which I also belong.

Hon. Speaker, I join the House in commending him and I will also be sending my amendment to the Chief Government Whip.

[2.54 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would like to take this opportunity to raise a matter of national importance, which I believe would be of great concern to all those who value democracy and the freedom of expression.

As we are all aware, Sir, monitoring telephones, listening to telephone conversations, tapping telephones or hacking into telephones and monitoring the internet have become a standard practice in many countries in the world that are waging war against international terror. But, in most countries such practice is controlled by stringent laws and regulations, which ensure that such laws are not abused by those in power by using it against democratically dissenting voices or against the democratic opposition. However, I am sorry to say, in Sri Lanka today, nearly three years after the LTTE was decisively defeated - as the Government likes to remind the country frequently - the interception of telephone calls as well as the monitoring of the internet, including e-mails has reached epidemic proportions at the moment. I am giving you these facts with full responsibility. Using the latest technology, websites which expose the waste and corruption of this regime are hacked into and blocked, and in fact we know that there is a special officer in the Presidents House - one Miss Anoma Lafir, a sister of our Ambassador in Washington, who is actually being tasked to monitor the web each morning and then according to her instructions, some websites are immediately blocked and banned.

However, at this moment, I must actually stress that I am not accusing anyone of - specially not the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama; I do not think he is even aware of this - and I am certainly not accusing the Ministry of Telecommunication and Information Technology, as it is known now. The Minister and the Secretary are not even aware of this. But, with responsibility I say that this outrageous infringement on our privacy and human rights is being carried out by the Ministry of Defence along with the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission, which now comes under His Excellency the President. According to the Act which I brought to Parliament in 1997, it should be under the Ministry of Telecommunication. In fact, the Secretary of the Ministry of Telecommunication should be the Chairman of the TRC. But, today for obvious reasons - perhaps obvious to them more than to us - it has been brought under the President. I again say with responsibility and I have access to a list of 687 persons, whose phones are tapped and hacked into on a regular basis. I can assure you that if you see these names, you will be surprised. The ones whose phones are being tampered with and listened to, are certainly not in any way terrorists. In fact, I am sorry to say, even the religious clergy of this country have not

been spared by the prying ears of the Ministry of Defence. There are members not only of the religious clergy, but members and captains of industry. Of course, there are many of us here in the Opposition, but what is perhaps of interest to you, Sir, - I again say with responsibility - that in this list of phones being hacked into by the Defence Ministry people, there are 102 names of Members of the Government including 29 Senior Cabinet Ministers. I mean, this is not terrorism. There cannot be terrorists within the Government. This is paranoia of the worst order. Then of course, there are three Chief Ministers in this list, many newspaper editors and dozens of journalists and as I said some captains of industry who are the bastions of respectability. I do not know for what reason these phones are being monitored. But, what is even more surprising is that, as you rightly said - as technology is moving rapidly everyday - you need the latest and highest forms of technology to hack into phones; even to read the private e-mails of people, the technology - again I say with responsibility here on the Floor of this House - has been provided by two Chinese companies: Huawei and ZTE. These are the names of the two companies that provide this technology for the Defence Ministry to tap your phones and ours.

In fact, according to the article published in www.eurasianet.org and quoted in http://groundviews.org., Huawei and ZTE have signed contracts worth tens of millions of US Dollars with some Central Asian countries not known for their democratic credentials. In fact, I quote from that article which appeared in www.eurasianet.org on 15th February, 2012. It states:

'Over time, authoritarian-minded Central Asian leaders have come to appreciate cooperation with Chinese telecom firms as a useful means of bolstering their authority, rights advocates assert. Some civil society groups argue that Huawei and others are willing to assist the Turkmen government......' "

That is one of the dictatorships in Central Asia. It goes on to say, I quote:

in monitoring cell phone and internet use in exchange for lucrative deals.

As they say, these two companies are the biggest investors in infrastructure in this country. Maybe the Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena is aware of it. In fact, Huawei and ZTE have some lucrative multimillion dollar deals in Sri Lanka. The overwhelming majority of mobile, broadband, internet access devices sold in Sri Lanka by Mobitel, Dialog, Etisalat and Airtel are all made either by Huawei or ZTE. According to the information I have, the value of contracts signed by these two companies are far bigger than the contract signed by the Central Asian dictatorships. In June 2011, the SLT awarded Rs. 3 billion - US Dollars 27 million - worth of fibre-optic network rollout contract to ZTE Corporation as part of the i-Sri Lanka project and SLTs ADSL infrastructure is also underpinned by Huawei technologies. In fact, the Indian telecom firm Bharti

247 248

2012 23

Airtel had signed a US Dollar 150 million deal with China to set up a mobile phone network in Sri Lanka some years ago. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) They are competitive in the market. Even Americans buy that. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) The question here - () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) These are all private players who have these agreements. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I am not questioning the award of the contracts. I am questioning the role these two companies are playing in Sri Lanka. This is what I am talking about. - [Interruption.] Oh my God! It has a lot to do with the Government. These deals are done by the Defence Ministry and the Defence Ministry is using their technology to tap your phones and our phones. That, I must say with responsibility. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. What is your point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, my point of Order is this. He is indiscriminately using the names of the Ministers and others in the Defence Ministry. This has nothing to do with the Defence Ministry, Sir. He is addressing the Geneva - [Interruption.] He is the man - when he was the Minister - who brought a special message , and - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) He did not mention any name. That is not a point of Order, Hon. Azwer. You may carry on with your speech, Hon. Member.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) I am trying to show you that these two Chinese companies, ZTE and Huawei, have invested much more than even the Central Asian dictatorships because they have got lucrative deals here. As a matter of fact, Sir, the pervasive Chinese investment managed to raise a few eyebrows even in Washington. A diplomatic cable sent by the Colombo Embassy in Washington in December 2009 says Huawei Telecommunications, a Chinese owned corporation has worked diligently to corner the telecom infrastructure in Sri lanka" - [Interruption.] Hon. Namal Rajapaksa, can you please control this clown

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

of yours? He is only dancing because you came. Now, he is trying to impress you. So, please ask him to sit down.- [Interruption.] Sir, it is also a well-known fact that - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please sit down.- [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) These companies in question are experts in their ability to hack into key computer systems and many countries with dismal human rights records value their service to clamp down on human rights activism and advocacy. And, as I said earlier, the quid pro quo for these two companies for getting the lions share - or perhaps we should say the dragons share because it is Chinese - of the Sri Lankan market has been to provide the Rajapaksa regime with the sophisticated technology needed to suppress the democratic rights of the people of Asias oldest democracy. In fact, that is why I could not help but - [Interruption.] -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) A little while ago, Sir, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena in his response to the Leader of the Opposition, said that the Government is committed to uphold the fundamental rights of the people. I ask the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, I ask this Government, is this how you uphold the fundamental rights of the people by hacking into the telephones and computer systems of the democratic dissent of the people of this country? Is that how you protect the fundamental rights of these people by hacking

249 250

into the telephones of Senior Cabinet Ministers? Is this how you protect the fundamental rights of the people of this country?

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Now, wind up please.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) [Interruption.] - and by even listening to the telephone calls of the Mahanayakas; I say with responsibility. -[Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please!

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, give me just two minutes. - [Interruption.] Finally, if this continues - [Interruption.] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena - Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning) We must bring a Motion of Privilege. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Yes, Sir. He cannot make use of the names of the Ministers. It is a serious matter.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, he is the man who bugged all the telephones by bringing a big machine when he was the Minister. [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Please sit down. Hon. Azwer, I cannot hear you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is addressing the Geneva Conference; he is not addressing the Parliament of Sri Lanka. Shameless man! . .

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena, . ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) - [Interruption.] - the Peace Committee has barred Sri Lanka's Major General from its Committee. This is a great shame on Sri Lanka.
