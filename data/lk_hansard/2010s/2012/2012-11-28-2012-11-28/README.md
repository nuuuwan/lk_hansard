Now, Sir, annually we make these allocations for the respective Ministries and Departments for the purpose of maintenance of all State organs and also with the expectation that the people will get the best benefit out of public funds, which are being spent through the Executive, but certainly with the approval of the Legislature - that is this House. Now, Sir, the biggest problem in this respective field, the Ministry of Justice and the administration of justice is not the amount that you have allocated for the maintenance of these judicial institutions, but whether the independence is upheld or not. However much you have allocated from public funds, it does not mean that it will help the people of this country unless the independence of the Judiciary is guaranteed and the Rule of Law is upheld. That is the sole purpose of having judicial institutions in this country and all these juridical institutions have been recognized by the Constitution. Therefore, unlike in any other Ministry, the quantum or the amount that has been allocated is not the most significant aspect, but what is most significant is whether under the prevailing system, there will be independence of the Judiciary to render justice to each and every one from top to bottom.

As you know, in a democratic form of government, the government is there for the people; not that the people are there for the government but the government is there for the people. The Government consists of three organs: the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary, and in their respective subjects and the scope of their objectives, they are equally independent. There has to be an equally independent situation, otherwise, if one of the organs or one of the pillars is weak, that means there cannot be any democracy. That is why in the famous Gettysburg Speech made by Abraham Lincoln in 1863 he said, Democracy is the government of the people, by the people, for the people. Therefore, what is significant, what is important, is not the government, but the people. For the better manifestation of their rights, liberties, privileges and entitlement, all three organs of the Government have to act as caretakers or custodians.

Therefore, I am not concerned and the people of this country are not concerned about the amount that has been allocated but still, the people are more concerned as to what extent the independence of the Judiciary has been maintained and protected by the Executive and the Legislature. I am glad the Hon. Minister of Justice, being a lawyer, is also here. The attitude which is being developed in this society is that the Judiciary is at the mercy of the Legislature and the Executive at the moment. I think that is very dangerous. There had been periods in this country with similar situations where the Judiciary had been at the mercy of the Executive and the Legislature. As a result, people have lost faith in the system. It is not a distorted fact, if I may say. Of course, the people of this country do not have much faith in the Executive and the Legislature because that has been deteriorated due to various reasons, over time. But still,

up to recent times, people had faith in the judicial system. But, now, there are certain grey areas with regard to the maintenance of the independence of the Judiciary.

Mr. Presiding Member, this is not what people have been bestowed with due to the sympathy or the mercy of the Legislature and the Executive. As far back as 1215, when the Magna Carta Agreement was entered into between King John and the then Legislature, that was about 800 years ago, there had been a clause even at that time to say To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice. That is the main criterion on which the Westminster system of government has been developed. Since ours was a colony under the British Empire, we have also inherited that system. Although there are loopholes, lapses, disadvantages and various other matters, we will have to concede that certain safeguards have been made both in the Constitution and in the ordinary laws of the land, during that period to maintain the Judiciary as an independent institution. Therefore, there was not much debate about the threat to the independence of the Judiciary during the colonial period.

Now, you may recall the most famous case which had been decided as far back as in 1930s, I think the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardenas father also played a key role in that case. When Mark Anthony Lyster Bracegirdle, being a white man, a Britisher, an estate superintendent, when he was arrested, there was an order given to deport him, to send him back. The case was taken up before the Supreme Court of this country and ironically all three judges were appointed by the British Government. The Chief Justice, Sir Sidney Solomon Abrahams, Justice Soertsz and Justice Maartensz, all three judges who had been appointed by the British Empire, held that the order given by the Governor-General in Sri Lanka was illegal, that was void. That shows the extent of the independence of judiciary that had been maintained during the colonial period.

Therefore, it is important at this juncture, taking into consideration the public opinion and the public attitude that is prevailing in this country, to insist as to how important is the independence of the Judiciary. Earlier, I referred to the Magna Carta Agreement which was signed about 800 years ago. Thereafter, there had been so many other struggles. That is why I say that this has not been conferred upon the people, but it has been won by the people after so much of struggle. But, luckily we did not have that much of a struggle because when the Westminster model of governance was introduced to Sri Lanka, this was part and parcel of it. Therefore, at that time, there were not much problems.

One may recall that even during the period of King James II in 1688, there was a struggle between the Judiciary and the Executive. During that period when the judicial independence was under threat, King James II

1475 1476

was ousted from the Crown by the people. During that period, the successors to the Crown were Prince William and Princess Mary. People did not want to accept them as successors to the Crown until they gave a guarantee that the tenure of the judges are guaranteed and will not be interfered with. Only after that, the people of the United Kingdom accepted Prince William and Princess Mary as successors to the Crown. As a result of that, the British people were able to stop the brutal intimidation on the Judiciary by passing the Act of Settlement in 1701.

In our country also, we have seen that our judges do not claim any preferential treatment. What they expect is, once they are appointed to the Judiciary, they must be given a chance for a fair hearing. It may be a case against a height or a mite. That is not the matter. It may be a case of a beggar. But, the judicial minds are trained minds and they know how to administer justice - [Interruption.] I agree with the Hon. Minister that this has been prevailing for some time, and at the relevant time when it became necessary, this Legislature or the Executive had not taken any action and had allowed it to continue. Now, it has come to a bottleneck situation, where whatever issue we may raise, there is an apparent struggle between the Executive and the Judiciary, which has got expanded. So, there is another struggle between the Judiciary and the Legislature too. Therefore, I also do not believe that under the independence of the Judiciary, anybody should depart from the accepted norms. I would like to quote what Sir Winston Churchill, former British Prime Minister once said about the judges. He said, I quote:

Our aim is not to make our Judges wealthy men or women, but to satisfy their needs and to maintain a modest and a dignified way of life suited to the gravity, and indeed, the majesty of the duties they discharge.

I concede that this is an ideal interpretation that we will have to accept with regard to the conduct of judges and their powers. At the same time, Lord Phillips in the United Kingdom had recently made a statement. He had said, I quote:

The media is not slow to attack the judiciary, but I am not aware that it has ever accused a judge of political bias, and I am not even aware of the politics of my colleagues in the court.

That is the judicial culture in the United Kingdom. But, of course, in Sri Lanka it is rather different. We have seen attacks sometimes made on the Judiciary by the media where in certain instances they are acceptable and in certain instances, they are not. They do it under the guise of the media freedom. Therefore, we will have to accept that kind of media criticism. In the meantime, we will specially have to concentrate on our duty, as to what we have to do, as legislators, to protect the independence of the Judiciary. That is why Lord Phillip - I referred to the quotation earlier - had stated as to how they appoint judges and take political opinion from their colleagues

and those are immaterial.

Once they accept the judicial function, they will have to act independently. Former Lord Chancellor, Lord Elwyn-Jones also referred to the system, the mechanism in which the judges have been appointed in the United Kingdom. He said, I quote:

When a vacancy had to be filled, the heads of the divisions .... were invited into my office to consider likely names.Usually we agreed as to the one most meriting, appointment. Occasionally two names were equally supported. Then the choice was left to me...

Hon. Minister this is how it happened there. I think there was not much political involvement when the appointment of the judges are made in those countries. I do not say that it happens only under this Government but right throughout in our country, too much politics has been involved in appointing judges to the superior courts including the Chief Justice. When politics is involved, of course, there might be instances of breakdown or some misunderstanding but if the proper procedure is followed, these problems will not arise. In countries where judges are appointed without any political involvement, this question does not arise. If there was political favour or political involvement when judges are appointed and if they do not heed to the voice of those who made the appointment, then of course we have to expect these problems. This is not something new. Since the 1978 Constitution we are faced with this situation. We cannot blame anybody for this situation. We have to blame the Legislature because this Legislature is obliged to make the rules to avoid all kinds of conflicts. But since 1978, the House has failed to do so and therefore, at present, we are faced with a very unpleasant situation in the country which is not good for any citizen in this country, the Government, the country as a whole, specially at a time when there are so many allegations in the international arena. At a time when a lot of elements are waiting to criticize and attack this country, we have opened the floodgates for any foreign force or elements to get involved in our internal affairs. That is the danger that we are facing. Therefore, the Judiciary has to be independent. When we read the Constitution, it looks like there are three stakeholders: the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary, but it is not so. In the developed world, the media also plays a very important and vital role. Unless the media also acts independently, fairly and reasonably, people will not get a chance to come to a correct conclusion as to what is happening in the country and as to what kind of decision they will have to take.

Therefore, in every respect, all the organs especially the Legislature is bound to perform and discharge its obligation at this instance on this issue. The Constitution has given us a guarantee that our fundamental rights, basic freedom, and human rights will be secured. But, if it is not practically adhered to, it will become an ornament just to adorn the Constitution. That is why I

1477 1478

[ ]

2012 28

insist that the independence of the Judiciary has to be maintained; it has to be respected. If the Judiciary is at the mercy of the Legislature or the Executive, I do not think the liberty of any man or woman in this country is secure. That is why the famous philosopher, Andrew Jackson has said, I quote:

All the rights secured to the citizens under the Constitution are worth nothing and a mere bubble, except guaranteed to them by an independent and virtuous judiciary.

Archibald Cox, Solicitor-General of the United States who was the the first special Prosecutor in the Watergate scandal case said that there are three reasons for judicial independence, I quote: (1) To guard against abuse of executive power. (2) To halt legislative erosion of fundamental human rights. (3) To provide assurance to the public that judges are impartial and fair in their decision making processes.

Therefore, when a judgement, a decision or a judicial proclamation is made, we are bound to respect and honour it. Now, I would like to give you an example. In the recent past, Mr. Nelson Mandela, who gained Independence for South Africa, which has the most recent democratic form of Constitution that had been adopted in the world, in 1995 made a proclamation about the Electoral Delineation Commission for the demarcation of the boundaries of constituents. After the proclamation was made, that was challenged before the Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court in its interpretation stated that the proclamation made by the President of the country is a nullity for the reason that he has not been given that authority, the jurisdiction by the Legislature. Then, on the same day, when the judgment was pronounced by the Constitutional Court, he appeared in the media and said, I genuinely believed that I have been given the power by the Legislature. I genuinely accepted the advice given by my legal team. But, now the Constitutional Court has held that I have not been given the power to do so and therefore my proclamation has been declared a nullity. I respect the court judgment. He further stated, By my admission of the correctness and the genuineness of the Constitutional Court judgment, I demonstrate not only the rule, but even the rule of the President is bound by the law of the country. That is the best example that we have seen during the recent past in the other part of the world about the importance of the respect for the Judiciary. If the Executive or the Legislature or may be powerful in the society, do not extend their respect to the judicial pronouncement, then no one will honour it. As a result what would happen is, it would lead to an anarchy situation.

In this country, of course there are counter arguments. But, with all that we know, there are a series of violence, crimes, murders, rapes, child abuses; everything is happening in this country. I do not say it is something new. But, if you look at the rate, the numbers of such forms of violence is increasing. If the people have faith in the system, they will not go to the man who has been

accused of and assault him. When there is even an accident, the people do not wait till the court administers justice. They take the law into their hands and they either kill or assault the driver and burn the vehicle. That is the situation in this country. At a time like this, if there is going to be a conflict between the Judiciary and the Executive or between the Legislature and the Judiciary, undoubtedly we are going in for an anarchy situation. That is bad. That is unhealthy. So, it is the duty to correct this, irrespective of party politics. One can have his own opinion on politics, but we must understand the importance of maintaining the independence of the Judiciary. That does not depend on the infrastructure you give to the courthouses, as to how that guarantees the maintenance of the independence of the Judiciary.

Thank you very much. [..1.25]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir, for the opportunity given to speak on the Votes of the Ministry of Justice. The word "justice" is chiefly in the national discourse today and the Minister of Justice is the one, who, just about a year ago publicly stated that the rule of law breaks down everyday in this country. He was then conferred with this post and under his watch, the situation has steadily worsened. Today, the issue of justice has become precarious and much talked about and its independence is something that most right-thinking people in this country fear will be forever compromised if some of the things that are happening now are permitted to continue in that way.

When we speak of justice, there are many issues in this country and people are anxious that they cannot receive justice. The Hon. Minister who spoke before me spoke about the laws delays. I agree with him that that perennial problem still continues, where people have to trek to courts three months at a time and thereafter come back after each date only to say that the case has been postponed and it goes on for years. That is one of the issues.

But, as I speak today, there is another serious issue of justice that has developed in Jaffna. Some university students have been badly beaten up and, even as I speak, the situation is grave, the situation is tense just outside the premises of the University of Jaffna. Some students have been admitted to the Jaffna Teaching Hospital because the

army and the police have brutally assaulted some students who peaceably went on a protest march just from one gate of the university to the other gate. They did that protest march because last evening the police and the military invaded the university hostel, and that too, the ladies' hostel, broke open closed doors, went into their rooms, threw all their belongings over the balcony, even broke their beds and threw the furniture out. Now, this kind of thing that is allowed to go on is not good for the country and we cannot discuss an allocation for the Ministry of Justice ignoring these serious developments that are taking place in a part of the country, where things must be addressed sensitively and carefully. Unfortunately, prisons do not come under the Ministry of Justice anymore. Unfortunately, the Attorney-General does not come under the Ministry of Justice anymore. All of these are essential elements for discussion on the issue of justice.

We saw what happened in the prisons last week. We have seen publicly in several newspapers, eyewitness' accounts on how prisoners are set to have been executed after the riots stopped. In the early hours of the morning, they have been called by name outside their cells and executed. These things have come publicly in the newspapers. Can we discuss a Vote on the Ministry of Justice closing our eyes - [Interruption.] Yes, I know, that was in the morning. But, what I am saying is that there is a larger issue of justice. That is why I am raising it. The parents of those prisoners who have been executed and their relatives are crying out saying, Where is justice? Can this happen?". Can the State apparatus behave in this fashion, be it in Colombo, be it in Jaffna or be it in any part of the country, inside the prison where the State is obliged to keep those persons secure? Can this happen? But, after all, this is a prison in which 53 prisoners were executed in 1983. The State has an obligation to protect those who are under its care. In prisons, when we have people, it is the utmost obligation on the part of the State to protect those persons and there is a very serious breach of justice when the State is unable to even protect those who are in their own custody. As I said earlier, what has happened in Jaffna is another clear example of this. What will happen is, as the Hon. Minister who spoke before me said, people lose confidence in the system of justice. That is not a good thing for any democratic country. Loss of confidence can happen as a result of the incidents that I mentioned or even as a result of delays and matters tarrying for too long in courts without a decision. And, the events that are now taking place involving this House also is another very serious assault on the Judiciary and consequently on peoples confidence in the system. Decisions are taken and executed using Standing Orders; even Standing Orders that are ex facie violative of the Constitution and void. That only causes people to lose confidence in the system.

The Hon. Speaker made a warning; I believe he even invited some editors and spoke to them about exercising some caution with regard to publication. But, what does

the other arm of the State do? What does the State media do? I am tabling* the front page of the "Daily News" of last Monday, 26th of November, which states, I quote:

The Damning Charges

Conduct unbecoming of a Chief Justice

This appeared in the front page. I am tabling this so that this can be appended at the end of my speech in the Hansard. This appears in a State-controlled newspaper. How is this possible?

When the Chief Justice came to Parliament, another news item states that orders had been given for the policemen on duty here not to salute her. Very churlish! - [Interruption.] It is a fact that they did not salute. Are you contesting that? And, how did that happen? - [Interruption.] I know that and I take responsibility for what I am saying. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne) You are taking a lot of responsibilities.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Of course, we take responsibility, not like the Ministers; not like the Government that acts so irresponsibly. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne) You are insulting the Speaker.

That will be expunged because he has the authority. The other matter is, Hon. Member - I am asking you as a lawyer - can the Chief Justice bring any other lawyer without subjecting himself to a search?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Now, you are breaching all the rules of this House sitting in that Chair - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) I want a clarification. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Presiding Member, how can you - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) You are sitting in the Chair. How can you ask that? Shame! - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, Please! - [Interruption.] I am only asking for a clarification from the Hon. Member. Let him reply. Order please! - [Interruption.] Both Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe and Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, resume your seats.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) You cannot - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) I can get a clarification, of course. - [Interruption.] Of course, you do not know the Standing Orders. - [Interruption.]He, being a lawyer, I am asking for a clarification.

( ) (The Hon. Chandrasiri Gajadeera) . [ ]

( ) (The Presiding Member) The Chair has all the right to ask for a clarification. It is only a clarification, not a comment. - [Interruption.] You must understand the difference between a comment and a clarification. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Presiding Member, this is a very awkward situation where I have to raise a point of Order against a query that is being made from the Chair. I do not think this has ever happened.

( ) (The Presiding Member) According to Standing Orders, Hon. Member, you must understand that you cannot raise a point of Order against the Chair. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I cannot be asked a question - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) There is another remedy for you, if you want to. - [Interruption.] Please proceed with your speech. - [Interruption.] Order, please! Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, you resume your seat. You cannot challenge the Chair. I am telling you. - [Interruption.] Hon. Sumanthiran, you continue with your speech. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Presiding Member, if you need - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member you carry on.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Presiding Member, I will answer your question. All right. You have asked me a question and you will listen to my answer.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Yes, please!

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You will listen to my answer now.

( ) (The Presiding Member) That will be nice.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If you need legal advice, please pay some lawyer and go and get that advice. Do not try and get it from me free in this House. That is the answer I wish to give you now and I think that the question was totally out of order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) No, it is not. You cannot say that. It is a clarification.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I say that it is out of order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) It is a clarification and I will not pay any lawyer for that because I am in command of the Chair.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is why I am saying that it is a very awkward situation that a Member on his feet has to remind the Chair that the - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, there is nothing awkward. You must know the Standing Orders. You are an able, senior lawyer. I respect you as a senior lawyer in the courts. All right, now please proceed with your speech.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you for that vote of confidence but still, if you want legal advice, please come to my chambers.

( ) (The Presiding Member) No, I shall not. I will desist.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Pay my fees.

( ) (The Presiding Member) You cannot ask a fee from the Chair. It is very unethical to ask a fee from the Chair. - [Interruption.]

2012 28

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Do not try to elicit free legal advice here.

( ) (The Presiding Member) All right. Let us proceed with the Debate.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Now, Mr. Presiding Member, we are discussing the Votes on the Ministry of Justice at a very critical time when the whole system of justice itself is under question for many reasons, including the reason that the Government is on a witch-hunt. The Government is unjustifiably on a path that will affect peoples confidence in the Judiciary and all because the Judiciary is not as compliant as they wish it to be. I do not wish to repeat what I said a few days ago.

I do not wish to repeat what the Hon. Member of the UNP from the Colombo District said a little while ago with regard to the independence of the three institutions that must be maintained, and the fact that under our Constitution, each of them are supreme in their sphere of competence, and there is nothing called "legislative supremacy" over either the Executive or the Judiciary. It is the Constitution that is supreme and even the Standing Orders or any procedures that we adhere to here, in violation of the Constitution, is void.

Thank you very much.

Whoever it maybe, if the Chief Justice has to retain lawyers, she has to retain lawyers, not lawyers who do not appear. She has to retain lawyers who appear, who are known as lawyers, not somebody -

He is referring to the constitution of Benches; he is referring to the conduct of Judges. He cannot do that. If it is a substantive Motion that is being discussed now, then he can. But, in this instance he cannot -

, - - , . , , , . Prof. Savitri Goonesekere, the former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Colombo had this to say in an address that she made at the Womens Day Celebration: Helping women facing domestic violence to end this violence does not mean breaking up a family unit. When there is violence in the home, the family is already broken. Even though a husband and wife live under the same roof and share a child or children, if the wife is being subjected to violence, the family is already torn apart. Helping this woman to end the violence she is experiencing will save her life and the lives of her children. It will help preserve her family.

, . . This is what Rousseau said in his discourse on the subject What is the origin of inequality among men, and is it authorized by natural law?. I should have wished then that no one within the State should be able to say he was above the law; and that no one without should be able to dictate so that the State should be obliged to recognize his authority. For, be the constitution of a government what it may, if there be within its jurisdiction a single man who is not subject to the law, all the rest are necessarily at his discretion.

In fact, we are proposing to bring in a new Contempt of Law Bill because we notice that there are disparities in judgments when judges give orders on contempt of court. As a matter of fact, the Civil Procedure Code provides for it. The superior courts have their own rules, but there are many disparities that have been noticed. The Law Commission, this is not an initiative of the Government itself, has proposed a new Contempt of Law Bill. I propose to bring the new Bill to the Cabinet very soon so that these disparities can be set aside and we will have a proper approach to the contempt of court procedures in this country. The Judicature Act too provides for certain provisions. All of this have been looked at very clearly by the Law Commission and we will soon be introducing some of these amendments.

Together with that, I must also say that we have brought in some new changes to the way in which fines are distributed to the local authorities. In the collection of fines imposed by courts and their distribution to local bodies, we would like to say that we are following an archaic system introduced during the colonial times. As a result, the effective implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution has become very difficult in the sense that apportioning of fines and fees money for the benefit of the provincial and local bodies have become very cumbersome. Some of the local bodies have brought it to our attention. Due to the difficulties in transmitting these fines, we have now devised a method where this situation will be remedied. A series of discussions have been held with banking institutions and other relevant authorities in the recent past. A completely new system will be introduced before the end of the year, hopefully, to make the whole process technologically oriented so that the human intervention in apportioning the fine money will become minimal and an expeditious process will replace the existing system. With this, I hope, the

apportioning of the collection of fines and fees imposed by different courts will become swift and smooth so that the ills of the existing system will be corrected and the development process of the local authorities will be facilitated.

Likewise, many other changes have also been introduced. In fact, several Members mentioned about the need to look at the laws delays in our court system. This is a perennial matter, a matter which is very difficult to resolve without the cooperation of the Judiciary - the lawyers and various other stakeholders. We have looked, holistically, at the entire system and proposed some changes to the existing Civil Procedure Code and the Criminal Procedure Code so that we will bring in new pre-trial judges as a new tier of judges. The particular amendments have already gone before the Cabinet and they are now before the Cabinet Subcommittee and hopefully, in the early part of next year, we will be able to bring in these revolutionary changes, which will drastically reduce the laws delays in this country.

Unfortunately, while we are doing all this, this incident of impeachment against the Chief Justice is being used by the Opposition to show -

Whereupon THE HON. (MRS.) SRIYANI WIJEWICKRAMA left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I am quite pleased, Hon. Chairman, with you in the Chair, to say that we have embarked on an effort to introduce many changes to the existing court system so that we will do away with the delays in the system. There had been many matters that have been brought to our notice. We have considered all that and have brought in these new changes, which will come into force, hopefully, early next year.

Not only that, if we take infrastructure, you were witness yesterday, Mr. Chairman, we went to Galle and inspected the new land in which a large court complex is to be built in Galle. I must say that it was one of your initiatives. Your uncle, the late Hon. Amarasiri Dodangoda, was very keen about that whole project. After you came in as the Deputy Speaker, you took a

1573 1574

keen interest in this matter and it was fortunate that we were able to also persuade the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva to intervene in providing some alternate accommodation to the officials of the Department of Irrigation who were occupying part of the land.

We will build a very large and modern complex, which will have many facilities and will cost almost Rs. 850 million. That, I believe, is one of the largest court complexes we are going to build in this country.

I must also say that that is not the only project envisaged for the next year. Next year, we are going to have the Homagama Courts Complex also built and we have allocated Rs. 200 million for that to start work. Then, one of the most dilapidated courthouses in the Island has been the Wattala Magistrates Court and we are going to provide a DC/MC and Labour Tribunal Complex there. Stage I alone will cost Rs. 175 million. The Hon. Joseph Michael Perera will be happy about this because he has been somebody who had been bringing up this issue at the Consultative Committee. So, stage I of the Wattala Courts Complex will begin with an allocation of Rs. 175 million by January, next year. Similarly, for the Gampaha Courts Complex, we have allocated Rs. 100 million. The Batticaloa Court, which was virtually abandoned because of certain construction deficiencies, is being renovated and we are now building a new court complex with Rs. 100 million within the Batticaloa Court precincts.

So, there are a variety of similar projects we have undertaken. Not only that, in order to ease the difficulties of litigants having to travel long distances, we have appointed a committee under the chairmanship of a Supreme Court Judge in order to look at the complaints regarding the delimitation of jurisdictional areas of courts. In this regard, that committee had had several sittings and hopefully, early next year, we will be able to implement some of those changes. Those changes will bring some relief to many people.

I must also say that an Hon. Member brought to my attention the Ruwanwella Court.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Minister, give me one minute. Sometime ago, I moved a Motion on the Development of the Quazi Court system and I think you have a scheme to put up new courts in several areas. If so, what are the areas and what are the improvements that you are doing as far as the Quazi Courts of Sri Lanka are concerned?

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) In fact, this is a new concept. Up to the time of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, nobody paid any attention to provide proper infrastructure facilities for this important segment, the Quazi Courts. It is on the special directions of His Excellency the President that we

have now begun constructing separate courthouses for Quazis. Altogether, 12 courthouses were built in the previous year and another 12 courthouses are now being built. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) What are the areas where these courthouses are being built? If you can just mention the names of those areas, the people there will be very happy.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I will read out the names of those areas. There are several Quazi Courts that have already been constructed. The areas which have been envisaged to be given new courthouses for the Quazis are: Addalaichenai, Musali, Adampan, Sainthamaruthu, Mutur, Galagedara, Vellamanal, Suduventhapulavu, Gampola, Eravur, Pottuvil and Ottamavadi. So, these are the areas which have been envisaged to be given new courthouses for the Quazis. Not only that, we have also taken steps for the Board of Quazis to sit in circuit in some of these areas, particularly -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) At the same time, are you going to have workshops for these Quazis? What we feel is, since the divorce cases are increasing, they must be given some Islamic interpretation of laws to be followed. That will be better.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) The issue of the workshops is a matter for the Judicial Service Commission because Quazis are also now being appointed through the Judicial Service Commission. So, as a matter of fact, I am aware that the JSC has organized a few workshops and those are continuing. The Sri Lanka Judges' Training Institute, which for all purposes comes under my Ministry, and administered by the Judicial Service Commission has been organizing a variety of courses. Apart from whatever other turbulent incidents that have now enveloped the judicial sector, these proceedings: training of judges, recruitment of judges, none of these things have faced any difficulty and they are going on as it should. Therefore, though some of the Opposition Members tried to make out that this entire judicial sector has come to a breaking down position, that is totally untrue. This is a legal procedure that has taken its own course.

Therefore, unnecessary conclusions should not be taken as if the entire system is in a state of breakdown. I must very clearly say that a variety of new changes have been introduced.

I must also refer to the issue relating to domestic violence raised by an Hon. Member in the morning. The Prevention of Domestic Violence Act was enacted for the purpose of protecting persons from being subject to violence in the home environment. The purpose was not to penalize but to prevent violence. However, if the injury caused as a result of violence is serious, the offence could be prosecuted through the provisions in the Penal Code and action could be taken accordingly. This law, I must say, which comes within the direct purview of the Ministry of Child Development and Womens Affairs and the Ministry of Justice is not in charge of the implementation of this law. We could, of course, be involved in bringing in an awareness programme, if necessary, in collaboration with the Ministry. I think the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne raised this issue. Therefore, I am compelled to make some comment on that.

Together with that, I must say, another area where my Ministry feels a need for changes is the law related to matrimonial disputes because domestic violence sometimes results in matrimonial disputes. In relation to this area, there is a need to introduce more mechanisms of mediation of disputes between disputed parties of families so that the main nucleus of the social web, the family, can be given a protective environment within the existing legal structure. Acrimony within family members can be reduced through this mechanism and a culture of effective reconciliation can be instilled in the overall social structure, especially for the benefit of the children who are compelled to silently suffer due to dysfunctional family backgrounds. These changes, we believe, will bring in far-reaching positive results in the overall society and we will be consulting the other relevant Ministries as well in introducing the necessary changes to these areas.

Also, I must say, with regard to marriage disputes among Muslims, the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act is being amended. We have set up a special committee under the chairmanship of His Lordship Saleem Marsoof and that committee is due to submit its report within the next one or two months and hopefully I will be able to bring in those amendments, so that longstanding changes that have been envisaged will be brought into fruition.

I must also speak about the all-important area of international arbitration. I must state that His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa in the last Budget allocated a sum of Rs. 100 million for that purpose and we have now decided to locate the new International Arbitration Centre in the World Trade Centre in Fort and one whole floor has been given to us from the BOI to house the International Arbitration Centre. Hopefully, the Centre will begin its operations sometime mid next year and the work to set up the Centre will be undertaken very soon.

We will also be looking at the necessary structure for the International Arbitration Centre along with the existing stakeholders. There are various arbitration

centres that are functioning through private initiatives. We have decided to bring them all together so that in one premises, all of them could function effectively. So, this is another novel project that has been introduced and I would say, today, the Singapore Arbitration Centre is able to attract almost US Dollars 3 billion of income through their arbitration centre. If we can attract even a portion of the work, it will bring in vast income through foreign exchange to the country. So, these are new features and there are a variety of other changes that we hope to introduce. Hopefully, these changes will come to fruition next year.

In conclusion, I must thank all those who participated in this Debate though some of them tried to divert attention from the good work that the Ministry is doing by trying to use the Debate to cast aspersions on the Government as if it was trying to interfere with the independence of the Judiciary. I must categorically reject all those allegations and say that law will take its own course; the inquiry will take its own course but, the structure, the process and its robust functioning will continue.

With those comments, I must thank my Secretary, (Mrs.) Kamalini de Silva, the Additional Secretary, the other officials and the Heads of Departments for having assisted me in carrying on the functions of the Ministry during the last year.
