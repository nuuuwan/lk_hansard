QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE LAUNCH OF SRI LANKAS FIRST SATELLITE ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Deputy Speaker, the local media has announced the launch of Sri Lankas first satellite named Supreme

SAT-1 on 27th November, 2012. On the other hand, the foreign media announced that China launched "China SAT-12" communication satellite into orbit.

This is Apstar 7B, a back-up satellite for Apstar 7, which was successfully launched thereby making 7B redundant.

Furthermore, SupremeSAT (Pvt.) Limited, a BOI company, has entered into a partnership agreement with China Great Wall Industry Corporation to co-brand this satellite as "Supreme SAT-1". Outer space is free for the use of all States in accordance with the international law.

The constitution of the International Telecommunication Union - ITU - makes provision for the allocation of satellite orbit slots to be registered with the ITU. Sri Lanka too is entitled to such slots. The media does not specify whether "China SAT-12" is utilizing a slot allocated to China or Sri Lanka.

Therefore, will the Government make a full statement on the "China SAT-12 and SupremeSAT-1" including the following:

(a) What are the satellite orbital slots allocated to Sri Lanka and how are they utilized?

(b) Is "China SAT-12" utilizing a slot belonging to Sri Lanka or another country?

(c) Was a transparent system followed in selecting a party for the Sri Lanka satellite project?

(d) What is the total cost for "SupremeSAT-1" and how will it be recovered?

(e) Who are the shareholders of SupremeSAT (Pvt.) Limited and what is their background and their investment?

(f) Who are the Directors of SupremeSAT (Pvt.) Limited?

(g) What are the future plans of "SupremeSAT" that are known to the Government?

(h) Who are the users of the other transponders in "ChinaSAT-12"?

(i) Who are the partners of SupremeSAT (Pvt.) Limited in this venture?

(j) Will the Government table copies of the following agreements between:

(i) BOI and SupremeSAT (Pvt.) Limited;

(ii) China Great Wall Industry Corporation and SupremeSAT (Pvt.) Limited;

(iii) The Government of Sri Lanka and SupremeSAT (Pvt.) Limited; and

(iv) The project proposal and similar documents submitted by SupremeSAT (Pvt.) Limited to BOI.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy)

! Thank you. [5.22 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Vasantha Senanayake) Mr. Deputy Chairman, it is of paramount importance, when addressing the House on the topic at hand, not only to emphasize matters pertaining to youth but also to make reference to the enslavement of youth and the murder of innocence. I make special note of narcotics, reckless use of medical drugs, inappropriate use of domestically-used substances which contain chemical compounds that intoxicate, and of course, the age-old enemies - alcohol and tobacco.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, I want to state at the outset that the NATA Act came into force in 2006. It is a result of the wisdom of "Mahinda Chintana" which bequeathed to our society its offspring "Mathata Thitha" or a full stop to intoxicants. The Act itself is laudable, and especially President Rajapakses role in bringing it forward, and also the tireless efforts of the present Minister of Health to protect the general population, can be termed as admirable. The international conspirators, however, that come in the form of British American Tobacco and their local proxies have resorted to sheer deviousness to avoid the consequences they are legally, socially and morally bound by.

Research done by reliable organizations committed to protecting youth and society in our country such as "Healthy Lanka" and FISD point out that from each village, the average amount of money spent on alcohol and tobacco is Rs. 10 million per year. This has been based on the legally-declared income of the alcohol and tobacco industry per annum as divided by the number of Grama Niladhari Divisions in this country. This roughly works out to 100 people of each Grama Niladhari Division smoking five cigarettes a day. Any person engaged in ground level politics will understand, any person who interacts with people will understand that these figures are conservative. They by no means overstate the issue. The survey also shows that 79 per cent of vendors have sold cigarettes and alcohol to teenagers under the age of 21. This is entirely contrary to the Act brought in by this Government. The penalties for offenders, Mr. Deputy Chairman, are not nearly as sufficient when one considers the repercussions on society for such infringement. Based on the legally declared profits of alcohol and tobacco industries, every Grama Niladhari Division spends Rs.10 million a year for these poisons. There are 149 such divisions coming under the Electorate of Mirigama which can accordingly be estimated as spending Rs. 1,490 million per annum for

perpetuation for these vices. In contrast, I, as a Member of Parliament receive Rs. 5 million for development. This is the biggest obstacle we have for development in this country.

Today, the Minister, Hon. Maithripala Sirisena, is fighting his cause before the judiciary for attempting to introduce a warning pictorially depicting cancer, which the murderous cigarette and alcohol industry is directly responsible for. Today, there are 63 countries that have legally enforced this requirement as per the international treaty of the WHO known as the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. It is an international obligation we must honour. Those that seek to abuse the judicial process to delay the implementation of such measures formulated to save the lives and the health of Sri Lankans must also be prosecuted for the abuse of the legal process.

I call upon the youth Parliamentarians in particular and the Hon. Minister of Youth Affairs and Skills Development to partner with the Ministry of Health to defeat this scourge that has been as harmful to the social fabric as much as terrorism. Even in the Colonial era, patriotic leaders, like my great grandfather Right Hon. D.S. Senanayake, were imprisoned on false charges because he pioneered the Temperance Movement or Amadyapa Movement in this country. It is the same today. The tobacco and alcohol industry is filthy rich, rich from the filth that they prostitute before our youth and society.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, you have one more minute.

( ) (The Hon. Vasantha Senanayake) Okay. Sir, the intention of Parliament is manifestly clear in Section 34 of the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act which requires that any party attempting to sell tobacco products must comply with the pictorial depiction of its dangers as required by both national and international law by virtue of the treaty we have entered into. Section 34 of the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act, No. 27 of 2006 states, I quote:

A manufacturer of a tobacco product shall cause to be displayed, conspicuously and in easily legible print, on every packet containing tobacco products manufactured by such manufacturer, a label of such dimensions as may be prescribed containing a statement of the tar and nicotine content in each tobacco product in such packet and such health warnings as may be prescribed

I emphasize the last line of that Section, ..and such health warnings as may be prescribed...

I shall conclude although there are a lot more to say on this by saying that we cannot escape from the solemn and sincere obligation that we owe to our people and to

2849 2850

the youth of our nation that are in every sense our hope and our future. Thank you.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. Lohan Ratwatte. You have five minutes.

Mr. Presiding Member, I think the Mover has sounded a danger signal as far this problem is concerned. I see the

Hon. Yogarajan untimely moving away. It is better if he remains to listen to what is happening in Tamil Nadu now. They are fighting a two-front battle: one is against the Sri Lankan Tamils which you are not able to defend and the other one is the danger posed by the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant.

Sir, there had been various other catastrophes as a result of these type of atomic centres.

I will draw your attention to the tragedy which occurred in Bhopal, India. On 3rd December, 1984, toxic gas called methyl isocyanate seeped from Union Carbide, a pesticide plant, killing more than 2,000 people and injuring about 150,000. There was danger even to the historic monument, Taj Mahal, which was built by Emperor Shah Jahan. Its colour got changed as a result of this tragedy.

A similar tragedy occurred in Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan on 12th March, 2011. An explosion in Reactor No. 1 caused one of the buildings to crumble to the ground. The cooling system at the reactor failed shortly after the earthquake and tsunami-hit Japan. By Tuesday, 15th March, two more explosions and a fire had officials and workers at the plant struggling to regain control of four reactors. The fire, which happened at Reactor No. 4, was contained by noon on Tuesday, but not before the incident released radioactivity directly into the atmosphere.

In this world where we are marching towards space, we have to be careful about the earth that we live in. As a result of these tragedies, there have been side effects such as cancer. Today it is clear that the pollution caused by the Chernobyl Disaster in Russia have given rise to large-scale increase in cancers. In particular, cancers are notably more common in populations from the highly contaminated regions and among the liquidators which have the highest radiation exposure in comparison to relatively unexposed groups. Amongst liquidators from Belarus for example - that was a land earlier belonging to the Soviet Union - incidences of kidney, urinary, bladder and thyroid cancer were all significantly higher for the period from 1993 - 2003 than in a comparable reference group. Leukaemia was significantly higher in liquidators in Ukraine, in adults in Belarus and in children in the most contaminated areas of Russia and Ukraine.

As you are aware, Sir, the greatest tragedy occurred in Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. The atomic bombs were first used during that war. What happened as a result of that? Even today, when people in certain areas in the Pacific eat fish, they get certain diseases. It is true that we have to advance scientifically and technologically, but at the same time, we have to live on the earth; we have to protect our environment.

Then, I will say something about leukaemia which was also due to the pollution caused by the Chernobyl

2887 2888

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

Disaster. Higher rates of acute leukaemia among Belarusian liquidators were first observed in 1990 and 1991. From 1992, a significant increase in the incidence of all forms of leukaemia was detectable.

Then, you have non-cancer illnesses. The identified changes in the incidence of cancerous diseases reported from studies of population exposed to radiation arising from the Chernobyl accident are only one aspect of the range of health impacts reported. In addition, significant increase in non-cancer illnesses amongst the exposed populations has also been reported although, despite the scale of the exposure, relatively very few studies are available.

The statistical document from the Ukrainian Ministry of Health is very interesting, Sir. It states a rise in cases of unspecified chronic and emphysema from around 300 per 10,000 population in 1990 to over 500 per 10,000 in the adult and adolescent population in 2004. Over the same period, bronchial asthma morbidity almost doubled to reach 55.4 cases per 10,000 population.

Then, as regards the digestive system, there is some evidence of digestive system disorders being more frequent amongst individuals who were exposed to the Chernobyl radiation. A survey carried out in 1995 suggested that morbidity of such disorders was 1.8 times higher amongst Belarus evacuees and inhabitants of the contaminated territories than for the Belarus population as a whole. Between 1991 and 1996, the reported incidence of peptic ulcers in the Belarus population increased by almost 10 per cent. So, this is a danger for us too. We have to be careful and we will take care of the Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale also. So, do not worry about that.

Sir, there are various documents and I will table* them.

They are very helpful not only to the Ministry of External Affairs but to all the Ministries concerned and the Government as a whole, so that protective measures could be made, a study could be made as to whether there is an inherent danger to our country, Sri Lanka, because only the water in Palk Strait separates India and Sri Lanka.

Finally Sir, I must say that the Hon. Ajith Kumara has done well in order to give a sound of warning. Thank you very much.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Presiding Member, actually it is a very good Motion, although it is late, that the Hon. Ajith Kumara has brought up regarding the nuclear power plant in South India. As you know, this is about 500 kilometres from our shores. Nevertheless, the present Government has taken serious action and dispatched several delegations as well, to negotiate about the safety requirements and to reintroduce the safety measures that are available in the world to the present system which they had agreed to. Especially after Chernobyl and Fukushima Disasters, there are several safety measures the whole world is undergoing; they are revamping the safety regulations after the Fukushima disaster in Japan. Most of the European countries are dependent on nuclear power, not on any other fuel like coal or hydro power as they do not have much of hydro power. They do not go for diesel which is the cheapest fuel available but use the latest technology although it is costly.

As the Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale stated, this power plant started its operation in 1997. There were several Governments that ruled this country since 1997 and although the power sector or environment does not come under the External Affairs Ministry, officials of the External Affairs Ministry as well the Ministers who held office have taken note of this and discussed about this matter with Delhi.

That is the normal course of action that we take. We do not discuss with State governments. We normally discuss with the Central Government and we have arrived at several decisions. I hope to read out the press statements issued in this regard and the measures that will be taken in the future for the knowledge of general public.

As you know, there is dense population in South India led by the Chief Minister Jayalalitha and by Karunanidhi sometime ago. They are the ones who should have stopped this because if there is any disaster caused by this reactor, firstly the people in South India will directly get affected because it is a densely populated area. Then, according to the way in which the wind blows at a time of disaster, it could affect either Sri Lanka or areas in the north-east, north-west, south-east or south-west of the Plant. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Even the Maldives.

2889 2890

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Yes, and even the central part of India.

Actually, the main persons who will politically lose by the decision of the Central Government on behalf of the people are the two Chief Ministers who have been there while this was in progress. So, there are many people who have been objecting to this and they are still protesting against this. They have not abandoned their protest, just like the protest against the Sethusamuduram Project by which marine life in the Bay of Palk Strait is going to be destroyed. Despite protests, the Central Government went on with the project and now they feel that it is a failed project. We are with the people. Although we need cheap energies, when it is available, we have to pay more attention to see whether those technologies can be used to give protection to people neutralizing any kind of disaster that might take place.

Sir, I would like to mention about the measures taken in respect of Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant in South India. On the 12th of October, 2012, after many deliberations, a delegation consisting of officers from the Ministry of Power and Energy, the Atomic Energy Authority and the Ministry of External Affairs, visited India to engage in consultations on Comprehensive Civil Nuclear Cooperation regarding this project. During these discussions, the matter of early notification, disaster precaution and mitigation in an event of a nuclear accident were discussed. But, these issues were not discussed by previous governments or by previous ministers who were responsible. Although this matter does not come within the purview of the Ministry of External Affairs, it has intervened in this matter.

The Indian Government assured that the Nuclear Power Plant in Kudankulam has been established with all the international safety standards. In addition, the Indian delegation stated that they have taken additional safety features, practised throughout the world after the Fukushima incident in Japan, on the request of Sri Lankan Government. So, these are the steps which the Indian Government has taken after the intervention of the Ministry of External Affairs of Sri Lanka.

In addition to the already established safety measures, India has reiterated its commitments to adhere to the following conventions to which both Sri Lanka and India have become parties. The first one is the Convention on Nuclear Safety; the second one is the Convention on assistance in the case of a nuclear accident or a radiological emergency and the third one is the Convention on early notification of a nuclear accident. These are international conventions which are signed between neighbouring countries.

The Atomic Energy Authority of Sri Lanka is in the process of installing equipment for online monitoring in the Northern and the Western part of Sri Lanka to

measure the radio activity level since it could come with the wind. They have already started installing these equipment on the coast of the Western Province.

A copy of the Joint Press Release issued by India and Sri Lanka at the conclusion of the bilateral consultations on Comprehensive Civil Nuclear Cooperation is with me and I will read that out in the course of my speech for your information and for the information of general public.

The Hon. Champika Ranawaka, Minister of Power and Energy has given a very comprehensive answer in this august Assembly a few months ago in this regard. This had been discussed earlier and this is not the first time that this issue has been brought to notice. This will be brought to notice many times in the future as well. I thank the Hon. Ajith Kumara for bringing this matter up today because then only people will be aware of this and vigilant on this. We will continue to make representations in the future as well. Whenever there is new technology on safety -

, ( ) (The Hon. Ajith Kumara) -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, a question is being raised by the Hon.Ajith Kumara. Are you allowing it?

( ) (The Hon. Ajith Kumara) ?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) * .

I was speaking about the matters that were discussed and they are relevant to the Adjournment Motion that you have brought in today. Also, I would like to read out the Joint Press Statement released by the Indian and the Sri Lankan Government on 12th October, 2012. It states I quote:

" The first round of talks between India and Sri Lanka on comprehensive civil nuclear cooperation was held on 12 October 2012 in New Delhi. The Indian delegation was led by Shri Harsh Vardhan Shringla, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of External

Affairs, Government of India and included representatives from the Department of Atomic Energy of India. The Sri Lankan delegation was led by Mr. I. Ansar, Additional Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of Sri Lanka and included representatives from the Atomic Energy Authority and the Ministry of Power and Energy of Sri Lanka.

2. Discussions were held in a warm, friendly and cordial manner. Both sides exchanged views on all aspects of civil nuclear cooperation and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the uses of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes to mutual benefit of the people of the two countries. It was agreed that the two sides would work towards a comprehensive Agreement on Bilateral Civil Nuclear Cooperation. Discussions included, inter alia, training of officials, nuclear safety and response to nuclear accidents.

3. It was agreed that the next meeting would be held in Sri Lanka in the first half of 2013."

Thank you.
