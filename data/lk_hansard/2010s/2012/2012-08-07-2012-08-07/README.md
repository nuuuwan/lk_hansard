: : PRIVILEGE: QUESTIONING BY MAGISTRATE OF A STATEMENT MADE IN PARLIAMENT

( )(The Hon.Hunais Farook) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Speaker, I wish to raise the following matter of Privilege:

Together with five other lawyers, I appeared before the Mannar Magistrate, Mr. A. Judeson, on behalf of my client on 31st July, 2012.

Contrary to the usual practice of hearing, the Magistrate summoned us to his Chamber to make our submissions. Then Senior Counsel, Mr. Shiraz Noordeen made an appearance and mentioned my name. Thereupon, the Magistrate in a hoarse voice said, Who is this person? I want to see him.. and the moment he saw me, he shouted at me in Tamil Language:

" ? - . ?" .

He said, Were you the person who spoke about me in Parliament? Were you the person who published news about me in the newspapers? Were you there in the Mannar protest?

''. Magistrate ," , ; ; ?" . .

515 516

Whereupon, I politely replied, "Your Honour, I am appearing before you as a Counsel for my client in this case and I do not wish to discuss extraneous matters". Thereupon, the Magistrate frowned and stared at me for a few seconds. Then, my Senior Counsel, Mr. Shiraz Noordeen intervened and politely informed the Magistrate that it was not proper for him to treat a counsel in that manner. Then, the Magistrate vociferously said, I know how to conduct myself and I do not want advice from you. Do not teach me.

The conduct of this Magistrate is clearly an affront to Parliament and is a breach of Privilege of a Member of Parliament. Therefore, I would submit before you, Hon. Speaker, that this matter is a breach of Privilege and appeal that this incident be inquired into by you as the guardian of the rights and privileges of Members of Parliament.

. Magistrate . , . . . , . , .. .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, the Hon. Member mentioned that he had made critical remarks in this House about the Magistrate and as a result this issue has been raised regarding what he has said in this House. Now, I would like to draw your attention to Standing Order No. 78. It states, I quote:

"The conduct of the President, or acting President, Members of Parliament, Judges or other persons engaged in the administration of justice shall not be raised except upon a substantive motion; .."

The Hon. Member has now admitted that he has breached Standing Order No. 78 by raising this Question of Privilege without a Substantive Motion.

The other matter, especially in regard to the Mannar incident and the Magistrate, is under sub judice. I think that matter should best be inquired there. This is not an independent matter that has come up by itself. But, there is a very serious case where an allegation has been made that a Minister has threatened - [Interruption.] I have not

named anyone but a Minister has threatened a judge. That is all that I have said. In that whole thing - [Interruption.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the Leader of the Opposition is violating the Standing Orders. The Hon. Hunais Farook never mentioned the name of the Minister. What he tried to make in his speech, Sir, is that the Magistrate has violated his rights as a Member of Parliament. He has all the right to speak because the Legislature has the power. We cannot give that to any other body. Sir, therefore, speeches made in Parliament cannot be questioned elsewhere. That is why he is raising the matter of Privilege. The Leader of the Opposition has no right to intervene in this, Sir. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) On whose behalf is he intervening? He is intervening on behalf of conspirators to drive the Muslims away from Mannar. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . , . [ ] , ? . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I have not yet finished my point of Order. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I have not yet finished with what I have to say; I do not know why they took this over. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, as far as Parliament is concerned, we act under Article 4(c) of the Constitution where judicial power is vested in us in regard to powers and privileges of our own Members. - [Interruption.] But now, is this an issue that pertains to the powers and privileges of our own Members or an indirect way of trying to get Parliament to interfere on a sub judice matter, in which case, it goes to the first portion of matters pertaining to judicial -[Interruption.] Will you sit down? I listened to you. You all are a bunch of thugs; [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] a bunch of rogues.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] You come here and tell me to shut up.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, this is a very sad situation. I do not see any Minister, Deputy Minister or any Member of Parliament from that side in the House. It is not a very good sign; losing interest in the Parliamentary procedures. I hope you will advise your Members to be present.

( ) (The Presiding Member) It was made known to me that they are attending many Consultative Committees and the COPE at which your Members are also there. Anyway, we will carry on.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) That is correct. We appreciate the progress that has taken place and also the steps that you have taken in this regard. But, our problem is how you have given permission for this hotel project in the Sinharaja Forest area, and we are totally against it.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) I do not think we have given a permit to build any hotel within the Sinharaja Forest area. We cannot do that. But, if you can give me those particulars, I will look into that.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Hon. Minister, there is a letter which was signed by Mr. Udaya P. Gammanpila addressed to the Project Director, Rainforest Ecolodge (Pvt.) Limited, c/o the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. In that letter, they have been given a green light for a period of three years by the Central Environmental Authority. If you say so, that is illegal because there are laws. . . , , . , . . ; . . lodges 20 .

Mr. Presiding Member, I think these are timely Regulations that the Hon.Minister, in his wisdom, has thought of moving in this House because we always look into the needs and aspirations of the common man or the people who engage themselves in various trades, crafts and other business.

Here is one case. We have to help the people involved in furniture making, particularly in Moratuwa and other places. The transport of timber is very essential for them and today, the Minister, Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, declared that the difficulties faced by them have been eased now. Therefore, we are very happy regarding that.

Sir, I also wanted to bring up another very important matter about palmyrah trees. One of our TNA Members was also speaking about that. Recently, I visited a village called "Thennamarawadi" in the Pulmoddai area under the Kuchchaveli Pradeshiya Sabha.

I remember when I visited Parliament gallery in 1947, the first speech that I heard was from the Hon. Robert Gunawardena, Member for Kotte, whose politics I admired very much. He was moving a Private Members Motion on the preservation of forests and reforestation. That was the first speech I heard from an Hon. Member and I remember it very well.

Today, I request the Hon. Minister to pay attention to the deforestation that took place during the 30-year terrorist rule by the LTTE in Mannar, Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi and Vavuniya in the Northern range and even in the Eastern range. Now, what is happening today? The Hon. Hunais Farook wanted to do a project on reforestation in Mannar. Mannar is known as an arid zone, so is Hambantota. As far as Hambantota is concerned, we are very happy, the country is happy and the international community is happy. There is vast development - never seen by the Hon. John Amaratunga in his lifetime - taking place. He appreciates that because he travels in the expressway. , , . , . Enjoy .

This is the Mannar fishermen's story. It is like the Arab and the camel story. The Arab gives room to the camel but thereafter the animal does not move away That is the pathetic situation the poor fishermen of Mannar are facing. Do not cut the hand that fed you, we would say. They came from Vidataltivu. There was an Agreement signed by the Hon. Minister. They have to return according to the Agreement.

There is also a Memorandum signed by hundreds of people led by Al-Azhar Jummah Masjith of Uppukulam, Mannar and several others.

Here is a Tamil paper in which people ask the question, "Why do you not allow the fishermen to settle, not only to fish but to reforest that area?"

" " : " : ? "

They are putting the blame on the Government. That is true. The Government has to find a solution to this.

That was the Agreement signed and it was confirmed. Therefore, there is no problem, Sir. They have solved their problems amicably by signing an agreement.

2012.07.22 " " :

Overpriced oil cargoes: Fujairah takes CPC to court,.

? It states, I quote:

The dispute is over over-pricing. The CPC had originally agreed to a price of Singapore Platts + US $ 54 a ton for six low sulphur fuel oil (LSFO) cargoes of 35,000-40,000 tons each. The supplier was Fujairah. However, the price was changed - adding a further $54 a ton ( a total of Platts + $108) and cabinet approval was sought and obtained.

L/C was opened; money has gone out.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) That must be wrong. Hon. Member, the Cabinet never approved US Dollars 108 premium but it approved only US Dollars 54. Unfortunately, even the authorities of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation wrote to this particular newspaper but they never rectified that. Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, the actual situation is that the Fujairah Company earlier had a contract after calling for tenders. They entered into a contract for six months to supply four cargoes of 35,000 tons each. Then, they started supplying 35,000 tons and after that they supplied another three cargoes also. Then, of course, the tender board decided to continue that and extended the period for a further six months because at that time, it was the lowest price in the oil market supplying low sulphur fuel. Then, the Cabinet approval was sought only to extend the previous contract at the same rate, US Dollars 54. Unfortunately, when the second contract started, the first cargo was supplied. Although the L/C amount was Singapore Platts plus US Dollars 54, they have quoted US Dollars 108 due to an oversight. As a result, US Dollars 108 million has been overpaid for the first consignment. When the second consignment came, the CPC asked the Fujiarah Company to rectify that. In the meantime, the ship was taken to sea, the Fujiarah Company filed a case of an emergency arbitration in Singapore. Last week, that emergency arbitration application was rejected by the arbitrators. Meanwhile, the CPC filed action in the Colombo Commercial High Court seeking an enjoining order. So, the High Court of Colombo issued an enjoining order and yesterday it was extended to 30th . The Fujiarah Company filed another application in the Colombo High Court and that was rejected. This is the situation. Now, the Corporation is in the process of recovering the overpaid amount and got an enjoining order not to pay for the second consignment as it is not fully unloaded. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, Hon. Minister, I stand by the article written by The Sunday Times which is a very reliable and responsible newspaper that has been there over a period of time. .. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) I admit that but there are some mistakes. But, this is the real situation. The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has written to this newspaper; unfortunately it was not rectified. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I do not dispute what you said in this particular instance even though you have not given me a
