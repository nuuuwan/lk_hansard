: : LAND LEASED TO KRRISH GROUP: STATEMENT BY LEADER OF THE HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva - Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management and Leader of the House of Parliament) Hon. Speaker, in response to the Question under Standing Order 23(2), raised by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition on 6th November, 2012, I want to make this Statement on behalf of that Ministry.

The Transworks House property at Colombo Fort remained undeveloped for many years due to encumbrances and vulnerability to security threats that prevailed over the years. The efforts made by the UDA to develop the property jointly with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in the recent past did not materialize. A part of the site where the former Public Works Department building is located has to be preserved to secure its archaeological value. The portion of the land occupied by the electrical substation cannot become part of the development. The above two land parts are not vested with the UDA yet. Therefore, the UDA was compelled to look for an investor who could make a proposal to develop the entire land parcel with a prior understanding about such limitations. With this backdrop, the UDA entertained an unsolicited proposal received as a response to the UDA web advertisement as the land was not readily available to entertain public tenders through media.

M/s KRRISH Group of India expressed their willingness to undertake the project in the entire land excluding the electrical substation site and incorporated a local company called, Krrish Transworks Colombo Private Limited to undertake the project. Initially the UDA entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the KRRISH Group to formulate the project. The Cabinet approval referred in the question was obtained to enter into a lease agreement subject to fulfillment of certain conditions with necessary statutory approvals.

The Company has initially deposited a sum of Rs. 499.5 million being 10 per cent of the total lease premium as a commitment fee on 14th September, 2012. As a follow-up action, the UDA has taken steps to vest the heritage building site in order to seek the final approvals

to sign the lease agreement. Since, the lease agreement has not been signed yet, the balance lease consideration has not been recovered by the UDA. The process of inviting proposals has been explained in the Cabinet Paper. The UDAs intention was to give an opportunity to all local and international investors to make their proposals to the said property. The offer made by the KRRISH Group for the above property was evaluated by the UDA. In addition to that, the BOI has also recognized this project as a strategic development project. The development proposal submitted for the site is for a mixed development project. The mixed development contains shopping arcades, retail shops, office spaces, hotels as well as apartments. Zoning of Colombo Fort as per the UDA Development Plan permits all the above uses.

The KRRISH Group has diversified business which includes distilleries and real estate developments. Searches carried out through KPMG Sri Lanka (Chartered Accountants M/s Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler) revealed that the KRRISH Group is involved with various real estate projects in North India under various entities with the Group, including JBPL and KRRISH Realty Nirman.

The following projects of the KRRISH Group have found reference in the public domain as per the above search report.

* KRRISH Provence: This is a planned residential group housing project at Gwal Pahari, Sector 2, Gurgaon, Haryana.

* KRRISH Township: This project is to be developed on the golf course extension road, Gurgaon, Haryana on approximately 100 acres of land. The township is planned with villas, apartments, commercial complexes, schools and hospitals.

* KRRISH Commercial Project: A commercial complex is being developed at Gurgaon on NH-8 besides 32nd milestone. The development is planned on over 1 million square feet having corporate offices and retail space.

* Ibiza Park, Surajkund: KRRISH has undertaken a group housing project at Surajkund, Faridabad, Haryana.

Beneficial owners of the Krrish Group are mainly the Katyal family headed by Mr. O.P. Katyal, M/s Teekay Finvest and M/s Mahadev Infratech (Pvt.) Limited. The Directors who are in the KRRISH Transworks Colombo (Pvt.) Limited are Mr. Amith Katyal, Mr. Rajendra Prashad Gupta, Ms. Aishwarya Soni and Mrs. Janaki Siriwardena.

The Lease Agreement executed with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for a car park project did not materialize and as such it was cancelled with their concurrence. Therefore, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka is no longer a party to this development.

This proposal has been considered by the Board of Management of UDA, the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and the Standing Cabinet-Appointed Review Committee, headed by the Secretary to the Hon. Prime Minister.

I table* the requested information and agreement between the UDA, BOI and the KRRISH Group.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Speaker, I rise to a point of Order. While thanking the Hon. Minister for reading out the statement by the relevant Ministry, I must say that the UDA has misled this House.

I would like to place before the Hon. Minister the matters that are to be taken up.

If KRRISH Group has not signed the final agreement, how have they got all the billboards out there?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) The advertisements?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) The main business partner of KRRISH Group is Cobra Indian Beer (Pvt.) Limited., and its subsidiaries are Iceberg Industries Limited, and Frost Falcon Distilleries Limited, which brew country liquor. They have not got the turnover or the assets of even the Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) Sir, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition is entering into a debate. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I am not entering into a debate.

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) If he needs a debate on this statement, that can be provided later. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) No, Hon. Speaker, I am only - ( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) This is not the time for a debate. If you want a debate, ask for it. Then I will verify this fact and reply. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Sir, I am raising a point of Order.

I am going to give a document to the Hon. Minister which states that Cobra Indian Beer (Pvt.) Limited., also has Lord Bilimoria in it. Cobra Beer in England went bankrupt and Molson Coors had to come in. Lord Bilimoria has been called a waster, a scoundrel, in the English Press. That is why I want you all to find out this. Ibiza Park, Provence Estate and KRRISH Township have never materialized.

Just find this out. I will give you all the details. , . All I can tell the Government is, if you are depending on Lord Bilimoria, you might end up with gonorrhea.

GSP , expropriation , over-investments . Sir, this is the duplication of capital expenditure in the country. With no malice, I am very happy to see pro-development in the country and I would love to see not one port in Hambandota, but 10 ports in Hambantota. But, after two years, when the Port has been put to commencement, how many ships have commercially come to this Port? During these two years, not even 13 ships have gone there. , - [ ] Could you listen please? , .

. 13 ? . 5800 , . ? So, the duplication of funding must be basically stopped. You must ensure that you put it into productive use and have a cost-benefit analysis. I am sure the Hon. Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning understands this, but I would like to get an answer on behalf of the Opposition as to how you are going to defend this. So, having a cost-benefit analysis is a must.

Then, we are going to have additional flyovers and airports in Hambantota. I greatly appreciate that and I am the happiest.

Then, look at what the ADB states in "Daily Mirror" of 18th April, 2012. It quite rightly points out, I quote:

Govt. fails to take steps to improve investor confidence: ADB

So, this has not been published with malice. What the ADB says is good, I only endorse it; whether it is the IMF, the World Bank or the ADB, or whether it is Cuba or North Korea, if they say something which is good, we must embrace it. On this particular issue, this is what the ADB says. So, likewise, the exchange loss to this country is another disaster.

, . .

Consistency and coherency has been shown over the last two or three Budgets, which I appreciate on behalf of the Opposition and, we are the first to commend things like that. But, that affects only a micro-picture of the country, not on a macro-basis. I would like to replicate that on to the macro-picture. That is what is required. The

relaxation of exchange controls is a step in the right direction. Is it a direction given by the IMF? Is this the way of exposing the countrys rupee to the world? If that is the case, are we backed up with the necessary resources to defend the rupee at a given moment? These are the questions that beg to be answered. Today, if a company can get US Dollars 10 million in three years, - there is some interpretation like that - we appreciate that. But, that should be at the Governments requirement - because they are unable to provide it - and with the strength of those private companies. But, if it is done just for the sake of "for one year go ahead and do what you want, get all the money and then suddenly close the stable doors", that is not how it should be done.That is what we, from the Opposition, say.

Then, Hon. Speaker, I would love to give certain ideas, which are basically from the Opposition. Today, in the construction field, there is a 28 per cent built-in cost made by the Government on taxes et cetera. So, ensure that that is reduced. The tax alone is 12 per cent of the 28 per cent built-in cost. If you reduce the taxation on banks, you will be able to make a healthy, vibrant small and medium business community. The financial markets are yearning to have consistency and coherency. Today, the stock market is re-linked, investor-confidence is non-existent and foreigners are exiting the country.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran, please.

[1.01 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill. As before, on every occasion when I have spoken on the Second Reading, I have consistently raised an important issue at the mini-Budget in 2010, later in November 2010 and also in November 2011, and for the fourth time today I wish to raise it right at the outset and that is, the unconstitutionality of His Excellency the President holding the portfolio of Minister of Finance. It is quite clear from the scheme of the Constitution that the President should not or ought not to hold that position. There is no explicit prohibition. But, if one reads through the Chapter on Finance, one cannot but come to the conclusion that only a Member of Parliament who is accountable to Parliament can hold that position of Minister of Finance. It is true that the President attends Parliament Sittings and in the present state of affairs, there is even provision for him to answer questions. Yet, we have not had that happened after the Eighteenth

Amendment to the Constitution was passed. In any case, he is not a Member of Parliament and therefore he is not really accountable to Parliament.

Article 148 of the Constitution makes it very clear that Parliament shall have full control over public finance. There is provision in the Constitution for the Head of the Executive, the President, to appoint different Ministers and assign to them different functions. But, we also have a determination and advisory opinion of the Supreme Court with regard to the portfolio of Defence. Although there is no expressed prohibition for anybody other than the President holding that office, in fact, for a brief period somebody other than the President held that office. The Supreme Court, in an advisory opinion, concluded that the post of Minister of Finance must be held by His Excellency the President having regard to the scheme of the entire Constitution. By the same logic, if one is to go by the scheme of the entire Constitution, the portfolio of Finance cannot be held by the President and it must be held by a Member of Parliament who is accountable totally only to Parliament.

Having said that, I wish to draw your attention to the fact that in the speech made yesterday, this becomes very clear. The first point that I made today becomes very clear if one followed the speech made by the Hon. Minister of Finance last afternoon in this House. In that speech, there was very little, if anything, to do with the budget of financial provisions. It had a lot to do with various political matters. As the Head of the Government, as the Head of the Executive, he set forth how the Government in the last two years, has performed and wishes to move forward; he talked about a three-year plan and many other matters totally unrelated to finance.

I wish to deal with some of those issues because those are crucial issues which have plagued this country for over 60 years. But, before I get on to those matters, with your permission, may I deal with some of the financial aspects.

This Appropriation Bill, after it was presented to this House, was challenged in the Supreme Court and Supreme Court's Determination was made known to this House by the Hon. Speaker on the 6th of November, 2012 when the House convened. The announcement made in the House was that only two clauses of this Bill cannot be made into law without it being amended because it offends Article 148 of the Constitution.

I wish to bring to the notice of this House that when a provision or provisions offend Article 148 of the Constitution, the position is now very clear that you cannot get over it by a mere two-thirds majority in Parliament alone. Article 148 deals with the legislative power of the Parliament directly relevant to Article 4(a) of the Constitution and. therefore, it is linked to Article 3. There were several Determinations of the Supreme Court

369 370

in this regard previously and even in one of the other two Determinations that were announced on the 6th of November 2012 itself, it has been clearly held that since a particular provision offends Article 148 and since Article 148 is linked to Article 3, that provision cannot be made into law without a special majority prescribed in the Constitution as well as an approval of the people at a referendum. In this instance, the Determination of the Supreme Court was tabled by the Hon. Speaker but I wish to draw the attention of this House today to some salient features of the Determination of the Supreme Court of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka - No. SC (SD) 15/2012 with regard to the Appropriation Bill.

The court carefully went through the submissions made before it and has held, I quote:

The Court agrees however with submissions of learned Counsel for the petitioners, that there has to be very careful scrutiny of any powers which are vested in public officers, without and beyond direct Parliamentary control at a macro level, the full control envisaged by Article 148 of the Constitution, as it could potentially be abused or used irresponsibly and in extreme situations even used for self gain through corrupt practices, in total negation of the safeguards guaranteed by the Constitution that all acts of Parliament would accord with the doctrine of public trust which binds Parliament when it exercises the sovereign power of the people.

The court also went on to hold, I quote:

This Court also agrees with the submission that this Court would not be bound by earlier decisions on several Appropriation Bills...

And thereafter, referred to the Determination made by the Supreme Court in 1986 on the Appropriation Bill, 1986.

That determination was made by a Bench of the Supreme Court presided over by his Lordship Justice Wanasundera. On that occasion also, the Court went into these aspects of full control over public finances by Parliament and made some salient observations. The Determination of the Supreme Court made on the Appropriation Bill, 1986 states, I quote:

'In respect of these functions- '

"These functions", that is Parliaments functions with regard to public finances -

'taxation, supply, appropriation and the authorization of expenditure- the House of Commons claims pre-eminence. '

It is a quotation from the British Parliament. They have also quoted page 759 of Parliamentary Practice (20th Edition) by Erskine May. I quote:

'Three important precepts of financial practice are implied in the appropriation of expenditure. (1) A sum appropriated to a particular service cannot be spent on another service. (2) The sum appropriated is the maximum sum. (3) It is available only in respect of changes which have arisen during the year in respect of which it has been appropriated by the relevant Act. As a consequence, any sum found to be saved on a vote at the end of a financial year must be surrendered to the Exchequer. '

Now, it is in respect of this function or in respect of these principles that some of the provisions of the Appropriation Bill before us has been found to be wanting by the Supreme Court where the Minister is given the power to appropriate for different expenses, monies that are authorized originally for some other expense and not utilized.

Also, to change Heads of Expenditure, the provision has been looked at by the court and the court has very clearly declared that such an exercise would offend Article 148. In the present Determination Their Lordships say, I quote:

In recent times there have been much debate on the powers vested in the Head of the executive and the Cabinet of Ministers, but it is appropriate to mention that the framers of the Constitution have aptly safeguarded these powers, as for instance in terms of Article 43(1) of the Constitution, they shall all be 'collectively responsible and answerable to Parliament' .

So, this brings me back again to the first point that I have made with regard to a person who is not fully answerable to Parliament holding the portfolio of Minister of Finance.

The Determination goes on to say, I quote:

Another perhaps less explicit but dominant control is enshrined in Article 148 of the Constitution, which mandates that all public finance, including the control of the spring or source of the finance whether it be through taxes etc, and the control of the allocation of public finance passes through and only through the eye of Parliament, which is expected and invested with powers to act in good faith and to act in accord with the public trust doctrine by monitoring through its directions, and maintaining checks and balances through its audits and verifications, to assure the people that there is the highest degree of fiscal accountability on the executive. In practice, fiscal accountability can only be assured by a process where Parliamentary control is exercised in full in a transparent manner where matters are placed in the public domain, enhancing the credibility of the process through patent disclosures and public debate on its implications. It is in this backdrop that this Court analyses the Bill and considers whether any of its provisions alienates or circumvents the control of public finance by Parliament as envisaged by Article 148 of the Constitution,..

There were placed before the court, several reports under the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003 and the court has found that the disclosures made there are inadequate. Now, this was the same in the Appropriation Bill 2008 also where the court went into these matters and examined the disclosures made to

371 372

[ .. ]

2012 09

Parliament even subsequent to appropriating certain sums for certain expenditure in terms of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act to be inadequate. In 2008, the court held very clearly, that is, SC(SD) 3 and 4 of 2008, where a very clear Determination was made that since Article 4(a) is offended when 148 is offended, it directly links Article 3 and that cannot be made into law without the approval of the people at a referendum.

So, I am citing two previous Supreme Court Determinations with regard to the Appropriation Bill, 1986 and the Appropriation Bill, 2008 together with another Determination that was made and announced with regard to Divineguma Bill on the 6th of November 2012, where once again another Bench of the Supreme Court held that when it offends Article 148, it offends Article 3 and, therefore, you require the approval of the people at a referendum.

The question that I am posing now, since the Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning is in the House is, what do you propose to do in terms of these two Clauses, Clause 2 (1)(b) and 7(b) of the Appropriation Bill, that have been found to be in contravention of Article 148 of the Constitution? It is now trite law that when Article 148 of the Constitution is violated, Article 3 is violated and therefore in addition to the special majority prescribed in Article 84(2), you also need the approval of the people at a referendum. Will the Government move to amend those two provisions 2(1)(b) and 7(b) of the Appropriation Bill to bring it in line with Article 148 before it is put to vote? Or else, does the Government propose to pass it with a two-thirds and also place the Appropriation Bill before the people at a referendum because if this is not amended, then the Appropriation Bill for next year cannot be passed, cannot become law until you hold a referendum. - [Interruption.] That is the position. During all these 20 minutes, Hon. Deputy Minister, I have clearly laid out, previous Determinations. If you followed my speech, you would have understood that when Article 148 is violated, Article 3 is violated and that did not happen today or yesterday. That happened when His Lordship Justice Raja Wanasundera made his Determination in 1986. That is trite law. I am asking the question: what does the Government propose to do? But, more importantly - [Interruption.[ I am not interpreting it. There have been previous interpretations.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Hon. Deputy Speaker, he was reading the Court Order. There is no such reference for a referendum. That is his own words that he is trying to include. You can interpret it in the way you want. You are interpreting so many things. But, in this judgment which is in Hansard, there is no -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You are perfectly right. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Please concede what is correct. You can argue. You may be having an argument. That is different. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am not arguing. I am citing the Determination made in 1986 by His Lordship Justice Wanasundera and two others. I am citing the Determination made in 2008. I am citing another Determination which was read out on the same day, 6th of November, 2012, all of which, say that when Article 148 is violated, automatically Article 3 is violated. That is not my interpretation. That is the interpretation made by the Supreme Court at different times.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) But, Hon. Member, the Supreme Court, at different times, has approved them. Therefore, you cannot go back. You have to read on the judgment that you are quoting, not on past judgments because the Supreme Court has said that none of those judgments are binding on our new interpretation. So, either you fall on the present judgment or fall on the older judgment. Where do you fall?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) All right. That may be the understanding -

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) You are trying to combine things for your own argument. That is what you are trying to do.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That maybe the understanding of the Hon. Minister. I have cited and placed on record the consistent interpretation by the Supreme Court, that where Article 148 is violated then automatically Article 4 (a) of the Constitution and in turn, Article 3 of the Constitution are violated and you cannot gainsay. It is up to the Government to decide what it wants to do.

In the present Determination, there is a very serious issue that has been raised with regard to foreign borrowings. The court, having looked at Clause 2(1)(b) of the Appropriation Bill, states that this kind of borrowing is intergenerational, meaning that this has a domino

373 374

effect, this keeps going from generation to generation and that Parliament must have a control over the maximum limit that may be borrowed.

It is for that reason that Clause 2(1) (b) has been cited as violating Article 148 of the Constitution. Also, Clause 7 (b) appears every year from 2007. It was the UNP that introduced such a provision first. Nobody challenged it then. But, I think it was from 2007 that it had been challenged. The Supreme Court from 2007 onwards consistently said, You cannot change the Heads of Expenditure and that must be reported to Parliament. Of course, initially they said, You can subsequently report it to Parliament. But, this time it very clearly says that Clause 7 (b) offends Article 148.- [Interruption.]

The Government must also understand that on the 6th of November, 2012 three Determinations of the Supreme Court were tabled in this House. Those were three Supreme Court Determinations made by three different Benches. In all three Determinations, those three different Benches had come to the conclusion that several provisions of the different Bills - the Appropriation Bill, the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Bill and the Divineguma Bill - violated the Constitution. So, that is something I think the Government must take note of - that not just one or two judges but in this case nine judges of the Supreme Court, sitting separately, have pronounced that you have presented Bills that violate various provisions of the Constitution. - [Interruption.]

I am only saying that that is a matter you will do well to remember. Even if you remember it, I am saying, continuously year after year Clause 7(b) of the Appropriation Bill reappears, despite the Supreme Court saying that it violates Article 148 of the Constitution. It reappears every year. Therefore, that does not seem to be well remembered when the Appropriation Bill is prepared.

To come back to the speech made by His Excellency the President, or rather the Hon. Minister of Finance, in the House yesterday, there were various political matters that were dealt with. I said that I will make reference to those matters in the second half of my speech. His Excellency the President said with regard to a political solution, the present system of Provincial Councils has to be re-looked at. That is an important pronouncement made in the course of a Budget Speech.

I would like to recount several promises that were made by this Government over the course of time with regard to this very matter. On the 26th of May, 2009 there was a Joint Statement issued by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-Moon. This is what part of it said. I quote:

President Rajapaksa expressed his firm resolve to proceed with the implementation of the 13th Amendment.

I repeat:

President Rajapaksa expressed his firm resolve to proceed with the implementation of the 13th Amendment, as well as to begin a broader dialogue with all parties, including the Tamil parties in the new circumstances, to further enhance this process and to bring about lasting peace and development in Sri Lanka

This was not just a one-off statement made in May, 2009. In March, the same year, the Minister Hon. Mahinda Samarasingha at the 10th Session of the UN Human Rights Council had this to say, I quote:

Our national discourse has been dominated for decades by an ethnic issue, which requires a political solution as a means to resolve problems. This political solution could never be imposed by force of arms and certainly not gain by acts of terrorism. It is for this reason that we are also trying to forge a sustainable political solution acceptable to all Sri Lankans on a recommendation of the All Party Representatives Committee, we are able to properly implement the 13 Amendment to the Constitution which was passed in 1987, ..

I repeat:

We are able to properly implement the 13th Amendment to the Constitution which was passed in 1987.

He referred to the APRC. The APRC that was chaired by the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana, handed over its Report to His Excellency the President, several years ago. What has happened to the promise made to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, in March, 2009, with regard to the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment and with regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the All-Party Representative Committee, none of which has been done? And, His Excellency the President yesterday said that it would be good if we could resolve this with self-respect within the country, without going outside. It was he who made these promises outside. It was he who voluntarily made a Joint Statement with the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon that I read out. It was his special envoy, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe who made this voluntary commitment outside with regard to the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment and further enhancing it and implementing the APRC recommendations. What I am reading out are voluntary assurances made by His Excellency the President and his own envoys to outside the country. - [Interruption.] Yes. Then, yesterday he said, Let us not go outside; let us redesign this system", the system now under the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which is not fully implemented. Then, several assurance have been given here and abroad, to India and to the UN, that it would be implemented in full from September 2008 onwards. And, sudden wisdom seems to have dawned

yesterday to inform this House that this needs to be looked at again; that this somehow does not accord with the needs of Sri Lanka today. We think this is a dangerous departure.

It was bad enough giving promise after promise and not keeping to them. But, by merely not keeping to those promises, you are changing course away from all those promises that have been given to people outside. So, it is our duty to raise this caution and inform the Government that this is not good for the country. It is not good for the Head of our country to assure the Secretary-General of the United Nations of all people, that he will do something, drag it for three and a half years and then stand up and say something opposite in this august Assembly. It is not good for the dignity of the people of this country to have somebody do this. Whatever it may be, he is the Head of this country; he is the Head of the Government and any behaviour like this reflects badly on all of us. So, as a responsible Opposition, it is our duty to bring it to the notice of the Government and place it on record. It is of no use later slating the international community. It is no use saying that others are now trying to interfere with our internal affairs. These are voluntary commitments given to the international community and as the Hon. Minister was pleased to say, in the grand scheme of things, we are one part. We have friendly relations with other countries. We may be an island. Yet, we are an island in the world of nations. We like to call ourselves a part of the civilized society but this countrys Government cannot be allowed to behave like a rogue-State, default on every promise that is made and then find others responsible for them or blame others for those defaults. This is not all.

I read out two assurances given in March and May in 2009. In May, 2011, The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, Minister of External Affairs of Sri Lanka made a Joint Press Statement with the Minister of External Affairs of India. It states, I quote:

The External Affairs Minister of Sri Lanka affirmed his Governments commitment to ensuring expeditious and concrete

progress in the ongoing dialogue between the Government of Sri Lanka and representatives of Tamil parties. A devolution

package, building upon the 13th Amendment, would contribute towards creating the necessary conditions for such reconciliation.

What has happened to this? And, we are angry when India exercises its vote in the United Nations Human Rights Council for a Resolution on Sri Lanka. We give repeated assurances like this and willy-nilly violate them and then, we are upset that India is voting for a Resolution on Sri Lanka. What do you expect responsible countries to do? When you go there, in New Delhi, you stand with your counterpart and give these assurances on a joint statement and then behave as if nothing has happened, that nothing binds you.

It is true that we are a sovereign country. But, we are part of a world of nations.

There are friendly relations that must be nurtured, and that brings along with it a certain measure of responsible conduct on the part of this country. If this trend continues - I say with all responsibility that yesterday was a watershed; there was a serious departure from even the undertakings, promises that are being given - if that is the direction in which the Government now wants to turn, you cannot blame anyone, but your own selves for the consequences that would bring, not on this Government, but on this country as a whole. And as responsible citizens of this country, we are as much concerned as anyone else is.

On 17th January, 2012, the visiting Minister of External Affairs of India, speaking at a joint press conference at which our own Minister of External Affairs, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, was also present, standing next to him had this to say, I quote:

"The Government of Sri Lanka has on many occasions conveyed to us its commitment to move towards a political settlement based on the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution, and building on it, so as to achieve meaningful devolution of powers. We look forward to an expeditious and constructive approach to the dialogue process."

Now, what has happened to those commitments made on many occasions and conveyed to India, to the United Nations and to the world? I wish to ask the Government this question. Is it the position of the Government - this must be made clear - that the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution will be repealed?

Then, I am asking another question. About participation in the Select Committee, we have made a full disclosure - if you want, I will repeat that - and we have made it known to the country, also again and again, that because promises made were not kept that we did not move in to that. It was not just only promises, it was agreements that were recorded and in writing as to when we will join the Parliamentary Select Committee and none of those have been fulfilled as yet. If you ask questions, you will get replies from me. - [Interruption.] You will be better off not asking questions.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Are you going back on it?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, we are not going back on it. We have said we will come into the Select Committee -

377 378

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) You have something else in your mind.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, no. We do not have anything else in our mind.

( ) (The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa) Do not say that. You have something else in your mind.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) All right. Now that you say it, I will place it on record.

On the 2nd of September, 2012, there was a meeting between the Leader of the TNA and His Excellency the President and there was an agreement reached at that meeting, which was recorded in the minutes of our bilateral talks that were held on the 16th of September, 2011. It is in writing and the agreement that was reached was that the bilateral talks would proceed and when we reach a consensus at the bilateral talks, that consensus would be taken to the Parliamentary Select Committee either as a Government's position or a joint TNA-Government position and it is at that point that the TNA would join the Parliamentary Select Committee. Why has that been breached? Why has that not been honoured?

If you go through every promise that the Government gives, it is obvious that it is habitual for Government to default on any promise. But, that cannot continue. If you keep continuing by dishing out promises and violating them willy-nilly as you have been doing in the last three years, you will have to face some consequence at some point. Sir, this is what His Excellency the President said

yesterday in the Budget Speech, 2013, I quote:

A change in the prevailing Provincial Council system is necessary to make devolution more meaningful

We welcome that part of the Budget Speech where he said "to make devolution more meaningful" because that is part of the assurances that have been given continuously. But, "a change in the prevailing provincial council system" is not part of the promise that has been given continuously since September, 2008. The promise that has been given since September, 2008, an umpteen number of times, is to fully implement the present provincial council system, to fully implement the Thirteenth Amendment and then go beyond it to achieve meaningful devolution. That is why I am seeking a clarification today of what is meant and what is the stance

of the Government when you say a change in the prevailing provincial council system. Why are you changing course now having given the world promise after promise after promise, saying you will fully implement the Thirteenth Amendment? That in itself is a shameful act. That is our Constitution, which the Government goes on saying, We will implement it; we will implement it. You concede that there is no rule of law in this country when you keep on saying, We will do it; we will do it. That is part of the Constitution of this country. Leave that aside. Having given that kind of repeated assurances that you would implement the Constitution, now to change course and say a change in the prevailing provincial council system obviously shows a serious deviation.

As I said earlier, it is one thing to give these promises and then, every time you are asked about it, to keep saying, No, no, we will do it; we will do it". That is the Sri Lankan way, to go on saying, "We will do it; we will do it.

( ) (The Hon. Arundika Fernando) Have patience.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran)

Thank you, Hon. Member seated behind me from the Puttalam District. I must thank him as he made a very clear stance and said that the Thirteen Amendment to the Constitution must be implemented. Anybody in the Government who thinks differently can go out of the Government and say it. I congratulate the Hon. Member from Puttalam.

( ) (The Hon. Arundika Fernando) Have patience. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) My only worry is whether he will be forced to leave now; from the speech made yesterday and he having shot his mouth, whether he will be forced to leave. I hope that does not come about. We are fully with you, Hon. Member, on that stand you bravely took and hope that sense will prevail, not just because we want the Thirteenth Amendment implemented. The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution is something that we had rejected right through as being meaningless. But, that is something that the Government has repeatedly assured is a first step, that they will fully implement that, go beyond it and further enhance it. So, that is a-

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Member, -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Ah! Where did you come from suddenly?

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) I have been here -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It was very quiet when I was talking about the bilateral talks' minutes and so on. You were not here. You are the Secretary to that Committee.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sorry, I just came in.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You disappeared when we were talking about the minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) We feel the same about you, Hon. Member. Like what you said about the Hon. Arundika Fernando, your position within the TNA also must be protected. Otherwise, the way it is going, you will also be ousted from the party very soon. Therefore, we wish you the same.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am seeking clarifications from the responsible Ministers seated in the first three rows. I am not seeking a clarification from a backbencher. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) We are here by the vote of the people unlike you. You are here only by choice or by default. I am here by vote. -[Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Hon. Member from Galle also has a role to play in this. He functioned as the Secretary to the Committee

that held bilateral talks between the TNA and the Government and he is knowledgeable on all the matters that I presently stated. So, he can confirm all that I said with regard to the agreements reached.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) I will definitely respond during my speech, after looking at the Hansard.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The question that I posed with regard to the Governments stance, I believe, will be answered by a senior Minister. I am asking this also for the reason that it has now become habitual for this Government to rake up something; then deny it; then officially deny it; but then suddenly carry it out. That happened during the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution. There was talk of extending or removing the term limits of the President. There was some momentum created. Then the Leader of the Opposition was invited for a few tea parties.

( ) (An Hon. Member) For coffee! .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Yes, for coffee parties, not tea. Then, an announcement was made in the public, with His Excellency the President and the Hon. Leader of the Opposition together saying, No, we are not doing this. We want to abolish the Executive Presidency and bring in an Executive Prime Ministership. That announcement was made and then suddenly an urgent Bill, the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, comes further entrenching the Executive Presidency, even removing the limits on terms that a person can be the President.

Now, there has been a little momentum created by the usual suspects in the game calling for the abolition of the Thirteenth Amendment. Some unsuspecting souls like my Friend, the Hon. Member from Puttalam has said, No, no, that is not the stand of the Government. The Hon. Minister, speaking on behalf of the Cabinet, said, We are not going to repeal the Thirteenth Amendment.

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella - Minister of Mass Media and Information) Hon. Member -

381 382

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) What did you say?

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) As of now.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) As of now. Oh right! Not tomorrow?

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) The Thirteenth Amendment is in existence.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you very much for that clarification.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Very precisely.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you very much. I am used to semantics like this in a Court of Law. But a Minister, at a press conference after a Cabinet Meeting, briefing the Media and addressing the country says, As of now, we will not repeal the Thirteenth Amendment, cannot mean that tomorrow we will repeal it.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) How many times has the Constitution of India been amended? So, amending a Constitution is not something alien.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Nobody is opposed to amending Constitutions. We want this Constitution amended in such a way to make it a good Constitution.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) That is fine.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We all support that.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) I have no argument on that.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have only five more minutes left.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) As of now, amending a Constitution is very democratic, as long as you practice the democratic process.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Do you really know what the intention of the Government is? Do you know why in the course of the Budget Speech yesterday, His Excellency said this? Can you explain the meaning of, changing the present system and then also talk about "meaningful devolution"? Can you explain why the consistent assurances given with regard to the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment is being deviated from now? Are you able to say that? No, you are not. You are not privy to the thinking of the Government. The thinking of the Government is a coterie of a few individuals only.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Hon. Member, can I take half a minute and tell you what it is.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You can only speak what you are told to speak at the end of the Cabinet Meeting. All you are told is, "We will not amend it tomorrow".

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) The right of expression exists for all of us equally.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We can see that.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Member, you can express yourself, I can express myself, the Hon. Harsha De Silva can express himself.

383 384

2012 09

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Who said No?

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) That does not mean it is policy. This Constitution enables us the right of expression.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The Minister of Finance has made a statement, and with all responsibility I am saying, a very dangerous statement. Having regard to repeated assurances given to India, to the UN and to the world, for well over three years, consistent assurances given in one direction has been deviated from yesterday. I am pointing that out and I am asking for a clarification. And if any -

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) Can it not be a better one?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is the clarification I am asking. ( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) The change very implicitly -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It can be.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) You cannot come to a conclusion and say that it is going backwards. It can go forward.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Are you able to confirm that it is forward only?

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) It is open.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Why are you not able to confirm?

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) It is a collective responsibility.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will take your word for it if you confirm now that it is only forward.

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) The President as the Minister of Finance in his speech -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You are not able to do that. You do not know what the Government is thinking.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Do you want an answer straight away? - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Now, where did he come from suddenly? We were all proceeding in a very meaningful and a proper way until, I said previously also, in every card pack there are two; in this House there is only one. That one just walked in and is creating chaos. - [Interruption.] There he jumps up again, a jack-in-the-box. - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. Although he did not mention my name, through innuendo he is accusing me of something. The Tamil community knows him as the worst jackal and the jack in the pack in the community.-[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Exactly.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Do you know where Karavetti is? Do you know where Jaffna is? He does not know. They hate him. -[Interruption.]

385 386

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will conclude now. - [Interruption.] Before I sit down, I have been honoured by this verbal diarrhoea that just emanated from the back benches on the Government side.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) If you think that it is a honour conferred upon you - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It all depends on who says it.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Absolutely not.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) To be called by you by names is an honour that is bestowed on me.

Thank you very much, Sir.
