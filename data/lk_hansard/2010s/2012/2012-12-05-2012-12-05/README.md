. , . .

Mr. Deputy Chairman, I would like to set the record straight. I like to say that the Shariah is a Divine Guidance that covers all aspects of a Muslim's life. Shariah Law is only one aspect of the Shariah. A criticism of the Shariah Law is actually a criticism of the Divine Law and amounts to a criticism of Islam itself. We have to respect all religions and all religious teachings and the criticism of a religion is in bad taste and totally unacceptable.

The Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake's description of the Shariah Law as "" is shocking and insulting to both Islam and its followers. He has spoken as if every woman who goes to the Middle East, particularly to Saudi Arabia, is raped or sexually assaulted. He also spoke as if every person who goes to Saudi Arabia either gets his head chopped off or his hands cut off. Whichever country we go to, it is up to us to conform to the law of the land, however much we may disagree with the law. For instance, in some western countries, homosexuality is not an offence but a westerner who comes from one of those countries to Sri Lanka will have to conform to the law in Sri Lanka, which considers homosexuality, an offence.

While any form of sexual abuse needs to be condemned and prevented, such allegations need to be seen in the proper perspective. Domestic female workers, in whichever country they work, are in a vulnerable environment and every effort needs to be made to ensure their protection. That has to be done at government-to-government level to ensure that not only domestics but all Sri Lankans working abroad are ensured their rights. It would be harming the reputation of those females who go abroad to help out their families to suggest that every one of them has been subject to sexual abuse. For every case of sexual abuse and sexual harm, there are hundreds of success stories. Many families have economically come up due to the hard work of those who work in the Middle East and the remittances sent here. There are many housemaids who have worked for 10 - 20 years for the same employer while coming home every two years to see their loved ones and returned back to their employers. Those who have worked in the Gulf vouch for scenes where the employer, his wife and children come to see the maid off at the airport with gifts and tears in their eyes at the departure of the maid either on holiday or for good. There is also a case of a Saudi Arabian employer who spent over 1,000 Saudi Riyals a day on a housemaid who was suffering from cancer for giving her treatment in a private hospital. Even though he knew that she may not be of any use to him, he continued to spend that money in order to help or cure her.

2473 2474

If the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake is unhappy with a law of a particular country, he may criticize the law of that particular country or, even better, campaign against sending our workers to that particular country. There are many countries which have banned sending of housemaids and Bangladesh and India are among them. We could do the same if we feel that our workers are not safe in those countries. But, instead of condemning the laws of that country, to condemn the Shariah Law is not acceptable, because it is questionable how much of a law is in conformity with the Shariah in a particular country. In some countries, there maybe many aspects of the law which are in conflict with the Shariah even though they are loosely called Shariah law. For example, Saudi Arabia is a monarchy and Islam, the Shariah Law, does not accept the monarchy. So, Saudi Arabia does not follow the Shariah in full. Therefore, we should actually criticize the Saudi Arabian law rather than criticize a religious Divine Law that we accept.

So, on behalf of the UNP, I would like to say that the UNP disassociates itself from the statement the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake made in this House regarding the Shariah Law. I am sad to say that he has been misled and that statement cannot be accepted.

They have a huge issue with land encroachment. The Government is not doing anything to stop that. The LRC itself is giving a lot of trouble to most of the planters. It is the solemn duty of the Hon. Minister of Plantation Industries to promote investments and to help financially-crippled factories to get back on their feet. Hon. Minister, I emphasize that it is your duty. You are an international figure. You all have so much of contacts with China. As you say, China is also another country which has entered the tea market. So, why do you not bring down some investors and revamp the whole system in order to give this economy another boost through some new investments? I think you are the ideal and the capable person to do that. I think in the good old days, people like the Hon. J.R. Jayewardene and the Hon. Ranjan Wijeratne headed the Ministry of Plantation Industries. So, I think you have a very good opportunity. You will remember how many quality planters we used to have in the '80s and

'90s but today, nobody wants to take up to planting. There is no child who wants to take up to planting as a job because conditions and facilities in the estates are so low and they do not want to even consider going for a job in the plantations. So, I think, Hon. Minister, it is your duty to uplift the plantation sector.

[4.41 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mr. Deputy Chairman, I am happy to speak when the Votes on many Ministries are being taken up for Discussion today. I would like to concentrate on some of the Ministries that I basically have a hands-on knowledge.

Let me start off with the Ministry of Civil Aviation. I am sure this is a Ministry that can do a lot for the country. At this particular moment, it is going through turbulent times. Each CEO who comes from this institution tells a different story. At the end of the day, the main agenda of the Government is distorted by wrong officials who are there. Look at SriLankan Airlines, its loss is Rs. 19 billion. Look at Mihin Lanka, its loss is Rs. 2 billion. You look at the transport sector. If I go further, the loss of the SLTB is Rs. 6 billion, the loss of the Department of Railways is Rs. 7 billion. So, there is a major problem in the transport sector.

We have to confine ourselves to civil aviation now. This is an important subject for us. It may not be that you are going to make profit all the time. We are quite conscious of that. As Members of the Opposition, we have to ensure that fraud is reduced, the best intention of the Government is exposed and the benefit accrues to the people. At this particular moment, you have an excuse that you cannot make profit because of fuel problem. This is absolutely nonsense because other airlines in Asia are making money. But, I think it is necessary for us - whether we are in the Opposition or in the Government - to have a national carrier. There is no question. But, does that national carrier need to take the money of the taxpayers unwantedly? You have overstaffing; you have wrong route sectors been utilized; you have wrong decisions been taken and it is under-capitalized.

2563 2564

[ ]

2012 05

The first thing you have got to do is to ensure that you get the correct capital base for the two Airlines. SriLankan Airlines is under-capitalized. As a result, you are giving them a herculean task by not giving them the necessary tools to perform. So, the first thing you have got to do is to ensure that they are properly capitalized.

Mihin Lanka is a waste of time. I told that to my Friend, the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena the other day but he did not listen. He thought that this was an airline that could be run easily. His intention may have been good.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) I should say that it is definitely not a waste of time. You can see that when you take the figures. The rates are actually low. But, I accept the fact that it is under-capitalized.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I would say that at this particular moment this Airline has got a loss of Rs. 10 billion with 117,000 people flying. I would have been happy if you said, You can go to Bodhgaya and come back in Mihin Air for Rs. 10,000. Then, you would have made more money. So, the intention there is different. You initially mentioned that this Airline is for the downtrodden people who cannot afford to fly. But, that is not what your CEO and Chairman is saying. I appreciate their version rather than your version, because they have to stay alive. You cannot afford to basically go on a voyage of discovery with no capital saying it is subsidized. They have turned that approach into the correct way. They have been looking at route sectors that are profitable and they are trying to maximize that. You must concentrate on that. But, I believe that these two must be amalgamated rather than wasting your time on taking another airline as well. Those are choices that can be told to you. It is your decision. But remember, the Government spends Rs. 13 billion for 13 lakhs of Government servants and your one institution has lost Rs. 19 billion for whose benefit? This is the stark reality that you are faceed with.

Look at the areas of cargo. It is underutilized. This is a hub that you can utilize. Cargo is an area where you can earn 14 or 15 per cent of revenue. At the moment you have only 8, 9 or 10 per cent of revenue. These are the areas that you have got to utilize.

India is a monster before us. But, we are the right country which can take advantage of the big neighbour that is near us. So, those are the areas that you should concentrate. You are wasting time by putting another airport in Mattala. That is your choice. If you are paying money for it, there is no problem. But you are taking innocent taxpayers' money and doing that. You had one expedition on the Hambantota Port.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) In 2001, you were trying to do the same thing in Monaragala. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is different. - [Interruption.] Here in this case, you are going to have the airport in the same climatic condition. If you have established it in another climatic condition and then if the weather pattern is bad here, you have an option that you can go to another area. That is the difference. You can have airports in every city you like. But, at the end of the day, there will be a critical mass to carry. That is the difference. The Hambantota Port is what we also planned for but what we decided was that it would be only a deep-sea port for dry-docking and not to build up port there by spending Rs. 6 billion a year on capital amortization because the Colombo Port has to bear it. But, today you have a Port there and only 24 ships have come there within 24 months. Is that what you want to do? To duplicate your capital resources? No.

The Mattala Airport maybe a step in the right direction for the future, but what are you trying to gain out of that? If you try to develop Mattala Airport at the expense of the Bandaranaike International Airport, that will be a folly. I am informed today that the runway there is damaged. You must get it repaired. We had a plan to develop the Katunayake International Airport for a better tomorrow by having two runways. So, acquire the 600-acre land that is there. You can take the Air Force Base to Mattala. If you do not want to take it to Mattala, Koggala or to Ratmalana, ensure that you free the land there and develop it for the second runway. It is not a duplication of assets. It is worthwhile and you do that. Before that, ensure that the runway is built up. Before too long, you might find that the tarmac is having a problem and that will be a serious issue. So, ensure that these vital matters are looked into.

The next matter that we have got to look at is the excess staff there. Ensure that they are entrusted with proper work. This morning, while answering an Oral Question, you stated that you still have 160 foreign pilots. So, ensure you localize that. You are a party that is talking everyday about it. . flights pilots . . , . . , , . .

Your newspaper, the Daily News of 3rd December, 2012 states, I quote:

HIA ready for take off

2565 2566

Take off but do not have a crash land. You must have the particular people - the critical mass - who are required. You cannot get airlines coming here unless you operate it properly. Otherwise, you will have a slot which is not properly utilized. You are trying to utilize flight landing every 14 minutes at the Katunayake International Airport. You can have five times more of that happening in Katunayake. So, develop it and ensure that the spill-over goes to Mattala. Now, in any case, you have embarked on developing Mattala. But, please ensure that your first and foremost issue is to develop the area on which you can concentrate. Like what has been done for shipping in the Colombo Port, the Katunayake International Airport should be for aviation. But, do not stop at that point. Also develop domestic tourism in all those areas like Weerawila, Koggala, Jaffna, Trincomalee and Batticaloa. Batticaloa is an area which is absolutely good for tourism and you are supposed to spend Rs. 900 billion for that. But, ensure that it is well spent. There is no point in spending Rs. 900 billion only for the ornamental factor in Batticaloa.

Then, Sir, I must pay tribute to Helitours because they are doing a yeoman service for the domestic tourism in Sri Lanka. That is an area where the SriLankan Airlines should really concentrate on and I do not think that the Sri Lanka Air Force is doing any commercial activities. So, this is an area where the SriLankan Airlines should be having subsidiaries to work on and also they should break the monopoly of ground handling because it lies in the hands of the SriLankan Airlines. So, it is something that you basically need to make competitive. Do not maintain the monopoly status because then you will be able to extract money only from the airline that is there. Ensure that you have competition and it can be among Government-owned institutions, but ensure that you have a healthy competition.

Today, considering the budget carrier and other airlines such as SpiceJet, Air Arabia, Tiger Airways et cetera, we find that the cost for running an airline in Colombo is very expensive. For example, to run an airline in Colombo, we have to spend US Dollars 2,500 as opposed to US Dollars 600 in India. As a result, we have less airlines coming into Colombo. So, As the Minister of Civil Aviation, you should be able to promote more airlines to come in. More airlines coming in means more tourism, more tourism means more revenue coming into the country and that should be the objective. That will also help the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa who is also keen to promote tourism. Ensure that you basically have an overall picture. Hon. Minister, ensure that you push them and bring more airlines into this country. More airlines will be more helpful for you. There is no point in building up hotels if the airlines do not bring tourists into this country. That is

what should be basically done. I think I should not take any more time to speak about matters relating to civil aviation because I would like to contribute some more views on other areas too.

The appointment of Senior Ministers is a matter which I feel absolutely sorry for because it is a waste of money, a waste of resources and a waste of knowledge and they come only at the last moment just to help only the firefighter issues. This is a waste of time. On the other hand, you have about 60 Ministries which are non-productive or counterproductive and again it is a waste of taxpayers money. So, these are areas which should be done away with. Ensure that you either give them a job or they are kept out of it. Do not just waste time. Bringing in these type of things is a waste of taxpayers money.

Then, if you take Telecom, I think this is an area where you have a lot of potential. You have gone to such an extent to have "telecom" in one Ministry, postal services in another and satellites in some other Ministry. There is no coordination, consistency or coherence among them. You have a good Secretary, Mr. Hemasiri Fernando to help you. But, the important thing is the problem of overstaffing. You have too much staff for too little activities. Try to have courier services because the best network is there in the Department of Posts. So, ensure that you create a courier service which will be helpful, healthy and be able to bring some money because this is an institution which is losing money badly at this particular moment.

So, I guess that these are areas which you have to look into in order to ensure that increased commercial activities are carried out.

. ? . ? 3 , . , hit squad . 3 . . . .

mass media. This is an area which is of great concern. In a democratic country, you must have a free, vibrant media and it needs principles that are applicable not only to Government media institutions but also to private sector institutions. Ensure that those give a fair coverage to all. Today, the Government media is on a voyage of discovery. You have on one side, the Government media

2567 2568

[ ]

2012 05

taking undue advantage and emabarking on character assassination of Government MPs and officials who stand very firmly on the principles that they believe in. There is an Impeachment Motion going on. You have the Daily News going on a voyage of discovery of their own. You have the Rupavahini doing whatever they want. These are taxpayers money. There are certain things that are done, which maybe anti-Government, but not anti-national. Just because there are such actions, it does not mean that the Government media must misuse those with the freedom given to them. But, remember one thing. The right of interpretation of the Constitution remains with the Judiciary. This is told by no less a person than the Speaker. So, please ensure that the necessary decorum is maintained when media goes on. When credibility is built, that helps even the Government. The Governments version told by a credible Government media will be better accepted than that of a Government media institution which does not have the confidence of the people. That is what needs to be done at this particular moment.

I would like to say that the Ministries we are speaking on were taken together simply because then, we have more time to concentrate on the important Ministries. But, that does not necessarily mean that we demean the Ministries that we have taken up together and are speaking on. Our MPs have been allowed to concentrate and speak on the areas that are covered by those Ministries and give ideas on many a matter.

Then, let me take another area which is of great concern today. The cost of living is very high; it is not easy to bear. As a former Minister of Trade, I know that the Hon. Johnston Fernando is having a hard time concentrating on reducing the cost of living. His job should be not only reducing the cost of living, but also increasing the income capacity. That is what makes you go forward. First, let me wish you a very happy birthday, Hon. Johnston Fernando. The young and energetic Minister should be able to focus his full attention on how to ensure that we have a competitive trade free from a monopolistic environment and also that Government regulations are free for everybody.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. 3 ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena. What is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) This Hon. Member of the Opposition made a derogatory statement about another Hon. Member violating the Standing Orders and I kindly ask you to expunge that from the Hansard.

3 ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) If there is anything against the Standing Orders, it will be expunged from the Hansard.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, this is how they defend. I did not mention a name. If the cap fits, the relevant person can put it on. - [Interruption.] I did not mention a name; I never mentioned a name. People who went up the cranes are the ones about whom I am talking. If you want, I can give the name also. But, I did not put that hat on to anybody. That is the difference. So, all I am basically saying is -

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Member, as an experienced Member of this House, I think you have to -

3 ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Ravi Karunayake, you have two more minutes. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What are you expecting me to do? Respect a person who does not deserve respect? I will respect the Minister of Co-operatives and Internal Trade who is a person who basically works. On that particular basis, all I want to say is, if profit is there - Now get ready; give them time to character assassinate. That is not a problem. But, I want my 25 minutes. - [Interruption.] How can it be two more minutes?

3 ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) You started at 4.40 p.m. You have to finish by 5.05 p.m. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I can speak till 5.11 p.m. 3 ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) No, you started at 4.40 p.m. It is recorded. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What to do? We get censored everywhere. Please give me three minutes.

3 ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Impossible. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, you are very eager to see the other side of the coin. That I can see. All I want to say Hon. Minister is, ensure that these people are accountable to you, do not allow them to run the institution as if they have dictatorial rights. Your leaders are doing one way, your institutional heads are doing another way, but that is not the way to run institutions. You must have Government regulations complied with; audit must be carried out.

The Finance Minister of this country says that there will be a tax of 12.5 per cent imposed on any company that has a turnover in excess of Rs. 500 million for a quarter. So, if that is the case, ensure that they comply

2571 2572

[ ]

2012 05

with that or exempt them. I recommend that you speak to the Finance Minister, His Excellency the President, and get that tax of 12.5 per cent taken away. It is not only Sathosa. You have cheaper rates at Arpico, you have cheaper rates at Food City. You yourself know that. You have appointed some good directors, Mr. Krishantha Kapuwatte is one of them, and ensure that they have a right to run that place. If you want a clean administration, that is what you have got to do. Just because your right hand Members resort to character assassination after this, it does not mean that Sathosa will be revived. The wholesale business was closed up five years ago. We reinvigorated that. We recapitalized it and put it on a competitive basis. Today that is non-existent. You should be able to correct yourself and ensure that the Chairman reports to you on a monthly basis. Having no audit for five years is something which is disgraceful.

3 ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If I have started at 4.40 p.m, and I have 25 minutes, I have another three more minutes.

3 ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) How did you calculate? Hon. Yogarajan, how many minutes are you giving him?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

3 ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) What is your point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, this is the problem the Chair faces. . . . , -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , ?

3 ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Yogarajan, how many minutes can you give him?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I will take three, four minutes. 3 ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Okay, Hon. Karunanayake, you carry on.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) On that particular basis, all I want to say is, ensure that you have a commercial establishment that is running. I have opened a can of worms. Hon. Minister, if you want to have an institution that is running clean and able to serve the people of this country, ensure that you guide it properly. Do not let

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] who are behind you to get up like a jack-in-the-box and talk without substance to ruin this.

All I basically say is, ensure that you work on a more competitive basis where tender procedures are followed, audits are complied with and you have a board of directors that is responsible for you. The Chairman is going in one direction and the board of directors is going in another. I took up the challenge and with your help we reinvigorated Sathosa. You know how it went on. Today what a mess it is in! Its actual loss is not reflected. This is how you waste the taxpayers money. So, all what I want you to do at this particular moment is to get our help to fight the economic monster. Inflation is galloping at the rate of 10 per cent in disguise. Ensure that you give the people what they deserve, a better living standard, a more quality-oriented living standard. Even the price of milk powder is going up. I know it is difficult for you but your concentration should be on increased competition. There is no point in trying to reduce prices when prices in the world market are going up. But, if you are able to face the competition, I am sure you will be able to do justice to the consumers of this country. That is all I wanted to speak on the area of trade.

Hon. Minister, I request you to look into the functions of the Paddy Marketing Board because that is an institution coming under you purview. Domestic production should be bought by them since these are institutions that should be utilized to gainfully buy what is produced. Today the private sector is giving a better price to the farmers than the Government sector. So, what you should do is to compete with the private sector. You have companies like Cargills -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Do you want me to wind up my speech?

3 ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) I do not mind if you have been given five minutes. Hon. Yogarajan, he is asking for five minutes from your time. Is it okay by you?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is okay. Three minutes is enough.

3 ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Then, wind up your speech. Three minutes is over now.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Since time is a problem, I will conclude. Before that, all I want to tell the Hon. Minister is that instead of heckling without knowing what you all are doing - you all have ruined the economy.- ensure that you listen to the point of view of the Opposition.- [Interruption.] Substanceless people are running this country and the country has economically fallen into a perilous situation and the innocent and poor taxpayers are made to pay the price.

I agree with the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake when he says that both Airlines are under-capitalized. But, we have to find solutions for those. That is what we are doing. Fleets have expanded; throughput has expanded; cabin factors have expanded and frequencies have expanded. Hon. Member, may I tell you that the SriLankan Airlines alone does 205 frequencies a week and Mihin Air with three aircrafts does 40 frequencies a week.

If you look at the fuel cost, three years ago the fuel cost was only 38 per cent of the revenue. Today, that has gone up to 60 per cent. When you look at regional airlines and all the other airlines in the world, there is a certain amount of subsidy provided by the respective shareholders or governments in order to keep those airlines profitable. That is something that we have to take into consideration in terms of finding a permanent solution for the under-capitalized situation. But, does that mean that we have to close down these airlines? You are very well aware of the agreement between Air Lanka and Emirates. Though I was not in this House at that time, I used to read in the newspapers how critical you were of the Agreement that existed between Air Lanka and the Emirates.

Should we not be following the model that Emirates introduced? Primarily, what should we be doing? We should be marketing Sri Lanka. That is exactly what we are doing. If we are marketing Sri Lanka, we need capacity. Now, Lufthansa has started building up capacity; British Airways has started. So, all these are new things that are happening. But, I do agree with the fact that both airlines must be strengthened in terms of their capital base and that is something that has to be addressed. I presume that it will be addressed in the coming year.

. airlines per seat kilometre unit cost . , Singapore Airlines, Malaysian Airlines, British Airways, American Airlines, Iberia Airlines, Cathay Pacific. Our seat kilometre cost is Rs. 6.50.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) ? ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) . . . , . .

The point that I am trying to make is, 60 per cent of the cost of operations today is attributed to the fuel cost. Can we pass on that entire burden to the passenger? We cannot do that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Are the other airlines doing that?

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) The other airlines are not doing that. If you take the accounts of Singapore Airlines, if you take the accounts of Cathay Pacific, if you take the accounts of Emirates, you will see the amount of equity contribution that they do every single year in their balance sheets. Unfortunately, we are not in a position to do so. That is something that we have to rectify. That, we have to accept. There is no point in finding fault with the management of the airline. In fact, the management has done very well. If you take the recent past, you will see that the numbers are on the increase with regard to cabin factors. Another issue that we have is - due to the fact that the Emirates Agreement was in place - that we have an ageing fleet. Our A340s will have to be changed. They can fly for another maximum one-and-a-half-years. A340 . re-fleeting . , When you are looking at it, you will have to take a holistic view of this whole thing. It is not a question of employees. What do you want us to do? Some of these employees- including my brother - has worked for that institution for 33 years. What do you want us to do? Kick them out tomorrow morning? Is that what you want us to do? If you take the statistics of employees per aircraft, we are far below the norm of the industry. We have only one problem to sort out. The issue that we have to sort out is in terms of proper capitalization and in terms of what we can do with the fuel cost. Until those

solutions are brought about, the situation of the airlines will not improve. That is a fundamental principle that we have to accept. That is not because of our management or because of our Government. If you take over the airline tomorrow morning, it will be the same thing. You will probably find ten people and sell it off and say, we sold it off, like you sold Sathosa. . .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) .

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) , . ? ? ? . , you mentioned the issue of pilots. Yes, SriLankan Airlines is recruiting pilots. When pilots come as cadet pilots, they have to be given training. They have got themselves a simulator and they are saving a lot of money. Even in terms of cost, if you see that the overall cost aspect of the airline - in terms of SriLankan Airlines - it has come down to more than 32 per cent over the last three-year period. That is amidst the inflationary period; that is amidst the depreciation of the rupee that we had to undergo. Do not forget about all these factors. These are commercial situations that exist when running a commercial business. You cannot give political solutions to a commercial business. That is the nature of the business.

[5.28 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Deputy Chairman. I am glad to speak soon after the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena. He stated in this House just now that there is a seat kilometre cost for the airline. The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena was the first CEO of Mihin Air. When he started, he introduced flights to Trichy. It was the only airline competing with SriLankan Airlines, which was charging up to Rs. 26,000 to Trichy. You offered that at Rs. 13,000. Today you have increased it to Rs. 21,000. I thought you were the proxy Minister of Foreign Affairs. But, you seem to be the proxy Minister of Civil Aviation too. Poor Hon. Priyankara Jayaratna is the Minister. You seem to be the proxy Minister of Civil Aviation too - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Why do you not look after the estate workers? - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I am talking about my people. - [Interruption.] Please listen to me and give me a reply. - [Interruption.] I will ask you a question. If the seat kilometre cost is so much as you said, why do you charge Rs. 50 per seat kilometre to Trichy and only Rs. 10 per seat kilometre to London? - [Interruption.] Is it because an estate worker or an Indian Tamil, who has to go often to Trichy, can be exploited? Please give an answer. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Yogarajan, I am sorry to say that you are displaying your knowledge of the aviation industry in public today. - [Interruption.] I am very sorry to say - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I am talking of passengers - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara) Give him the answer.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) I will tell you.- [Interruption.] I will answer. , .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You tell me why do you want to exploit those who are going to Trichy? You give a concessionary rate of Rs.10 per seat kilometre to a flight to London. Give the answer.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) The cost per available seat kilometre is determined by many things. - [Interruption.] It is determined by the cost of the sector, cabin factor that is utilized and the period of flight - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) But, when you start a budget airline, that is to help the people.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Let me explain to you. - [Interruption.] You asked me a question. - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I am asking you to help my people.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) I am answering your question.

2585 2586

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) What is the answer?

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Let me explain that to you.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) You did not give an answer.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) When you take the flight to Trichy - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) That is not the answer you gave. You told us two minutes ago that the cost per seat kilometre was so much. If the cost per seat kilometre is so much, why do you differentiate between London and Trichy? That is all I ask.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) I am going to answer the question. Give me the opportunity to answer the question.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Go ahead. You are taking my time but it does not matter.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) If it is a two-hour return flight and the capacity that you carry, maybe 50 to 60 passengers, then obviously your cost component per unit is higher.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Not 50 to 60 passengers.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Obviously your cost component per unit is higher in a flight to Trichy. But, if you take a flight bound to London, you carry at least 300 to 385 passengers in a 10-hour long flight at a stretch.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Then, how do you talk about the cost per seat kilometre?

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) That is how you have to calculate - [Interruption.] Do your homework before you come to this House without making a fool of yourself.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Your logic may have been the cause for Mihin Lanka running at a loss. - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Anyway, I am talking about my people. At least now, reconsider that your budget airline gives us a better deal when we travel to Trichy. - [Interruption.] Do not exploit us. Okay, thank you. - [Interruption.] I will speak on something more useful. - [Interruption.] Hon. Sajin de Vass Gunawardena, you continue to be a proxy Minister for others who are really Ministers. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Why do you not concentrate on the people in the estate sector?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Minister of Plantation Industries, I am grateful to you for having decided - you, as the golden shareholder - yesterday, at the meeting with the plantation companies, to release seven perches of land for housing.This was an issue the Hon. Vidura Wickramanayaka, the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara and myself took up at your Consultative Committee. You took a policy decision at the Consultative Committee to issue seven perches of land for the estate workers to build their own houses at their own cost because your Government is not building houses in the plantations.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) How do you know? You have never gone there.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I know better than you. Please sit down.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, today there is another issue. The wage increase is coming up in March. The plantation companies have already started talking about productivity of the worker and I am very glad to tell you that the former Chairman of the Planters' Association, Mr. Mahendra Amarasuriya, has given the right reply to these plantation companies who are trying to say that the worker productivity is low. He said worker productivity is low because the per hectare yield from the estates managed by the plantation companies is half of what the smallholders are getting as their yield. So, the only solution is, as you said at the Planters' Society Meeting, to give lands in the estates on an outgrow basis to the plantation workers. We hope, like you today decided, give us seven perches of land to build our own house, which was conceded by the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa also, when I spoke during the Second Reading of the Budget. He said that he would give 10 blocks of seven perches each as a challenge for our plantation workers to build their own house on the seven perches that would be given. You have today taken such a policy decision and we are grateful to you. Similarly, on this issue of creating an outgrow scheme within the plantations, I hope we will have your full support in the future.

The Hon. Radhakrishnan while speaking here mentioned about the EPF applications in Hatton. The Hon. Minister of Labour and Labour Relations is here. I took this up with the Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne, Minister of Productivity Promotion and with the Hon. Navin Dissanayake, Minister of Public Management Reforms while we were discussing the Votes of their Ministries at the Select Committee. Sir, there is an issue because the Labour Office in Hatton accepts applications for EPF claims only up to 8.30 in the morning whereas they start work at 8.30 a.m. and they can accept it till 12.30 p.m. Because they close the counters at 8.30 in the morning, workers are coming and sleeping in the Hatton Office of the Labour Department from the night itself. Some of them even come at 4 oclock in the morning. If you look into this issue and solve this, it will be a great benefit to the plantation workers in Hatton area and I am sure you would attend to it as a former trade unionist who has sympathy for workers.

Thank you very much.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I know more about plantations than you know about aviation. Please sit down. - [Interruption.] Hon. Minister thank you very much. We are grateful to you.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Can I know exactly what you are doing there? You never went to the estates. Then, how can you know about estate workers?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) At that time I was representing the Colombo District. Today, I have moved to Nuwara Eliya. I know better than you.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena)

You are in the CWC. - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes. You ask the Hon. Sivalingam whether I know about plantations or not. - [Interruption.] Please sit down because I have only 10 minutes. Please do not waste my time. The Hon. Minister of Plantation Industries - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Now, what you are saying has nothing to do with the estate workers because you are representing the people of Colombo. You are betraying your own community. - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I am not. My people know better.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) You are speaking to the community in Colombo, not there. My apologies!

hectares, which accounts for nearly 28.7 per cent of the total land area of the country. It is the other day His Excellency the President in his Budget Speech proposed that the forestry coverage of Sri Lanka should be increased to 35 per cent during the current year and I am very happy that the Hon. Minister of Environment and other connected ministries are taking steps towards successful reafforestation.

Then, Sir, increasing population pressure has created land fragmentation and farmers tend to cultivate crops by clearing surrounding natural forest areas. Forests have now become more vulnerable to depletion, in the face of an increasing demand for land for rapid development activities, in the post-conflict period. Then, there are people who clear the jungle to grow crops. This also poisons the soil. Therefore, chena cultivation is something that is not to be encouraged in this country although poor people are involved because the soil has got to be preserved. Then only they will have trees and natural environment, a healthy life in every part of the Island. Whilst the reported contribution of the firewood and forestry sector to national GDP is only 0.6 per cent, it does not capture the actual contribution of the forestry sector to Sri Lankas economy. Eco-system services provided by the forests and community level benefits of forests are some of the aspects that are not included in the statistics.

Then, Madam Presiding Member, I must also discuss about the land degradation. Land degradation denotes all natural or anthropogenic processes that diminish or impair land productivity. Natural processes include climatic changes and accelerated intensity of winds and waves. Among the anthropogenic factors, over-use of land and water, deforestation, excessive use of agro-chemicals, and careless disposal of wastes often degrade land. In Sri Lanka, man-induced land degradation is more significant than natural forces. It is manifested through high rates of soil erosion and siltation, landslides, floods, emerging problems of salinization, coastal erosion, and loss of productivity of agricultural lands.

Even in your area, Madam Presiding Member, in the Ampara District, a large acreage of forestry went under a development scheme. I think reforestation must take place in that area so that the people will have rainfall. If there is no forest, there will be less rainfall in the island. As a result, we will be unable to have agricultural pursuits in this country.

Significant land degradation began during the past 150 years, particularly after the advent of commercial plantation agriculture. In 1900, with a population of only 3.5 million, Sri Lanka had approximate forest cover of 70 per cent. See the difference! By 1953, when population reached 8.1 million, natural forest cover had diminished to approximately 44 per cent, and when population doubled by the mid-1980s, the forest was cut by nearly half, to less than 25 per cent.

COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMME FOR SOIL CONSERVATION

3 ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Will an Hon. Member propose the Hon. (Mrs.) Sriyani Wijewickrama to take the Chair?

( ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva) I propose that the Hon. (Mrs.) Sriyani Wijewickrama do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. (MRS.) SRIYANI WIJEWICKRAMA took the Chair.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Madam, before I move the Motion, I have a pleasant task to perform. That is, I see a birthday boy in the House, the Hon. Johnston Fernando. We wish him a very happy birthday and many happy returns of the day. The only thing is that you have still not cut the cake for the Parliamentarians. At least, we will come for dinner.

, I move:

Reports related to soil erosion are received daily from different parts of the Island. It is evident that this grave calamity occurs as a result of torrential rain and wanton destruction of the trees. Therefore, it is moved in this House that a comprehensive programme be initiated for soil conservation.

I would like to table* the Sinhala and Tamil versions of this Motion to be included in Hansard.

I would like to say that in Sri Lanka, soil erosion is a major problem. If there are no forests, there will not be mountains and valleys; there will not be a country. So, in order to have a country, we have to protect, safeguard and develop our forestry. The depletion of forest resources and associated losses in biodiversity have been long- discussed environmental issues in Sri Lanka. The extent of natural forests in 2010 was estimated to be 1,883,310

The key scientists and engineers comprised of A.E.K Tissa Weerasinghe and Dayananda Kariyawasam from the Forest Department, Prof. Milton Amaratunga and Prof. George Dissanayake from the University of Peradeniya, Dr. Granville Dharmawardena from the University of Colombo and Dr. Telma Gunawardhana.

The Bowood Limited is a subsidiary of the Industrial Development Board. The project was liquidated and solar dryers - saw doctoring equipment in sawing methods machinery 40 to 60 per cent - were all cannibalized and sold. Bowood possessed one million cubic feet of rubber wood with non-toxic salt and conserved approximately one million acres of forest.

Then, I also want to propose that the Ministry or the Government must seriously think of setting up a separate task force for soil erosion to review the policy and the Act. There is also the coastal erosion. Coastal erosion is the wearing away of land and the removal of beach or dune by wave action, tidal currents, wave currents or drainage. Waves generated by storms, wind or fast-moving motor craft cause coastal erosion, which may take the form of long-term losses of sediment and rocks or merely the temporary redistribution of coastal sediments. Erosion in one location may result in accretion nearby. The study of erosion and sediment redistribution is called coastal morphodynamics. It may be caused by hydraulic action, abrasion, impact and corrosion.

Last year, I attended a Conference in Nagoya, Japan. The Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa also attended another parallel conference that was held. There, they discussed about bringing in resolutions, motions and to pass them in Parliaments, so that the whole world will be able to understand the inherent danger of felling trees without any consideration of the survival of mankind and animals in this world.

. , . . . . . , , , . . He stated about the coastal erosion that is occurring and has allocated a lot of money from the Budget. The Budget Speech under the heading, Drinking Water, states, I quote:

Rs. 3,200 million has been allocated for 55 water supply projects covering all provinces, for the benefits of emerging small towns.

. . . 3 "National Green Awards" 3 . . 3 -Central Environmental Authority - . .

By that time the man/land ratio - a rough measure of natural resource availability per capita relevant to an agricultural economy - equalled one acre per person. We are basically an agricultural country and we have to preserve our land. That is our wealth, our natural wealth.

When I visited the old Parliament as a student one day, I still remember when I was in the Gallery, it was the late Hon. Robert Gunawardena, brother of the late Hon. Philip Gunawardena, regarded as the father of socialism in this country and, who, is also an uncle of our Chief Government Whip, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena and the Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena, Deputy Minister of Civil Aviation, who moved a Motion in regard to this matter.

; . , - 1952 - .

Madam Presiding Member, we acknowledge the brilliant visionary of our President in defeating the most brutal terrorist organization of the world and developing the nation after winning the war. However, there appears to be an omission on the subject of soil and water conservation which should come under the Soil Conservation Division of the Department of Agriculture. Now, it may be not operating. Forestry is required to minimize soil moving into reservoirs and rivers and to maintain groundwater during the dry period. Is it correct that the Mahailluppallama Research Farm is to be developed by the Hon. Deputy Minister of Agrarian Services and Wildlife? We would like to have an answer for that.

Then, Sir, research development and utilization was carried out by a group of brilliant Sri Lankan scientists and engineers supported by Hon. Ministers at that time like the late Hon. Philip Gunawardena, Hon. T.B. Subasinghe, Hon. Cyril Mathew along with brilliant civil servants like Neil Bandaranaike, Gaya Kumaranatunga, Akil Mohamed, Mahinda Wijenayake and H.B. Dissanayake.

It further states, I quote:

An investment of Rs. 680 million will be made in 2012 to save around 48 per cent of non revenue water in Colombo due to leakages and waste.

This is what His Excellency the President has stated on page 17 in his Speech for the Budget of 2012. That is one aspect of it.

Yesterday, it was the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena who said aloud to the whole world that, , . ; ; 3 . . . . , .
