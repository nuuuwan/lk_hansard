asked the Minister of External Affairs:

(a) Will he inform this House-

(i) the institution that handles the baggages of persons engaged in Diplomatic Missions through the Ministry of External Affairs;

(ii) whether a formal tender procedure was followed in selecting that institution;

(iii) if so, the basis on which the institution, which hitherto handled baggages was dropped and the task was entrusted to some other institution;

(iv) the difference between the payment made to the new institution for performing that task during the last year and the amount paid to the previous private institution per year?

(b) If not, why?

Ceylon Shipping Corporation Limited . , Ceylon Shipping Corporation Limited . , Ceylon Shipping Corporation Limited . . ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Hon. Deputy Speaker, a Cabinet decision had been taken to give it to the Ceylon Shipping Corporation Limited because the private sector was charging a higher amount at that time. So, this was a decision of the Cabinet to give it to a Government institution, which is the Ceylon Shipping Corporation Limited, from 2005. Therefore, we cannot identify the difference today. So, we do not call for private tenders for the same destination. ( ) (The Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam) , Ceylon Shipping Corporation Limited . , . .

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) If there are any complaints, we will certainly look into them. But, definitely we will have to ship through the Ceylon Shipping Corporation Limited and, they are giving competitive rates, according to what I understand. But, we are not in a position to get individual rates for every trip. But, certainly we will look into the grievances, if any, if brought to our notice. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , . ( ) (The Hon.

[5.52 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Madam Chairperson, I think President Mahinda Rajapaksa's regime will go down in history as an era of great revival and renaissance. It is a revival of the country after it was completely destroyed; a renaissance after the great and mega development schemes were initiated through the "Mahinda Chintana" by the President himself. It is very much evident to anybody who travels around the country.

In this whole process of development, the most striking feature is the building of roads. We have heard about the Thomas Skinner, a prominent Road Engineer, Sir Henry McCallum, a British Governor, Captain Dawson, in whose memory, a pillar has been erected at the Kadugannawa hill. They were great men. We have also heard about the road builders in Rome.

Now, Sri Lanka, in the 21st Century, has shown what road building is to the world at large. From the time of Independence or going beyond that, for centuries, there was no development in road building. Now, if you go to any part of the country, you can see the development of roads.

My Friend, the Hon. Hunais Farook spoke about Mannar, which was completely destroyed through human brutality - through the killing of human beings by the LTTE and through natural calamities. Now, there are beautiful roads being built all over there. The Southern Expressway is very much known to the whole world. Earlier it took about three to four hours to to reach Galle from Colombo. Now, we can go there within one hour and come back at the same speed.

What has happened to the Opposition, particularly to the UNPers? I ask. They say, "None is so blind as those who refuse to see". These people, not that they cannot see, they refuse to see, . In this instance, they are blind too. From morning, the speakers who spoke from the Opposition, from the UNP benches, did not discuss the Regulations under the National Thoroughfares Act. They were talking, if I may put it in Sinhala, walpal. Koheda yanne? Malle pol - Where are you going? Coconuts in my bag. That is the blindness with which they suffer.

It is no surprise, Madam Chairperson, you, coming from the woods of Ampara, dedicated to social life,

working for the toiling masses could understand what development is. Those days, we could not go from Colombo through Padiyatalawa, Maha-Oya or other places to the Eastern Province through dilapidated roads. Today, we can motor through a chain of beautifully carpetted roads covering thousands of square miles, from Mahiyanganaya to Akkaraipattu, to Kalmunai, to Pottuvil. If you go from Polonnaruwa to Welikanda and then reach Oddamavadi, you can see there a beautiful bridge built through the efforts of Mr. M.S.S. Ameer Ali, former Minister of Disaster Relief Services, with aid received from spanchy - Spain.

This is the way the Government has revived the country. This is renaissance. A new history is being born. You should be proud, Madam, that you belong to the regime of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who has ushered this revival and renaissance. You also know how your past leader, Mr. Philip Gunawardena, a great socialist leader - and a man of the soil, gave a new lease of life to the toiling masses of Ampara, Hambantota and other areas.

These are the leaders who helped build Sri Lanka together with late Hon. D.A. Rajapaksa, the father of the illustrious sons, who are in the helm of affairs in this country today, democratically elected by the people, of course.

Look at the Hon. Nirmala Kotalawala. , ? , . . ? " " .

is in Sri Lanka now and has come back after several years abroad. He exclaimed in sheer excitement: Have I come to Sri Lanka or to Heaven? That is the first impression of the new Sri Lanka of Abdul Jabbar, my classmate.

The Daily News of 8th February, 2012 states, I quote:

Communities must cooperate with President

It is a lovely piece of article penned by Atapattu Bandara of the "Daily News". In that article, Dr. Subramaniyam Swami has been quoted as follows:

Nobody can divide Sri Lanka in two and resolve the ethnic crisis. The minority communities should place their trust in President Mahinda Rajapaksa and cooperate with him in finding a solution. No other country can solve Sri Lankas internal problem

Who has said this? It was said by none other than Dr. Subramaniyam Swami, Leader of the Janatha Party" when he arrived in Sri Lanka on a private visit. He went on a pilgrimage to Kataragama on Monday and later met media personnel. ! ,

!

He has made a very important speech. He comes from Tamil Nadu, and sees the light of day, the light of the new era and the renaissance brought about. I only request you not go to the diaspora. The Hon. Sampanthan has been behind the door speaking to some people who have come here. They wanted to influence the outsiders before the Geneva Conference. But, I say, they will fail utterly, I know that. Therefore, if you want to live in this country peacefully, together with the Sinhalese and the Muslims, I call upon the Tamil leaders to cooperate with the Government as Dr. Subramaniyam Swami says. By doing this only, you can ensure a peaceful and better living for your people. I am addressing the empty benches of the TNA. They are not even here to listen.

Thank you.

In fact, we really do not need to have this Debate today. I submitted this yesterday and I do not know whether my Adjournment Motion was leaked to Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal. By 10 oclock this morning, the answer to my question was quite obvious. What I am saying, Madam Presiding Member, is that the Central Bank has finally decided to let go off the hold on the rupee. As of this afternoon, the rupee had fallen to

999 1000

2012 09

something like 115.30 or 115.40. Unfortunately, this process was delayed. Anybody who has read a book on Economics would understand that there are certain economic theories. No person can say, " I do not care about the theories". Some people say, "Harsha is a bookworm and he only talks about what is in the book". As a matter of fact, that is not the case. I know what is in the book and I also know in practice how to manage institutions and companies. I was responsible for the entire treasury of one of the large banks in the private sector when I came back after my PhD. I was the Chief Economist of a very large bank. So, I know how these things work and it is not only what is in the book. Subsequently, I founded a company and managed on my own. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) That was bankrupt. ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) He says that the bank was bankrupt but subsequently, maybe about a year after my joining, that bank won the "Best Managed Company" Award in Sri Lanka. I will tell you which bank. It was the DFCC Bank. Mr. M.R. Prelis, who was my boss, went and collected the Award for the "Best Managed Company". What I am trying to say is, people must not think that they can erase what is in the theory books. You cannot. It is not possible. You may try but you just cannot because the theory of demand and supply is the ultimate basic fundamental law in Economics. What happened was, the Government was attempting to manage the value of the currency artificially for political purposes. I will table* the Letter of Intent written to Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Managing Director of the IMF, signed by the Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning at that time and also by Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Governor of the Central Bank.

In that, they request the Board of the IMF for a Stand-By Arrangement of 400 per cent of our quota to the value of 1.6 billion of SDR. Approximately, it is US Dollars 2.6 billion. The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama knows very well that before this letter was written requesting for this amount, certain conditions had to be met.

However much we tried to explain in this House that the Government in fact increases taxes as a part of meeting these conditions, the Government denied it. But, let us be truthful. I have the document here with me. It

says, actions already taken by the Government. That is, actions taken prior to requesting the loan from the IMF.

The second point is, Amendments to the Nation Building Tax to raise the rate from 1 to 3 per cent. That was done. It is okay for political reasons but the Ministers in this House denied it. That was done because there was a problem on the fiscal side. We were running large budget deficits and the revenues were not sufficient to meet the expenditures. In the conditions that were laid upon the Government, which were agreed by the Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal, it is said, I quote:

In particular, the program -which is expected to run through 2011 - envisages (i) fiscal adjustment sufficient to reduce the central Government budget deficit to 5 per cent of GDP by 2011.

So, this was clearly one condition that the Government of Sri Lanka and the IMF agreed upon. I am not going to stand here and say that this is a bad thing. I have to be truthful. But, sustenance of a large budget deficit is going to impact upon the future generations because this has to be financed in some way. You have to borrow or print money to do this. So, you had to do it.

The second condition in that was, I quote:

" (ii) continued flexibility in the exchange rate.

That means the Government had to follow the Supply and Demand principle and let the market determine the value of our currency. What is important is, the Memorandum has what is called, a set of Quantitative Performance Criteria. Technically, it is the Net International Reserves of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. We talk about this Net International Reserves of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Mr. Cabraal and the rest of the officials, and of course, His Excellency the President and all the Ministers of the Government have been saying,Look, our external reserves have been climbing. They also say, Look, never before have we had so much reserves. True and that is because we borrowed a lot of money. If you really analyse what those reserves are, you will realize that there is a large amount of dollars that have been borrowed to build these reserves. So, when the quantitative conditions were laid down, why they said "Net International Reserves" was because the IMF was not willing to agree with the Governments request at the time to borrow these reserves and then use that amount as the amount of reserves available. "Net" meant that you could not count the borrowed amount in reserves.

Like I said in the Motion, what happened was, at the beginning of the programme, the Government was able to meet the quantitative conditions and then the IMF released tranches: on the 24th of July, 2009, 6th of November, 2009, 28th of June, 2010, 24th of September, 2010, 2nd of February, 2011 and 4th of April, 2011. That was the last time they disbursed any money. Now, the reason for that is, the Government was not able to meet the conditions that they had agreed upon. That is the fact.

* . * . * Placed in the Library.

On the 7th of September, 2011, the IMF issued a press release - Press Release No. 11/325 dated 7th September, 2011. What it states is this. I quote:

The uncertain global environment underscores the importance of continuing to build foreign exchange reserves. While headline reserves are at a comfortable level, buoyed by the Central Banks purchase of the proceeds from the recent 10-year Eurobond,

What does that mean, "purchase of a 10-year Eurobond"? Sometimes people do not understand these technicalities. A 10-year Eurobond is nothing but the billion dollar sovereign bond which we floated, which we borrowed at 6.25 per cent. So, it is a very high rate of interest. Again I quote:

nonborrowed reserves-..

They go on to explain -

that is, excluding Eurobonds, IMF disbursements, and foreign holdings of Treasuries - have steadily declined, reflecting foreign exchange sales by the Central Bank. This policy does not seem to be in line with the current fundamentals of the economy.

In responding to market pressures, the Central Bank should henceforth

This is important -

In responding to market pressures, the Central Bank should henceforth limit its intervention and allow more exchange rate flexibility.

When was this issued? This was issued on the 7th of September, 2011 - when the Budget was being designed. Obviously His Excellency the President and people working with him in preparing the Budget understood the problem. That is why, I think in November, when the Budget was presented in this House, the President devalued the currency by 3 per cent. However, when that happened, the Governor of the Central Bank said, I remember this very clearly, This is one of the devaluations. It will not happen again. How can he say like that? If it cannot happen again, that means he has to do something to ensure that it does not happen again. How do you hold the value of the currency? Let us suppose we are talking about coconuts.

35 . . ? . . 8 .

. ? . 110 . 112,113,114 . ? , . . ? . . . . ? .

So, by doing this activity what happened was, the amount of reserves we had, something like US Dollars 8 billion, finally dropped to about US Dollars 5.5 billion. That means, we sold about US Dollars 2.5 billion worth of our reserves in this exercise to defend the currency at what I call "an arbitrary level". Of course, we knew that the rupee was overvalued. Of course, it was written about. If you had looked at the Real Effective Exchange Rate, which is calculated by the economists of the Central Bank, anybody would have realized that the rupee was overvalued. If you had looked at the export growth, you would have realized that the rupee was overvalued. If you had looked at the import growth, you would have seen that the rupee was overvalued. That is why politicians, who may not necessarily understand the technicalities - and I am not expecting them to understand - always said, Things are being dumped here; Cheap imports are coming. It is not that imports are cheap. It is just that our currency was severely overvalued. Now, what has happened? We have lost all the money that was borrowed from the IMF. By that time we had borrowed roughly US Dollars 1.7 billion from the IMF. But, we sold about US Dollars 2.5 billion of our reserves. That included the money borrowed from the IMF and a part of other borrowings.

The next point is what I want you to understand because that is really what caused this crisis.

So, what happens is, when the credit growth is beyond acceptable levels, that reflects in greater import demand. You think about it. When the credit is easy, the interest rates are low and the currency is overvalued, what happens is, you create further and further import demand. This is a vicious cycle. So, you borrow at cheap rates and our consumption basket is fairly import-heavy. , . So, that is what happened. That, Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, is the problem. Sometimes, people are unable to appreciate the holistic problem. People look at the exchange rate; people look at the money markets, but you have to be able to put both together to understand the problem. That is why the day before yesterday when a person from a newspaper company called and asked me, I

said, "Very good, Mr. Cabraal has done what needs to be done. He has understood the problem. Let us wait and see". The editor of that newspaper called me in the evening when I was leaving Parliament and asked me, "Harsha, did Nivard send you a bouquet?" I said, "No, he did not send me a bouquet but I got brickbats from my boss". Then, he said, "You must remember that you are also a politician". So, I had to explain to him, "I agree I am a politician, I am an economist, but I have to be truthful and that is what I have always been doing. When something is good, I must say it is good and that is what I did".

Finally, the realization has come about the Central Bank unfortunately very late in the day that you cannot do what they attempted to do. So, now what has happened? Today, they have said, "We are removing the ban on the rupee" and they have taken out the ban and the rupee went up to 115.90 and settled at 115.30 - 115.40 levels. Also, I was wondering why is that? Will it go to 116? Will it go to 117 or 118? Where will it stop? I do not have the answer. The answer is out there in the market. All I know is that Mr. Cabraal cannot say that it will be at this point. I want to remind this House, I have said it before and I have told His Excellency the President at Consultative Committees, "Sir, you cannot do this". People sometimes laughed at me saying, "What nonsense is Harsha talking" You tell me today whether I have been talking nonsense for the last four months or not. I have told repeatedly, "this is a futile exercise, you cannot do it". Today, the people who ridiculed me would have to eat their own words. I do not want to say I said so. That is okay. This is our country and at the end of the day, our people are going to suffer. Now, what is going to happen is that the exchange rate has depreciated, interest rates have gone up and the prices of all goods and services will rise.

One last thing I would like to say, before I let my Colleague second this Motion is very important and that is, people have said that what I had said before is not true. But, the fact is that according to the conditions agreed upon - I will read you one sentence : "Specifically, the aim is to ensure that the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) break even by end-2011."

Unfortunately, the problem has even got worse than what it was before and I am telling you today, Hon. Chairperson, that within the next two weeks, the Government will have no choice, but to increase the price of fuel because otherwise you cannot control the emerging complexities if you look at the global environment. So, I do not want to take pleasure when things are sour. But, I want to tell you that next time around, please listen to us also because we make constructive criticism. If you had listened to us, - not now because now we have to say, "we have told you, Sir" - this problem would not have been this bad.

Thank you very much.

. I quote:

The economy continued to expand rapidly in 2011, with growth likely to come in around 8 percent, and inflation continued to moderate to solid mid-single digit levels. The Government budget deficit also declined further, to under 7 percent of GDP.

However, a strong rebound in domestic demand, supported, in part, by increased bank lending, resulted in a larger-than-anticipated surge in imports, causing the current account deficit to widen significantly in 2011, despite healthy growth in exports and remittances. External reserves declined markedly in the second half of 2011. The discussions focused largely on the governments strategy to address the external imbalances that emerged in the second half of 2011 and ensure that the economys recovery continued without undue disruption. There was broad agreement that a decisive policy response was needed to put the economy on a sounder macroeconomic footing, especially given the current uncertain global environment.

In this context, we are encouraged by the recent adjustments in the monetary and exchange rate policy stance, as well as the strong commitment of the government to further reduce the budget deficit to 6.2 per cent of GDP in 2012 and address the losses of key state owned enterprises.
