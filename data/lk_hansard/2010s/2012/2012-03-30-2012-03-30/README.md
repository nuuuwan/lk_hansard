() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Wait, I am coming to that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Because we are not in any comfort zone at the moment. We are in deep trouble.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) You are not in any comfort zone. Definitely you have no comfort zone, now you are on a hard rock. My dear Friend, we do not have to exchange words. I am going to give you hard facts and figures. So listen!

"Concessionary Income Tax Rates - Reduction of income tax rates on profits and income from research and development to a maximum rate of 16 per cent for a person". So that remains but we have reduced the rate. - [Interruption.]

The Hon. Leader of the Opposition raised this. So, leet me explain. Today we are discussing six Bills. Regarding the Finance Bill, there are so many things: we have simplified the charges payable on registration of vehicles; increase of luxury, semi-luxury and dual-purpose motor vehicle taxes; exemption of the application of levy on rooms of Five-Star Hotels for airline crew. So, this does not entail a total elimination of the Finance Act. We are bringing in amendments.

For certain cases like this which we explained at the Consultative Committee, we are giving that discretion under that Act. Earlier every time we had to give a concession, we had to come here and ask for a total amendment. So, let me come to this.

. tax exemptions. Value Added Tax - [ ] , . Value Added Tax , . ? "Importation of machines and equipment required for the improvement of film theatres with digital technology; machinery for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, machinery for the manufacture of biomass briquettes and palletes; manufacture of such products - greenhouses, polytunnels, and materials like that; supply of power generation machinery and equipment; importation of fabrics for the use of domestic consumption subject to an all- inclusive tax of Rs.75 at importation".

So, these are all considered decisions, where in some sectors, certainly we give tax exemptions. Of course, we give tax exemptions. Even under the BOI Act, we give

tax exemptions. - [Interruption.]. You must understand the philosophy behind this. That is in selected sectors in what are called our thrust areas. I am very sorry, we are using language like, "thrust areas", "comfort zones" and all that. I hope you will understand. So, whatever that maybe, in selected areas, we are going to give concessions. What is wrong with that? We have to compete with many other countries which are giving concessions like that.

For example, after this I am going for a discussion with the Vietnamese trade delegation. We are going to discuss what concessions we can give them and what concessions they can give us. This is a more complex world. Long years in the Opposition have dulled your minds. You are not aware of what is happening all over the world. If you can tell us that these are not important areas for such tax exemptions, then I can understand, but you have no criticisms on that.

, . , ", , " . , - Minister of External Affairs - .. . . . , .

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) It is from January. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . - - . . Your Cabinet does not act in unison. Your left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. The Hon. Wimal Weerawansa does not know what the Minister of Finance is doing. The Minister of External Affairs does not know what the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe is doing. This Finance Bill terminates the Withholding Tax on the Registration of Motor Vehicles. . But, what is more important is this: How does Part IV of the Finance Bill exempt certain enterprises from the provisions of Customs Ordinance, Exchange Control Ordinance and Import and Export (Control) Act, if such activities are carried on?

Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, the Inland Revenue Act, No. 4 of 1963, the Customs Ordinance (Chapter 235), the Exchange Control Act (Chapter 423), the Companies Ordinance (Chapter 145), the Merchant Shipping Act, No. 52 of 1971, the Finance Act, No. 65 of 1961 and the Air Navigation Act (Chapter 365) are all encompassed in Schedule B of Section 17 of Greater Colombo Economic Commission Law, No. 4 of 1978.

. , . .. BOI .

, .. . . , . ? , BOI - [Interruption.] I am trying to come to that point. Exemptions that you are going to grant are being taken from one Ministry and put on to the other Ministry. The Ministry of Economic Development has the powers. I am just going to read out what the Minister has said about the BOI incentives: "Significantly, when you sign an agreement with the BOI, the specific incentives granted to an eligible company may include tax holidays or preferential tax rates, exemption from customs duty and foreign exchange controls". What you are trying to do is to arrogate powers from the Ministry of Economic Development and bring that under the powers and the controls of the Finance Ministry. There is no necessity of doing so

1653 1654

[ ]

2012 30

unless you want to redefine the actual running of the Ministry of Economic Development. So, that is what we are questioning at this particular moment.

Then, you go even further. You specify it under the Section 17 of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission Law. Tell me what you are going to give them more than what they have at the moment. The only perfidious act that seems to be taking place is taking it away from the Ministry of Economic Development. Is that the purpose of amending this particular Bill? Why is there a sense of urgency? It already exists in the line ministry which controls and markets. Now, what you are trying to do is, to make the BOI which is under the Ministry of Economic Development subservient to the Ministry of Finance in order to get the approval. Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, imagine you are the relevant Minister. You have to go to the Finance Ministry to get approval for something under your own ministry. This is why it goes even further. You can amend certain things completely but complete eradication of those basically leads to a lot of problems. Where is this country heading to?

Look at what that they are going to give. This leads to complete exemption of taxes like port levies, customs duties, free port and everything. Now, they are going to bestow this right on the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and the Finance Ministry.

Six or seven months ago, there was a statement uttered that a nudist colony was going to be formed in Kalutara. Nobody objected to that; nobody rejected the claim that we made in Parliament. Now, imagine if the Sri Lanka Ports Authority says, "Okay, you can have a nudist colony in Waskaduwa, Kalutara, a gambling den and a casino", on the same basis, there would be prostitution also. Who is going to correct this type of things?

Then, the next issue is with the arms and ammunitions trade. Under entrepot trade, there are five trades which have been prohibited. One is arms and ammunitions trading; one is narcotics trading.

Now, I have asked a specific question. Please tell us what is this blind carte blanche exemptions that you are giving? Has it been arrogated from the Ministry of Economic Development and taken on by the Ministry of Finance and Planning, and where does this trickle down? Is it for a nudist colony? Is it for money laundering?

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) To whom have carte blanche exceptions been given?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is what we are asking.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) There is nothing specific.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, there is nothing specific. You are giving the exemptions to a particular person, the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority -

1657 1658

2012 30

( (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Who can grant that? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) He can grant it. If it comes under the SEMA, which I think - ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) There is no particular - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is right. Now, I must say that I salute the SEMA Bill. We might have differences but certainly that has specific advantages that can go after blue-chip companies, flag-chip companies et cetera to make a comfort zone like the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama said; all those are good. This also should have been in the same way. You can time-target or you can bring in more stringent laws to the existing laws. Today, you are basically trying to give the Sri Lanka Customs a regulation which is under the BOI. For 30 years, you ran the BOI because you need it; Sri Lanka is not the only girl on the beach.

There are many countries that welcome investment. Remember, Myanmar is the greatest threat that we have now because it is an ASEAN country; it is within ASEAN. It is not like Sri Lanka, which one of our former Presidents tried to bring Sri Lanka into ASEAN when we are not located in that area. But here, Myanmar is there. They will be a direct threat to us. So, we have got to ensure that we relocate, reposition ourselves to compete and take on Myanmar. Now, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama was happy to go and see the Minister of Trade of Vietnam rather than listen to the Opposition today, giving constructive criticism like what you are doing and be able to contribute to the well-being of the Debate that is on today. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) All that will be conveyed. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) All that will be conveyed but nothing will be done because you have a such a bad brief. How can we defend this? All what we should do is to ensure that we also contribute constructively.Our key speakers today are the Hon. Kabir Hashim, the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, and the Hon.

John Amaratunga. We all came here today though we have many other things to do because we want to show how important the finance of this country is.

Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, tell us - [Interruption.] I have given seven points on the same score. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Are they on the carte blanche? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, on the carte blanche. As I told you, you are basically giving the right to a person like the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. So, this specific one also should be laid down in a thing like SEMA, as a specific Act. Then, you can say Yes, pick on this one. We have a fantastic company there. Now, we do not fault Shangri-La for coming; we salute them for coming. But, what we say is that the way it was done, is wrong. Why should they be exempted from 11 billion when the innocent people are paying for bread, kerosene oil and even a box of matches that went up by Rs. 5? That is why we fought. Remember, we are not an Opposition that opposes everything. We are the ones who help the Government most. It is easy to say what you are saying. Ensure that you implement the recommendations of the LLRC. These are your Government's proposals. These are not Americas proposals. So, on that score, you are bringing Bills into Parliament which are surfeit - some areas are arrogating powers to another Ministry. This is what is redundant; this is what is superfluous; this is what is unwanted; this is waste of time because you do not know what you are basically trying to achieve.

Now, you are talking of a US Dollar one billion trade deficit. Now, let me also touch on the subject of BOI. One of the main things is, I must say, the Minister has appointed a good Chairman who is looking after the work. He is a very competent person even though he is a bureaucrat. In that section, there are four people. They are good people but they do not have powers to market. Former people like Mr. A.M.C. Kulasekara, Mr. Tuli Cooray, had the knowledge to convince and get a foreigner come in to the country and invest. That is not there anymore. Today your junior officers are being sent overseas. How can they go on roadshows and do these type of things? Then on the one side, you basically try to lure foreign investment and on other, your Government basically did not allow the Foreign Minister of Sweden to come. They closed down the Embassy. Then, you basically fought the European Union and lost the Labour GSP. You did not allow the Canadian Opposition Leader to come. But, you had a team that came here; look at the impact that they have created on the country.

What they said was that there is no law and order in this country. They basically said that internationally, you are not obliged to follow certain things. But, they faulted you all for not doing basic things that are in the Constitution. This was stated by the three Canadian MPs who came to the country recently. Likewise, you basically told an untruth to India. The External Affairs Minister of India, S.M. Krishna says that you all said "Thirteen Plus". You had to waste 20 minutes in Geneva answering his call and ensuring that you put the record straight as to what he discussed with the President, on which you were stony silent when he was here. You basically had to go to Geneva to answer what was there, and because of that, India today has turned against us - not as I guess - certainly they will be there with us. Unfortunately, you all marketed yourself very poorly in Geneva. The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe goes and tells one thing, "Yes we are going to implement LLRC". But, you are basically telling the rest of the world, "No, we are not bound by that" and today the answers are there. Unfortunately, this may be out of context, but you are pushing foreign investments away from this country. That is why you told us to come today - which is not a Parliament day - to ensure that we support and give our constructive criticism to you all in order to ensure that these Bills are passed. When you are doing that, the very foreign investors who are coming to this country are not going to come here just for the sake of coming to Sri Lanka. They are coming to make money; they are coming to see whether there is an environment conducive to them; they are trying to see whether there are laws that are coherent, consistent and implemented to the letter. You do not have law and order that existed earlier because the Seventeenth Amendment has been taken off. These are matters that were discussed in Geneva. So, you are wasting time bringing in legislation -

Deputy Chairman of Committees, from morning I have been listening to all the speeches made by the Hon. Members about political parties, personalities, the Geneva Resolution, the LLRC Report but nothing was said about the Bills, which are before the House today.

1727 1728

With regard to the Geneva Resolution, I think the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, Minister of External Affairs was asked to go to the United States of America and meet Bill Clinton about three months before this Resolution was passed. But, he did not go. He wanted three months to implement it. Now, India has come to our rescue and because of India's help, we have been given one year to implement the recommendations.

World's elder statesmen, along with Nelson Mandela, have urged the Government to implement that Resolution. Otherwise, they say, we will have to face a strict resolution than this. So, we are responsible for the Resolution that was passed in Geneva. But, in some way it has helped this Government to overcome some difficulties they face due to the rise in the cost of living.

What is the LLRC Report? The LLRC was appointed by this Government. They have issued interim directives and then a final advice. In Geneva, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe told the Commission that they will implement the LLRC Report. But, in Sri Lanka I hear a Senior Minister saying, We cannot implement the entire LLRC Report. They have gone beyond their powers. Is this the way to look at it? Who are they? We have not appointed them. It is the Government that appointed them. What is that Resolution? The Resolution wants you to implement the recommendations of the LLRC, which was appointed by you. If we do not implement it, you may have to face a more strict resolution at the next session.

Now, I come to Clause 5 (3) (c) of the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill. It states in page 17, I quote:

(xxxv) any goods, (other than motor vehicles and goods for personal use) required for the purpose of provision of services being international transportation which is consigned to Sri Lankan Air Lines Limited, Mihin Lanka (Pvt) Ltd.

or Air Lanka Catering Services Ltd.; I am totally opposed to this and I want this to be deleted. I do not know why the Government wants to help these two institutions; they are two white elephants. I think Mihin Lanka (Pvt.) Limited fell into economic difficulties and the Treasury had to bail them out. Why did the Treasury bail them out? If they were unable to maintain themselves, they could have got a loan from a bank, not from the Government. Mihin Air had been paid billions and billions of rupees to cover their losses. Who paid it? Our people had to pay. I am opposed to this and I do not want any kind of exemption given to SriLankan AirLines Limited, Mihin Lanka (Pvt.) Limited and Air Lanka Catering Services Limited. If the SriLankan Airlines is unable to manage their affairs economically and efficiently, let them wind up or let them get a loan from a bank and manage it; not from Dr. P.B. Jayasundera, Secretary to the Treasury.

Regarding the cost of living, my Friend, the Hon. Bandula Gunawardane has said, according to newspapers, that a sum of Rs. 7,500 is sufficient for a month for a family. I do not know where he is living; whether in this world or in some other world. A bundle of keerai is Rs. 50. So, how can people exist in this country? I am a diabetic patient. I buy a medicine named "NovoMix(r)30" and I have to pay Rs. 1,300 for one pack, which is sufficient only for two days. It was Rs. 1,000 earlier but recently what has happened is, the prices of medicines have also gone up. Who is suffering? The poor people are suffering. How can they live? The real problem we are facing is the cost of living and we are facing an economic crisis. Do not forget that. In time to come, you cannot even get loans because we are getting loans to pay the loans.

Some Ministers were speaking about the development in Jaffna. I go to Jaffna every month. I spend about 10 days going all over. But, there is no development work taking place there. What is being done is, they are putting up some roads. Who are the labourers? They are the Chinese and the people from the South. I ask this Government and the Hon. Minister of Economic Development whether they have spent any money in development work, which may generate employment for the people in Jaffna.

There are several graduates who are unemployed. There was a newspaper advertisement saying, "Please join the SLFP by paying Rs. 250, if you want employment." Is the Government giving appointments only to the SLFP graduates?

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Member, that is totally false. Anyone can join the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and become a member. It costs you only Rs. 10 and nothing else. Please do not misrepresent facts in the House. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) I am sorry. This is what has happened in Jaffna. Your SLFP man has said that.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Where?

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) In Jaffna.

1729 1730

[ . . ]

2012 30

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Do not mislead the House.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) It appeared in newspapers. They want these people to join the SLFP if they want any jobs. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) More and more people in Jaffna join the SLFP. - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) No, - [Interruption.] Be generous as far as we are concerned. - [Interruption.] We are not asking for the moon. We are only asking - ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) The Geneva issue has polarized your community further and thousands of people will join the SLFP. You will see that very soon. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) We are not - [Interruption.] We are not preventing anybody from joining the SLFP. I know that this Government is trying to bring down the strength of the TNA by doing several acts. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) The Government is not trying to do that. You are doing that by yourself. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) No, no. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) The TNA is polarized today and by that you have marginalized and alienated yourself from your own Tamil community. That is a fact that has to be realized. What you are saying is controversial.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) I am saying this from what I hear and what I come to know from Jaffna when I go there every month. -[Interruption.] Yes, do not worry about us. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) We are not worried about the TNA but we are worried about the large community that is living in Jaffna. -[Interruption.] You are trying to segregate the Tamil community. That is what we are worried about. That is our primary responsibility being in the Government. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) [Interruption.] Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, we were prepared to continue with the talks. Who stopped it? ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) We invited you. You can still continue talks with us. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Who stopped it? We are still prepared to negotiate with the Government. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Member, there is a Parliamentary Select Committee - . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) No, but what you must do - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) You are undermining Parliament. - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) No. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Why do you not come to the Parliamentary Select Committee and join the process? Why are you making a time-bound proposal? What is there to be afraid of?

1731 1732

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) When the Government - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) There is a point of Order being raised.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, you must allow the Hon. Vinayagamoorthy to speak. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, do not disturb him.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, we are having a nice and friendly exchange of ideas.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Vinayagamoorthy, you continue with your speech.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Sir, I want to tell the Hon. Member that we are still prepared to have negotiations with the Government to solve our problem. ( ) (The Hon. Vasantha Senanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! A point of Order is being raised. Hon. Member, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Vasantha Senanayake) Hon. Member, you made a statement and most of the hard facts that you spoke of were matters you had heard of. So, are they merely hearsay or are they factual? - [Interruption.] . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) They are factual.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Vinayagamoorthy, you carry on with your speech.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Sir, all what I want to say is, for God's sake, do not squander our money, the public money, by bailing out Mihin Air and the SriLankan Airlines. SriLankan Airlines was bailed out. It was running at a loss and the Treasury had to give the money. Why does the Treasury give the money to SriLankan Airlines or Mihin Air? If they are unable to manage their own affairs - ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Member, you must first understand as to what the aviation industry is. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) I do not want any disturbance to be made. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) This is not disturbance. I am only pointing out the facts. What you are telling is totally irrelevant. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) You can answer at the time you speak. - [Interruption.] ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, you carry on with your speech.

1733 1734

2012 30

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) So, what I am saying is, not only is the Government squandering money on SriLankan Airlines and Mihin Air, but it is also spending people's money unnecessarily on functions held in every village and everywhere. What happened in Anuradhapura? What is the amount of money you spent there and what did you achieve there? As far as we are concerned, we are still prepared for a negotiated settlement with the Government.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) So, why do you not come without wasting time?

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) You are not coming; you have suspended talks with us. We are prepared to come even now. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) No. You give us the names of your representatives now. Then, we can have it tomorrow.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) I am sorry.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) I know that you are sorry. We can understand your "sorry". Anyway, the solution is in your hands. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) What I want to tell you is this: when the Government is faced with a problem, what does the Government normally do? They appoint a commission and shelve the issue. That is what has happened now. You are not prepared to implement the recommendations of the LLRC Report. Why is that? ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon. Member, there is a Parliamentary Select Committee.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) . . rose.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Yes, Hon. Azwer.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You tell us whether you are prepared to come and participate in the Parliamentary Select Committee. Tell us the point of view of the TNA? Tell us and tell the world, Yes or No. . ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) We are not prepared to do that now but we are prepared to have talks with the Government. India and the United States of America have told the Government to speak to the TNA and come to a settlement. Thank you very much.

( ) (The Presiding Member) . , .

( ) (The Hon. Vasantha Senanayake) Mr. Presiding Member, it gives me great pleasure to speak a few words on the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Palitha Range Bandara with regard to the system of alternative medicine. When speaking about alternative medicine, it is a known fact that prior to western medicines being accepted in countries like ours as the established code of medicine with stringent practices, with boards, certifications and so on, there were indigenous systems of medicine that existed not only in Sri Lanka but also in India. In Africa, they had their witch doctors and their own systems of medicine, which was also documented as having the effect of curing patients, illnesses and sicknesses. The American Indians had a system of medicine unique to them, which again contributed to curing the diseases. The Chinese today have acupuncture, acupressure and other systems of medicine, all alternative to the standard western practices. We are not going to compare and I think we should not compare one system with the other. But, if the desired effect, that is, the cure for the disease or the remedy for the disease is effected, then that is what we need to achieve.

Let us take the case of Dr. Eliyantha White whom I have known since childhood. I have not consulted him in a medical capacity, but I have seen him being able to cure people, whom I have known, suffering from ailments all their lives, maybe within a week. This is truly remarkable.

Sir, if you take cures from a religious perspective, we are not so afraid to accept them. For instance, some Buddhists will tell you that a dying patient or his relative was taken near a Bodhi Tree, a Bodhi Pooja was performed, he was given holy water or something to that effect or Pirith Pan as we call it in Sinhala and he was cured miraculously. You wilNow, t hear Catholics say that water from Lourdes was given to a dying patient and the dying patient immediately opened his eyes and recovered. That really depends on the faith of the person. That is called "faith healing". In these evangelical churches also, you can see a lot of faith healings. Sometimes, there are groups of patients who are brought and healed together by a certain preacher. When that is done, that is categorized by the believers as the work of the God or the work of the Divine. It is believed by

others, perhaps as a hypnotic suggestion or a conditioning of the mind but some people altogether rubbish it by saying, this is nonsense. Nevertheless, the desired effect is reached. That is, a person in a wheelchair started walking or something to that effect.

Now, we are aware that Dr. White has cured many distinguished people in this country. I will not elaborate the list. I think the Hon. Palitha Range Bandara gave us a comprehensive list of some of the people whom Dr. White has treated successfully and also distinguished people coming from other countries also. So, if the desired effect is reached, we have to come to the conclusion that alternative medicine and medicine from the natural confines or the confines of science, as we understand it, may not necessarily mean that the system itself is untrue. For instance, there are so many things we cannot prove in Science. Even the nefarious Rasputin was able to cure the son of the Czar of Russia from Leukaemia although western medicine had no cure for him. People like Uri Geller were able to bend metal with the projection of their minds. These parameters may not be known to Science. But, if it works and the result is seen, we cannot say that it is a farce or failure.

Therefore, Mr. Presiding Member, what I propose to say is that whilst we should recognize alternative medicine, we should also have some criteria for recognizing practitioners of alternative medicine. Dr. White has a proven track record; not everyone who goes under that label of being able to cure people of ailments has a good track record.

I think we have to be careful in admitting all those that go under the label of "alternative medicine" and about healers. We have to recognize the genuine cases and give them legitimacy.

I thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for the time allotted to me and I thank the Hon. Member of the Opposition for bringing such a valuable Adjournment Motion.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Then, the Hon. Alhaj A. H. M. Azwer. You have four minutes.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, it is very rarely that we witness an Adjournment Motion acceptable to all Members of both sides of the House. This is one such rare moment - a Motion moved by the Hon. Palitha Range Bandara.

Sir, if the "Wonder Boy of India" or the "Little Master" has scored a century of centuries, that maybe because of the healing science that Dr. Eliyantha White practised on him. Dr. Eliyantha White might have been very much responsible for that because today, Sachin Tendulkar is one of the persons who has earned the goodwill and appreciation of not only the cricket lovers in India, but of people in all countries. Likewise, Dr. Eliyantha White, no doubt, has done his work very well by curing so many people.

Sir, apart from that science of medicine Dr. Eliyantha White practises, there are also, as the Hon. Palitha Range Bandara said, alternative systems of treatment. One is,

1807 1808

acupuncture treatment, which was practised very well by Dr. Jayasuriya at the Colombo South General Hospital. Dr. M.A. Latiff, you know, Sir, was the President of Homeopathic Medical Association of Sri Lanka and he wanted it to be practised by as many people as possible because even Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth takes homeopathy medicine.

Then, there is also Ayurveda and Unani medicines. The Government must pay attention to those two sciences of medicine. I think Unani medicine must receive more attention. The Hon. Deputy Minister of Health is here and I bring it to his notice. Sir, there were Motions moved in this House by great men like Sir Razik Fareed and Mr. M.E.H. Mohamed Ali of Muttur urging the governments to develop Unani medicine. I myself also moved a similar Motion earlier. The attention paid to Unani treatment is not enough. There are a lot of Unani students passing out. Once upon a time, I remember, we opened Unani Centres in Muslim villages like Pangaragammana in the remote Mahiyangana Electorate. I think more people are practising Unani medicine and therefore, you must pay more attention to that faculty.

Sir, medicine is a sacred thing in Islam. The first-known medical personality was Avicenna. Avicennas mode of medicine is followed by even the western and eastern physicians. Even today, if you go to western medicine hospitals here, you will find Avicennas photograph hung on the walls there. Even major operations were done in ancient days without the modern techniques that we follow today.

One of the persons who adorned this House as Speaker, Deshamanya Alhaj Bakeer Markar, came from a Hakeem family. "Hakeem" means a doctor in Arabic. When they were practising this medicine in Arab Road in Beruwela, Princes and Princesses came by boat from the Maldives to take medicine. This medicinal method was so well developed that the whole of Asia knew it well. It was only the other day - I must express my condolences in this House - that the Hon. Alhaj Bakeer Markars sister, Mrs. Durrathul Yatheema Maimoona Mohamed, who practised medicine, passed away at the "Hakeem Villa". She was the aunt of the Hon. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar as well. A large number of people from all over the country visited the funeral house to pay their respects at Maradana, Beruwela.

All in all, the Sinhala medicine is practised in the villages without possessing, as some Member mentioned, any form of certificates.

" " . ; . " " . .

Then, Sir, during my small days, my mother used to take me to an ayurvedic doctor or . , , , , , , , , , - . . . . , .

There is also, as some Member mentioned, Pentecostal medicinal system. The Pentecostal medicinal system is curing diseases by giving water to drink. That is also a type of medicine.

Sir, the last thing I want to say is that Dr. Eliyantha White has cured so many Members in this House and also great cricketers. But, I am sorry to say that even though I referred Ms. Ranjani Jayamanne, Editor of Hansard, - who was complaining of a hip ailment - to him, he has not been able to give an appointment even to me for the last six months and she has not got an appointment yet. I hope, in the spirit of goodwill and in keeping with the spirit of medicine, Dr. Eliyantha White will attend to Ms. Ranjani Jayamanne also.

I thank you, Sir. ( ) (The Hon. Dilip Wedaarachchi) , . - - . . .
