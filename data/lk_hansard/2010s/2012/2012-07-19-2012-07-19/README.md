( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I rise to a point of Order?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) I find that this House has not got a proper Order Paper because that contains the proceedings for the day. The Order Paper is printed by the Government Press. This is not an incorporated institute. Therefore, the powers of the Government Press lie with the Government Printer. I would read both the Establishments Code and the Constitution, which make provisions for appointment of heads of departments together. According to them, the head of department is a person who can exercise power. In the absence of the head of department, one of the deputies - there are two Additional Government Printers and three Deputy Government Printers - has to be appointed as the acting Government Printer to exercise the power. But, at the moment there is no acting person. So, just by saying the Government Press will not do - ? ( ) ... . , . . . ; . . . . , . There is no an acting person. You have not got any of these persons appointed. So, I am bringing all this to the notice of the House and I am asking the Minister concerned to get someone appointed in the course of next week or so as the Head of the Department and not to have the Additional Secretary as the whole election process comes in. There are two Additional Government Printers and three Deputy Government Printers. Get one of them appointed; then everything is legal. Otherwise, we are going to have problems with regard to the election process, judiciary and also in this House.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Thank you very much. I will look into that matter.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Azwer, what is the point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I want to raise two important matters. The first is, the threat to the sheer existence of Parliament. Sir, that is a threat to set this House aflame, inciting people to come and take over this. I think the Chief Opposition Whip was good enough to say something regarding that. But, I go a little further and say that action must be taken against the Hon. Member who issued the threat to demolish this House, which is a threat to democracy also. - [Interruption.] Sir, a motion must be moved; I think he must be removed. Then, the second matter is - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! Hon. Member, your point is taken. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M.

, [111C.] (1) .

Every judge, presiding officer, public officer or other person entrusted by law with judicial powers or functions or with functions under this Chapter or with similar functions under any law enacted by Parliament shall exercise and perform such powers and functions without being subject to any direction or other interference proceeding from any other person except a superior court, tribunal, institution or other person entitled under law to direct or supervise such judge, presiding officer,..

Then, Article [111C.] (2) of the Constitution states, I quote:

Every person who, without legal authority, interferes or attempts to interfere with the exercise or performance of the judicial powers or functions of any judge, presiding officer, public officer or such other person as is referred to in paragraph (1) of this Article, shall be guilty of an offence punishable by the High Court on conviction after trial without a jury with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to a period of one year or with fine

381 382

That is, with a fine not less than Rs. 100,000.

There are two groups who should be found fault with this and brought before court. One is, this particular Minister who has tried to interfere with the Judiciary and the others are those who have gone, on the instigation of the Minister, to the court house, intimidated the Magistrate by trying to pelt stones, threatening to set fire to the courthouse, damaging the building and injuring police officers. They should be taken to task. It is a very serious act of violation of the independence of the Judiciary; it is a violation of the Constitution. It is very clear. I do not know what action the Government proposes to take. A Minister cannot go round like this intimidating the judges. Is this the independence of the Judiciary that the Constitution is going to safeguard?
