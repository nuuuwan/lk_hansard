The Bank of England is a reserve like the Central Bank. That has no commercial activities in the process. But, any area where the government is going into commercial ventures, any area where Government funds are going in, they have a completely independent authority. Now, even the BBC does not give special coverage to the Government or the Prime Minister, David Cameron, like the Rupavahini and ITN does. They attack the Government more than anybody else; like when we were in Government, the ITN and the Rupavahini attacked the UNP Government more than the Opposition. That is the irony of it.

See what is happening in the United States of America or in Singapore. Singapore is a classical example. See

555 556

how financial discipline is instilled into the system and how profitable those entities are because in every aspect, they are commercial in nature. From the time you take a loan, from the time you pay a loan, from the time you declare dividends, all have a sense of commercial viability and forwardness in that. So, all I have got is, re-emphasize the fact that there is a necessity today to bring in such laws in order to ensure that the public is made aware of what is going on. So, I call upon the Government not to look at it from the point of view that it has been brought from an Opposition Member, but to consider that it has been brought for the good of the entire economy of the country.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, please wind up, now. The Hon.(Dr.) Harsha De Silva also has to speak.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, Sir. I will give him time. Out of the 25 minutes given to us, I have been given 15 minutes and I will give the Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, the other 10 minutes. So, all I ask is to ensure that we implement this.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Your 15 minutes' time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Okay, Sir. So, please ensure that there is support for this particular Motion across the House because then we can ensure that bad debts are reduced and politicization of loans is eradicated and brought under controllable limits.

A particular broker tells the NSB: "You know the market price is only Rs. 30. Why do you not buy a share for Rs. 50?" So, why does the NSB want to pay Rs. 50 for a share which is valued at Rs. 30? Why? Think about it. Now, remove yourself from that position and consider the broker who is making this invitation to purchase. The broker is a Shareholder Director of The Finance Company. In his position as a Shareholder Director, he has information that others do not have. As a matter of fact, only yesterday, The Finance Company issued a statement to say that they collected a billion rupees in deposits in the last month or something like that. That information was not available. Therefore, there is strong suspicion, since the person who brokered this deal was a Shareholder Director of The Finance Company, that he had information which the public did not have. Therefore, I believe that there is a clear case of insider dealing here. That is what the Government should vehemently investigate into, and bring the culprits to book.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I seek your indulgence to move initially an amendment to this Motion that has been presented before Parliament today by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. The Motion states:

2012 11

That this Parliament resolves that legal provisions be introduced in Parliament to publish names of defaulters who have borrowed over Rs. 100 million from State Banks".

To that I would like to move the following amendment :-

"...and also initiate immediately an investigation of banking US Dollars 3,000 in violation of Sri Lankas Exchange Control Regulations.

Sir, this Motion speaks of so many matters.

I would like to bring to the notice of the House Part VIII of the Monetary Law, which states, I quote: PART VIII - RESTRICTIONS RELATING TO CENTRAL BANK OFFICERS AND SERVANTS *45. (1) Except in the performance of his duties under this Act, every officer or servant of the Central Bank shall preserve and aid in preserving secrecy with regard to all matters relating to the affairs of any banking institution, or of any client of any such institution, that may come to his knowledge in the performance of his duties; and any such officer or servant who communicates any such matter to any person other than the Monetary Board or an officer of the Central Bank authorized in that behalf by the Governor, or suffers or permits any unauthorized person to have access to any books, papers, or other records relating to any banking institution, shall be guilty of an offence.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) All right. Hon. Deputy Speaker, may I - [Interruption.] If the Opposition wants - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, you carry on with your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. I am the one who moved the Motion. I would like to have a clarification. Only 45 minutes - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not a point of Order. We can sort it out later. Hon. Minister, you carry on with your speech.-[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, it was agreed at the Party Leaders Meeting to have the Debate only for 45 minutes.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) So, the Hon. Minister can take the balance 20 minutes to speak. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Sir, if the Mover of the Motion wants a substantive answer from the Government - I am the Minister who has been entrusted with the task of giving the Governments point of view on this Motion - and if I am not allowed to say what I have to say, I mean, he is - [Interruption.] We will take up this issue later at the Party Leaders Meeting, but let me have my time to reply.- [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake has brought up this Motion - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I would like to know whether I have a right to respond to the Motion that he -[Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You have taken three minutes in excess in addition to the 25 minutes allotted to you. Anyway, let the Hon. Minister answer and we will give you two or three minutes to speak.- [Interruption.] You carry on with your speech, Hon. Minister. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Thank you. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) How many minutes have been allotted to the Minister?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) He is entitled for 10 minutes, but we will give him about six minutes.- [Interruption.] He will be given only six minutes, not 10 minutes.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Let me very quickly lay down the position. Sir, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake brought up this Motion with a motive to perhaps bring in certain issues that are totally out of the context of the Motion itself. But, let me first outline the position. - [Interruption.] There are certain time-honoured principles that have been followed in the relationship between bank and customer and its confidentiality. Even for criminal investigation the bank is not expected to disclose any details of transactions. That, all of us know. Particularly the United National Party which follows a heavily capitalist system should have known that this has been a time-honoured practice in the culture of banks.

Disclosing of details of transactions between the customer and bank is governed by Section 90A-C of the Evidence Ordinance. All of us know that. In certain instances, banks can even refuse to comply with a court order for good reasons that they will adduce. Only exceptions are in respect of money laundering and financing of terrorism. Even in this instance, the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank can ask for details for investigation purposes.

Sir, in fact both statute law and judicial decisions that have been laid down by both jurisdictions abroad as well as here have laid down fetters on Parliament, going on a frolic of its own to enact this kind of legislation that the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake wants us to do.

Therefore, we say that this kind of Motion cannot be entertained for the reasons that I will now lay down. Let me quickly take you through some of the legislative provisions as well as the judicial decisions to demonstrate to you as to why the Hon. Karunanayakes Motion cannot be considered by a responsible Government.

First of all, this Motion impinges on the existing secrecy laws of the country pertaining to banking transactions. We enacted a salutary secrecy provision, namely Section 77 of the Banking Act, in 1988. That was by a previous United National Party administration. Long before we enacted this provision in 1988 in the Banking Act, in an English case called Tournier versus National Provincial and Union Bank of England in 1924, the Court of Appeal of England laid down embargoes on lending institutions to reveal customer-related information. These embargoes were taken note of by national legislatures in various parts of the world and that is how we enacted Section 77 of the Banking Act in 1988. In 2005, we amended Section 77 by Amendment Act, No. 2 of 2005. This is the current law on the sacred duty that every lending institution owes to their customers not to reveal information to public domain. But, there are exceptions to this duty. In other words, a lending institution can give out or reveal information only in some exceptional situations and these exceptional situations are narrowly circumscribed. I will come to those circumstances.

Sir, one of the predecessors in your office, the Hon. Gamini Fonseka, once took one of the newspapers to court for defamation. When we deal with defaulters, we also stray into areas of defamation. In fact, a number of defaulters have sought millions of money as damages against banks because there had been leakages of their defaults into public domain. You will recall, a former Deputy Speaker, the Hon. Gamini Fonseka, took a particular newspaper to court for disclosing his defaults on a loan and he obtained huge damages from the District Court of Colombo. Therefore, we should be circumspect in venturing into areas that would impinge on rights of defaulters such as their reputation. As I said before, we have on our Statue Book a legislation called the Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka, which was passed in 1990 and has been since amended twice: once in the year 1990 and later, in the year 2008. This is the law that deals with defaulters to some extent. Even under this legislation, the right to obtain information about defaulters is severely limited. In fact, a defaulting customer took the Credit Information Bureau to court somewhere in 2003, and the Supreme Court of the country in a case called Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka vursus Jafferjee Brothers further limited and delineated the powers of the Credit Information Bureau.

Fetters have been imposed on an unlimited foray into information pertaining to defaulting customers.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, you have one minute left. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Okay, Sir.

Therefore, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, two Acts that compel disclosure because they are subsequent to our international commitments, have permitted certain limited sanction to reveal customer information for the purposes of investigation into money laundering and financing of terrorism. These are consequent to conventions that we have entered into and ratified internationally.

Sir, since my time is limited and as there have been issues raised regarding the National Savings Bank matter, I need to table* a statement by the Board of Directors of the NSB as part of my speech. Thank you.

: : Statement tabled:

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, thank you very much. You are sharp on time. Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, I will give you three minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, please give me five minutes. Otherwise, I cannot conclude my speech.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You have already taken three minutes in excess.

[3.25 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I thank the Hon. DEW Gunasekara for contributing positively to a Motion which came up from the Opposition and I call upon the Hon. Azwer, if he has a spine, to tell the same thing he said in Parliament outside. I will reply to everything he mentioned. - [Interruption.] I am sure he has only a mouth and not a spine. - [Interruption.] So, I do not want to waste time on him. I will spend the rest of my time on the Minister of Justice. - [Interruption.] How could you expect justice from a Minister of Justice who contested from the UNP and crossed over to the Government? Could you expect justice from that Minister of Justice? He is asking about the moral right to bring in such a Motion. All I call upon you, as the Government and the Minister of Justice, to do is to publish the names of defaulters who have obtained loans amounting to Rs. 100 million and above from State Banks, not from private banks and defaulted after one year. People like you, who basically contest from one side and go to the other and think that that is a moral right, do not think it is right to do so. We do not need to waste time on such matters. It is the same Central Banker, whose actions with regard to Gold Quest is questionable, who is taking money from the EPF and the ETF. Then, we are asking about the Mihin Air which took Rs. 10,000 million from the banks. And, money is owed to the Lankaputhra Development Bank. We want such crooks brought into book. We are asking about the SriLankan Airlines which loses Rs. 19,000 million a year.

ESTABLISHMENT OF INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS AND ENACTING LAWS ENSURING FREEDOM OF INFORMATION

[3.29 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I move,

573 574

2012 11

"That the Presidential Commission on Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation (LLRC), in its final report, has pointed out the requirement of Independent Commissions. Further, since it has been recommended that necessary rules and regulations must be formulated for the freedom of information and that investigations must be initiated on serious violations of international laws and human rights, it has been revealed that the Government is going to hold elections in future, according to newspaper reports. The Elections held without appointing the Independent Commissions and without ensuring media freedom will not be recognized and also the investigations conducted on violations of international laws and violations of human rights will not be recognized. Therefore, this Parliament moves that the recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) to the effect that laws required for immediate establishment of Independent Commissions and the laws required for the freedom of information should be formulated and that the requirement of Independent Commissions and the requirement of freedom of information should be incorporated into the Action Plan being prepared by the Government.

I will read the Motion in Sinhala also.

" , .

, , , " " ."

Mr. Deputy Speaker, when the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe addressed the Human Rights Council on the 21st of June 2006, this is what he said, I quote: Due to the present stalemate we are experiencing with regard to the appointment of the Constitutional Council, I wish to inform that President Mahinda Rajapaka has decided to recommend to Parliament the appointment of a multi-party Parliamentary Select Committee with a view to resolving the procedural shortcomings and further strengthening of the democratic governance objectives of the 17th Amendment to the Constitution under which the Constitutional Council was set up. We view this exercise as a further confidence-building measure among our citizens in Sri Lanka. With this corrective action, we hope that all impediments to the effective functioning of the Constitutional Council and independent commissions will be removed.

So, when the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe addressed the UN Human Rights Council in 2006, he gave a firm assurance that the Seventeenth Amendment would be implemented. Then in 2008, when the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe addressed the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council, he gave a firm assurance that the Constitutional Council which was not functioning at that time due to the non-appointment of members would be reactivated. But, what did the Government do? In 2010, after the euphoria of the election victory, the Government abolished the Seventeenth Amendment

I do not see the Minister of External Affairs present here, I do not see his deputy here and I do not see the Minister who speaks for Human Rights here. I would like to know who is going to reply?

( ) (An Hon. Member) The Hon. Azwer is going to reply.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We want an Hon. Minister to reply, not a donkey.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) When I speak, I must speak to someone who is going to reply. So, I would like to know who is going to reply. -[Interruption.] The Minister of External Affairs is not here, his deputy is not here, the Minister who speaks for Human Rights is not here but I am speaking about the assurances given by the Minister who speaks for Human Rights and the External Affairs Minister at the UN Human Rights Council.

Anyway, as I said earlier, the Government at the UN Human Rights Council on several occasions gave an assurance that the Seventeenth Amendment would be implemented but in 2010, after the euphoria of elections, abolished it. Be that as it may, the LLRC has now recommended that independent commissions be established. They have referred to a Police Commission, they have referred to a Judicial Service Commission and they have also recommended that the Freedom of Information Act should be enacted in Sri Lanka. So, I want a clear answer from the Government whether the Action Plan, which the Government is now preparing according to newspaper reports, will include the implementation of the Seventeenth Amendment and the Freedom of Information Act.

575 576

I saw a statement made by the Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena about Provincial Council elections. We are not against elections but there must be a level playing field. We know what happened in the Eastern Provincial Council Elections last time - I am sorry the Hon. Rauff Hakeem left the Chamber. At the first election to the Eastern Provincial Council, how many polling agents were chased?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) The ballot boxes were stuffed. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Please, you can reply later. The Hon. R. Sampanthan confirms that the ballot boxes were stuffed. The Police is under you, the Attorney-Generals Department is under you, the media is under you. I saw your statement that the answer to the problems we have with the international community is to hold elections. I must say you are on the wrong track. Holding of elections is not going to solve the problems that you have with the international community. That is a very basic thinking on your part. You may win elections in the future, that is a different matter. But, that is not going to solve your problems with the international community. To solve your problems with the international community, you have to implement the LLRC recommendations as mentioned by the UN Human Rights Council. We are ready for elections. But, there must be a level playing field. We saw what happened in the Eastern Province during the Provincial Council Election last time. That was an election that the UNP could have won. We won the Trincomalee District; we lost the Batticaloa District by a mere 10,000 votes and the Ampara District also by a very small amount. We would have won two Councils. We could have won a second Council if not for stuffing, as said by the Hon. R. Sampanthan. - [Interruption.] Not terrorists, security personnel. The whole world knows about it. Only you think others do not know. So, I am telling you that you are making your case worse. If you hold elections without the Seventeenth Amendment and the Freedom of Information Act in force, those elections will not be recognized. They will not be recognized internally as well as internationally.

Now, the LLRC calls for investigation into the violation of international law and investigation into serious human rights violations. Without having an independent police, do you think that these investigations will be accepted? Do you think so? You know the murder of five students in Trincomalee and the 17 aid workers at Muttur. What happened to that? The Udalagama Commission has wound up. So, you are asking the police to investigate into the killings of these innocent people.

Do you think investigations will be fair? If you listen to the Udalagama Commissions findings - the tape is there, you better put it on and listen to it - Minister for Human Rights at that time telephoned Dr. Manoharan, the father of a young boy killed and said, Do not come to give evidence. We will give you a house in Colombo. You know that. That is on record. The investigations must be of international standard; just holding investigations will not help you. For the sake of the country, I am asking you to hold elections but there must be a level playing field.

Where is the Action Plan? - [Interruption.] All are missing in action: the Minister of External Affairs is missing; the Deputy Minister of External Affairs is missing. It is a shame. It is an insult to Parliament when such an important matter is being discussed. It is a shame. Why can they not come to Parliament? They cannot come here because we are getting ready to ask 30 or 40 questions from them. They cannot come here because they have gone and told untruths to the international community disgracing our country. They have told untruths over and over again.

I would like to ask the Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena: Do you know that in 2008 there were 94 recommendations against Sri Lanka? Ninety four! When the Universal Periodic Review meets at the end of this year, they will have to answer all the 94 recommendations. You will have to answer all that: the Seventeenth Amendment, the extra-judicial killings, the disappearances, the media freedom, the freedom of the Human Rights Commission and what happened during the last stages of the war. Are you ready? No one appears to be ready.

Therefore, I ask the Government to divulge the Action Plan. Now, you say that foreign countries are interfering. But, you do not want to reveal the Action Plan here. You want to go to America and reveal the Action Plan there. It is a shame. You must reveal the Action Plan in Parliament. We are the Opposition and all of us can discuss it. Why do you not reveal the Action Plan here? There is a very active civil society here. Why can you not reveal it here? Why do you want to go to America? Earlier, a Minister asked us to boycott American goods, not to drink Coca Cola and not to eat Kentucky Fried Chicken. Now, where are you going? You are going to America. Our country has become a laughing stock of the people. I am sorry to say that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I second the Motion moved by my Colleague, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella. It is a very important resolution that has been brought in at a critical time.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I would like to ask, just as my Colleague quite rightly asked, Who am I speaking to? A resolution has been brought in and from a responsible Government and somebody has to come forward and answer for their irresponsible acts.

Today, the Minister of External Affairs prefers to be in Dubai speaking to some Sheikhs rather than answering the Sri Lankan Parliament. The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs may be evading Parliament. The Minister who had been the Special Envoy of the President on Human Rights is basically being inhumanely treated by the Government. He has been given leave from Parliament and he is missing in action. The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena who is the man for all seasons seems to be full of action. He has too many jobs to be juggling around and I do not think that even he is here to answer these. Irrespective of all that, our concern is for protecting the image and people of this country.

When we gained Independence from the British, the key words of the late Hon. D.S. Senanayake were, We are gaining Independence from Britain which ruled this country. We are a multi-religious and a multi-racial country. We must have the strength to carry the Sri Lankan identity into the future. Sri Lanka means the Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims, the Burghers and the Malays. All put together makes a rich fabric, the socio-demography of Sri Lanka - the Sri Lankans".

On the 19th of May 2012, we celebrate three years of the eradication of terrorism. Absence of war is not beginning of peace. You cannot force peace after a war. It must come from within the hearts and minds of the people. The majority should not be imposing their will on the minority; neither should the minority take undue advantage of the situation and impose conditions on the majority.

This is the time for the make or break of the country. For the first time, on the 12th of March 2012, the international community brought a Resolution against Sri Lanka. When the world community stood up against Sri Lanka and brought a Resolution, we were surprised because we thought that it was in the able hands of our Government as there were media revelations that the Resolution is going to be defeated and that everybody was supporting the Government. And, suddenly you had our closest friend, India, voting against us. Who is responsible for this?

You had arrogant Ministers who were threatening; ridiculing; fasting unto death and doing all types of stupid activities that ridiculed Sri Lanka. Today where are they? They said, "Why should we go after the dictates of America? Why should we basically be listening to the Westerners? We have our home-grown solution". We, from the Opposition, were the first to say that you do not need anybody imposing any will on the country. We have the strength, we have the confidence and we must have the magnanimity to work together to have a home-grown solution. But, are you permitting such a thing to take place? That is the problem.

Now, why is Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris going to America on the 15th of May? Is he going to see Disneyland? Is he going to have a holiday? Why is he - who, two or three months ago ridiculed the Americans and said, I do not need to waste time" - now suddenly going at an errand call when Hillary Clinton says to come there? You remember the State Secretary who was in Bangladesh a week ago; was in India five days ago and was in Myanmar a month ago? A Resolution was brought against Sri Lanka but it did not seem fit for her to come to Sri Lanka obviously because it seemed to be a sour subject.

The Government is acting like a village thug thinking that such activities will bring the international community to their bended knees. It was such activities that brought a Resolution against our country and which basically brought a major problem to the country. Now, it is time that all of us work together to rectify this anomaly that has taken place and rectify the error that has been committed by this irresponsible Government. We, as a responsible Opposition, call upon the Government to reveal the action plan that you want to tell the Americans. Trust the Opposition more than the Americans. Even they themselves have said: "You exhibit to the Sri Lankans

581 582

2012 11

before you come and tell us what is going on". Now, that is the reality. After all, they are not the jury. The international community is there to see that the inhuman activities that this Government is committing is not taken forward.

This stems from my learned Colleague, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, when he brought the Motion forward, he said that the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe in 2006 had said about the full implementation of the Seventeenth Amendment. Has that been honoured? In 2008, in the Universal Periodic Review, it was remembered and re-echoed that that was to be implemented. Remember the Joint Statement that was issued by the President of this country - not by any mean person but by the President of this country - and Mr. Ban Ki-moon when he visited our country stated that we will fully implement the Thirteenth Amendment enhancing the process of the devolution of power. So, at that time, it deemed fit that there was a lacuna in the system; there was a drawback; there were certain errors that need to be rectified. These were not mentioned by just local councillors; these were not told to the people who were visiting the country, but these have been told with a purpose: to get a permanent solution to the vexed problem that has been going on since the day of Independence.

So, Hon. Deputy Speaker, we, at this particular moment, call upon the Government to stop fooling the people. You are a Government that goes and tells India one thing; you are a Government that goes and meets the Venerable Mahanayakes and says another thing; you meet the partners of the UPFA and tell them completely another thing. Have the UPFA partners, three days ago, not got a two-page letter sent by the Government? My Friend, the Hon. Hasen Ali, the Secretary of a responsible political party - even though the party is acting irresponsibly - is here. So, Sir, I am asking whether you did not get a two-page letter. Has that not spelt out what of the LLRC recommendations is going to be implemented and what not? Is this what is expected? The LLRC is a Report of the Government, by the Government, for the Government. This has been very skilfully used by the international community because they saw that the international community was being fooled by this Government. So, they took the Government by its neck and said, Your report that you are bringing forward as LLRC Report, you implement it the way that you are saying. Now, that is what finally ended up as a Resolution against this country on the 12th of March 2012.

The LLRC has its own flaws but certainly we commend it, that it would go on a step in the right direction. It has not got the accountability that has been addressed but we appreciate that in its difficult environment, it has been able to put many things into place and we call upon the Government to implement those correct recommendations. Look at the Thirteenth Amendment. That is in the Constitution. Why do you not

first show your good faith by implementing the Thirteenth Amendment? This has been told five times to the Indian Government; it has been told twice to the UN Human Rights Council. Even recently, in February 2012, when Mr. S.M. Krishna, the Minister of External Affairs of India came to Sri Lanka, he and the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris in a joint statement and also in the discussion he had with the President have brought these matters open. These are not matters that have been closed and finished. That is the difference between a responsible government and irresponsible acts.

Now, the action plan for the implementation of recommendations of the LLRC is being taken forward. My Colleague, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, quite rightly asked as to where the action plan is and what it is about? You want to go and spin a surprise to the Americans? They are not bothered about it. The Hon. Minister of Construction Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities thinks that the American economy depends on Sri Lankan exports. That is why he said, We do not need to export anything to them or we do not need to import anything from America. He thinks that if we do not use Microsoft software or Google, then the American economy will crash. He does not know that in a US Dollar 600,000 billion market, Sri Lankan exports to America is 0.002 per cent and reverse-wise, their imports to Sri Lanka is only 0.03 per cent.

So, Hon. Deputy Speaker, all what we want to do is to ensure that an honourable political solution is brought to this country. The economy is in dire straits. I do not need to dwell on the subject of the Independent Elections Commission because my Colleague, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella dwelled on that in full.

What are you talking? You are talking of an independent commission. But, you cannot even hold a cooperative election without a fraud taking place. So, what more do you want to exhibit? You are talking of an independent Finance Commission. It was less spoken of, so I will dwell on that subject.

You had the Cabinet meeting last week voting US Dollars 300 million to import aircraft to this country. - [Interruption.] Privy to this information though the Members of Parliament are not there, we know what is going on in the Cabinet. US Dollars 300 million has been approved by the Cabinet to buy aircraft. SriLankan Airlines is losing Rs. 19 billion. For the household subsidies you have spent only Rs. 8.5 billion. You lose three times more on one entity in SriLankan Airlines and you are putting more money into that particular venture. You saw the documents last week in this Parliament that another US Dollars 100 million is being spent onto SriLankan Airlines. All this is simply because there is no independent Finance Commission. These are matters that the LLRC, the Governments own appointed team, is saying that it is absolutely essential to get the country

583 584

back into order. Remember Sri Lanka is not the only country that had its own problems. We had our civil disturbances. Now, those are gone. But, as I said, the end of the war is not the beginning of peace. It has to come through the process, through the hearts and minds of people, and then only can the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Burghers and Malays live as one Sri Lankan community.

The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris and his pack of holiday venturers, who are going to America will only be successful if he can reveal to this House what they intend doing there. This is how we will be able to quench the thirst of the international community. Remember that the resolution brought against the Government is not against the Government; it is against the country. And, just because a few people are mishandling the country, it does not mean that the Sri Lankans have to suffer the fate of this and that is why we want to get it corrected.

So, Hon. Deputy Speaker, while echoing the need that we have got to ensure that these resolutions, actions are tabled in Parliament; we also want the genuineness of the Government to come out. Rhetoric is not the need of the hour, it is the genuineness, the actions that are there. We, as the majority - the biggest single party in the Opposition - is looking forward to a sense of genuineness of the Government. If you reverse course of what went on in 2001 to 2004, when this Government was in Opposition and when we were in Government, what amount of hassle was there or if I may replay what went back in 1987? Today the Government is living on the Thirteenth Amendment. But, remember when the Thirteenth Amendment was brought in by President J.R. Jayewardene, what amount of problems was created by the present Government who was then in the Opposition. They brought in hysteria. They broke down places of worship, buildings et cetera; a number of people were killed and they said that the Thirteenth Amendment was going to be the end of the journey of the country. Today, the same chauvinists are saying that this is the only saviour of the country. What a change! What a transformation! Why is this transition? Because the late President J.R. Jayewardene had the magnanimity to say, "We have brought too little, too late but this is the step in the right direction". What is this Government saying if it was too little too late at that time? So, these independent Commissions were a must in 2000 when almost the entire Parliament voted and said that this is the way forward. Taking away the politicization of the economy, the politicization of the bureaucracy is the best way forward to the country and today the same thing that they voted then, was overturned in a couple of weeks, just about a year and a half ago.

So, all I want to say is to ensure that the Government comes clean. What is the way forward? This is not just satisfying Hillary Clinton or Mrs. Samantha Power there.

It is the international community who look at little Sri Lanka and say, You are in the bracket of Cuba. You are in the bracket of North Korea. You are in the same grade of Syria, Sudan and Iran. Now you cannot say that they are in the same grade of Myanmar because Myanmars leaders had the vision, the character and they were able to extricate Myanmar and are in the way forward now.

Where is the independent commission? When will the LLRC Report be implemented? As I said, the UPFA partners have to tell us what of the LLRC is going to be implemented. Then, you have got Mr. Lalith Weeratunga who has had a separate section saying LLRC to be implemented or not or what is going to be done. The sense of commitment is not shown when the Minister of External Affairs is in Dubai today. The Deputy Foreign Minister is not here; not even a single Cabinet Minister to be seen here.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) The first three rows are empty. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, the first three rows are empty. That is the sense of absurdity that is there. Now, you have angered the closest friend of ours, India. You are trying to flirt with the world when you know what way the country is - ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have only one more minute. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Okay, Sir. So, on that particular basis, all I want to say is, ensure that the country has a future; the people must have a future. Just because the UPFA does not have a future, do not bury the future of the country. The LLRC is a recommendation of the Government, by the Government and for the Government. It needs to be implemented from there onwards. The words told by the President to Ban Ki-moon and what our External Minister told to the External Minister of India - and the most important aspect in todays context is the political solution that needs to come out from the joint discussions that were started by the Government and the TNA. Where has it gone to? After months of discussions, deliberations, it has come back to zero. If the Government is serious - today they only want to show the world that we are talking. But, the Government wants to do everything and anything that they feel they want to do. This is the change that is required.

The Opposition sees the hypocrisy of the Government. We see the danger that is there. We call upon everybody to have sanity. Let sanity prevail, come back to order and depoliticize international issues. Do not let the international community poke their hands into this. We have the competence. We have the feeling that we need a solution. Let the home-grown solution be brought and ensure that we bring a lasting peace to this country.

[4.25 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you Mr. Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity given to me to speak on this Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Member for the Kandy District. Before I get on to what I wish to state, I would like to deal with some very interesting matters that the Hon. Acting Minister for Mass Media and Information just stated to this House. He said that this Motion which seeks to implement the recommendations of the LLRC is nothing but the agenda of the Tamil diaspora. I wonder how kindly His Excellency the President will take this comment having appointed the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. Is the Hon. Minister suggesting that His Excellency the President was acting according to the agenda of the Tamil diaspora in appointing the LLRC? [ ] . . He further stated that media freedom in this country is like the horse that was tethered and walked round and round, and even after its release kept walking round and round. That is, concession by the Minister himself that there is self-imposed censorship out of fear that they are being kept within the bounds and even if one cannot see the rope, the horse knows that it dare not move outside that circle. Even the private media today knows only too well what is good for their health. That message has been clearly delivered by the Government and today by the Hon. Minister himself in this House.

The Motion identifies two matters. Firstly, there is recommendation that rules and regulations must be formulated for the freedom of information, and secondly,

593 594

[ ]

2012 11

investigations must be initiated on serious violations of international laws and human rights. But, the operative part of the Motion is with regard to the appointment of independent Commissions. Whilst I fully endorse that Motion to appoint the independent Commissions, I recognize that the Proposer and the Seconder have dealt with that adequately and I wish to move on to the other matters that are mentioned in this Motion and some matters that are not mentioned in this Motion.

The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission made some interim recommendations. In their Final Report, they themselves lament that their interim recommendations have not been implemented. They have not included in their final report those interim recommendations. There is an article by Prof. Savithri Gunasekera and Mr. Jayantha Dhanapala, respected retired civil servant who was in Foreign Service, on behalf of "Friday Forum", that a few matters must be done as a matter of urgency and this is not out of any improper motive but for the sake of the country and one of those is releasing the report of the Udalagama Commission of Inquiry into killings, including that of the five students in Trincomalee and the 17 aid workers of Mutur. The Hon. Minister, a little while ago, was suggesting that we should not rake up matters that have been forgotten.

He was suggesting that the killing of five students in Trincomalee and the 17 aid workers in Mutur is a matter that the Government has successfully swept under the carpet and he is urging the Opposition, Do not remind the international community of this now. Do not bring this to the fore. Let forgotten matters be forgotten. I wish to tell this Government most categorically that none of those matters will ever be forgotten. Matters of justice, quest for justice can never be quenched by sweeping them under the carpet.

These two respected individuals further say that names must be made available of detainees and missing persons in regard to whom there is documented information of death. Thirdly, they suggest taking measures to prevent abductions and investigating such allegations as a matter of urgency and prosecuting offenders. Even whilst the Geneva Sessions were on in the month of March, there were white van" abductions liberally taking place in this country telling the international community, "we do not care two hoots to your concern about violations of human rights in this country; not one person has been apprehended and brought to book; that is what we want to display to the world; we do not care; we will carry on regardless whatever of your expression of concern".

As has rightly been pointed out by the Mover of this Motion, this is a disaster for this country and as responsible Members of the Opposition in this House, it is our duty to again and again remind the Government that they cannot take the country down this slope. Like the

other speakers of the Opposition, I also want to record the fact that no responsible Minister was present in this House until now. Now, I can see a senior Minister sleeping in the front row. He is still asleep. That shows the seriousness of this Government with regard to these matters and if we proceed in this way - [Interruption.] I talked about responsible Ministers. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Where is the Leader of the Opposition? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) If we go in this direction, the writing is on the wall as to what will happen. With all these things happening, I am sure the Hon. Member who is trying to disturb me will also agree with me that there is very serious concern expressed in the LLRC Report itself about religious freedom. While all these things were happening, we saw what happened in Dambulla and even the perpetrators who are very well identified are still at large. There is provision in the Penal Code of this country to prosecute persons who damage places of religious worship. The whole country knows the identity of the one who led the attack and the Government does not have the will to move a muscle to apprehend that offender and I wonder what the Hon. Member has to say about that. He dare not say anything. [Interruption.] Hon. Azwer, do you want to say anything? You dare not say anything about that.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I want to say one thing.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) What is that?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You can earn your - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) There is nothing about what I raised. - [Interruption.] Yes. I am a professional - [Interruption.] He has nothing to say to the challenge that I posed to him.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) That is not a challenge.

595 596

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) All he can do is to sling mud and Mr. Deputy Speaker, as yourself, I am also -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Azwer, what is your point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, just a while ago, he said these things should not be raked up. Do you want another bloodbath in the country? The issue at Dambulla has been settled. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not a point of Order.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, the Hon. Member has just demonstrated that he has no knowledge of the Standing Orders and what a point of Order is. I will get on to the second matter. The Motion states that investigations must be initiated on serious violations of international laws and human rights. The Tamil National Alliance has openly stated its position with regard to this. The violation of international laws is not a simple issue. That is a matter on which the international community can legitimately ask questions and that is not considered interference. That is international law today. We have said that accountability remains an urgent and important need to help victim communities overcome trauma and rebuild their lives. You talk so much about reconciliation and if you are serious about reconciliation, your concern should be that of the victims and if victims are to recover from trauma, justice and accountability are necessary parts of that. That is so to bring closure to a collective and personal grief, to ensure genuine reconciliation, to break the cycle of impunity in Sri Lanka, and to ensure against a return to violence, we need to put in place a credible and independent mechanism for accountability. International standards with respect to accountability require that this process advances truth, justice and victim reparation and that can happen only by the appointment of an independent international investigation. Any investigation must be independent. Those who are aware about this country know that no internal arrangement will ever be

independent and that is why we have consistently requested that it must be international to ensure that it is independent.

There is another matter about reparation to victims. Three years have passed since the conclusion of the war and as I said, if one is serious about reconciliation, the whole language of the Government ought to reflect that. I have with me today an invitation to an event that is to happen on Monday, the 14th and according to that, somebody has written a book titled, Gotas War. Whose war? Gotas War. - [Interruption.] The subtitle states, The Crushing of Tamil Tiger Terrorism in Sri Lanka. It means, Tamils equals Tiger equals Terrorists. That kind of mindset -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Tell us the author if you dare? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) The author is Mr. C.A. Chandraprema. We all know who he is? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He is talking the truth. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) That is not the point I am making. Anybody can write a book about the war. That is not what I am talking about. I am talking about the language used. He says, Tamil Tiger Terrorism. That means, Tamils equals Tiger equals Terrorists. That mindset will never advance any kind of reconciliation in this country. If you are serious about reconciliation, you need to change that radically. Removing Tamil officers from Tamil areas and appointing persons who have no proficiency in Tamil will not advance reconciliation as it happened yesterday in the case of GA, Vavuniya. This follows, sometime ago, the appointment of the GA of Mannar. We protested; we have consistently protested about the fact that the Government Agent, Trincomalee, is also a person who has no proficiency in Tamil and worse, he is a retired military man. There are only two provinces in this country that have retired military personnel as their Governors. That is the North and the East. Why is that? Three years after the end of the war, paying mere lip service to reconciliation, you still want to keep that tight control over those people. You want to occupy their lands - only two days ago, we had an Adjournment Motion on that - and I must place on record that the most responsible reply that we had on that day came from both the Minister for Resettlement and the Deputy Minister of

597 598

2012 11

Resettlement. They both conceded that enough has not been done. There were other Ministers who talked through their hats but the Ministers concerned accepted that this has not been done properly. Three years on - ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is the point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I do not know what type of an advocate he is and how he advocates. He is misleading the House. The Hon. Ministers never said that; they said something more has to be done and it will be done; the Government will do it. They never said that it is not done. Do not mislead the House as you do to your clients. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Member, you may continue. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Mr. Deputy Speaker, the Hon. Member for Kandy moving the Adjournment Motion referred to various assurances that the Government has given without serious thought of consequence, just to get over their difficulty on that day and all of those are matters of record at the Resolution that was passed in May, 2009 in the United Nations Human Rights Council, which very specifically states that it welcomes the assurance given by His Excellency the President. This is what it states; Welcoming also the recent assurance given by the President of Sri Lanka that he does not regard a military solution as a final solution, as well as his commitment to a political solution with implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to bring about lasting peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.... That was three years ago.

Now, it is a strange thing in this country that the Head of the country gives an assurance that he would implement the Constitution. That speaks volumes about the rule of law in this country. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella referred to previous Resolutions in 2006 where assurances were given that the Seventeenth Amendment would be implemented. Whoever gives an assurance that a part of the Constitution would be implemented concedes thereby that they are violating the Constitution at that point in time. And, here we are three years later, nothing

has been done about implementing part of the Constitution. The Thirteenth Amendment remains on the Constitution and repeatedly the Government says, We will implement it. Every time they say that, they are conceding to the world - ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) You have one minute left, Hon. Member.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) We can give him more time.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay, thank you. How long can you give me?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Then, I will take off time from the Hon. Mangala Samaraweera or Hon. Ajith P. Perera. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, Sir, I will conclude. This will take only a minute. I will conclude, Sir. [Interruption.]-

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) There are a lot of speakers - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) So, these assurances themselves have given a clear picture to the international community that this is a country that does not honour its Constitution, its supreme law. That is consistently confirmed by its Ministers and even the Head of the country that we do not honour the Constitution. We merely pay lip service. We take oaths under this Constitution to uphold the Constitution and then we go around the world saying, We will implement it; we will implement it; some day we will implement it".

Now, this is the attitude that has to change. This assurance given the world over that a political solution will be found has not been materialized. No effort has been taken. Merely appointing committees and ensuring that nothing comes out of those committees is no way of

599 600

demonstrating to the world that you are serious about finding a political solution. This is the same with regard to the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission as well. Why should the LLRC recommend that there must be the Rule of Law; that the Constitution must be implemented? Do we all not know that? Why should an Inter-Agency Advisory Committee have to be appointed - yet another committee - when interim recommendations are made by the LLRC? If LLRC makes interim recommendations, implement those. It is for that that you appointed that Commission in the first place. Now, it has given its Final Report and you have gone and appointed yet another committee to advise you on what of that can be implemented and when that report comes, a further committee will be appointed and when that report comes, another committee will be appointed. This pattern keeps going on and on and on.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, now wind up, please.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will conclude, Sir. The Hon. Minister was heard urging the Members of the United National Party to convince the Tamil National Alliance to come into the Parliamentary Select Committee. Now, we have made clear to the whole country our position with regard to the Parliamentary Select Committee. You cannot appoint a Committee for bilateral talks, go on with that for one year and then start appointing another Committee. There must be an end to the appointment of committees. There must be a serious political will that is demonstrated in action. An action plan has been mentioned in this Motion. I conclude now, supporting the proposition that the action plan must be first laid bare to the country, before something that we do not know is taken around the world to deceive the world.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, when an Adjournment Motion of national and international importance is being taken up in the House today, the disdainful attitude the Government has for the Motion in question is shown by the very fact that most of the Front-Benchers - until the Hon. Chief Government Whip, the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana and the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen came - were totally empty. What is also shocking is that the person who must be here in order to respond to this Motion, the Hon. Minister of External Affairs, is absent today. -[Interruption.] Okay. If not, we would have expected - I thought, of course, that the Hon. Minister must be too busy packing his baggage already to go to Washington and meet Hillary Clinton.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) What is the point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) The Hon. Member is misleading the House. The Hon. Minister of External Affairs is not absent. He is attending an official meeting in Cairo. When did you bring this Motion? You should have brought this Motion long time ago and given prior notice of it. So, Hon. Member, please do not mislead the House.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, you carry on with your speech. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Also, we do not accept an answer from the Deputy Minister of External Affairs. We actually expect an answer from a responsible Member of this Government. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Where were you all these days? - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) To begin with - [Interruption.] This is a matter of national and international importance and the joke of it is, while the Minister is getting ready to go to Washington and meet Hillary Clinton, he sends his Deputy Minister here to answer in Parliament, the very person whom we saw in pictures some weeks ago, being present when the effigies of President Obama were burnt in Colombo. This gentleman was there in all those meetings. Anyway, it is indeed a sad state of affairs. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Sir, I rise again to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) What is your point of Order? ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) I was not present in any place in Colombo when effigies of President Obama were burnt. So, please do not mislead the House. You are talking to the press. Please do

615 616

not mislead the House. Talk about the Motion in question without misleading the House.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Member, you carry on.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Then, I want to ask where this Deputy Minister was present when such acts against friendly countries were taking place. It is a shocking act against the friendly countries especially for a Minister of External Affairs or a Deputy Minister of External Affairs to be there.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today, Sri Lanka is a country in crisis, not only inside Parliament but we are facing a serious economic crisis; we have an unresolved ethnic crisis and today, we have also a crisis of governance. In addition, we are also facing a crisis of credibility - that is what I would call it - with the international arena due to the duplicitous manner in which we dealt with our longstanding friends in the international community. The "raised sarong diplomacy"; the "Medamulana type raised sarong diplomacy"; the hallmark of the foreign policy of the Rajapaksa Regime has brought us to the verge of international isolation and Sir, if I may say, we are on the verge of becoming the new Burma of Asia when Burma is also now travelling towards democracy, prosperity and development.

As I was part and parcel of the Rajapaksa Regime at the very inception, I know that it has always taken a very dismissive attitude towards its humanitarian and human rights obligations. In fact, way back in 2006 - I have it here; I have also read sections of it before - in a confidential letter to His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, I, as the Foreign Minister, warned him then of the serious repercussions Sri Lanka will have to face if our credibility factor as a nation is to be undermined. In the context of what we are facing now, I feel that the contents of my letter still have some relevance, if not more relevance today, and I would like to quote very briefly some sections of it. Again, I would like this time, not only to table* my letter, because of its relevance I would request you, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, to publish the whole letter in full in the Hansard.

Sir, on the 13th of December, 2006, when I wrote to His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, I said, I quote: Your Excellency, I am writing this letter to flag some grave concerns I have regarding the ground situation in the North and the East as well as some critical foreign relations dimensions and other matters related to the ethnic question. These issues are seriously undermining our credibility as a Government in the eyes of the international community. As I have pointed out in several discussions recently, due to various omissions and commissions on our part as the Government, our image internationally is deteriorating rapidly which may lead to serious repercussions .

I wrote this in December, 2006.

I further said, I quote:

As Your Excellencys Minister of Foreign Affairs, I would be failing in my duty if I do not highlight some of these concerns and the impending perils. The forewarnings given and preventive and mitigating courses .

Those were also suggested by me in this letter.

In it, of course, I highlighted the foreign policy achievements of the Government. I did not only criticize; in fact, I highlighted how much we achieved in the first few months by getting the LTTE banned in the European Union with the active help and participation of the United States Government. Condoleezza Rice, whom I met thrice in Washington, extended their wholehearted support and R. Nicholas Burns, who was one of the Deputy Secretaries, - I am revealing it to the House at this moment - actually canvassed on our behalf in some of the European Union countries who were still not convinced about the proscription of the LTTE. They are the ones, who finally got the unanimous consensus needed in the European Union for the LTTE to be banned on the 26th of May, 2006.

In fact, I reminded His Excellency the President even about the support we got from India. I quote:

Since your State visit to India in December last year, Indo-Sri Lanka relations were further strengthened

But, now it is in tatters. I also reminded him and subsequent to one such request, I personally conveyed to Hon. (Dr.) Manmohan Singh. Those days when I went there, the Prime Minister used to see me. I am not boasting. Every time I went, I did not meet the Foreign Minister, but I met the Prime Minister of India, who actually granted all our requests.

I remember at one time we needed some spare parts within 48 hours and Prime Minister, Hon. (Dr.) Manmohan Singh had flown those spare parts to Colombo within 24 hours of the request. So, this is the kind of support we had initially, but unfortunately we squandered it away because the "white van" started appearing; the abductions started happening; Members of

Parliament like the Hon. Joseph Pararajasingham and the Hon. Nadarajah Raviraj were assassinated and the Hon. T. Maheshwaran was later killed. These things started while I was the Foreign Minister. That was when I started writing this letter to the President and I will read one more section of that letter. I quote: There have been persistent reports about alleged abductions and extra-judicial killings attributed to government forces as well as the Karuna faction and the LTTE. These alleged abductions and killings have been reported both from cleared areas and uncleared areas.Whether or not these were committed by terrorist groups or Government agencies, it is the responsibility of the Government to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators in keeping with Sri Lankas treaty commitments. When such prosecutions do not take place, the Government will be blamed for allowing a culture of impunity.

This is what has happened, Hon. Chief Government Whip. This culture of impunity, we could have actually dealt with at the very beginning. The Government must be perceived as being above reproach at all times. This is something which all of us must realize. Even when fighting a ruthless terrorist group like the LTTE, the Government must not be seen as using the same tactics as a terror group. We have to be above that. The rule of law must always be respected by all arms of the Government.

This is a 13-page letter. So, I am not going to go through it. That is why I asked this letter to be published in full. Even at the end again I requested - at this time I was still in the Government; I was still your Foreign Minister; we were still great friends and you did not shout obscenities at me. . , . . . ( ) (An Hon. Member) ? ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) , . . . , . , . ? ? , -

Sir, I just would like to read this. I quote: Finally I would like to express my concern about the manner in which allegations against the Government are handled by the state media. Instead of responding to the allegations made against us in a

factual and credible manner, the people who make such allegations become victims of vicious personal attacks bordering on criminal defamation. A strategy of shooting the messenger will only alienate the international community further away from us. I sincerely hope that these concerns will receive Your Excellencys urgent attention. Thank you. Sincerely, Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ports & Aviation"

Of course, the response I got for this letter was that within 51 days I was removed from the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs.

But, after six years I would again like to bring to your attention the contents of this letter because the track record of this Government is that it has always not kept its promises, not only to the people of Sri Lanka but also it has not kept its promises to the international community. Giving solemn assurances and making commitments without having any inclination of fulfilling such promises merely in order to wriggle out of a difficult situation, in the face of mounting international pressure became the hallmark of this regime. A much respected Foreign Minister - I do not want to name him now - of a friendly country, after a meeting with top Members of the Government called those Members a pack of bloody liars

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

The very words he used in private. ( ) (An Hon. Member) Shame!

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Yes. This is the kind of image the international community has today of the higher echelons of our Government because of their inability to live up to their promises which they make from time to time. I just want to state some examples. Now, look at the various commissions. You keep appointing various commissions from time to time in the face of international pressure. In fact, between 2006 and 2012, I believe there have been seven Commissions of Inquiry appointed by the President and seven very important Committees chaired by various Cabinet Ministers. But, the outcome of most of these Committees is either unknown or inconclusive.

In fact, I would quickly like to go through them. For example, on 24th of March 2006 - this was of course for other political reasons - there was a Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed to inquire into matters arising out of the procurement of high value weapons and

619 620

other military equipment. It was appointed on the 24th of March, 2006 and the findings have not been made public. Then, there was another Presidential Commission appointed to inquire into the procurement of high value weapons and other military equipment during the period 2000 to 2005. It was appointed on the 5th July, 2006 but up to now the report has not been made public. Then again, a two-member Commission of Inquiry to probe into the assassination of the Batticaloa District Parliamentarian, Joseph Pararajasingham, was appointed on the 23rd of August, 2006. I was in Government then. The Final Report, I know, was submitted to the President but the findings have not yet been made public. Then, the Presidential Commission - the Mahanama Tillakaratne Commission - to examine the circumstances that led to such incidents of abductions, disappearances, unidentified dead bodies and unexplained killings as were reported throughout Sri Lanka in the recent past - this was amended to "since 13th September, 2006" - was appointed on 15th September, 2006 and the mandate was extended until 2007. But so far, the public nor Parliament knows what the outcome of this Report has been. Then, the Commission of Inquiry appointed to Investigate and Inquire into serious violations of Human Rights, which were alleged to have arisen in Sri Lanka since August, 2005 - the Udalagama Commission - was appointed on the 13th of November, 2006. The Report has not been made public. So far, even Parliament does not know what the outcome of that Report is. Then, there is the Report of the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons. In fact, I played a major role in recommending this Commission to be appointed and we got some of the most eminent people in the world to come to Sri Lanka. The President of Sri Lanka invited 11 international actors to observe the work of the Commission of Inquiry. This was actually going to monitor the other Commissions to ensure that those Commissions were working independently. It was finally established in February 2007 but what happened? The Final Report of IIGEP stated that it found, Absence of political will and the institutional inability of Sri Lanka to conduct human rights inquiries in accordance with international norms and standards. That is a damning verdict on this Government and then, they left in a hurry. So, the seventh Presidential Commission appointed was to examine the individual conduct for the deficiencies associated in connection with the items highlighted in the COPE Report dated 22nd June, 2005. It was appointed on the 20th June 2007 but so far this report has not even been tabled in this House. I do not think that even the Ministers are aware as to what the outcome of this report has been.

In addition to that as I told you, there were various inter-ministerial committees, which were appointed in the face of international pressure.

In fact, while I was the Foreign Minister, we appointed the Inter-Ministerial Commission on Human

Rights on 25th May 2006 under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights. It was expected to meet on a regular basis especially with regard to implementing decisions regarding human rights. So far, we do not even know whether that Committee exists or whether there has been a final report.

Members appointed to the Monitoring Committee on Abduction and Disappearances were - God forbid! - Minister Dullas Alahapperuma, Minister (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, Deputy Minister P. Radhakrishnan, Deputy Minister K. Baiz and the then Opposition Leader of the Colombo Municipal Council, Vasudeva Nanayakkara. It was appointed on 28th June 2007 but there are no results so far.

Members appointed to the Special Committee to Inquire into Abductions and Recruitment of Children for use in Armed Conflict were the Secretary, Ministry of Child Development and Womens Empowerment et cetera. It was appointed in 2007. There are no results so far.

Mr. D.S. Wijesinghe, Presidents Counsel chaired Committee the Committee Appointed to Study and Report on the US Department of State, "Report to Congress on incidents during the recent conflict in Sri Lanka". There is no response so far.

The Inter-Agency Advisory Committee to facilitate the implementation of the Interim Recommendations of the LLRC as submitted to the President in February 2011. This Committee actually submitted a report. That is also a no go area.

The LLRC in its final report stated that it regrets that full effect has not yet been given to the Interim Recommendations. Again, this is not what I am saying.

A one-man committee was appointed to probe into the violent incident in the Katunayake Free Trade Zone. Mr. Mahanama Tillakaratne was appointed to the Committee in 2011. So far we have no idea what these committees are doing.

One of the reasons why I am arguing on the credibility factor is because you have not been able to meet any of your commitments and assurances given by your own Government, by your own President, by your own External Affairs Minister to the international community. As a result, the situation has got very bad and now we are in the process of making an action plan to meet our obligations.

It is not only our inability to meet some of these concerns but the anti-democratic movement of this Government also created this problem because any pretense to democratic governance the Rajapaksa Regime may have had, were laid bare on the 8th of September

621 622

2012 11

2010 when the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution was bulldozed through Parliament insidiously exploiting the general feeling of goodwill towards this regime for decisively defeating the LTTE. The Government seemed hell-bent on performing the last rites on democracy in Sri Lanka. They did not use the war victory for the benefit of the people. They used the goodwill they gained from the people because of the war victory to entrench themselves further in power. This is what happened. Democratic structures have been dismantled in a calculated and systematic manner. Democracy is now becoming increasingly confined to the grandstanding of our political leaders and to the Orwellian Newspeak, which the Government kept and fed - media has perfected to an art form.

In fact, as I said earlier, the present regime in its obsession to perpetrate a dynasty - I know most of the Ministers are against it - is now systematically and single-mindedly dismantling the fundamentals of democratic rule and the rule of law insidiously exploiting that general feeling. Sri Lanka now, can no longer be considered a democracy in Asia.

We killed the Seventeenth Amendment, which was one of most progressive amendments brought in to Parliament, perhaps it was the only time when the whole Parliament agreed including Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. Sorry he was not Prime Minister, he was Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2001.

We all raised our hands to create these independent Commissions. We all raised our hands to create an independent Police Commission; we all raised our hands to create an independent Judicial Commission; we all raised our hands to create an independent Police Commission and we all raised our hands especially to create an independent Election Commission. This was a milestone in the history of Sri Lanka, but unfortunately on the 8th of September, 2011, President Rajapaksa grabbed all that power back into his hands. As you know, today the Attorney-Generals Department comes directly under the President. The Chief Justice is appointed by the President. The Elections Commissioner is appointed by the President and all other important positions are now appointed or manipulated by the President or his family. As for the rule of law, I am not going to talk about it because we have discussed it in length in this House today.

Having said that, I would say that the other factor which brought the sort of international condemnation and international scrutiny we are facing today is the inability of the Government to resolve the unresolved ethnic crisis which has been haunting this country for so many decades. Winning the war against the LTTE in 2009 gave us a propitious moment to win peace, once and for all. The defeat of the LTTE, one of the most ruthless and extreme groups in the world, gave us a window of

opportunity to overcome the scourge of terrorism of extremist politics, both Sinhala and Tamil, which has raised its ugly head each time many of our leaders tried to address the grievances of the Tamil people. With the LTTE out of the way, it was up to the President with his unprecedented popularity - I agree, at that time his popularity was unprecedented especially among the Sinhala people - to convince the majority that a durable peace can only be achieved through a political settlement based on power-sharing. This is what he should have done. But, instead what happened? Instead, the Rajapaksa regime embarked -on - what I would call - an orgy of triumphalism. Members of the Rajapaksa clan competed with each other to carry Buddha statues to the North enacting scenes from the Mahawamsa, making a mockery of the true spirit of Buddhism. Very recently - this was something I heard yesterday - the tenants of the land in Mannar belonging to Sir Kandiah Vaithyanathan - I believe he was a Member of the D.S. Senanayake Cabinet - have been chased out last week in order to build a Buddha statue there. All this is done in the name of our great Lord Buddha. That mosque in Matale was destroyed in the name of the Lord Buddha.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Member, please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, I will wind up in three minutes.

In fact, all I can say is - I do not know if the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena would get angry with me - as a Buddhist, I feel that if Lord Buddha could revisit our Island today and witness what is going on in this country in his name, I am sure he would decide never to step on the soil of Sri Lanka again. That is how terrible it has become.

Instead of wanting to win their hearts and minds, the Tamils have been made to feel like a subjugated and vanquished race depending on the magnanimity of the Sinhala majority in general and the Rajapaksa family in particular. The long suffering Tamils of the North and the East have found themselves in a "from the frying pan into the fire" situation despite being liberated from the clutches of the LTTE.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Sir, can I have two more minutes?

623 624

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) No. How can I give you more time? - [Interrruption.] Then, shall I deduct it from the Hon. Ajith P. Pereras time? - [Interrruption.] You have already taken more time. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) We have a lot of time since we started early. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) We have half an hours time left from what has been allotted for the entire Debate.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That is different. ( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) As a result of all these factors, the Government has lost all credibility and today, we are bogged down in a quagmire of international scrutiny. At a time when Sri Lanka is under international scrutiny, the LLRC Report has given a much-needed lifeline to the Government. Despite certain shortcomings especially in the area of accountability, the LLRC Report has not only been endorsed by the UNP and the Opposition but also by the international community. Instead of forcing a foreign formula on us, the international community is asking for the time-bound implementation of this Report, which the Government has called its home-grown formula. As the Hon. Leader of the House said on the Floor of this House on 16th December, last year, even the President has expressed his satisfaction with this Report by thanking the Members of the LLRC for fulfilling the task entrusted to them with responsibility and commitment. It should also be a matter of pride to the President that a Presidential Commission appointed by him has been endorsed across the board and I believe that all the Opposition parties stand ready to support the implementation of the LLRC recommendations as early as possible. .

The repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment must be given priority so that the independent Commissions can be restored. It is imperative that the independent Election Commission with full powers to conduct a free and fair election be restored immediately, especially if you are thinking of having other elections soon, along with the independent Police Commission, the independent Public Service Commission and the Judicial Service Commission in keeping with the LLRC Report. The Right to Information Act will also strengthen the Sri Lankan democratic credentials and meanwhile, the process of

formulating a political settlement to build on the Thirteenth Amendment must commence immediately. It must not be a time-buying exercise to mislead the international community. A genuine political commitment should be shown by the Government and the Government must fulfill the assurance already given by them to the TNA.

The Action Plan - I also endorse the views of the others - must be discussed with us. Actually, if it has been done in consultation with the Opposition, it would have even more credibility internationally and it must be a genuine Action Plan, not one prepared merely in order to buy time because this is a good opportunity for the Government to turn the tide around in their favour. If not, I would say, the Government will have no one else to blame but itself when the floodgates of international scrutiny get open very soon.

Thank you.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity to speak on the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella.

The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission has pointed out the need for independent Commissions in its Final Report. Further, it has also recommended that the rules and regulations necessary to ensure the right to information and media freedom should be formulated and investigations on violation of international laws and grave violation of human rights should be initiated.

Everybody is rushing to implement the LLRC recommendations, suggesting ways of implementing them. The Government has clearly mentioned that they are ready to go for elections whether it is in the North, the East, the South or the Central Province. Basically, the Opposition has a fear of going for elections without an independent Election Commission. At the last election, at the General Election or the Presidential Election, your own leader, the Leader of the Opposition, Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe praised the Government for conducting a free and fair election. At the day of the election -

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No, he did not.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Of course, he said that. . .

Prior to the LLRC recommendations were brought, the Darusman Report was brought. At that time, even the TNA and the UNP were bringing the Darusman Report to light. The Darusman Report did not have any respect for the LLRC, which was appointed by the President and was preparing this Report. What did you all say? First of all, you condemned the people who were writing the LLRC

639 640

Report; you were bringing allegations against those people. Then you said, These three people should have been appointed by some other party. You did not have any respect for them. TNA , , , . . . . , - flats - . interim recommendations LLRC Report . . census .

Therefore, there have been a lot of rehabilitation programmes taking place. A three-member delegation of the European Parliament visited Sri Lanka three weeks ago. They are: Ms. Jean Lambert, Mr. Fernando Lopez Aguilar and Ms. Inese Vaidere. Ms. Inese was surprised because we have released all the LTTE combatants in the North and the East to follow their normal lifestyle. She said that she would vote against the vote to get these

people released. The Government has taken a bold decision in releasing these people and rehabilitating them to bring them back to the normal system in this country.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , Action Plan . ( ) (The Presiding Member) The Deputy Minister is having his own views on this. Let him express them freely.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Altogether, 594 child combatants have been released. Among them are 364 males and 230 females. -[Interruption.] Hon. Member, please let me finish my speech. You had time to speak. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) That is his responsibility -

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) You could have spoken during your time. Let me finish my speech.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I am asking about what is mentioned in my Motion.

( ) (The Presiding Member) You can ask but the Deputy Minister has his free views.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Other programmes for former child combatants have also been conducted and they are living very happily doing their normal day-to-day activities including their studies, which was deprived to them by the LTTE, which was deprived to them by the UNP by letting them to continue the war in the North and the East and also in the South of the country. There was no freedom for the people to go about in the South. So many people, even the Members of Parliament, including yourself, had to go with so much of security in the South; there was no freedom. If you go through the details about the - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, the Deputy Minister is in action.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) Action Plan ? , .

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) I will come to that. Please sit down and listen. With regard to education, I can give you much of results of the child combatants who sat for the GCE (Advanced Level) Examination in 2010 and even the results of the combatants who sat for the GCE. (Ordinary Level) Examination in 2010. All these are the recommendations of the LLRC Report. What the Government wanted to do and what the Government has been doing are documented, my dear Hon. Members so that you can go through them. The problem is, you do not know what is happening in the North and the East - [Interruption.] You all are fearing the elections. That is the whole issue.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) We want to know about the Action Plan.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Activities under the rehabilitation programmes, for instance, spiritual, religious and cultural rehabilitation programmes on returning of cultural and family norms are taking place in the North and the East and all over the country. The rehabilitated people are travelling to the South as well to follow these programmes.

Then, with regard to the vocational rehabilitation programmes, many opportunities are made available for male and female beneficiaries. I can give you the details of the many loans which have been given to the people to start new businesses and rebuild their lives. Psychological as well as creative therapies are also given for the rehabilitated. Sports, extra-curricular activities are taking place in the North and these are all recommendations contained in the LLRC Report. Family unification through the "Peace Villages" concept has also been introduced to the - [Interruption.] Yes, this is also mentioned in the recommendations. - [Interruption.] Of course. Family unification and protective accommodation has been carried out according to the recommendations of the LLRC Report.

Then, the vocational training programmes for ex-combatants have also been started and they are going on very well according to the LLRC recommendations. You are talking about free media. We have provided the people in the North and the East with computer laboratories for IT-related vocational training for them to get into Information Technology, which is also one aspect of media freedom, and have taught them how to use the computer .

Earlier, there were no internet facilities for the people of the North but now we have provided them with internet facilities and also with telecommunication facilities so that they are able to use -

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) What are you talking about?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) We are doing this according to the recommendations of the LLRC Report. There are so many recommendations in that but your only issue is the implementation of the Election Commission and the Police Commission.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) No, no.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) For your election purposes only you are talking about them. - [Interruption.] Please let me finish my speech.

Psychological and physical development counselling is also taking place. I think you should participate in this psychological and physical development counselling. It is of no use coming here and talking about unnecessary things which cannot be implemented overnight. We have to wait. We cannot implement these things overnight - [Interruption.]

Then, mobile workshops and mass marriage ceremonies are taking place in the North and psychological counselling is taking place at the training centres in the North, the East and the South, wherever they live and feel free to live in this country.

Also, I can give you the information of the amount of money that has been allocated to the resettled people to restart self-employment, and the details of the loan disbursements. The resettled people numbering 12,000, including the ex-combatants of the LTTE, who are now

643 644

living in the Vavuniya District have been given Rs. 21,670,000 up to now and the resettled people in Jaffna have been given Rs.145,165,000. A total sum amounting to Rs. 6,395,000 has been given to the resettled people in Trincomalee and Rs.122 million has been given to such people in Kilinochchi on subsidized loan schemes in order to restart their livelihood on agriculture, livestock, fisheries industry, small businesses, domestic industry and to purchase productive enterprise equipment and so on and so forth. We have given Rs. 14,690,000 to the resettled people in the Mannar District and Rs. 9,625,000 to such people in Mullaitivu. The resettled people in Batticaloa have been given Rs. 4,090,000 and Rs.100,000 has been given to one family resettled in Colombo to restart -

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) What about the High Security Zones?

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Also, some of the ex-combatants of the LTTE have been resettled in Galle, in down South and they have also been given an opportunity to restart businesses. - [Interruption.]

The suggestions made through the Adjournment Motion by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella for inclusion of media freedom, appointment of independent Commissions, the Action Plan and investigations on violation of international laws and grave violations of human rights which flow from recommendations already contained in the LLRC will be dealt with in the manner outlined previously by the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, when he submitted the LLRC Report to Parliament on 16th December 2011.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Deputy Minister, please wind up your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) So, it is a matter of time. You must give time to the Government to draw up a plan. You cannot blame the Government or you cannot force it to have a time frame to prepare a plan and to deliver it. First of all, you should nominate your people to the Parliamentary Select Committee so that you can bring up all these matters at that Committee. Then, work out a plan which is good and could be implemented in this country on a short-term, medium-term and long-term basis.

Mr. Presiding Member, I take this opportunity to tell that the Government is definitely going to implement the recommendations of the LLRC. But, to do that we need support from you all. What we want from you is not to blame the Government for taking time but to extend your cooperation to implement the recommendations of the LLRC, as promised by the Leader of the House on the 16th of December, 2011. So, it is a matter of time. We cannot force the LLRC recommendations to be implemented within a few days or a few months. We cannot work out a plan and have it implemented within a few days time. We need the support of the Attorney-Generals Department to see whether those can be implemented.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) You brought the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution within 24 hours.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) But, this is a 30-year old war and we lost three decades due to the LTTE insurgency in this country.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Deputy Minister, your time is up. ( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) Okay. Therefore, we need time for the implementation of this package for the people in order to ensure long-lasting peace.

So, just because you fear elections, just because you fear that the number of your Members will get reduced in Parliament, that has nothing to do with the LLRC recommendations. We are working towards bringing peace and prosperity to all the people who were deprived of them for the last 30 years in this country, especially to the people in the North and the East.

Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, you said that you have got the opportunity to meet the Prime Minister of India. Remember, you got that opportunity as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of President Mahinda Rajapaksas Government and not because of your personal capacity. First of all, put your party in order. Just because you left the Government, do not try to condemn it. You talk about the party that you are representing.

I do not want to talk about what you have got to say about the Government but I would say that your party, your own leadership will have to face a few more elections and then you will realize whether your Leader

645 646

[ ]

2012 11

can bring peace and prosperity to this country. - [Interruption.] First of all, you have to bring peace to your party before you think of - [Interruption.] Do not worry, President Mahinda Rajapaksa has shown his ability to the world. Even when he was fighting the war, you all said that he cannot fight the war. You all said that we are going to Medawachchiya and not Kilinochchiya; not Alimankada but Pamankada. You all did not support us. You all supported the people who had weapons.

( ) (The Hon. Mangala Samaraweera) The President or the Government cannot go to the Europe. That is how things are.

( ) (The Hon. Neomal Perera) We have to thank the Government of America for exposing Raj Rajaratnam, an insider trader who had been sending money to Sri Lanka to your party members. The American Government is still supporting us, we must tell that frankly. It is not only during your time, when you met Condoleezza Rice, that the American Government supported us. - [Interruption.] I must tell you that the Government of America is still supporting this Government and is committed to the safety and security of all the people in this country, not only of the Front-Benchers of the United National Party, who have no leadership or who have no vision for its party members in this country. I do not want to talk about the individual mud-slinging campaigns that you talked of today and accuse the Members of mud-slinging. You accused the Minister of running away from todays Debate but you brought in this Motion a few days after he left this country.

I am telling you, just because you cannot get the UNPers together, do not blame the Government which is going to deliver the LLRC package in this country in due course. It will be delivered in the best interests of the Tamils, the Sinhalese and all other communities in this country; not the way you want, not the way the UNP leadership wants or not the way the UNP goons want in this country.

Thank you, Sir.
