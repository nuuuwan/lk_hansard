' ' PRIVILEGE : ENGAL DESAM REPORT OF 15.11.2012 AND RECENT NEWSPAPER REPORTS

. .. ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Speaker, thank you for permitting me to raise this issue as a matter of Privilege. During the last few days, there have been reports published in certain newspapers purporting to indicate that you have given an Order to remove me from the Chairmans Panel. You have not done so and you told me so when I met you in the Chambers. This is not only a violation of the privilege ensured to every Member of the House but also an infringement upon the Speakers authority. How could anyone put words into the mouth of the Hon. Speaker and make it a news report, quoting unreliable sources?

I propose that this be referred to the Committee on Privileges for inquiry.

Also, Sir, I raised the question of an article which appeared in the "Engal Desam" of 15th November, 2012 in which they have defamed the Hon. Abdul Cader and myself. When I raised this matter on the Floor of the House, the Hon. Deputy Speaker wanted me to give a Sinhala or English translation of the news item together with our explanation which I table*.

I propose that this too be referred to the Committee on Privileges. Thank you.

(The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you, Mr. Chairman, the war that raged in the North and the East of Sri Lanka for several decades has come to an end more than three years ago. The Tamil people want to put the war behind them and they want to get on with their lives. There seems to be a rather mistaken belief among some people in this country that the Tamil people want the armed forces out from the North and the East. That is not correct. I may put it on record that we realize and we accept that the armed forces have got to be present in the North and the East as they are in the whole country. We only ask that the presence of the armed forces in the North and the East is not in

2943 2944

such a manner that is oppressive to the Tamil people, so as to subjugate the Tamil people, as to make them feel that they are not equal citizens in this country and as to make them feel that they are inferior citizens in this country. That is what we do not want. We, the Tamil people should be able to exist with self-respect and dignity in the North and the East while the armed forces according to the numbers required, according to the numbers necessary in a reasonable way, will also exist in the North and the East and carry on with their work. - [Interruption.]

Sir, in this context, I need to talk about the history of the Tamil struggle. The Tamil struggle commenced shortly after Independence. It has a long history. It commenced for various reasons, with various grievances, with the legitimate grievances which have been recognized by very tall leaders in this country like the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and the late Hon. Dudley Senanayake. There was the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact. There was the Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact. If those Pacts had been implemented this country will not be in this position today. We were never a violent people. We carried on a legitimate, democratic, non-violent political struggle. We performed Satyagraha, we observed Ahimsa. When we did all that, there was violence unleashed against the Tamil people. It happened in 1956; it happened in 1958; it happened in 1961; it happened in 1977; it happened in 1981 and there was a genocidal Tamil pogrom in 1983. These are indisputable. We were prepared for a reasonable political solution within the framework of a united and undivided Sri Lanka. My Leader, Mr. Chelvanayakam very clearly enunciated that position. There can be no question about it, there can be no denial in regard to that matter. Therefore, that was the history of our struggle and it was because these reasonable political demands which were advocated in a democratic non-violent way were not accommodated and because there were repeated consistent anti-Tamil pogroms that took place over a long period of time, it was in those circumstances that the LTTE emerged. One must understand the true circumstances in which the LTTE emerged. I have always taken the view that the LTTE was not created by the Tamil people, that the LTTE was in fact created by successive governments in this country which did not accommodate legitimate Tamil political aspirations and when the Tamil people carried out a non-violent, peaceful, civil disobedience struggle, they were subjected to violence. That was the reason why the LTTE emerged. There were legitimate reasons for the emergence of the LTTE. Nobody can deny that. It came to be termed as a terrorist organization when it attacked civilians: Sinhalese civilians, Tamil civilians, Muslim civilians, when they started attacks on civilian leaders. That was the time that the LTTE came to be termed as a terrorist organization.

They never observed human rights; they never observed democracy. These were their failings. A lot of people claim credit for destroying the LTTE. I say the LTTE destroyed itself by not observing democracy, by not observing human rights and that was the truth. The late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, our former Member of Parliament, a most respected Member of Parliament and my good Friend, played a very leading role in ensuring that the LTTE was weakened, that the LTTE was paralyzed, that the LTTE structures in many countries the world over were dismantled. He was largely responsible for the support of the international community to Sri Lanka to defeat the LTTE. If the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar was living today, he would indeed be very horrified at many of the things that are happening today and many of the things that are being said today. So, we must remember this. Sir, my own leaders, my own Colleagues were killed by the LTTE. I was on the hit-list of the LTTE. Why? You call us the LTTE proxies. Do you call us proxies because we were to be killed by the LTTE? Do you call us proxies because we were on the hit-list of the LTTE? When they came into the Ceasefire Agreement and entered the process of negotiations, then naturally everybody had to work with them to ensure that there was a political, peaceful resolution to the conflict. Now that the LTTE is no more there, that the LTTE has been removed, it has gone away, some people think that Tamil issue has also gone away. The Tamil issue cannot go away like that. The Tamil issue will remain until a reasonable, workable, acceptable and durable political solution is found to the Tamil question. The Tamil issue has only acquired greater moral strength and greater legitimacy as a result of the demise of the LTTE. The Tamil issue cannot go away.

Now, I want to refer to something. I do not want to be misunderstood. What is wrong in observing a remembrance day for those who died during the war? The 27th of November this year also happened to be a very religious day for the Hindu people where we lit lamps and prayed to Lord Murugan. Karthikai Deepam is a great festival. It so happened that there was also the remembrance day for the LTTE cadres. What is wrong in a brother lighting a lamp for his dead brother? What is wrong in a mother lighting a lamp for her dead son or what is wrong in a Tamil lady lighting a lamp for her dead husband? The JVP commemorates their day of celebration. Nobody complains about it. Nothing is done. Why can we not do the same, do it as a fundamental right? It happens the world over; it happens in every country where people have laid down their lives and made a sacrifice, maybe for a good cause, maybe for a bad cause, maybe for good reasons, maybe for bad reasons, but that is a fundamental right to which people are entitled and that should not be stopped and that certainly should not be stopped by force.

I am very sorry, Sir, that there was this unnecessary incident regarding the students in Jaffna. Now, I am told that of the four students taken into custody, one had been

2945 2946

[ . ]

2012 07

released but three are still in custody. It is my very well-considered submission that the army should not have entered the university premises on the evening of 27th of November. There was no violence there, there were no guns there, nobody was engaged in violence.

If at all they were going to light some lamps, observe some silence and pray for their deceased brothers which they were entitled to do - it also happened to be a day of Karthikai Deepam when lamps are lit in prayer to Lord Murugan - I think the army was wrong. It was an unwarranted entry, an unwarranted interference with the activities, perfectly legal activities of the students of the Jaffna University. They were assaulted. Their hostels were damaged. Their property was destroyed. Four of them were taken into custody the next day and three of them are still in custody. I would very strongly appeal to the Government to look into this matter more carefully. We do not want confrontation. We do not want a situation to build up in this country. We would appeal to the Government to look into this matter and ensure that the boys who are in custody are released.

Of course, Sir, we are concerned about the activities of the armed forces in the North and the East which are a hindrance to our living with self-respect and dignity in the areas in which we were born and in which we have lived. We have asked for demilitarization, not for the removal of the military. Out of the 20 divisions in the Sri Lankan Army - according to the information I have - 15 divisions are in the North, two divisions in the East and three divisions in the rest of the country. I am told that if there are 15 divisions in the North, that would mean that there at least 150,000 soldiers in the Northern Province. That is a very very large number of soldiers, given the fact that the number of people in the Northern Province is probably in the region of 600,000, which means that you have one soldier for every four civilians. This is not acceptable, Sir. The army had been interfering in other matters. When the first meeting was held in Jaffna, just prior to the Local Authority Elections, the armed forces went in and assaulted the persons who had assembled in a school building and that meeting was disrupted. On the day prior to the election to the Local Authorities in Jaffna, particularly in the Wanni, in Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu, they went around and confiscated peoples ballot cards and identity cards. I had to make representations to the Commissioner of Elections in regard to that matter and certain action was taken, and those people were able to vote. When the Provincial Councils Elections took place in the Eastern Province recently, army intelligence personnel played a part in regard to that matter. They went and intimidated persons who were working for the Tamil National Alliance. They were told not to do that. They were told, If you work for the elections for the Tamil National Alliance, there might be consequences which you will have to face after the elections are over. People were frightened; people were not able to freely partake in the elections.

With such activities of the army, we are surely concerned. The army is occupying large extents of land in the North particularly, and also in the East. We do not want tension to build. We want to live in a state of normalcy. We do not want trouble in our areas. We do not want a confrontation with the armed forces. We want to live in peace. We do not want them there in such large numbers because when they are there in such large numbers, their presence is oppressive. Their presence is a humiliation to us. Their presence has an impact on our self-respect and dignity. It makes us unequal. It makes us second-class citizens. That is what we do not want.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I am losing my time, Sir. ( ) (The Chairman) . .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, in the first instance - ( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Sampanthan, you carry on with your speech.

( ) (The Chairman) , . . -

(The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Sir, I did not in the course of any part of my speech demand the removal of the army from the North and the East - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Sampanthan, you continue with your speech.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Now, Sir, our people have not been able to resettle in Valikamam. Our people have not been able to resettle in Sampur. The Government has made commitments to the Supreme Court that the people can resettle in these areas in Valikamam and Sampur. People are not able to settle on their lands in Mullaitivu in Keppapulavu and they have been sent to a place called Kombawil some long distance away. Five hundred and fifty one houses in Jaffna are still occupied by the army. Three hundred eight camps in Jaffna are on private lands. There are army camps in 153 Grama Niladhari Divisions in the North. This is what we complain about, this excessive presence. We do not say that they should not be there. They can be there in certain camps, do their activities as before the war, maintain their intelligence, have their surveillance. There is no problem in regard to that matter. That is their duty. We only do not want the armed forces to have an adverse impact on the lives of our people and make them feel that they are some inferior people in this country, not equal people in this country that is what we do not want.

West of the Iranamadu Tank Sir, East of the A-9 highway on 4,600 hectares of lands approximately 12,000 acres of land, approximately 10,000 houses are being built for the army, something very different from army being accommodated in camps. Ten thousand houses are being built for the army. This is a large housing scheme. Majority of them are going to be soldiers from other parts of the country. They will come and settle down with their families - [Interruption.] Please do not disturb me. Please talk later. Please be civilized. They are going to become permanent residents there, they are going to become permanent voters there - [Interruption.] Sir, we must have some order in this House.

In order to give this whole thing a measure of some balance, from an ethnic point of view, recently the armed forces have started recruiting some Tamil females into the army. They are being paid Rs. 35,000 per month. I am told that 118 females were recruited recently and that they are also recruiting some people to the Civil Security Division called the CSD with black T-shirt with the yellow marking CSD on the T-shirt. Two thousand five hundred people have been recruited recently, both males and females. They are being paid a salary of Rs. 18,000 per month, but they are largely engaged to work as labourers in army camps. Now, this is not the sort of economic activity that our people want. Our people want to start their agriculture, our people want to start their fishing.

Our people want to start their livestock and animal husbandry development and our people want to start their industries. What is being done in those areas? You want to get some people who will oblige you, give them some salaries and in order to give the semblance of doing something for the Tamil people, recruit some Tamil people into the army. You are recruiting some of these people and putting them into some activity largely serving your own purposes, the requirements of the armed forces. In Iranamadu, 25 acres of land are being cultivated by the army with vegetables; in Theravil, almost 150 acres of land are being cultivated by the army with fruits; in Vellamkulam, about 600 acres of land are being cultivated by the army with cadjunuts; in Mukkombu, 100 acres of land are being cultivated by the army with coconuts; in Chunnavil, 600 acres of lands are being cultivated by the army with cadjunuts. These are all in the Wanni. A large extent of paddy fields under village tanks are being cultivated by the army. The army is engaging in all these activities where civilians should be engaged and where civilians should be involved. Civilians cannot go to these areas; civilians cannot live in these areas and civilians cannot walk in these areas because these areas are under the control of the army. A displaced family is given a maximum of one fourth acre of land to live and to carry on his occupation. Can he live in that land? Can he survive with that land while the Army is occupying such large extents of land? I am informed, Sir, very reliably that behind the Iranamadu Tank, between the Iranamadu Tank and the Army settlements, at Dollar and Kent Farms and behind, there is Welioya, there is the move to establish a link over a distance of 70 or 80 kilometres. Over a distance of 70 or 80 kilometres of land, their effort is to establish a link. Sir, such steps must inevitably have sinister objectives. It is not something that we can keep quiet about that we can watch or not speak about or hear about and not speak about. Armed forces are being used in my submission by their large presence in the Northern Province in particular, to achieve political objectives. That must not be allowed. That is not the work of the army. Army fought the war. The war is over. Army must be confined to its camps and engage in other legitimate work that it

2949 2950

2012 07

might require them for. But, you must not use them in such a way that the Tamil people are being deprived or subjected to harassment. These steps also, Sir, quite apart from achieving certain definite political objectives bring about substantial demographic changes in the North in particular now, it has also happened in the East and is still happening in the East. And these changes, Sir -

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne) How many Sinhalese people have been living in Jaffna Peninsula?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) For goodness sake, let me speak. We have too many [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

in this House, Sir. We have so many

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] in this House. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) .

. .. ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Chairman) Point of Order ?

. .. ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Chairman, being the Leader of the Tamil community and a senior politician he cannot use the word

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] and the word

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] on the Hon. Members of this House. [Interruption.]

Sir, all Members are Hon. Members. There are no

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] There can be others in the North. Hon. R. Sampanthan, you have to respect the Members.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) If I might say so, Sir, I am not a supporter of ethnic cleansing. I come from a district where Sinhalese people live. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) a . .

. ( . )

(The Hon. R. Sampanthan) There will not be one Sinhalese person who will complain that I have ever harmed him. Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, you know that your Members of Parliament who have been to Trincomalee, your Ministers who have been to Trincomalee, have met with the Sinhalese people and they have said that. Sir, that is our position. It maybe there was ethnic cleansing by the LTTE; there was ethnic cleansing of Tamils during all these racial pogroms. How did this diaspora come about? That is now complained about. The diaspora came about on account of the fact that during these pogroms that took place in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. People went out as a result of violence. That is how the diaspora has come about. So, Sir, we do not support ethnic cleansing. It is our view that all people must be entitled to live wherever they have lived. That if their fundamental right, irrespective of whether they are Sinhalese, whether they are Tamils or whether they are Muslims. The only thing we have opposed is people being settled by the State in such a manner as to change the demographic composition of the areas which is what the Bandaranaika-Chelvanayakam Pact and the Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact provided against. That is all that we have advocated, that is all that we have demanded. We have never demanded anything more than that. We have never taken any objections or whatever to any person of any ethnicity coming into the North and the East, settling down and carrying on his enterprise. We have never opposed that. That is the position Sir. [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) , . a .

2951 2952

. . . . [ ] .

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I think the time has come now; three and a half years after the war for the Government to take action to ensure that the Tamil people living in the North and the East are able to live in peace, are able to live with self-respect and dignity, not with the sense of inferiority because that is fundamental to reconciliation. If there has to be reconciliation in this country between the different ethnic communities and if such reconciliation is fundamental to progress in this country, it is also fundamental that we must be able to live as equals with self-respect and dignity with our rights restored. The way I have been treated in this House today, Sir, does not inspire such confidence.

So, this is my plea, Sir. We want all these army occupied territories including the new housing that is coming up to be abandoned, not to be used for military purposes. We make that request on the Floor of this House as we are entitled to because these are deliberate efforts to alter the demographic composition of these areas by enhancing the strength of the military by bringing those families into the North and the East and settling them there. When the army cultivates various lands in such large extents with different types of crops, when these armed forces are demobilized, they will have their houses, develop the lands from which they can eke out their existence. They will have their livelihood made out and they will become permanent residents of the North and the East. There is a programme that is presently happening, that is being very diligently executed by the Government and we would earnestly urge that this be brought to an end. I thank you, Sir.

This Government has no mechanism to engage the TNA. This is not a good omen for the future. It is the responsibility of the Government to pursue its initiatives to create understanding and move from absence of war to the creation of a lasting peace. Talking is a prerequisite. Following a unilateral policy on reconciliation has never worked in history and will never work in this country. It is a contradiction of terms. Reconciliation has to be between two parties who have to be reconciled. We have to reconcile communities, not just soldiers and the community. The primary responsibility for reconciliation lies with us, the politicians, the Government, the communities, the civil society and then, with the soldiers. The soldiers have fulfilled their duty. It is the Government; it is Parliament that must fulfil its duty to move from absence of war to creating a peaceful and lasting society.

( ) (The Chairman) () .

[11.53 a.m.] ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Weerasekara) Mr. Chairman, first of all, let me speak a few words in English to respond to the Hon. R. Sampanthan and also to the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne, who just spoke. I am glad that I can speak just after them. The Hon. Sampanthan stated that the army must not subjugate or persecute the Tamil people. I think, Mr. Chairman, that is the most treacherous statement that I have ever heard. Of course, he was not speaking to this House but he was speaking to the world media and also to the United Nations Human Rights Council.

I must ask the TNA as to who did persecute the Tamil people and who did subjugate the Tamil people? Was it the army or was it the LTTE? I ask the TNA, who killed the Hon. A. Amirthalingam? Who killed Mr. Kumar Ponnambalam? Who killed the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar and who killed the Hon. Neelan Tiruchelvam? Who killed Mr. Alfred Durayappah and who killed the principals of Tamil schools who objected to Prabhakaran? Did the TNA speak a single word about them? The TNA kept mum; they condoned those atrocities and murders. Now, they are speaking about the Tamil people. The TNA was always telling that the LTTE was not a terrorist organization but freedom fighters. But, I must tell you, Mr. Chairman, freedom fighters never kill the very people whose freedom they fought for. Tamil people have been killed and the TNA always condoned, accepted and kept mum.

I also ask, Sir, who cleared the land for the displaced Tamil people to come and resettle after the war? The soldiers sacrificd their lives; they risked their lives and removed about 500,000 anti-personnel mines, about 1,400 anti-tank mines and about 400,000 improvised explosive devices risking their lives. Did the TNA give a single cup of tea to these soldiers who sacrificed their lives and risked their lives to remove those landmines and the anti-personnel mines? It was the soldiers who are even now building the houses. Did the TNA build a single house for the displaced Tamil people? Now, they are talking big about the Tamil people.

I must also tell you, Sir, that the maintenance of law and order of the Jaffna Peninsula has been the duty of the police force. Now, action has been taken to recruit more than 1,000 Tamil youth and by that, we are in the process of winning the hearts and minds of the Tamil people. The TNA, of course, do not like that. I must tell the TNA very

2961 2962

2012 07

firmly in this House to refrain from instigating the university students to get into these nefarious activities. The TNA were the people who instigated the students to light lamps and commemorate Prabhakaran. Prabhakaran was the leader of the most ruthless terrorist organization in the world. Prabhakaran killed about 37 novice monks in broad daylight at Aranthalawa. They killed innocent women at Sri Maha Bodhi. They killed about 300 Muslim people during a prayer in Kattankudi. They killed 57 people in Gonagala, while they were returning from a sermon. The TNA was instigating the innocent university students to commemorate such a terrorist leader. The TNA must stop using these university students to achieve its diabolical and treacherous objectives.

I must also tell the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne and the Hon. R. Sampanthan, who are lobbying the idea of talking to the TNA, that the TNA is the other arm of the LTTE; we know that. We have very comprehensively defeated the LTTE. So, after defeating the LTTE, talking to the TNA is just like Winston Churchill talking to the Nazis after the World War II. So, it is ridiculous and hilarious. Therefore, the Government has made room in the Parliamentary Select Committee for the TNA to come and express its views with the other parties. There is no need for the Government to talk to the TNA, which had been the other arm of the LTTE.

2012 07

[1.28 p.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir, for affording me this opportunity to speak on the Votes of a Ministry that swallows up 15 per cent of the Budget Estimate and a Ministry whose Secretary was mentioned so many times during the course of the Discussion. This is the second week of the Committee Stage Discussion of the Budget Debate and I cannot remember any other Ministry Secretary being so fortunate as to get so many honourable mentions in the House. Perhaps, the sibling relationship that this secretary has affords him this special privilege.

The Hon. Leader of the House, in his speech, stated that people are complaining about the massive estimate allocated to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development, but he said that most of it goes for the salaries of the service personnel. This is not correct. The maximum that can go for salaries of service personnel is Rs. 60 billion. The Total Esstimate for this Ministry is Rs. 289 billion. Even if you look at the Recurrent Expenditure of Rs. 248 billion, still it is only one fourth. If you look at the salary figures given in the Budget Estimate, it is Rs. 173 billion, still, it is one third. So, it is wrong to say that most of the sums allocated to this Ministry goes for the salaries of service personnel.

Secondly, I want to touch upon a matter that our Party Leader spoke on in this morning. He referred to an incident in the University of Jaffna and consequent events. One of the consequent events that have taken place is that, apart from the four university students who were arrested - one has been released and three are still in custody - more than 10 others have been arrested in the last three days under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.- [Interruption.] Most of them are persons who are said to have been rehabilitated and released.

I see that the Hon. Member from Galle came running into the Chamber as I started speaking. I do the reverse: when he speaks I go out, but he comes running into the Chamber. Thank you, very much.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Obviously. I came running into the Chamber because you say untruths in this House. That is why I came.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You are the monitor, not only of the Ministry of External Affairs but also of the speeches made in this House.

So, these arrests are not good; I say this for a reason. This is almost like replaying what we had in the 1970s and that is not good.There is a cycle that is happening.

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Ratwatte) The law of the land. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, the Hon. Member of Parliament from Kandy, who sits behind us, is now on that side, talking about the law of the land.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) We are on the same side. - [Interruption.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am going to speak about the law of the land in a moment. So, please be patient and listen.

Sir, I am pleading with the Government; I am urging the Government to please reconsider this high-handed approach to the Tamil youth.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Can I ask one question please?

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Please listen to me. - [Interruption.] First, listen to me. This is exactly - [Interruption.] Will you let me speak? This is exactly what the extremists want. - [Interruption.] Mr. Presiding Member, you will have to control this House.

a ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, please let him speak. You carry on, Hon. Member.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) This is exactly what the extremists want and that is why I am urging the Government to reconsider what you are doing because if there is a high-handed approach, you are playing into the hands of the extremists, who want to bring about a tense situation again.

2983 2984

( ) (The Hon. Lohan Ratwatte) You all are the ones who are making that situation.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) We have been pleading with people who are extremists to be reasonable and we have repeatedly said in this House and elsewhere that this issue must be resolved before we have a replay of events. It is in that spirit, not in a spirit of confrontation that I am again pleading with the Government to please reconsider this move where you go on an arrest-spree and detain them under that draconian piece of legislation called the "Prevention of Terrorism Act" for long periods of time. This is not good for the country. You have done a very good deed by rehabilitating them and releasing them. So, please do not undo all the good that you have done so far.

The other issue is also one of great concern to us, that of military rule. The Hon. Member was heard to talk about the Rule of Law. We do not want military rule in any part of the country, be it LTTE rule or even Sri Lankan Army rule. We want civilian rule.

a ( ) (An Hon. Member) That is the Sri Lankan rule; there is no Sri Lankan Army rule.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Exactly. We do not want the army rule, but there is a military rule that is being imposed on our people and that is to be avoided. It is true that during the time when the war was on, there were certain necessities, but now it is three and a half years later, enough time to have changed the situation. It is not necessary to continue in that high-handed fashion. We are not going to achieve any reconciliation if it goes on like this.

Coming on to the Rule of Law, I want to -

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Ah! You the authority of the Rule of Law. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) No, no, I want to read the concepts of some authorities, not mine. I quote from A.V. Dicey's The Law of the Constitution. These books are available in the Library. So, those of you who can read, can read these

books please. - [Interruption.] For your benefit, I will read certain portions of it, enough for you to digest for the day.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Let us peacefully digest Dicey. But, what you are trying to do is to digest the country.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) This is what it says about the principle of the Rule of Law, I quote:

The supremacy of the law of the land was not a novel doctrine in the 19th century. It may be traced back to the medieval notion that law, whether it be law ordained by God or by man, ought to rule the world. So, that is the Rule of Law and that is why our own Constitution also has very specifically, even in the Preamble, talked about the Rule of Law. It states that it is a fundamental principle, the Rule of Law. It is on that bedrock that democracy exists.

Several mentions have been made in this House in the last couple of weeks with regard to the sovereignty of the people. In our Constitution, the people are sovereign. It is not the Parliament that is sovereign; it is the people who are sovereign. This is different to the British concept. - [Interruption.] The British concept is that the Parliament is sovereign. In fact, A.V. Dicey says that in Britain, the Parliament means three things: the King, the House of Lords and the House of Commons. All these three things together is called the Parliament and the essence of the supremacy or the sovereignty of Parliament is that it can make any law whatever and unmake law and that is what we call the legislative supremacy of Parliament.

In this country also, Parliament has the legislative supremacy, but certain -

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) You cannot interpret the Constitution. That is not your job. You may do that in the Supreme Court. That is a different matter. But, the supremacy of the House -

a ( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) There is nothing called the supremacy of this House. That is where you are going wrong. - [Interruption.] There is a legislative supremacy of Parliament.

2985 2986

2012 07

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) That is exactly what you want; the supremacy of this House abolished.

a ( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! Let the Hon. Member speak. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) There is no supremacy of Parliament. That is a wrong notion. Not even in England, now. - [Interruption.]

a ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please do not disturb. - [Interruption.] Let him speak. You can answer later. - [Interruption.] You can answer later.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) He has taken an Oath to uphold the Constitution. a ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, you can answer later.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) A hundred years ago, that concept went out. - [Interruption.] In the Eighth Edition of A.V. Dicey's book, that was in 1855, he talks about the sovereignty of Parliament. - [Interruption.] But, after the Parliament Act in the UK in 1911, in the 1914 Edition, before he died at the age of 92, he retraced it and said that the concept of Parliamentary supremacy was outdated even in England. That was in 1911. - [Interruption.] A hundred years ago in England, the situation had changed. - [Interruption.] But, in Sri Lanka, in the 1972 Constitution, we did have the notion of Parliamentary supremacy or the legislative supremacy of Parliament. In the 1978 Constitution, for the first time, the issue of Referendum had been - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. a ( ) (The Presiding Member) A point of Order is being raised by the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Sir, are we getting a lesson in constitutional affairs or are we discussing the Votes of the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development? He must -

a ( ) (The Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, that is not a point of Order. - [Interruption.]

a ( ) (The Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Sumanthiran, you continue with your speech.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) In our Constitution, we have two concepts. - [Interruption.]

a ( ) (The Presiding Member) Please, let the Hon. Member speak. - [Interruption.] No, no, it is not a point of Order. Hon. Member, go on with your speech.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) One is, the Rule of Law and the other is, separation of powers. If Parliament is supreme in the legislative sphere, the Judiciary is supreme in another sphere. Even in England, the concept of legislative supremacy came about through interpretations of courts. In our Constitution, in Article 125, that has been very clearly laid down, that it is only the Judiciary - that too, only by the apex court, the Supreme Court - that has the sole and exclusive jurisdiction to interpret the Constitution.

When the concept of Referendum was brought in to our 1978 Constitution - it was not there in the 1972 Constitution - why was that brought in? It was brought in because the powers of Parliament were limited. Even by a two-thirds majority, you cannot change certain things in the Constitution. - [Interruption.] You can change it only by, additionally, going directly to the people and getting their consent at a Referendum. That is what we have, these entrenched Articles in the Constitution. The point that I am making is, in the First Republican Constitution, you could make any law; you did not have to get the consent of the people at a Referendum.

2987 2988

a ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Okay, Sir. But now, under the Second Republican Constitution that we live under, the power of Parliament has been restricted because you cannot change or make laws contrary to certain entrenched provisions. You have to go directly to the people because the people are sovereign, not Parliament. People have delegated their sovereignty to be exercised through three modes of governance: one has been given to Parliament and the other has been given to the President. - [Interruption.] The President is also elected directly by the people, but that does not mean that the Executive is supreme. Parliament is elected by the people; the President is directly elected by the people. You cannot say that Parliament is supreme over the other two institutions merely because it is elected by the people or that merely because the President is elected by the people that he is supreme over the other two institutions. - [Interruption.]

a ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please conclude your speech now.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I am concluding my speech. - [Interruption.] These are three parallel institutions that operate under the concept of separation of powers and unless we function in that way, the whole system will collapse.

Thank you very much.

We all like this city to be clean. We all like it to be beautiful. I thank Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Secretary, Ministry of Defence and Urban Development. I agree that he is doing a good job. But, what I am saying is, there are two sides to the story. So, you must consider the other side also. Just because you have the gun, just because you have the backhoe, do not come to peoples homes and crush their houses and throw them out on the street.

Development. The Members of the Opposition have to understand that. The TNA Members criticize the armed forces saying that they are against the Tamil people. We cannot accept that because we know the history. In 1971, the armed forces fought against the JVP. Again in 1985, 1986 and 1987, they fought against the LTTE and the JVP simultaneously. The armed forces are not there only to fight against the LTTE. These are the matters the Hon. Members of TNA have to understand. They have to understand as to why we need the military; they are there to safeguard our people and our nation. That is what we have to appreciate.

At the same time, I really appreciate His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa. According to my knowledge, if we want to win a war, three factors are very important. The first factor is decision-making; the second factor is planning and the third factor is implementation. Mostly, decision-making originates from the political leaders, leaders of the nation or the politicians. That is why His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa took a strong decision to destroy terrorism through military ways. He met with a lot of problems. Even he faced a lot of opposition internally and a lot of pressure internationally. But, he never obeyed. He took a strong decision to destroy the LTTE through military ways. That is why he appointed a talented secretary, Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, to the Ministry of Defence. He had a proper plan to destroy the LTTE. He knew when to start the war and implemented ways accordingly. He gave powers to the three Forces, especially to the Army. They carried it out properly. That is how we won the war. That is why we have to appreciate His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and the officers of the three Forces.

But, behind the scene, there is much sorrow. Officers of the armed forces lost their lives. They are living without legs, without eyes, et cetera. They are suffering a lot. But, now we are developing the country. Especially the army personnel are supporting to develop our country and to resettle the displaced people. We are doing a lot of development. Also, we deployed more than 2,000 army personnel to remove the landmines in those areas. During that time also, they met with a lot of accidents. They lost their legs. Why did the Opposition not talk about those things? The TNA Members are shouting saying that the army people are doing this and that

I especially appreciate Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, because at the last Eastern Provincial Councils Election, he ordered the army not to come out for two days within the election period. So, the last Eastern Provincial Council Election was held in a very peaceful manner. There were no army personnel on the streets. So, we have to appreciate the army and His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Thank you.

[5.05 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran - Deputy Minister of Resettlement) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman, for giving me this opportunity to discuss the Votes of the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development. First of all, I would discuss the role played by the Ministry of Defence, as to why it is important. A lot of Members of the Opposition are not here to listen to my explanation. They, including the TNA, misled the House and went out.

Sir, there are many security measures taken under the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development. One is, military security. It deals with the protection and safeguard of the nation. The other is the political security. It deals with the stability of the social order; it specifically addresses the threats to the sovereignty of the nation. The other is the economical security which I do not want to explain more as everybody understands it.

We have to especially appreciate the role played by the armed forces. The Members of the TNA are not here. They are misleading this House. As we see today, Indian fishermen are entering into our waters. They are stealing our commercial fish catch; they are catching fish in our waters. The Sri Lanka Navy is blocking them and are saving our sea area. The Sri Lanka Navy has given the opportunity to the Tamil people to catch fish. Especially, people of Jaffna, Mullaitivu and Mannar get the benefits of those security measures. That is the importance of economical security. When the British came to Sri Lanka, they stole our gems, our tea and a lot of resources. That happened due to lack of economical security.

The other is the environmental security. Environmental security deals with environmental issues which threatens the security of the nation. For example, the problem that we face now - even the people in Tamil Nadu oppose it - is the nuclear power plant built by the Indian Government near our Island. The Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant may affect our country one day. Those kind of issues are related to environmental security. The Members of the Opposition have to understand what the security measures are, but they are not here to listen to my explanation.

The other security measure deals with energy and natural resources. Those resources include water, sources of energy, land and minerals. Adequate natural resources are important for a nation to develop its industries and the economic power. There is this example of the war between Iraq and Kuwait. Iraq went to capture Kuwait because they wanted to take the oil reserves there. We also have oil resources, we have already found it out. We need security measures for that. Those are the measures taken under the Ministry of Defence and Urban
