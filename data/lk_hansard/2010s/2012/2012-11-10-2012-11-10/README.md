( ) (Mr. Speaker) There is a point of Order being raised. Yes, Hon. Member, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) When a Question is asked in Parliament, it has to be answered. At the COPE, you can say that you cannot answer it. But, in Parliament, what is going on must be revealed to the public. Sir, we have the majority of shares, 51 per cent, in this. So, my Colleague wants to know what is going on. At COPE, you can tell, "do not ask" but in Parliament, you must highlight what is going on. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , . , .

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) , .

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . .

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, I have two matters to raise. The first matter is, we would like to know whether a magisterial inquiry will be held and the police officers who will be investigating because, as the Hon. Minister said, a lot of issues, like how they got access to the weapons and why such a large number of people have died, would arise. So, you will have to have a separate or a special police unit on which people have confidence because they will have to produce evidence before the magistrate. The coroner can give the reasons for the deaths now, but I would ask the Government to ensure that they have a special police unit and some of the senior members of the Prisons Department - unfortunately, the Commissioners are no longer taken from the Prisons Department - are also involved in it.

Hon. Speaker, the second matter is a different inquiry. As you are aware, a Resolution under Article 107 (2) of the Constitution has been given in respect of the Chief Justice and the House today, is in exercise of its judicial functions. Unfortunately, some of the media have been making various insinuations. I have got one in the DailyFT which states that either I have some grudge against the Chief Justice on the Eighteenth Amendment or I am talking with the President and so many other matters. Now, as far as I and my party are concerned, this is a judicial matter on which we are not going to comment. We should not be asked to comment. This is not normal like the Budget and media can always write whether it is good or bad, even the DailyFT. I have no specific grudge against the Chief Justice in regard to the Eighteenth Amendment. But, I have been a vocal critic of the Supreme Court for what, I say, has been to the fact that they have taken away the fundamental rights of the people. Others may disagree but on that I stand and similarly, I have also praised the Supreme Court for certain judgments like the Appropriation Bill and the Z-score. I think it is best if the media will stop bothering us asking as to why we are voting for or against on anything. We still have not decided the procedure. For that, we are meeting you only on Monday. So, I think you will have to make a statement. I will criticize the Supreme Court like I criticize the DailyFT for not talking about the Krrish building, covering it up and for not putting facts

outside. So, if they do not do their duty, it is useless asking us. But, media can comment as to what they have to do without talking about the position of the person concerned, the Chief Justice or any other persons who have been mentioned.

I have found that the Daily News - I will send a copy of that to you - has been stating that the Chief Justice is guilty. They are not to take over our job before we have done that. So, I think you will have to warn the media; tell them to correct it and lay down some guidelines till we finish this. Otherwise, media would become a nuisance to us. Let them say what they have to say. There is no need for them to be asking us.

His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa has spent more than all of those people. If you add all the money spent by the leaders starting from the Right Hon. D.S. Senanayake to Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa has allocated more money to the North. I am a person who is involved in Northern politics from the 1970s. So, I will tell you that no President has spent so much of money for the North and the East, like His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

There are other problems, we will settle those. You can come to the Select Committee and sort out all those problems. We also can come there and give our opinions. We will get together and help His Excellency the President to sort out those problems.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Presiding Member, it gives me pleasure to speak today on the Budget for 2013.

Before me, the Hon. Minister of Labour and Labour Relations spoke and before him, there were three speakers who dwelt on the issue of provincial councils, whether they will exist or not. The Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathan asked for confirmation whether the provincial councils will exist. This issue has come up because two of your senior Ministers, the Hon. Wimal Weerawansa and the Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, have been going around saying that provincial councils

597 598

[ ]

2012 10

should be abolished; the Thirteenth Amendment should be repealed. So, while this is going on, His Excellency the President, who is also the Minister of Finance and Planning, comes to this House and creates further confusion. Without understanding that, I think we should not go forward. I will read from the Budget Speech of the Hon. Minister of Finance and Planning, which states, I quote:

A change in the prevailing Provincial Council system is necessary to make devolution more meaningful to our people. Devolution should not be a political reform that will lead us to separation but instead it should be one that unifies all of us.

Then, he goes on to say, I quote:

"It should not involve high spending and complex governance structures

That means, he is calling it a white elephant. It is like saying, this is not worth keeping.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) That is your interpretation -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, you have to infer from the speech that the Hon. Minister of Finance and Planning has made.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) That is a new one.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) He has said that it should not be governance structures that would be expensive. But, he goes on to say, I quote:

Everybody who met me from all corners of Sri Lanka, whether they were Tamils, Muslims or Sinhalese, asked for greater access to education, health, employment opportunities, better living and equal standards across the nation.

So, the people are asking for bread and butter, not for more political power is what he conveys from that. When you say "people are not asking for political power", that means, political power that is available through the provincial councils, which he describes as a white elephant, is not necessary for the future. That is what we infer from this. So, the confusion created by your Ministers is further confounded by the President himself. So, there is a doubt in the minds of the Tamil people. That is why the Hon. Sumanthiran, who spoke yesterday and the Hon. Adaikkalanathan, who spoke today, raised this issue. The Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, who has always

stood up for devolution, said, We will not allow it to be abolished. We accept and appreciate that statement. If the Government could state, We are against whatever our two Ministers are saying. Those are only their personal views. The view of this Government is to have the provincial council system" and it is promised to the international community, that the Thirteenth Amendment and the provincial council system will be further developed to go towards the so-called 'Thirteen Plus' , then we would rest assured that you have no designs on the provincial council system. It is unfortunate that the Hon. V.S. Radhakrishnan, who represents the Up-Country Peoples Front of the late Hon. P. Chandrasekaran, comes to this House and says, "We do not mind changing the names. Okay, they will give you Pradeshiya Sabas instead of provincial councils". Are you willing to accept?

Do not give room for reduction of the powers of provincial councils. It is very important that provincial councils be further strengthened, so that you assure that the issues of the people are attended to the way they wish; the issues of the minorities are left to them to attend to the way they would prefer in their regions. If you are not willing to concede this equality, we can have a situation of no war, but we cannot achieve a situation of peace in this country. So, please take this into consideration, please take the sensitivities of the minorities in this country into consideration before you go further.

Then, I wish to talk about the plantations, which I think I should do in the Tamil language.

In 1992, the late Hon. Ranasinghe Premadasa, by a special Ordinance, brought a rule that the minimum wage should be increased up to Rs. 2,000. At that time, according to the cost of living, that was considered a fair wage. Like that, why is the Government not intervening in the issue of fixing wages for the private sector? . . ( . . ) (The Hon. H.R. Mithrapala) In 1992, nationalized lands were given back to the companies.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes, that is true. We were part and parcel of it. Do you know why? At that time, the Government felt that they have no money to reinvest. - [Interruption.] We did not give it up; we did it under certain conditions. At that time, the Government of Ranasinghe Premadasa agreed that all wage increases proposed by the Budget would be extended to the plantation workers also. But, the Chandrika Bandaranaike Government in 1994 refused to follow the principle that was set. So, we were also taken for a ride.

Today, the plantations are existing because they was privatized. If it had continued under JEDB or SLSPC, we can imagine what the situation would have been. Today, the JEDB and the SLSPC, with the few estates that they are managing, have to pay over Rs. 3 billion as EPF of each of those corporations. So, if they had all the 20 companies with them, it would have been Rs. 60 billion or more. So, privatization was the only way to save the plantation industry at that time in 1992 and that was why we opted for it. Today, the companies are not doing their job. You are trying to give them foreign loans. But, I am glad that the Government has recognized that these companies are not looking after the workers and that is the reason why you have put a condition that only those who conform to proper corporate social responsibility would be given loans from foreign agencies.

This Government has put forward a proposal on housing needs and it only talks about urban housing. Is urban housing the only issue in this country today? Urban housing is directed towards eviction of people from the city so that that land can be grabbed and given to foreigners. It is not targeted towards the people who are living there. If you are interested in looking after the peoples housing needs, then you should provide housing for them not only in urban areas but even in rural areas. This has not been done. In plantation areas, people have been living in line rooms for over 100 years and some of them for 160 years.

If you can give us seven perches, we are willing to build our own houses. The plantation workers are today confident enough to say that they are not expecting any funds from the Government; they are willing to build their own houses. They all are workers who are having EPF accounts.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) You do not want houses for the estate workers.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, we will build our houses. Give us the land, we will find our own money. You have not given any houses. During the last four years, this Government has built only - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Yogarajan, you continue. - [Interruption.] Hon. Sri Ranga, you may explain your position during your speech.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Minister, in December last year, the Minister of Labour brought a piece of legislation, which was recommended by the National Labour Advisory Council. It said that any worker who has been a member of the EPF for more than 10 years can withdraw up to one-third of the balance lying to his credit in the EPF for the purpose of building a house or for medical treatment. It is almost one year today but still the circular has not been issued by the Ministry of Labour. When we ask the Minister of Labour, he says he has not been given permission by the Treasury to issue the circular. Maybe the Government fears that when people withdraw money from the EPF to build their own houses, the Government will collapse. Why? You are living on EPF money and your share market mafia is also living on EPF money. - [Interruption.]

609 610

2012 10

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) That money is for their welfare and for their own social security.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, you brought in a law, saying that they can borrow up to one-third of that to build their own houses. If they take their money and build their houses today - [Interruption.] You know last year -

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) If they withdraw their EPF, when they retire they do not get a cent.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No. What they want at the end of their life is to -

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) When they retire they do not get a cent.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Minister, we know that.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) So, why are you doing that?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) No, we are not doing anything wrong. - [Interruption.]No, I will tell you; give me a chance. I will explain to you. - [Interruption.] I will explain to you. When you take your EPF - [Interruption.] Please give me a chance. When you take one-third of the EPF to build your house, you have the balance for your life. That is how it is done. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) That will be expunged.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Let us uphold the dignity of the House. - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Hon. Minister, what I am saying is, if they take one-third of the money, if they get the money and build a

house today, it would cost maybe Rs. 3 lakhs or Rs. 4 lakhs. But, after 10 years, he will need, maybe Rs. 10 lakhs to build a house. That is why you brought this Law. It is a good piece of legislation. The price of cement last year was -

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) What happened was, we saw that some people go without any money after they retire. Even the interest itself has gone up.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) I understand. I am with you.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) Our plan is for the Government to build houses for the estate sector.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) It is not going to happen.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) Do not stop that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) During the last seven years of your Government, you have built only 4,600 houses.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) Yes, we have built at least 4,600 houses. You did not build any house. Even from the Indian housing project, we have given 5,000 houses. So, within the next two years we will be building more than 10,000 houses.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Those are all dreams, Hon. Minister. In the "Mahinda Chintana", you said you will build 50,000 houses in three years. But, even in seven years, you have built only 4,600 houses. For seven years 4,600 houses means it is less than 700 per year. The Hon. V.S. Radhakrishnan spoke here and said that there is a need for houses, two lakhs in the plantations. So, if you take at the rate of 700 houses per year, it will take 300 years for you to complete this task. We are offering to build our own houses. Give us lands.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne - Minister of Productivity Promotion) How many houses did you build when you were in the Government? - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, we went to meet the Mayor of the Kurunegala Municipal Council and asked him that the line rooms used by the workers in the Municipal Council be given to the workers. Then, the Mayor asked my leader, You know, 50 per cent of my workers are your Tamil people and 50 per cent are Sinhala workers. The Sinhala worker who comes to work at the age of 20, builds a house before he gets married. Why are your people for generations asking for these line rooms built by the Municipal Council? My leader answered saying, In a village, a father has a plot of land. He gives 10 perches each to his four children. They build their houses. My people do not have land. That is why they are unable to build. That is what I am asking you. Give us land. We will somehow endeavour to build our houses.

I thank the Hon. Minister for making this offer and I accept the challenge. We will do it and show you. Thank you very much. [. . 3.10] () ( ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Mervyn Silva - Minister of Public Relations and Public Affairs) " "

[3.55 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, I am elated and humbly honoured to participate in yet another Budget Debate and for the twenty-first time in this Parliament - and that too on the eighth Budget presented by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa in this House.

Sir, this is a social welfare Budget. I describe this as a Budget of "milk and honey" because this eighth consecutive Budget presented to Parliament by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, provides for the extension of subsidies to dairy and poultry products. Also, farmers can now tap kitul trees and obtain treacle and produce jaggery from it without having to obtain a permit - thus it is sweet and milk. That is what the Budget has given us.

There is also the humanitarian gesture of our President in entertaining poor children at his official "Temple Trees" residence, talking to them and giving them gifts and taking them around the gardens where the veggies are grown. The Presidents observation of some children with worn-out shoes - and some of them without shoes - prompted him to provide for a pair of shoes and an additional free uniform to poor children through this Budget. The President has decidedly focused on the lowest strata of society as the Father of the Nations Children.

The farmers revolutionary proposals to increase rice production have been addressed, especially those who are Sinhala, Tamil and even Muslims hailing from the Eastern Provincial granary which is called the Rice Bowl of the East.

The plight of those poor 1980 July strikers have been alleviated by providing them with a stipend of Rs. 5,000 a month, while Government servants gain an income increase of Rs. 1,500 per month. Sir, I recall the day when the present Governor of the Western Province, "Jamal-al-Lail" Seyed Alavi Moulana who was battered down. He is a good friend of the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena - he was watching the scene from a distance - I believe Moulana was attacked with bicycle chains. Today, he is being hailed as one of the leaders of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Trade Unions holding the post of the Governor for over the last 12 years. As a result of the agitation, 14 strikers committed suicide.

I, being an erstwhile media man, am extremely overjoyed and thank the President for having extended concessions to media personnel by way of bank loans to purchase duty-free cars. I am of the firm belief that they

629 630

should also be provided with laptop computers, which is essential for practising their profession more efficiently. I must also place on record in this House that the media personnel who cover the proceedings of this House have been doing a very efficient job, but at times they must exercise balanced reporting. I hope that they will certainly take note of this.

There has been a reference made in this House to the Impeachment Motion that is before the House.

I was - you were also there, Sir - in Islamabad participating at the Sixth Conference of the Association of SAARC Speakers and Parliamentarians last week. There, I picked up a Pakistan newspaper called the "INTERNATIONAL - THE NEWS". What does it state? The supremacy of Parliament has to be maintained. The Parliament is very supreme. Nobody can challenge it. The Chief Justice very unethically, out of professional ethics has gone public to say that she rejects all the charges made against her. What right has she got to do that? She has already exonerated her own self.

Parliament is the supreme institution". Who says this?

This is an article that appeared on page 12 of the "INTERNATIONAL - THE NEWS" of 7th November, 2012 which states, I quote:

"Minister for Information and Broadcasting Qamar Zaman Kaira Tuesday said that it was encouraging to see that all the institutions were keeping the Constitution in high esteem.

That is in Pakistan. We too do the same thing. Nobody can challenge us. We are elected by the people. The

President is elected by the people. Therefore, the people have mandated the President to govern this country. Our Constitution allows certain impeachment motions. That is a right guranteed to the Members of Parliament by the Constitution.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have to wind up your speech. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I will wind up. It further states, I quote:

The minister said that the statements of the chief justice and army chief were not against each other. Kaira said the Constitution was marginalised by some actors of the past and now it was basic reference for all the institutions.

Listen to this, Sir:

To another question he said that Parliament was the supreme institution in the country as it represents the will of the people. There is no doubt that the Supreme Court is the apex court in the country, but when we talk about supreme institution,

Parliament is the supreme institution as per constitution, he said.

We also say the same thing in Sri Lanka.

Then, I will read the headline of todays "Daily News". It states, I quote:

More accounts, in face of denials by CJ.

A lot of other things are coming out now. Therefore, upholding the dignity of the great post in the Judiciary is essential. Let her uphold the decorum in her capacity as the Chief Justice.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have to wind up your speech now. You have exceeded your time.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I will wind my speech, Sir, by saying this. I also feel sorry because I have been a signatory to the appointment of the present Chief Justice. As a Member of the Parliamentary Council, I also gave my affirmation. Today, I feel ashamed and sorry that I did that because she has proved that she had lost the confidence of the Judiciary.

An article which appeared in todays "Daily News" also states, I quote:

Section of BASL lawyers oppose convening of meeting.

635 636

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have to wind up your speech now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I do not want to read the whole report. I table* it to be included in Hansard.

Let us realize our own responsibilities, our rights and conduct our business. The Legislature is supreme. Let the Judiciary do its business. Then, we all can build up a healthy, good, vibrant and a democratic nation in this country.

Thank you, Sir.
