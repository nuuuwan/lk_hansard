... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Speaker, I am thankful to you for giving me this opportunity. In support of the Hon. Lalith Dissanayake

and the Hon. Arundika Fernando, I would like to quote Article 4 (c) of the Constitution, which states:

the judicial power of the People shall be exercised by Parliament through courts, tribunals and institutions created and established, or recognized, by the Constitution, or created and established by law, except in regard to matters relating to the privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament and of its Members, wherein the judicial power of the People may be exercised directly by Parliament according to law ;

Therefore, no other alien power can dictate terms to you or to the House. Sir, I can do nothing better than quote from "Erskine May", the greatest authority in this regard. Under "Introduction" in "Part 1- Constitution, Powers and Privileges of Parliament", it states, I quote:

"But most Parliamentary procedure and usage derives from the admitted right of each House to regulate its own proceedings, a right which led a former Clerk of the Commons to observe, 'What does it signify about precedents? The House can do what it likes. Who can stop it?' "

That is your power, Hon. Speaker, and the supremacy of Parliament. Therefore, Sir, nobody has the right to dictate terms to you from outside. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) . . .

2012 04

Sir, with the expansion of urban activities, the Colombo Metropolitan region has the highest spatial boundary as a region which is a classic example of development as well as the complexity of urban form. The Hambantota Harbour and the Mattala Airport create more urban areas in the southern area and the Southern Expressway linking Hambantota and Colombo-Katunayake Expressway will develop the suburbs, specially based on 11 major interchanges.

In the same way, the "Eastern Revival", and the Northern area development will create more urban centres within the next decade. Sri Lanka has a definite trend of urbanization and urban development all over the country. In this situation, it can easily convert this development into an ad hoc situation if there is no proper management of land uses through promotional and controlling mechanism.

Urban area related issues are common to any country. Every country faces similar problems with the achievement of developed levels, but the continuation of the same problems shows the management issues and negative attention to the ground level situation. Sri Lanka has been facing this problem for a long time especially with the commercial capital, Colombo. The urbanization trend and increase of services within the core areas of the town, create lots of congestion, pollution and many socio-economic issues such as those related to haphazard development and management issues with the institutional setup. But, when we analyse the informal developments in Colombo and other urban areas, integration of all these factors, institutional deficiency, loopholes in the legal system as well as attitudinal problems of the people can be seen. This happens with the land use changes in urban areas. Unless corrective action is taken on a systematically planned basis, the following can be expected to manifest in several ways:

1. Encroachment on available state lands which will include environmentally sensitive areas by causing severe adverse effects;

2. Encroachment on the urban periphery, which is extending even to available private lands;

3. Further fragmentation of agricultural land, either by private-sector developers or by the state sector, where necessary, through procedures by the enforcement of the Land Acquisition Act irrespective of appropriate urban development in terms of plans which deal with the ad hoc land development;

4. Unplanned urban expansion - urban sprawl.

Traffic congestion in main arteries, road accidents, insufficient road width for increasing vehicle population, poor traffic management systems are some problems related to road infrastructure. Also vehicular emissions, Green House Gases - GHGs - create air pollution and urban heat islands which has a heavy impact on urban areas.

The Colombo City is facing this problem and this has made Colombo the fourth worst city to stay in the international arena. High density population is one reason for this problem. Average population density in Sri Lanka is about 300 persons per square kilometre, but it is 2,000 persons per square kilometre in the Colombo City. This very high population density not only creates transport and other infrastructure issues, but also socio-economic problems related to health and education.

The problem of solid waste which has developed to crisis proportions in the City of Colombo and its suburbs, and traffic congestion coupled with an alarming rate of accidents within and outside the City need appropriate planning solutions on a priority basis. The other problems that need planning solutions comprise unauthorized constructions which lead to noise, air and water pollution; slums, shanties and poor housing conditions and unemployment, poverty and environmental degradation.

With the increase of the population in Sri Lanka, congestion in the urban areas increased which resulted in the increase of slums and unauthorized occupants, pollution of the environment, blocked drainage systems and low standard roads, which have been identified as weak infrastructure facilities. In addition, bringing the North and the East areas, which were subjected to 30 years of terrorism, towards a rapid economic development has become a special function of the Government. For this purpose, providing basic infrastructure facilities, constructing houses, building proper rain water drain systems, developing a proper strategy for disposing of garbage which has created numerous problems et cetera constitute main investment programmes.

As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Urban Industry under the Divineguma Programme of the Ministry of Economic Development, I was able to extend a valuable contribution participating in various exhibitions and programmes organized jointly by the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development, islandwide.

We have conducted awareness exhibitions at district level on various cottage industries, technology pertaining to them, market and training opportunities with a view to implement model programmes of establishing domestic industries under the Divineguma National Programme. These programmes and exhibitions were conducted in 24 districts.

Those exhibitions were held with a view to eradicate poverty among those living in the urban areas, through the development of entrepreneurship among them and motivate them to start their own enterprises or small industries and contribute to the development of the country. The exhibitions also provided them opportunities to market their products and create a network among them so that they can help each other to develop the business.

2281 2282

A large amount of females participated in these programmes and they were immensely benefited by the services provided for their development. Microfinance facilities were provided through local banks to develop their projects. Under this programme, 26,577 persons were recommended to receive training in entrepreneurship development and they were provided with basic raw materials and tools to enable them to start new business ventures. For the proper review of the Divineguma National Programme conducted by the Ministry of Economic Development, 25 National Operational Subcommittee meetings were held.

Hon. Chairman, as the Senior Minister for Urban Affairs, I would like to state that I am committed to solve the urban problems that I mentioned earlier in my speech in collaboration with all the relevant Government organizations, local authorities, et cetera.

My special attention is always paid to the urban poor in order to improve their quality of life. I work with Divineguma to achieve the objective of developing an entrepreneurial culture among the young people living in urban areas.

All the other Senior Ministers and myself are always committed to work along with all other Ministries for the realization of the vision of "Mahinda Chintana" that is making Sri Lanka the "Wonder of Asia.

Thank you. ( ) (The Chairman) 1.00 .

[2.02 p.m.] () ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana - Minister of Scientific Affairs) Thank you, Mr. Deputy Chairman. As the Senior Minister of Scientific Affairs, I have been entrusted with the task of coordinating and monitoring the scientific activities carried out by the various line ministries as well as the institutions within those line ministries and coordinating them with the private sector and the industrial sector to achieve maximum economic development. I am happy to say that the Cabinet has approved the National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation and also given me the power to implement that strategy using the mandate that I have as Senior Minister of Scientific Affairs.

Accordingly, the objective is to try to mobilize science, technology and innovation to achieve maximum economic development through the application of advanced technology, which is a shortcoming in our country. Countries that have forged ahead have been able to do so by incorporating advanced technology. For

2301 2302

instance, in Japan more than 85 per cent of exports are advanced high-tech products, the same with Korea - 70 per cent and Singapore - 60 per cent. In Sri Lanka, actually only 1.5 per cent of our exports include high-tech. Therefore, the emphasis should be on generating high technology within our country by promoting the effective coordination and monitoring the various scientific establishments to do the necessary research, which is focused on adding maximum value to our available raw materials and also providing the human resources, such as the researchers, the PhD holders who are required to develop the technology for this task.

So, in order to do that, I have developed a three-year project. This project has been approved by the Department of National Planning and by the Treasury. The required staff of 41 persons for this project has been approved by the Salaries and Cadre Commission and also by the DMS. Accordingly, I have worked out the estimate of the required funding and it amounts close to Rs. 100 million for each year for the three-year project. Now, I find in the Budget Proposals, only Rs. 25 million has been allocated for the next year, while Rs. 100 million each has been allocated for 2014 and for 2015. When we brought this matter up during the meeting of the Select Committee headed by the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Treasury Representative said that they were unaware that 41 appointments had been approved by the Salaries and Cadre Commission at that time.

Therefore, at the time that they made the provision, they only allocated Rs. 25 million, expecting only 10 persons to be employed. But, subsequently, when they found that there will be 41 persons employed, the Treasury agreed to provide the required amount, which is Rs. 100 million per year.

Now, as the 41 appointments have already been approved and they are now in the process of being recruited, I would request that the full allocation of Rs. 100 million be given for next year. This was accepted by the Select Committee appointed to discuss the Heads of Expenditure of Ministries selected from the Budget Estimates of 2013 and I hope that this would be included in the Budget, so that we can not only just recruit the people and they will be idling, but, we can go ahead with the programme that we have worked out. That programme involves setting up a suitable computerized setup for data collection, the recruitment of high-quality scientific personnel with experience, who can command the respect of the scientific community in various branches of activity in different Ministries, different institutions and coordinate their efforts, so that we get the maximum utilization of our limited resources to benefit our economy to identify the different value changes of our raw materials in terms of exports and accordingly develop the necessary technology and support our industrialists, so that we can have rapid economic development.

Therefore, Mr. Deputy Chairman, I request that this amount of Rs. 100 million for the year 2013 be included in the Budget for this year, so that we can go ahead with the programme of work that has been mapped out as part of this project, which has been approved by the Treasury as well as by the Department of National Planning. If this is done, then, I am sure that we can bring about the type of rapid economic development that the Budget envisages and the Mahinda Chintana envisages, where we become a country that adds maximum value to our raw materials and become a high-tech industrialized country and where we become a real generator of knowledge that will benefit our industry and make us the hub of economic development in the Region. Thank you.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Thank you very much. The next speaker is the Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathan. You have 12 minutes. Before that, the Hon. Janaka Bandara will take the Chair.

[2.22 p.m.] () ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of International Monetary Co-operation and Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning) Mr. Presiding Member, I want to say a few words about our activities, as the Minister of International Monetary Co-operation. As you know, today we live in a highly interrelated global environment. Our economy is very largely interconnected with the outside world. On the one hand, our exports are to developed countries, particularly in Europe and in America. On the other, a large number of our Sri Lankan citizens, now estimated to be 1.3 million, are working abroad and remitting in the region of US Dollars 6.5 billion a year. In addition to that, we have many regional economic co-operation activities. So, as Minister of International Monetary Co-operation, I would like to say that we have been able to link with all these multifarious organizations and to see that Sri Lanka benefits from these associations.

I will try to describe a few of those important relationships. We refer to the Bretton Woods Institutions.

2307 2308

2012 04

That is, after the Second World War, the victorious nations set up two financial institutions because they believed that the conflict which led to the Second World War was largely caused by monetary difficulties. We all know that after the Treaty of Versailles, the German economy collapsed because they had to pay huge reparations to the victorious powers. With the collapse of the German economy with rampant inflation, we saw the rise of Hitler and of fascism.

So, after the War, the victorious powers decided to set up financial mechanisms, firstly, to supervise the global financial arrangements and secondly, to see whatever assistance could be provided in case of difficulties of some economies, which would have otherwise slid into balance of payments problems, inflation and thereby, destabilized the global economy. The two institutions that were set up were the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

The International Monetary Fund has two major purposes. The first is to have a surveillance of the global economy and you have an Annual Report issued by the IMF, particularly by its economic research staff , which summarizes the global scenario in economic terms and also makes projections as to how these countries, these regions, these alliances will fare in the immediate future. I want to say that many of these reports highlighted well in time the impending economic downturn that we are facing today. So, one is surveillance. The other, of course, is to come to the assistance of countries which have balance of payments difficulties by making standby arrangements and providing financial assistance so that countries which face a dire balance of payments problem can emerge from that. There is also a certain amount of selfishness involved because if one economy collapses, particularly a large economy - for example, you can take the Greek economy, the Italian economy, the Spanish economy or now, they are talking of the French economy - then, of course, it will have wide ramifications for the whole global system.

So, the IMF has a surveillance mechanism, a predictive mechanism and also an assistance mechanism to keep a stable financial world. It works through central banks, the reserve banks and through the ministries of finance of the region. We, in particular, have benefited from that because Sri Lanka has had a standby arrangement with the IMF and we have received, over a period of time, US Dollars 2.6 billion worth of standby credit. It is one of the best programmes that the IMF has undertaken in recent times. Many other programmes of this nature, standby arrangements, have collapsed on the way. For example, Pakistan, the Maldives, Ireland, Greece, Iceland and many of these countries that had SBAs and special programmes with the IMF have not been able to go through the several steps because there is an understanding between the IMF and the countries that receive assistance.

Sri Lanka is a success. Very often there is a misunderstanding - this is very important that I must address this issue - that we are giving in to the IMF, that we are giving in to the World Bank. Sir, nothing can be further from the truth because the stance of these two institutions today is to give ownership to the countries concerned. Maybe 20 or even 10 years ago, the IMF and the World Bank had strong policy prescriptions; they had to impose conditionalities. If a country was not willing to accept those conditionalities, then they would not get that assistance. But, Sri Lanka has never had to go through that type of strong subjugation to conditionality though our Friends of the JVP and now, our Friends of the UNP have been saying that we are subject to conditions. That is not so. We have had discussions. Whether they are economists of the IMF, of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka or the Ministry of Finance, they all agree on a diagnosis of our economic problems. There is not very much variation regarding how you diagnose this problem. If you have an illness, you can go to four specialists. But, they all will probably tell you the illness which is diagnosed together by all of them. So, in Sri Lanka also, I think we must realize that these international institutions are only working together with us. So, we have got this relationship or we had this relationship while the SBA was on, and we have successfully completed that programme. US Dollars 2.6 billion came to our Central Bank and I must also clarify that we are not using that for budgetary support. It is being used as a confidence-building measure. The money is given to us and it is parked in international banks from which we get a fairly substantial interest. The most favourable terms - this is very important because as a country, we must try to get the most favourable terms - of course, are the grants. Some countries give outright grants, but those are very small in number. Maybe, the maximum was when China gave us something like US Dollars 5 to 10 million. So, there are grants, but they do not figure very much now in the assistance schemes. Therefore, we try to get concessionary credit. Most of it comes from multilateral institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, the ADB and so on, which give concessionary credit. So, as far as the IMF is concerned, we have successfully concluded that programme. Soon after this Budget, we will begin discussions with them to see what further relationships we will forge with them.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Minister, you have two more minutes. () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Sir, give me five minutes please.

So, that is with the IMF.

With the World Bank, I want to go very rapidly and say that, this time, the allocation has been doubled as far as Sri Lanka is concerned.

2309 2310

We are investing money in education, health and particularly a new programme A US Dollar-200 million programme has been undertaken for the improvement of the City of Colombo and other cities in the country. I also want to say that we have had good relations with the Asian Development Bank, which has funded many of the infrastructure projects and one cannot think of international monetary assistance without thinking of large-scale investment for infrastructure projects. Many of our infrastructure projects have been funded not by the IMF - they do not fund projects - but by the World Bank and the ADB and they have given us concessionary credit.

Finally, of course, I have to refer to bilateral relations. We have very strong bilateral economic relations. We cannot confine the discussion only to the IMF, the World Bank or the ADB, we have very good relations with other countries. For example, now our trade with Iran, with Russia, with the tea-buying countries and oil-exporting countries are all on a mutual bilateral basis. And, I would say, that a great success which is often not recognized in this House is that we have had very, very sound relations with the Middle East. For example, we have got very concessionary rates when it comes to import of oil. We have got very good cooperation when it comes to export of our tea. So, one of the great factors of Mahinda Rajapaksa administration, I would say, is our strong relationship with the Middle-East which has not only political but economic implications. So, if you look at the Bretton Woods Institutions, regional banks like the Asian Development Bank and the multi-lateral relationships that we have forged, on behalf of the people who are dealing with international monetary co-operation, I must say that we have been quite successful.

I would like to mention two officials specifically, one is the Governor of the Central Bank and the other is the Secretary to the Treasury, and particularly the officials of the External Relations Department - ERD - of the Treasury. We have all worked together and I think we can be happy that in the past year we have done well by this country when it comes to our economic relations.

Thank you very much, Sir.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to second this very valuable and timely Motion.

I am sure the Minister is present here to listen to us and give us a reply finding ways and means of controlling this so that the consumer does not have to suffer too much.

During the past, we saw tomatoes being thrown away. They were unable to be sold even at Rs. 5. But, prices are going up. Look at other items like potatoes and bombay onions. With regard to these two items, there is a big difference in the price of local production and the imported ones. As far as potatoes are concerned, you are imposing a duty of Rs. 50 on all imported potatoes. Still, they are unable to be sold even at Rs. 86 whereas local potatoes are sold at Rs.117.

If there is a move to impose a tax or a duty on imported potatoes in order to protect the local farmer, it should reach the farmer. Otherwise, it is useless making it a tax or a revenue measure by the Government so that the Government becomes richer and the people become poorer.

Further, all these details are taken from the Department of Census and Statistics. The Department of Census and Statistics itself is giving us the monthly Cost of Living Index. The Cost of Living Index is moving up according to the Government in a single digit. It is around 7 per cent. But, we see that the vegetable prices are going up by, as much as, 100 per cent in some cases and on an average, it is about 60 per cent. Prices have gone up compared to last month as well as to 2011. So, what does this show? This shows that the cost of living is moving up. However, it is not reflected in the Cost of Living Index and there is no published Cost of Living Index for those who are in certain trades where the Cost of Living Allowance is paid. So, on one side, prices are going up but it is not reflected in the Cost of Living Index. At the same time, you do not publish the Cost of Living Index for those who are entitled to a Cost of Living Allowance in order for them to draw that allowance. So, while prices go up, wages do not go up. So, what is the solution for the consumer? We expect an answer for this from the Minister.

You have to protect the farmer and at the same time, you have to give a fair price to the consumer. Balancing between these two is your task. I am sure that it is not an easy task but at the same time, as a Government, you have a responsibility to provide the farmer fair prices for their produce. I do not know whether some of these items go up in price on a seasonal basis. So, is your department or ministry having any system to study these movements of prices during the year and to find ways and means of

addressing a stable price to the consumer while protecting the farmer? This is what we want to know from you, Hon. Minister. Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) .
