[2.15 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, for giving me this opportunity to speak on a few topics which are of a very important nature today, especially at a time when the Government is running the economy down, not knowing how to resurrect it, and putting the country into further turmoil.

The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (Amendment) Bill, the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Bill and two Orders under the Sri Lanka Export Development Act are under discussion at this particular moment.

It is the industriousness of the Tamils, the business acumen of the Muslims and the large heartedness of the Sinhalese that make the social fabric of Sri Lanka. That is what makes a better tomorrow for Sri Lanka, not just your "Mahinda Chintana" or not because you are trying to fool the world. If you embrace all the religions together, that will be the sparking-point where Sri Lanka can get into a better tomorrow. So, utilize it; do not only talk. When the Hon. Sampanthan comes for talks, you tell one

417 418

thing; when the Hon. S.M. Krishna comes from India, you tell him another thing and when you go to meet Venerable Malwatta Mahanayaka Thero, you say something else. You take three different approaches and you do not know what is going on.

. . , -[ ] ? ? . , . [ ] ! , . ? [ ] , . . . ? . . .

Another important matter today, Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, is the expropriation Bill. You were one of the persons who was instrumental in going to court with me on the order given on petrol issue; we were together in the COPE on the Lanka Marine Services Limited case; we were together on the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation issue and you and I were there attacking the hedging deal also. But what happened? We were on the same side but when you became a Minister, you took a different approach.

On the 9th of November, 2011, in Parliament, we told you, "please do not bring this expropriation Bill" Why did we say that? We told that because this country needs investment. We need investment. - [Interruption.] Let me get to the point. When you basically expropriate assets, it gives a wrong connotation to the investors who come into the country.

Now, forget everything and look at what has happened? Hon. Minister, Mr. Nihal Ameresekere is a friend of yours and mine. We may be different in our views. I may be the only accountant who represent Parliament and I take my hats off for the approach he has taken today. I was amazed to see that with the knowledge of an accountant, he has been made an Associate Member of the American Bar Association. - [Interruption.] Well and good! As a lawyer, you are not a member of that Association. So, we congratulate him.

When the Supreme Court gives its determination on a matter of an urgent Bill, it does so under Article 122 of the Constitution. My learned, good Friend, the Hon. Sumanthiran, will correct me if I am wrong. Article 122 of the Constitution permits you to bring in an urgent Bill. Article 123 of the Constitution is in regard to the determination of the Supreme Court in respect of Bills. If there is an element of doubt in a Bill, the Supreme Court

cannot give you a clean bill of health on that particular Bill. But, that is what has happened. The Supreme Court went through this particular Bill and gave its determination to go forward with the Bill. But, the same Supreme Court has very clearly said before Mr. Nihal Ameresekere that they entertain certain doubts according to Article 123(3) of the Constitution. This basically arouses a suspicion that a doubt exists. So, when a doubt exists, Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, the Supreme Court cannot allow us to take up that Bill for debate. We have basically debated it and expropriated the assets. We have here the Hon. (Mrs.) Anoma Gamage, wife of one of the owners of the expropriated assets.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) We should not refer to persons. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We are concerned because this is a perfidious act; this is not a normal act. You are expropriating assets. Take the Hilton case. We told that the Japanese owed some money. You expropriated just because of the greediness to take over the assets. On that particular basis, today the Supreme Court - [Interruption.] You ask the Premadasas' of what was given by Premadasa. But, I am telling you with authority that the UNP did not giving anything - [Interruption.] No, the UNP did not give anything. I need to defend my Party. We do not have rogues like those in your Government. If anything has been given, please say that this is what has been given and let the people who have been given come out. The UNP has not given anything. I defend the late President Premadasa. He basically drove the economy, not like other people who are trying to use his name and go forward. He basically drove the country forward. I salute him for that and I tell you that nothing was given for the benefit of him. If anything was given, please prove it in this House - [Interruption.] Do not basically character-assassinate people who have done something - [Interruption.] I am only saying, if there is anything given, show it here. Mr. Nihal Ameresekere has basically made the Hon. Speaker and even the President, a party to this. So, he has done something which we, as Members of Parliament, are unable to do. We should be ashamed.

Look at the Attorney-General who has driven us - [Interruption.] - The Governments lawyer is the Attorney-General. He has taken all of us for a ride. The same Supreme Court which said that it is okay to debate it in Parliament, is now telling that there is a suspicion -

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Do not challenge the Supreme Court. You are not entitled to do that.

419 420

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Then, what should be done? ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) You have to keep your arguments and debates outside the decisions and determinations of the Supreme Court. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am not a lawyer. So, I am subject to correction. If you say so, my lawyers will tell me. But, all I am trying to say is, the Attorney-General has fooled us. We, as idiots in this Parliament have accepted it. Today, the Supreme Court which told it was Okay, now say Do not talk and he has got leave to proceed.

If the Supreme Court did not see something right in this, they would not have given leave to proceed. I mean, what is this? The Parliament is supreme; the Supreme Court is subject to the delegated powers of Parliament according to Article 4 of the Constitution. So, do not subject our rights to the Supreme Court.

On that particular basis, I am only trying to draw - ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) We have parallel powers. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is not parallel. We are well above. They have delegated powers. - [Interruption.] So, on that particular basis, Hon. Minister, all what we say is, this is well and good. So, do not take short cuts in an economic activity - ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) We have not said - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I know it. That is the reason why I am saying - ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) We said that we must expropriate more ventures than that- ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is well and good.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Everything that was privatized was a fraud. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is well and good. So, go ahead and do it. You all have the two-thirds majority. So, go ahead and do it. But, all I am trying to say in this little Mother Lanka that we live in - you all can live in a world of your own - is to do a little justice to ensure that the wheels of commerce keep turning. Do not ensure that you take us back to be on par with North Korea, Cuba, Ethiopia and Somalia that you all are basically trying to be parallel with. - [Interruption.] The main thing that has got to be done is to ensure that we have a way forward. The most important thing is, the investors must feel more comfortable than the workers.

Now, it is US Dollars 500 million which has again gone up to US Dollars 600 million. Now, in that particular matter, one of the key factors was that the China Merchants Holdings (International) Company Limited had said that they would not come forward to make any additional payment unless their colleagues or their partners come up with the relative increases. Aitken Spence , 150 . . . .

We must understand the political realities that are there between India and China. I guess our Friend, the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena can listen to this and the Hon. Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, who is the de facto Minister, can also listen to this. Today, the Indian factor - that geopolitical factor of the Chinese invasion that is there - will also determine why the development of this particular port is basically happening with the Chinese. Today, you have the Hambantota Port which is under Chinese control. Then, you are having that South Port that is going to be developed in Colombo - now with Aitken Spence coming out with their 30 - 55 per cent under Chinese control while the Sri Lanka Ports Authority holds 15 per cent of the stake. I am sure the

423 424

Chinese will gallop the rest of that, and then you will have the Colombo South Ports first private terminal going to a Chinese hand.

Now, you are looking at the Indian exports that are coming out of an Indian Port - [Interruption.] Why not? Even though you do not, the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance has mentioned that the debt should be converted to equity and the Chinese should be given the opportunity to take equity control. Now, that is already on record which had - [Interruption.] So, I am going on your incompetent Governments position holders who is basically giving statements, which is attracted by the Indians. I mean, if we are an Indian investor, India will look at this Chinese involvement or Chinese love that is there in Colombo. You are trying to get Indian exports going through Sri Lanka using a Chinese Port. Do you think that they will allow that to go on? So, this is one of the reasons why we are asking this.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) You do not know. I think you are - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I do not know? Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, I, being an Opposition Member, pushing more exports to Sri Lanka than some of your Ministers in your Government - ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) That is very much appreciated. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, as a result, I am quite aware of the problems that you are faced with. When we mentioned this two years ago, you all paid scant respect. Today, you have Harry Jayawardena walking out of the investment. He, being a businessman, knows what is there. We are only surmising whether there is a pressure coming from India. We are wondering whether this US Dollars 150 million increase was perpetrated by the Ports Authority to kick out Aitken Spence and to bring in Chinese investment. Now, if that is the case, you had Mr. Krishna coming in to Sri Lanka. Did they not, behind the doors, asked about this Chinese love that is going on? The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, the Minister of Industry and Commerce, is doing a very honourable service. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Is it a point of Order or a question ? ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) No. I am raising a point of Order. Sir, the Hon. Member is misleading this House. Whatever he is saying is totally ineffectual.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What is the point of Order in that? What is misleading? ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) The Hon. Member is talking on behalf of a private company as a lobbyist. - [Interruption.] The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake is now talking on behalf of the Aitken Spence as a lobbyist. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, you can continue. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am not speaking for anybody. Nobody pays a single cent to us for anything. Surely,unlike your chequered political career, I have been here for 19 years and not a single guy will say that he paid one cent to me. So, we do not need to be singing hosannas for anybodys dinner. We are not that type of people. I am only singing - ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Please do not talk on behalf of a private entity! ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is none of your business. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon.

Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) . . rose.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, I have no time. If you give me five minutes of your time, you can interrupt. Otherwise, please sit down.

Sir, I am only speaking on the national interest of Sri Lanka. I am speaking as a person who is involved in matters on behalf of the country a hundred times more than what you are basically doing. You are a person who started Mihin Air and ran it into the ground. All I want to say is today, the Indian Exports - [Interruption.] Sir, can you kindly guide the House, if not, allow us to take time from them.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) This is how he disregards the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You have been misguiding and mis-riding the bloody [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] country for three, four years. Do not tell us what we are doing. Look at the Minister of Industry and Commerce - [Interruption.] Today, you could see the problem that is there to invest in this country. You have today, a port that is manipulated and you have exports that are coming out of India and going into Chinese-owned ports. Do you think that will be permitted? I am asking this question -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Azwer, what is your point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, the Hon. Member is calling Sri Lanka a bloody [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] country. He is an American, yankee monkey. [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] He is calling our country - we were born here - a bloody [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] country. Let it be there. Do not withdraw. He is calling Sri Lanka a bloody

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] country. [Interruption.] This is the man who insulted the military. He is pleading for a private company. He is suffering from China phobia.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) If there is anything against the Standing Orders, it will be expunged. Hon. Azwer, sit down please. Hon. Member, you may carry on.

427 428

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I have not said anything like that. These are the guys that are saying. I am only saying - [Interruption.] Can you guide this House? If not, please tell us, we will do it. I am telling you that this Mother Lanka of ours is being ruined by this Government. The late Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali had developed the port. The exports were developed by the late President J.R. Jayewardene. Today, it is being taken on to a different level. Are you telling me that the Southern Port Harbour does not have 55 per cent Chinese Merchants Holdings (International) Company involvement in it? Are you telling me that this is not Chinese controlled? What are you telling? Are you telling me that 55 per cent is not in the hands of the Chinese when you have 15 per cent in the Ports Authority and 30 per cent in Aitken Spence, and Aitken Spence has backed out? Let the answers be given by them. I am not interested in any way. So, we must basically look at embracing India. When I was there as Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs - the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen knows it - we basically called India to come in as a joint venture for the ports as the SAARC ports are there. Getting the Indians to come and invest with us was the best way forward. You could see even in one of our Private Members Motions, we have put India - [Interruption.] That is obvious. Now, you are basically talking about Mr. S.M. Krishna, the External Affairs Minister of India who came here yesterday. You all have basically moved forward. I am happy that His Excellency the President has said Thirteen plus plus. But, now your Ministers are coming and saying No, no there is no Thirteen plus plus, if it is Thirteen plus plus, there will be minus minus land and police powers. Now, what we are asking is whether His Excellency the President is running the country or are the Ministers running the country? One Minister says that the LLRC Report is wrong. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Why do you not name your representative to the Select Committee? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Why should we? First the Government must reveal its stand. You cannot get the TNA to get into talks. You all have talks there. Remember, we, the United National Party has been the only party that has been able to solve the problem to a certain degree. We are the ones who introduced DDCs, we are the ones who introduced the Thirteenth Amendment, and we are the ones who have taken it forward. So, do not tell us that we do not have a stand. All what we want is the Government's stand. Today, what is your stand? You have told Mr. Krishna, the External Affairs Minister from India that basically you are going to give Thirteen plus plus. What is that

plus plus? But, your Minister says, "No, no, if it is Thirteen plus plus, there will be minus minus land and police powers". So, we want to know this because these are statements that are of importance. - [Interruption.} You can reply when you are speaking. Now, I am speaking here. The External Affairs Minister quoting the President says, "His Excellency the President said Thirteen plus plus". But, the Ministers are saying otherwise. So, we want to know the Government's stand.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committee, give me two more minutes.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) I cannot give you two minutes. Hon. John Amaratunga, are you giving him two minutes?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, you are there only to cut our time but our generous Chief Opposition Whip is giving me the time. All what we basically say is - [Interruption.] All we want to do is -[Interruption.] This is our country. This is not anybody elses country. No external force -

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Your bloody [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] country and our country. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) This is our country. You all run amok with the economy. Do not blame the Opposition for that. We are saying that this must have a national policy. You are increasing the cost of production, you are reducing the competitiveness by making the rupee strong and on the other side, you are taking the subsidy away. You are

429 430

2012 19

trying to bring in amendments to the BOI law in order to appoint the Board of Directors when the fundamentals are not there.

Then look at the external factor. Today, India is one of the biggest success stories. That is the biggest strength that we have. We, little Sri Lanka, can be what Hong Kong was to China. But, we are not positioning ourselves. When I was the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs - Hon. Risad Badhiutheen will definitely bear testimony - our entire job was to lure the Indians to come here and invest because that was the strength that we had. We can together compete with the region. We can together compete with the world. I can see that the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen going in that direction. Unfortunately, he has a bad brief to carry. One man cannot make a spring. He must basically be able to take a message. So, on that particular basis, all what we are saying is that now you have gone to external dimensions. One year ago you had CATIC coming and taking land. Now, CATIC has backed out. You had Shangri-La going all over the world. Now, that has backed out. - [Interruption.] Shangri-La is investing here. That is not an issue. But, in their Hambantota investment, I think you should push them. I can see the young MP, the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa, trying to lure them in. I hope he can get them there. But, what has happened to CATIC?

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) You will see that in another two weeks, they are starting construction work. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) CATIC is another story. I will not highlight that now. I will leave it to another day due to lack of time. But, all that I want to basically say is that we have a wonderful opportunity. Do not lose ourselves to Myanmar, which is coming into this particular area as the production base today. Myanmar is twenty times Sri Lanka. They are positioned near China, Thailand, Vietnam and all those areas. Their cost of labour is US Dollars 30 as opposed to four times ours. So, we must not lose our position in being a nation of producing and exporting, rather than importing and trading. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I know that you are very keen to shut my mouth. I will do that. But, give me one more minute.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) No. Your time is over. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Give me one more minute. The Indian Minister of External Affairs has come here with a very important role. So, ensure that our national policy is put in place.

[3.03 p.m.] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen - Minister of Industry and Commerce) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Sir, in accordance with the Budget 2012, presented by His Excellency the President in Parliament, the Government has taken action to revise the Import and Export Cess structure through the enforcement of the following orders published under the Sri Lanka Export Development Act, No. 40 of 1979 in Gazette No. 1733/5 and Gazette No. 1733/6 of 21st November 2011.

Sir, the cess tax imposed on certain exports has been revised with the objective of discouraging export of these items in raw form and encouraging the value-added exports. Cess tax imposed on export of raw rubber, phosphate, granite, mica and timber logs has been increased while the cess on export of natural graphite, clay, illmenite, rutile, titanium and zirconium have been newly imposed.

The encouragement of value-added industry while leading to more investment opportunities would also present opportunities to establish new industries, employment generation and increase export earnings. Therefore, measures taken by us to impose cess on exports in raw form will no doubt be significant in our march towards a manufacturing economy.

With the objective of reducing the upfront cost of local manufacturers and to encourage the local industry, the cess on import of raw material such as starch, certain types of polymers, pipes for mini-hydropower projects, butyl rubber, scrap iron and metal cans, have been completely removed while cess tax imposed on inputs of sanitaryware of plastics, steel sinks and baths have been reduced. Although the import cess on certain types of fabric has been increased, the other levies such as VAT, PAL and NBT imposed on these items have been completely removed.

431 432

The tourism industry is booming and it is expected to be a US Dollar one-billion industry in the near future. In order to cater to the needs of the tourist industry by enhancing the availability of branded products, the Government has reduced the cess on import of certain categories of beauty or make-up preparations, apparel, footwear, travel bags, hats, ornamental products and ceramic products, while completely removing the cess on cutlery and toys.

Our country has already achieved a world reputation in several sports. School children and the youth should be encouraged to pursue sports and our country could be projected as a sports hub in the region, providing sports-related services and goods. To boost the sports economy and to build a healthy nation, the import cess on sport goods such as track suits, swimwear and sports shoes has been reduced.

One of the key objectives of the Government by imposing cess on imports is to discourage the importation of non-essential items and protect the local farmers and manufacturers. Import cess has been imposed on non-essential items such as frozen food, processed meat, flowers, perfumes and luxury goods. The Government has not levied cess on the import of essential items such as drugs and investment goods. Therefore, through the imposition of import cess, it is expected to protect the local industry and mitigate the outward flow of foreign exchange from the country. It will also serve to relieve the balance-of-payment difficulties faced by the country. The imposition of import cess will also lead to encourage local value-addition and provide protection to farmers and local manufacturers, which would in turn strengthen the local economy. According to the statistics released by the Department of Census and Statistics, the economy had registered a highly commendable growth rate of 8.4 per cent in the third quarter of 2011. While the developed countries are facing setbacks, the progress achieved by our economy is commendable.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, for their own Bill, they do not have their own Members, forming the Quorum. Where are the Ministers?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Where are your Members?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Why should we be bothered about it? Why should we be there for your Bill? - [Interruption.] That is your business. - [Interruption.]

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, are you raising the issue of a lack of Quorum?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, I am raising it. - [Interruption.]

, . - , , . , - Parliament counted, and a Quorum not being present, the Division Bells were ordered to be rung. Later, a Quorum being present -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Risad Badhiutheen, now you may continue. ( ) (The Hon. Risad Badhiutheen ) Sir, that progress made by our economy is one instance which reflects the success achieved by pursuing the policies under the Mahinda Chintana.

The Government has implemented several measures to develop and promote exports of Sri Lanka and as a result, the export sector has achieved a considerable progress. The export sector has been able to register a satisfactory growth rate of 20.98 per cent in 2010. The performance of the export sector improved further in 2011and it was able to register a commendable growth rate of 23.3 per cent up to October, 2011. Industrial exports, which was 74.4 per cent of the total export earnings, have also grown by 29 per cent. Textile and garment exports have registered a growth of 24.4 per cent.

The exports to two major markets have also registered a satisfactory growth up to October, 2011. The exports to the USA have registered a growth of 24.45 per cent. We should be happy to note that our exports to the European

433 434

[ ]

2012 19

Union have registered a growth of 24.3 per cent and the export of garments to the EU has also registered a growth of 26 per cent. This clearly demonstrates the ability of our exporters to compete in the EU market even without the GSP Plus concession.

Sir, it is important that the export sector, which contributes significantly to the Gross Domestic Product - the GDP - of the country, should make a substantial contribution to achieve the development objectives of the country. Accordingly, my Ministry is taking steps to increase export earnings of the country up to US Dollars 15 billion in 2015. Our target for 2011 was to achieve US Dollars 9.1 billion in export earnings by the end of the year and the statistics reveal that we have almost achieved that target by the end of November, 2011.

The Sri Lanka Export Development Board, which is under the purview of my Ministry, has implemented a number of programmes for the development of that sector. The main objective of the Strategic Plan of the EDB is to achieve an export target of US Dollars 15 billion by 2015. By adopting a strategic approach, the EDB aims to implement a number of programmes such as promotion of exports to identified markets, implementation of supply chain development programmes, provision of trade information, implementation of e-commerce development programmes and skills development programmes. The main objective of these programmes is to improve the competitiveness of the export sector, which would permit it to confront the challenges posed by the international market.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Budget 2012 presented to Parliament by His Excellency the President proposes several measures that would develop the export sector. Nearly 57 per cent of Sri Lankas exports are absorbed by the USA and EU markets making Sri Lanka vulnerable to changes in these markets. Therefore, entering into new trade agreements with emerging economies in Asia, Africa and South Africa, as proposed in the Budget, would be a timely move to diversify our exports to these markets and exploit the export potential of new emerging growth centres of the world.

The Government aims to achieve an economic growth target of 8 per cent and it is estimated that an investment of 35 per cent of the GDP is required to achieve this target. The present savings level is nearly 28 per cent of the GDP. Therefore, rationalization of the existing investment regime as proposed in the Budget 2012 will contribute to attract investment and thereby bridge the countrys resource gap.

The tax holidays proposed in the Budget for small, medium and large-scale enterprises would also encourage investment in export-oriented undertakings. The measures proposed in the Budget to develop the tea, rubber and minor export crops sectors would contribute to expand the supply base of these crops and improve productivity.

Sir, our next aim is to be a rice-exporting country. In 2010, Sri Lanka has exported 199 metric tons of rice to Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. The international demand for rice is also showing an increasing trend. Therefore, the Governments initiative for developing rice cultivation by establishing rice export zones would result in excess rice production for export.

The IT sector has a large potential for employment generation and export. Sri Lanka has targeted export earnings of US Dollars one billion from the IT sector by 2015. Establishment of IT-dedicated centres with infrastructure is essential to attract investment to the IT sector. Therefore, setting up of a Technology City in Hambantota would be a major step towards fulfilling this requirement.

Sir, Sri Lankas research and development capacity is not adequate and industrial research being carried out is not demand-driven. Therefore, the proposals set out in the Budget 2012 are important to motivate researchers to carry out effective R & D which meets industry requirements. These are some of the Proposals in Budget 2012 that would support the export sector.

Sir, our Government has been able to usher in peace and establish a stable political environment, which is necessary for the development of private enterprises. These positive factors together with the co-operation of the private sector, present great opportunities for export development.

Sir, we are indeed extremely fortunate to be guided by the excellent leadership of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa in our endeavour to develop our country. Our task is to support the progrmmes implemented by the Government and make Sri Lanka the Wonder of Asia

Therefore, as patriotic citizens, I would earnestly request every Hon. Member to set aside differences and work in harmony for the betterment of the country.

Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva, please. You have 25 minutes. [3.20 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, today my Colleague, the Hon. Sumanthiran went before the Court of Appeal with regard to a case filed by himself on a land circular. There is a circular issued by the Government

435 436

stating that unless the people in the North and the East provide documentation proving the ownership to their lands, they would not be entitled to enjoy the privilege of ownership of their lands. The Hon. Sumanthiran went before the court and argued that that particular circular was in contravention with the Constitution of this country. Some Hon. Members of the Government - I cannot remember them by their names - argued that lands needed to be given to the investors to start projects in these areas. Certain people went before the court because they had private grievances and accused my Colleague, the Hon. Sumanthiran, for involving himself in this.

What has happened today, Sir? The Deputy Solicitor-General appearing for the respondents has given an undertaking to withdraw this circular and said that he will issue a new circular and present it to court. Sir, there has to be a rule of law, not a rule by men. That is what the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission Report tells us. If there is a law, you have to abide by that. Just because somebody wants to put up a hotel or somebody wants to construct a golf course, you cannot take peoples lands however powerful you may be or however connected you may be to the regime. So, it is good that today we have got the court ruling. I hope at least now the Government will think twice before trying to force people to part with their lands because they want it for some reason.

Now, moving on to the Debate today, I have read about the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen almost everyday in the newspapers. He always tries to do something. He works very hard and I commend him. He goes around the world and tells people to buy our stuff. He goes around the country and tries to develop the export sector. I wish we had more Ministers like the Hon. Risad Badhiutheen.

What he tried to do was to improve exports to US Dollars 9 million by 2011. He said that he was able to do so by November and he hopes to increase exports to US Dollars 15 million by 2015. But, Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the problem is we cannot talk only about exports. We have to talk about imports as well. Hon. Minister, 10 years ago, before you take over this portfolio, Sri Lanka exported 37 per cent of its GDP. Ten years ago, exports to GDP was 37 per cent. What that meant was, Hon. Minister, investors were putting their monies into the export industry. However, 10 years later what has happened is, that share has fallen to 17 per cent. So, whatever the Hon. Minister is trying to do, there is some problem in that because people are not investing in the export sector. Like what our Colleague said earlier, people are engaged in trade and do projects taking commission-based contracts but do not invest in the export sector. So, that is a problem. You need to understand where the bottlenecks are. Why are people not investing in the export sector?

Sir, as I said before, the other matter is, you have to look at the imports as well. Hon. Minister, you have to look at the balance of trade. It is true that you are increasing exports but it is also true that somebody else is increasing imports by several folds more than your exports. So, what is happening is that the balance of trade is expanding. We have never seen a balance of trade of this magnitude in this country. By the end of last year, we speculated that it would have been something like US Dollars 9 billion, which is as much as your entire export earnings. So, that means, we are importing twice as much as what we are exporting. Then, what happens is, there is a great demand for US Dollars because imports are done in US Dollars. Although there is a great demand for US Dollars, we have a Central Bank that does not want the market to reflect the true value of the dollar. Thereby, the value of the Sri Lanka Rupee is held at an arbitrary level. I say, "arbitrary" because I mean it. Somebody wants to keep it at 110 and some others want to keep it at 114, immaterial of what you, Hon. Minister, are trying to do to improve the exports from Sri Lanka to both its traditional and new markets. So, what happens is, our currency gets overvalued. When we have an overvalued currency, Hon. Minister, what happens is, our exports become expensive relative to imports, and imports become cheap. Therefore, importing goods and selling here becomes much more lucrative and profitable than trying to export. In economics, we talk about something called, Dutch disease. That happens when people do not invest in the export industry but invest in short-term trading and other lucrative commission-based projects. So, that is a problem that you need to address.

If this country is growing as rapidly as you say and if the investments are coming in lorry loads as you say, then, the investors must be confident about the future. All what a stock price says is a discounted cash flow of a particular company. That means the price that is reflected in the share market today is an expected profit of that company forever into the future. That is how a stock price is theoretically determined. So, if the stock prices are coming down, what that means is, there is less positivism. They feel that these companies will not do well in future. That is what it is showing. , , , BOI agreements . .

[4.25 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Presiding Member, the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (Amendment) Bill, as many Members have already stated, is seemingly a simply amendment, separating the positions of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. But, I would want to still reiterate what the Hon. Sunil Handunnetti mentioned just a few moments ago in the House. I think the Hon. Minister said that he will be finally giving some clarification on it.

Why are these two positions being created? Because you had a Chief Executive who is the Chairman and now there seems to be a separation coming in. Why are they created? We would like to know the rationale and the logic. We also want to know what exact powers each would have and how it will be differentiated. Are there going to be two salaries and two sets of perks? And, as it was alleged by the Hon. Member, are positions being created for people or basically, is it really an organizational change? The real issue here is, I do not think that an organizational change is going to actually bring investment into the country.

As we know, the real issue is to get investment - that is direct foreign investment and private foreign investment into the country - because there is a huge gap. In 2009, we know that FDI was about US Dollars 600 million and in 2010, it was about US Dollars 500 million. We know that in 2011, that figure may have doubled. We are still waiting for the figures. It maybe about a billion dollars - that it may have doubled. But, really, that investment came because domestic private investment actually increased; not because it came from overseas. Domestic private investment as a percentage of GDP went up from 17.9 per cent to 21.6 per cent during that period. Mr. Presiding Member, the fear that we have and what we see is that investment in Sri Lanka is getting limited basically to local knowledge and to political connectedness. That is the fear that we have, because somehow or the other, nearly three years after the war, there seems to be still an inability to attract foreign direct investment. That is why we are asking this question. An increase in FDI may become increasingly tied to influential local partners and political personalities.

However, today, there was an interview with the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa in the Daily FT. In it, the question has been posed to him and he says, I quote:

You dont need Rajapaksa connections; Opportunities are open to all.

Todays Daily FT further states, I quote:

It is unfortunate that such thinking is prevailing. This could be a legacy from the past regimes. Certainly this is a myth today. The opportunities are open for all, provided they sincerely believe in the future of Sri Lanka, and that as a country we can do it.

I further quote:

Some of those by the fact they may have supported or preferred the UNP could think that they cant do any new ventures or could be creating their own distance form the Government. This is unnecessary.

It is interesting that the Hon. Member has been talking about basically what he seems to think is a perception, that you need to be politically connected. The fact that he has addressed the question itself shows that certainly there is some issue; there are some questions about being politically connected. It maybe a perception; it maybe reality or it maybe any one of those two. We do not know. But, it is not just about having a positive mindset and having dreams. The Government is urging the private sector to change their mindset and have a positive mindset. I think dreaming is good. I came to Parliament also because I am bit of a dreamer. But, I do not think you could hope to realize your dreams unless your dreams are grounded in reality.

It takes a lot more than dreams and a lot more than plans to actually transform an economy. That is really the issue. Perception is a reality and therefore this Government seems to be having a problem.

In the few minutes I have, I would like to just expand on why there is a lack of confidence for investors, whether in the Sri Lankan private sector or whether it is foreign direct investment, to invest in this country. A little while ago, some of my Colleagues talked about the expropriation Bill. The expropriation Bill was an unnecessary piece of legislation on the Sri Lankan statute book, which certainly is going to work against the confidence that investors would have. It was totally unnecessary. There were other means to deal with the problems that were there and it got complicated when we put ongoing profitable ventures into the annexes of the expropriation Bill when there was a case only to deal with businesses that had completely gone bankrupt and closed. So, that was one of the issues.

Furthermore, there is institutional failure. I am glad that the Hon. DEW Gunasekara is in the House as I make this point. In the COPE, we went through 229 companies. Some were loss-makers, some were profitable and some were beginning to lose. But, we saw some common factors in a lot of them and they were to do with management. It was to do with how business is conducted. It was to do with governance in the public sector. I was glad to hear from the Hon. Chairman of the COPE in the House today that they have summoned all the Secretaries and other managerial leadership of the Public sector and they are beginning to address the question of discipline in these corporations.

But, I want to make a submission that it is a lot more than discipline. It is to do with a change of attitude; it is to do with training; it is to do with investments that are made. If the Government is serious and they want to

457 458

2012 19

make a serious move in the management of the economy, they have to seriously invest money in training the management in the Public sector. Without money and investment it will not happen. Just making changes as it pleases the Executive, will not make a dent. We recently saw the Sri Lanka Cricket, which has been totally mismanaged. Even the international cricket organizations are continuously looking at that. Can you imagine a Government institution not paying the people who work in it and we have had others intervene to get our cricketers to work. What does the Government do?

( ) (The Presiding Member) I thought it is not a Government concern. It is an independent body. You know it.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) It is an international body, but I am making some deductions about the independent body. The Government elected a Interim Committee into the Sri Lanka Cricket without an election. This is what I am talking about. If you sincerely want to change the management structure, you have to allow the market forces; you have to allow governance; you have to allow transparency in the process of doing this. Otherwise, you are going to have a problem.

Another reason why there is lack of confidence in investment is because of the law and order situation. We see that the police has failed in some situations. Instead of strengthening the police; instead of investing in the police; instead of their training; instead of building the institution, we have brought in the military to take the place of the police. The way to build confidence for investment is to build the institutional framework. Recently, in a resort in the South of the country, a tourist was murdered. Not only was he murdered, his accompanying lady - wife or other partner - was raped according to reports in the media. It is a serious issue particularly for the women of this country and their dignity.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, I think your time is up. ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Is my time up, Sir? Can I just have a minute to close then? I will conclude.

( ) (The Presiding Member) All right.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) This is a serious issue concerning the confidence in the economy and investment. These kinds of incidences need to be transparently gone into and they need to establish the facts. Otherwise, investment might not come in. I was so glad to hear that the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption is going to be called before Parliament and we are going to be following up on some of these things. There are policy inconsistencies. Even in the tax policy, there are inconsistencies. So, we need remittances, we need FDI. But, we cannot go on living on borrowed reserves. We need to have earned reserves. Earned reserves can be got only if the economy is competitive; only if exports are competitive; only if you have an exchange rate policy which is competitive. It is really mind-blowing. In August, we had US Dollars 8.2 billion of reserves.

By the end of last year, 2011, we had US Dollars six billion or less and more than US Dollars one billion reserves since the Budget Speech in defending the Sri Lankan Rupee currency. Therefore, the Government needs to look at the macroeconomic framework. You cannot have just a wrong macroeconomic framework and expect the country to be competitive, to have exports and to get foreign direct investments. That just would not happen. Changing just institutional frameworks would not happen. Good governance is a prerequisite; institutional building is a prerequisite and also we need to have independent decision making where the private sector will not be interfered with in one way or the other, directly or through pressure, like we have seen in the recent withdrawal from the Colombo Port or for private sector investment from the Colombo Port.
