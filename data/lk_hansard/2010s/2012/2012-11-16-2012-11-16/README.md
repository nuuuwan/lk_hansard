( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Please ensure that the Rupavahini Corporation - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is the answer I want. I am talking of the revenue loss of the Rupavahini Corporation.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Keheliya Rambukwella) That is not relevant to this. - [Interruption.]

() .. ( ) ( () . . - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the purpose of any budget is to take the maximum advantage of a particular situation that exist in a country and to formulate a set of proposals that would be suited to the circumstances prevailing at any particular time. The main characteristic of the current situation in our country, Sir, is peace and stability, which we have achieved after three long decades. Now, in order to maximize that, the Government is placing a particular premium on economic diplomacy. There are many features of the current fiscal and monetary policies that are greatly appreciated by investors and others overseas. One of these features, Sir, is consistency. Many foreign governments have told me that if we are serious about investment, it is absolutely necessary to ensure that we simplify our tax structure, we reduce the number of taxes that we have in this country and we refrain from making rapid changes which would result in an erosion of confidence. Now, this consistency with regard to our tax structure is something that is greatly appreciated by the international community.

There is also, Sir, an initiative that has been taken in this Budget to address the problem of liquidity. Companies are now permitted to borrow abroad; to access bond markets abroad. This will ease the situation in this country where if these avenues were not available, then the State would have to borrow. The State would have to borrow and companies will have to resort to methods like rights issues, to raise money. But today, companies can access international money markets and this will produce the very beneficial consequence that the ratio of borrowing to GDP will be greatly diminished.

The other factor that is very important is infrastructure. No government in Sri Lankas history has

1297 1298

[ ]

2012 16

made such a colossal investment in the development of infrastructure - ports and harbours, railroads, highways, all of this. These are necessary stimulus for economic development and to encourage investment in the country. I think the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, with a sense of fairness, will probably concede that the thrust in the Budget in favour of the small and medium sector, is entirely commendable.

The Budget has raised the taxation levels for the Small and Medium sector. Many of them have been totally exempted and even companies in the SME sector, which have been brought within the tax net, enjoy relief by a substantial reduction of the quantum of taxes that are payable. Moreover, banks and financial institutions have been told that if they set apart a sum of money, create a separate fund for on-lending to the SME sector, to provide capital for the SME sector, then the profits generated by that fund will enjoy total exemption from taxation.

I know, as someone who has taught young people in the universities of our country, there is a great deal of creativity. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella spoke of young people, their aspirations in life. They have creativity. What they lack is seed capital to start a venture. This Budget contains several practical proposals to address that situation in a pragmatic manner.

If we are talking about the situation of stability in the country, many foreign governments appreciate the fact that that stability brings benefits not only to people within the shores of our own island but over a much wider geographical area. The Sri Lanka Navy is playing a signal role with regard to securing the security of sea lanes, the integrity of transnational commerce and addressing problems with regard to piracy, which have acquired alarming proportions in other regions of the world, that is not so in our part of the world. For example, the Government of Australia has expressed to me their deep appreciation of everything that we are doing to mitigate the problems arising from illicit migration to their country. Many problems connected with terrorism, money-laundering issues that have a bearing on the stability of the economies of other countries are being constructively addressed by the Sri Lanka Navy, which is expending resources, time and energy in dealing with these issues. So much so, that the Government of Australia has totally revamped its whole procedure for processing applications. It is now being done not within the mainland of Australia but out of Nauru, for example. I have told them, Whatever you do, if you do not take the step of making it very clear that illicit migrants will be sent back immediately, nothing else would suffice. So, these are areas in which our contribution has been greatly appreciated by foreign countries.

Then, I must also say that there is active co-operation in Western Europe, for example, with regard to activities

that are connected with terrorism. Police and investigating authorities in Western Europe are working very closely with the Attorney-Generals Department in Sri Lanka and with the Ministry of Defence. There is a very close collaboration. Many prosecutions have been instituted in those capitals. Those countries are also very concerned to nip in the bud, any problems that may arise with regard to a resurgence of activities that they would like to control in their own countries. The best proof of it is that large numbers of people are being sent back to Sri Lanka. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella spoke of doubts in the minds of these countries. But, if they thought that Sri Lanka was not a safe place, they are certainly not going to send large numbers of people who have been there for quite long periods back to Sri Lanka. People are being repatriated to Sri Lanka from the United Kingdom, from Switzerland and from many countries of Western Europe, which have publicly declared that circumstances in this country are safe. In some cases, there was litigation in those countries. Various groups went to the courts of those countries and asked the courts to intervene to prevent these people from being sent to Sri Lanka. But, those Governments have said, No, we are satisfied that there is no danger to them. There is no longer any reason for them to stay here. They are economic refugees. There is nothing to run away from". So, that is a considered judgment by the Governments of those countries, which have declared to the whole world that the situation in Sri Lanka is entirely safe and stable and there is no reason any longer why these people should continue to live in those countries.

Then, again we need to look at the current situation and strengthen our contacts with regions of the world which have been somewhat neglected in the past. Let us take, for example, countries in the Gulf region. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella said that there is no investment in the country. He distinguished between loans and investment. Of course, there is a distinction between loans and investment. But, take Shangri-La. That is not a loan; that is an investment. My Hon. Friend is aware that there are two hotels in the process of being constructed; the physical construction is going on in Colombo and in Hambantota. What is more? Shangri-La has started recruiting people to be employed in those hotels. Just last week, a batch of young people was sent for training in four foreign countries. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella is of course aware that Shangri-La is one of the most prestigious hotel chains in the world. They have hotels all over. They are sending these young people to be exposed to the highest quality of training that is available in the tourism sector. Throughout that period of training, they are being paid a handsome allowance. Employment is guaranteed for them. Shangri-La, in fact, while going on the construction of these two hotels, one in Colombo and one in Hambantota, are trying to identify a site on the East Coast to build yet another hotel. This is a flagship investment in many ways, apart from the large quantum of money which they are investing in this country. It is an

1299 1300

investment which will enthuse and embolden other major hotel chains to come into this country. It is, therefore, wrong to say that everything consist of loans which are repayable, that there is no investment and that the circumstances in the country are not conducive to the generation of confidence in the minds of investors. That is simply not correct. Shangri-La is coming here because they think that there are profits to be made. Why are British Airways resuming flights to Sri Lanka after so many years?

My Hon. Friend is aware that they have not been operating flights from London to Colombo for a very, very long period. Now they are coming back. Why? Because there is potential. Tourism brought in an income of only about US Dollars 500 million two and a half years ago. It is now almost US Dollars 1 billion. So, these are sound commercial decisions. They are not political decisions. The British Airways is not making these decisions to please us. They are resuming their flights to our country because the country is taking off.

Shangri-La is perhaps the most conspicuous of investments. But, it is by no means the only investment. ITC Maurya, is one of the best known hotel chains in India. They are building a hotel, in fact, very close to the site which has been taken by Shangri-La. So, the picture that was painted by my Hon. Friend, with his customary persuasive power, does not however reflect the reality of the situation.

If you are talking of investment, I would like to tell my Hon. Friend who preceded me, that there is also very considerable investment coming from the Gulf region. In fact, Sri Lankas relations with the Arab world, which have a long and distinguished history, are now being resuscitated in a manner that confers very substantial benefits on this country.

The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella spoke of developments in Geneva and the attitudes of some countries in relation to Sri Lanka. I would like to tell him that we are legitimately proud of the very strong support, the very steadfast support, that we received from the Arab world. In March this year, when the vote was taken on the Resolution in respect of Sri Lanka, there were four countries of the Gulf region which were Members of the Human Rights Council: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Jordan. In spite of the immense pressure that was brought to bear on the Governments of these countries, three of them strongly supported Sri Lanka. They not only voted for us; I was in Geneva at that time and I am personally aware that they actively canvassed for us. Saudi Arabia did; Qatar did; Kuwait did.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) What about India?

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) I will come to India. But surely, Hon. Kiriella, you know the circumstances that resulted in that decision. You know that very well. You know what it is that prompted the Government of India to make that decision. That is not a secret. So, the Kuwait Fund, investments from Qatar, all of this is coming into this country because just as Shangri-La is convinced, just as British Airways is convinced, investors in these countries think that the circumstances are right for investment in this part of the world.

We must also not forget that one of the most rapidly developing areas of the world is the African Continent. During the next 10 years the rate of growth of many of the countries in Africa will probably be higher than countries in the East Asian region. Take Nigeria for example. It is a country with 160 million people. It has oil. It is a very strong economy, not second to South Africa. We have neglected that part of the world. Sri Lanka does not have a single resident mission in West Africa. That is not a satisfactory state of affairs. We are seeking to rectify that. My Friend is aware that the Nigerian High Commissioner has already come here. I met him. He is very enthusiastic about the future of our bilateral relationship. We initiated this. But, they have sent their High Commissioner to Colombo. He is here setting up his mission. He is functioning on the ground. Africa, Sir, is home to 300 million people with rising levels of income in many of these countries.

So, Sri Lanka is going to strengthen our relations with that part of the world and, in particular, we have very close affinity with some of the Island States, which like Sri Lanka, are today focusing more and more on what is called the "Blue Economy." Sri Lanka is an Island nation and we have not in the past made sufficient use of our ocean resources. I do not mean just fisheries but yachting and leisure activities which are ancillary to the development of tourism.

The President of the Seychelles was here a few months ago. He asked our President, "why are we allowing other people to come to our waters and benefit from shipping, from all the activities connected with the ocean which should bring income to our people?

Sir, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, there was a special meeting of Island States which were putting a focus on their marine resources. Already, Seychelles is placing very significant orders from the Sri Lanka Navy. They are worth very large sums of money. Seychelles, Madagascar, Mauritius,

1301 1302

[ () .. ]

2012 16

all these Island States have a substantial community of economic interest with Sri Lanka. That is a solid foundation to build upon as this country continues to enjoy the fruits of peace and stability.

At the same time, it is necessary to make greater use of regional arrangements. I think within the SAARC region, we can do much more with Intra-SAARC Trade. The volume of Intra-SAARC Trade is depressingly low.

I want to tell the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella that our relationship with India is very sound. I really mean that. It is very sound. Tell me, when did you hear of more than six of the most important Ministers of the Indian Government visiting Sri Lanka within a period of four or five months? It happened. This would not happen if there is a sense of strain, suspicion and hostility.

We had the Hon. Jairam Ramesh here. That was a very productive visit. Probably one of the most productive was the visit of Shri Anand Sharma, Indias Minister of Commerce and Industry, whom I had the pleasure of meeting once more when I was in India a couple of weeks ago to attend the IORAC sessions. The Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry, is very sharply focused on improving the trade relationship between our countries. He has conferred enormous benefits particularly on the apparel sector. They are interested in infusing technology into our industries.

Then, people to people contact. I do not think that anything was as successful as the Kapilavastu Relics. More than two and a half million people in our country had the opportunity of venerating the sacred Relics in seven Provinces of the Island. Srimathi Kumari Selja, Indias Minister of Culture, Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation personally accompanied these Relics.

In India just a few days ago, I met the new Minister of External Affairs of India, Sri Salman Khurshid. Indian Ministers have told us, in so many words, that they consider the relationship with our country to be absolutely fundamental to their welfare. Of course, issues arise from time to time between countries but I assure my Hon. Friend that there is an inexhaustible reservoir of goodwill and understanding between these two countries both of which realize fully well that their destinies are inextricably intertwined in terms of history, in terms of the economy and in terms of geographical location. We have the best possible bilateral relationships with countries which are important to our well-being.

Contrary to what the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella said about China, I want to tell him that - he knows very well - one of the main uses of these visits to the United Nations General Assembly, quite apart from what happens in the plenary proceedings, is the opportunity we have to have bilateral meetings with world leaders, which would otherwise not be possible. One of the most productive

meetings I had in New York two months ago was a meeting with His Excellency Yang Jiechi, China's Minister of Foreign Affairs. He kept many important delegations waiting outside his door and spent more than 35 minutes talking to us and told us about Chinas vision of the development of their bilateral relationship with Sri Lanka. It is not mere words; it is not mere promises, but there is real substance in the relationship between China and Sri Lanka.

Then, take the Russian Federation. In my meeting with Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, who began his very distinguished diplomatic career in our country - he had his first posting in Colombo - he told me that he was very happy here. He even speaks a few words of Sinhala. As he meets you, he greets you saying Ayubowan!. He told me, You are being unfairly treated by some countries. They are imposing double standards on you. He remarked, not just to me in private, but also when he met the media and addressed them jointly with me, that in the whole business of human rights, there are no tutors and students. He also said that Russia has undertaken a comprehensive study of the human rights performance of western countries. As a result of that meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister, we were able to welcome in this country His Excellency Konstantin Dolgov, Russias Commissioner for Human Rights. He came here; the Russian Foreign Minster asked him to come here.

So, the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella must not think that the world is disappointed with our performance, the world is at daggers drawn with us. We have very powerful support from vast swathes of the globe. So, there is much else to say, Sir. No doubt, we can go into these issues in greater depth on the 30th of this month when the Ministry of External Affairs will be debated for one full day, I think for something like seven hours. Sir, I will then have the opportunity of dealing with some of these issues in greater detail, but I appreciate the constructive spirit in which the speaker who preceded me, spoke of some of the challenges confronting this country. Although I do not agree with his assessment of current circumstances - I think those assessments are really at variance with the ground reality - I do hope that in matters connected with foreign policy, which should not be partisan, it is not us and them, we all would work together. Foreign policy consists of strips and layers which have been contributed by successive Governments, by different political parties. I do hope that we will be able to work on matters pertaining to foreign policy in a spirit of partnership, which will ensure very considerable benefits for our country.

I thank you, Sir.

I quote:

It was agreed at the outset of the arguments that it is of paramount importance that the inalienable sovereignty of the people must be exercised by Parliament under the doctrine of public trust in terms of Article 4(a) of the Constitution.

Not only that, Article 148 of the Constitution states, I quote:

Parliament shall have full control .

not partial,

. over public finance.

1341 1342

[ ]

2012 16

Sir, Article 43(1) of the Constitution states, I quote:

There shall be a Cabinet of Ministers ... which shall be collectively responsible and answerable to Parliament.

On page 3, the Determination of the Supreme Court states, I quote:

which mandates that all public finance, including the control of the spring or source of the finance whether it be through taxes etc, and the control of the allocation of public finance passes through and only through the eye of Parliament, which is expected and invested with powers to act in good faith and to act in accord with the public trust doctrine by monitoring through its directions, and maintaining checks and balances through its audits and verifications, ...

And, the important part of this sentence is, I quote:

... to assure the people that there is the highest degree of fiscal accountability on the executive.

The Determination further goes on to state, I quote:

Parliament shall not abdicate or in any manner alienate its legislative power, and shall not set up any authority with legislative power.

Sir, the following is to do with the borrowing limit of Parliament brought through the Appropriation Bill to Parliament. On page 4, it states, I quote:

This Court finds that the use of the term hereby authorized, appears to be limited only to prescribing a ceiling of Rs. 1295 Billion for the raising of loans, and does not contemplate Parliamentary supervision, scrutiny or control of either the terms of the loans, the interest payable or the period of repayment. We find therefore that clause 2(1)(b) constitutes an abdication of the power of control by Parliament over fiscal matters, especially the control over the source of finances which creates a debt of the Republic, as envisaged under the terms of Article 148 of the Constitution.

The Court is clearly saying that no Appropriation Bill could only stipulate a limit of borrowing but Parliament has to have full control without abdicating its responsibility on every cent that is borrowed in the name of the people of Sri Lanka.

Furthermore, the Supreme Court Determination on page 7 states, I quote:

The Court finds that clause 7 of the Bill, presents a direct challenge to the onus on Parliament to have full control over public finance as protected by Article 148 of the Constitution. This was recognized and set out very clearly in the Determination related to the Bill titled "the 19th Amendment to the Constitution".... and set out in the Determination related to the Appropriation Bill 2008......at page 3, which recognized that full control includes, 'Control by way of allocation of public finances to the respective departments and agencies of Government and setting of limits of such expenditure' .

In other words, the Parliament cannot delegate that responsibility to any other authority but it has to take full responsibility for what it does with finance.

Sir, the Determination further states on page 7, I quote:

Accordingly, this Court finds no justification whatsoever to warrant a unilateral decision by a Minister of Finance over public finance outside Parliamentary control. And, it goes on to quote from page 35 of the Determination made on the Appropriation Bill, 1986. I quote:

'it would be anomalous for Parliament which has to exercise financial control over expenditure by the Executive to delegate that power to the very authority which it has to supervise without devising suitable checks to control the use of that power. In our view some amount of direct and actual control however nominal has to be retained by Parliament in this matter.' So, if I were to summarize, this is what the verdict says, I quote:

This Court therefore determines that clause 7(b) of said Bill in effect, contravenes the full control of public finance which belongs rightfully to Parliament in terms of Article 148, and only Parliament, and no single member of the executive should be permitted to traipse within the boundaries of that power. Therefore this Court finds that the provisions contained in clause 2(1) (b) and 7(b) of the said Appropriation Bill contravenes Article 148 of the Constitution and is therefore inconsistent with the Constitution.

The online news by Vladimir Hernandez, BBC Mundo, Montevideo states, I quote:

It's a common grumble that politicians' lifestyles are far removed from those of their electorate. Not so in Uruguay. Meet the president - who lives on a ramshackle farm and gives away most of his pay.

It goes on to state, I quote:

President Mujica has shunned the luxurious house that the Uruguayan state provides for its leaders and opted to stay at his wife's farmhouse, off a dirt road outside the capital, Montevideo.

This austere lifestyle - and the fact that Mujica donates about 90% of his monthly salary, equivalent to $12,000 (7,500), to charity - has led him to be labelled the poorest president in the world.

"'I'm called 'the poorest president', but I don't feel poor. Poor people are those who only work to try to keep an expensive lifestyle, and always want more and more,' he says.

'This is a matter of freedom. If you don't have many possessions then you don't need to work all your life like a slave to sustain them, and therefore you have more time for yourself,' he says.

This is a good example.

ADJOURNMENT

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva - Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management and Leader of the House of Parliament) , " " .

. . Question proposed.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) , ... .

DEVELOPMENT OF DAIRY FARMING AND LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. I move,

"This House is of opinion that every step must be taken to develop the dairy and livestock industry with a view to improve the living standards of those people engaged in the industry while making available ample dairy and livestock to meet the demand of the tourist trade and ensuring food security."

This is a very important Motion at this juncture because the Government has taken every step, through various Ministries, in order to help the country in agriculture, livestock, industrial production and also increase fruit and vegetable production in this country. Dairy farming also takes a very important place in our society. , . , .

In this respect Sir, even His Excellency the President while presenting his Budget - we must laud and appreciate what he said - has given pride of place for the development of dairy and livestock farming. He has given a very fine example in the Budget Speech, that he had once heard about a woman entrepreneur from the Monaragala District, which is a backward district in Sri Lanka, who engages herself in dairy farming with seven cows, each giving 10.5 litres of milk per day, that generates a daily income of Rs. 3,675. She must be a rich lady who does not go in seek of gems or gold in order to swell her income. . .

After breast milk, the best milk is cow's milk. So, this country will become a healthy nation. We can drive away malnutrition if our children are fed properly.

Sir, taking all this into consideration, the President, in all his wisdom, has proposed in his Budget Speech, to give a glass of milk, protein, and also supply the children with an extra set of uniform material and chappals or shoes for the poorest of the children.

Livestock industry is a unique economic activity that can be expanded rapidly in the country. It grows without any entrepreneur's investment because people in villages are engaged in it, as the President himself pointed out about the case in Monaragala.

1407 1408

Successive Governments have failed to exploit the full potential of this industry in our country. In this background, Sri Lanka became a nation importing dairy products. The promotion of dairy production in our country will save US Dollars 350 million a year. If we give a cow to a woman to rare in the backyards of her village, we will be able to save US Dollars 350 million of foreign exchange and will generate new income sources for our rural entrepreneurs.

Therefore, His Excellency the President has quite rightly proposed to maintain high taxes at the point of the Customs on imported milk power to encourage local milk production. This will guarantee a farmgate price of Rs. 50 per litre for fresh milk and promote around 160,000 dairy farmers. The National Milk Board and MILCO will also expand their factory capacity at Digana, Polonnaruwa and Ambewela to increase fresh milk production and dairy products at a cost of around US Dollars 40 million.

The role of livestock in agriculture in Sri Lanka is complex and significantly different from that of the industrialized nations. Although the livestock sub-sector has contributed only around 1.2 per cent to the National Gross Domestic Product - that is what the Budget says - it has been a crucial source of income for many rural smallholder farmers; livestock are a "living bank" that serves as a financial reserve for periods of economic distress.

Sir, even poultry farming is very important. We know about Bairaha, which establishment was started by that great philanthropist Alhaj M.I.M. Naleem Hajiar, whose commemoration will be taking place tomorrow in Colombo. He was a gem merchant. He did not venture into that field but saw to it that the people got the correct income - they have a market for their products. He started this and gave thousands of boys and girls employment in the village areas. That is the way this Government is venturing out in order to cater to all sections, to improve dairy farming. I think poultry food importers also must be given whatever concessions the Government could give to them.

Then, Sir, may I switch on to Tamil because for them, milk is very important as always milk and honey takes pride of place in poems and songs of the Tamil world. Avvaiyar, a great lady poet of India, amply demonstrates this in sweet poetic form -

'' , " - "

.

"Give me the three arts of expressing the Tamil language, drama, song, and the dance - , , - I will give you, in return other sweets and milk". So, that is very important. . . Whenever we go to a saiva hotel, moru is served. It is a very good drink for everyone's health and we like it. Lassi is made out of milk. It is also a very tasty sweet drink. . . . .

. Sir, Amul milk is available everywhere. The NLDB must also venture on that. I have stated this at the COPE also when they came. I went to Madras immediately after my marriage as my wifes uncle, M.M.A. Navas, was living there. I still remember the place, Harleys Road. In Tamil Nadu, men and women bring the cows to your doorstep.

. . My good friends who studied with me, Campbelabad M.S.M. Nizar, and S.M.A. Jabbar - Sathankulam Jabbar - related to me several stories about it.

, Budget . , .

, . . The late Hon. S. Thondaman made a significant commitment to develop this industry when he was the Minister in charge of this industry. But, he did not get the required support. In that background, Sri Lanka became a dairy-importing nation. The promotion of dairy products in the country will save US Dollars 350 million of foreign exchange. As I told you earlier, this is the contention of His Excellency the President also.

The Hon. Deputy Minister is here. He would give a substantial reply to this. There are 28 NLDB outlets in the country. They are at Andigama, Beligama, Bopattalawa, Dayagama, Galpokuna, Hargama, Horrekelly, Karandagolla, Kottukachchiya, Koulwewa, Mahaberitenna, Maarawila, Melsiripura, Miriswatta, Narangala, Nikaweratiya, Oyamaduwawa, Parasangahawewa, Polonnaruwa, Ridiyagama, Rosita, Rukkattana, Siringapatha, Weerawila, Welikanda and Welisara. You can increase these outlets and make them available at railway stations, in bus stands in Pettah and everywhere, because milk is so essential for the development of the human body. It gives peace of mind and good sleep to a man, thus creating a healthy nation.

I thank you very much, Sir, for giving me this opportunity.

(a) (i) Yes.

(ii) Yes.

(iii) Yes. (b) (i) Legal proceeding with regard to incidents of Domestic Violence is initiated at the Magistrate Courts. Though we requested the Ministry of Justice for the relevant information we were told that Ministry of Justice is not in possession of such information. Legal proceedings are initiated by the victims through either the police or private counsel or the Legal Aid Commission of Sri Lanka. Therefore we are not in possession of such information. (ii) National Committee on Women has conducted 4 workshops in 2010 to sensitize Hon. Judges on the incidents of Domestic Violence. These programmes were conducted in collaboration with the Judges Institute of Sri Lanka. Though the Act provides for granting interim orders within 14 days, there are no provisions for compensation for victims due to delays in court process. It is the duty of the Magistrate Courts to examine the case within the stipulated time. Therefore such information should be requested from the Ministry of Justice. (iii) There are no provisions for a stipulated time period for an interim order. Nevertheless, till the protection order is given by courts or till the interim order is cancelled by courts, interim order will remain in force. (iv) A research is conducted by the National Committee on Women on the effects of the implementation of the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act No.34 of 2005 and

asked the Minister of Education:

(a) Is he aware that - (i) Mr. M.A. Abajulfan residing at No. 4/5, Common Road, Addalaichenai 14, faced the interview for recruitment to Class-III of Sri Lanka Teacher Educators Service on 01.06.2006; and

(ii) his name has not been recommended to the Public Service Commission to appoint him to the aforesaid post up to now, eventhough he has fulfilled all the qualifications? (b) Will he state whether action will be taken to refer the recommendation of the Ministry of Education to the Public Service Commission to grant him the promotion that he is entitled to, implementing the recommendation issued by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRC/2775/09) with relevance to the above matter (as per Public Administration Circular No. 17/2005) ?
