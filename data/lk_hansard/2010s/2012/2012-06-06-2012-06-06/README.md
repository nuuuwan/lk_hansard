, . . , , . [2.18 p.m.] ... ( ) ( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Urban Affairs) Mr. Speaker, I rise with great respect to pay tribute to a senior politician and one-time Deputy Minister, the late Hon. Ratna Deshapriya Senanayake. I am very thankful that I got this opportunity to recall the memory of a highly-cultured gentleman politician who had been one of those rare men with great qualities. As his name indicates, he is a real Ratna among Gem of men.

I had the fortune of associating with him when he was a Deputy Minister, during which period I was the Mayor of Colombo. His services to the people of Sri Lanka, particularly to the people of the Minneriya Electorate, have been unique. He was very sociable as he was a journalist attached to the Lankadeepa newspaper in his early days. He transcended the boundaries of race, religion, caste and creed and embraced all people alike.

The Hon. Ratna Deshapriya Senanayake was a well-known lawyer, who was a tower of strength to the progressive movements led by the SLFP for over 50 years. I had the opportunity of visiting Indonesia when he was serving as the Sri Lankan Ambassador in Indonesia. I still remember that despite his position as Ambassador, he volunteered to accompany me whenever I wanted to do shopping.

As a Deputy Minister, he rendered an excellent service. As a man, he fostered fellowship among the different ethnic communities; he was an ardent believer in multiculturalism and ethnic harmony. He always looked at the problems of the people with great understanding and an open mind. His approach to the various issues had been unique in respect of each issue. He was particularly careful not to offend anyone.

He was a revolutionary and progressive politician whose concern was the welfare of the people. He was an honest and clean politician and his life can be emulated as a model by all present-day politicians. He proved himself as a peoples leader and he was a good listener who was always ready to help those who came to him seeking his assistance.

Sir, I join the Hon. Members of this House in paying my highest tribute to him and conveying my deepest condolences to the members of his family.

Thank you.

[2.44 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, this House has seen many colourful personalities who represented the people. There had been revolutionaries, socialists, communists, rightists, leftists, liberals, progressives and some even called others "reactionaries". That has been the history of this Parliament and from time to time, age after age. Such men added colour and dignity to this House. One such person who comes to my mind, who had always been a colourful and a dignified personality, was our dear Friend, former Member of Parliament and Deputy Minister, the Hon. Ratna Deshapriya Senanayake.

Sir, he was a very clever lawyer too. I remember seeing him on his feet in the courts. At that time, I rated him only second to Dr. Colvin R. de Silva in his style of legal arguments and the way he cross-examined witnesses. He was very robust. At times, he was aggressive and at times as a true style of a lawyer, he appeared to be very mild. But, he was able to extract the truth out of witnesses and get the judgment on his side.

Sir, I came to know the Hon. Ratna Deshapriya Senanayake together with our veteran trade union leader and Governor of the Western Province, "Jamal-al-Lail" Alhaj As-Seyed Alavi Moulana. I used to go with Governor Alavi Moulana for meetings organized by the Chinese Wing of the Communist Party and the Sri Lanka-China Friendship Association. Thereafter, Sir, I became very friendly with him. It was more so after having met in this House, his brother, the amiable and great Parliamentarian, who was full of humour and laughter, the Hon. Dharmasiri Senanayake who was the Minister of Media, Tourism and Aviation. He always held a sway in any debate in this House. I should say, Sir, that I had never met a person like him, who carried no hatred or malice against any other Member of Parliament. I used to cross words with him in this House. I used to fight for the rights of the former Air Ceylon employees. I get appeals from them even now. Whenever I fought with the Hon. Dharmasiri Senanayake - the able and younger brother of the Hon. Ratna Deshapriya Senanayake - he used to come out, pat on my shoulders and tell me, Azwer, you are doing a wonderful job for your party. So much so, Sir, when the inaugural flight was launched from Colombo to

265 266

Dhaka, what did I hear? The Hon. Dharmasiri Senanayake was telling me, You are selected by me to go on the inaugural flight with the Hon. Minister (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, the Hon.(Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa and others. I was amazed, I could not believe my eyes. That is the way the family of the Hon. Ratna Deshapriya Senanayake showed love and affection to us. They always had the interests of their fellow men at their hearts.

Then, Sir, I met Ratna Deshapriya as Ambassador in Jakarta, Indonesia. The Committee on Public Enterprises headed by the Hon. D.P. Wickremasinghe, accompanied by the Members of the Committee, the Hon. John Amaratunga, Chief Whip of the Opposition today, the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, who is a Minister today and several others went there. He had a party for us. He was a colourful personality. He danced his way through and made all of us happy.

When he was in the Dedigama Electorate, I used to meet him at times in the Kal-Eliya Arabic College and at other Muslim schools in that electorate. Incidentally, the Kal-Eliya Arabic College is the first Arabic College for Muslim females. I see today in the Gallery, a galaxy of Muslim students wearing the fardha and hijab, who have come to Parliament today. He helped this Arabic College, the Thihariya Home for the Disabled and several other institutions.

Although he was a progressive and a fighter, he was very much liberal at his heart. He catered to the needs of all communities, not only in Mirigama and Dedigama, but also in Minneriya and other places.

I was one of those people who were attracted by his writings. The Hon. Ratna Deshapriya Senanayake came under the tutelage of the great doyen of journalism, D.B. Dhanapala. He used to excel in writing in Sinhala. He wrote a regular column called, Vanahi - " , , " . He whacked at the so-called reactionaries, the bourgeoisie class or company owners who failed to give proper wages to the people who worked very hard.

The Hon. Ratna Deshpriya Senanayake served as the Deputy Minister of Information and Supplies under the then Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. He was also the Minister of Planning in the Bandaranaike regime. He served the SLFP with dedication and commitment. Having served as Chairman, CWE from 1960 to 1965, he was appointed Deputy President of the SLFP in 1980, giving strong leadership to the party in the Polonnaruwa District.

The Hon. Ratna Dehsapriya Senanayake was a well-known journalist, an able lawyer, who was a tower of strength to the progressive movements of the country led

by the SLFP for over 50 years. He was an honest and clean politician. In his varied life, he was one who never gave in to any undue influences politically, socially or in community life. As an honest and clean politician, his life can be emulated as a model by all present-day politicians.

The Hon. Ratna Dehsapriya Senanayake served this House with distinction for 6 years and 28 days.

I wish him eternal bliss and may his soul be sanctified!

Thank you.

[4.02 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, I rise to express my condolences on the demise of the Hon. Vaidyacharya W.I. Fernando with whom we were very pally in this House.

Sir, in 1989 five of us came to this Parliament on the National List. As pointed out by my Friend who spoke earlier, we represented varied fields of activities. There was the Hon. Alec Robertson who represented the Burgher community. He, in fact, was a very renowned Buddhist lay preacher. Then, there was the Hon. Kalinga Obeywansa representing the arts and crafts here. He excelled in Bera Wadanaya, which is a tradition of the Sri Lankan community in this country. Then, there was the Hon. M.H. Amit, who represented the Malay community. His father-in-law was that great educationist and national leader, Dr. T.B. Jayah, who represented the Legislative Council. He occupied a distinguished position in our Legislature. Dr. T.B. Jayah first represented the Legislative Council during the time of the British Raj. Next, he represented the State Council under the British colonial rule. Then, he represented the independent Parliament and became the first Muslim Cabinet Minister. The Hon. Amit was his son-in-law and also his private secretary. So, he knew many problems of Ceylons politics. They always stood for a united Sri Lanka - the Malay community and the Moor community.

From time immemorial, even during the period of the Dutch-Portuguese, the Muslims who were chased away from the coastal areas found solace in the Kandyan Kingdom. The Kandyan Kings liked those Muslims, our forefathers very much for they have been very great Ayurvedic - Unani physicians like the great personality to whom we are making reference in this House, the Hon. W.I. Fernando Veda Mahata. This Veda Mahattaya used to relate to us in the Lobby that the Muslims at that time administered indigenous medicine to the King and the Kings family. When the Bisawa or the Princess in the palace took ill, the Ayurvedic - Unani Muslim Physician had felt the pulse of the patient through a noola - a

285 286

thread - held by the patient on the other side of the thiraya. . . , a superb medical system was developed of our own in ancient times. That is how the Muslims and the Sinhalese came to live so closely as friends, sharing their respective cultural values. They were given lands in the hill country as a result of the great medical attention paid by them.

. 51 . , , . That is what this great local Sri Lankan physician told his friends when he was nominated to Parliament. When his Friends told him, Now, you have to cut your konde, he said, No, I shall not and even ". That is why the Leader of the Opposition dwelled at length about how the Veda Mahattayas dress was recognized as a part of the attire of this Legislature. No one else had been wearing that type of a dress. He was a hilarious, very humorous figure. We have yet to meet a person of the calibre of the Hon. W.I. Fernando in this House.

. . , .. - who was a Malay Member - ," , , " . belt . tie , chain . , . , he wore that outside. , " , . ." . Members in the Legislative Council such as the Hon. M.C. Abdul Rahman, the Hon. W.M. Abdul Rahman and later Sir Razik Fareed and the Hon. N.H.M. Abdul Cader wore fez caps. . . . fez caps .

Sir, this distinguished personality served as a colourful figure in this House for 4 years, 8 months and 17 days. Unfortunately, he had to cut his Parliamentary journey in 1993, a little shorter than we did after coming into Parliament, because he had to give way for the late Hon. Anura Bandaranaike to come to Parliament. He did not mind it because he had no love or lust for positions. He sacrificed his seat straightaway and gave it to the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike.
