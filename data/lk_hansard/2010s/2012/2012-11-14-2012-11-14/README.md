I hope you could understand all that jargon.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What makes you think that I do not understand it? Do you understand what you told Parliament?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Your sarcasm is good for your party, not for the Opposition.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, no. Some of those translations have to be explained.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Just because your professor does not understand, do you think that we also do not understand it? Do not think of us at that level.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I am only talking about the jargon. You cannot understand a joke also.

885 886

- * . . Document not tendered.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I have a sense of humour that you do not seem to have. Just because you are mature in age and profession, it does not mean that you need to be sarcastic.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am not a bloody jumping jackass. [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

Hon. Minister, my first Supplementary Question is this. The SLECIC was incorporated then by the Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali to ensure that exports to countries to which normal exporting terms do not apply are given a comfort factor. But now, the SLECIC does not seem to be giving a comfort factor to certain areas to which Sri Lankan exporters can export without fear. For exports to countries like Iran, Iraq and Russia, the SLECIC does not offer any insurance covers. So, would this Ministry help the exporters - there are quite a lot of exporters - who want to export to those countries? But, owing to the fact that a conducive climate for exports is non-prevalent in those countries, that is not offered. Therefore, could you please ensure that the very motive for bringing SLECIC into existence is brought into play at this moment? Did you understand what I said?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I agree with what you say because there are so many obstacles to local exporters, particularly in the legal field. Only yesterday, with His Excellency the President of Uganda, we discussed the necessity of -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Ugandan President? () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes, he is here. You may not know but he happens to be here. - [Interruption.] I will explain to you. I am, with some degree of responsibility, trying to tell you that what you said is correct because there are so many exporters and so many investors, particularly in the mini-hydro field, who cannot get there because of the absence of an import-export bank in Sri Lanka. They cannot get that type of credit easily, which many other investors in other

countries can do. For example, in India. As you know, most of these countries are going towards setting up import-export banks. So, I am only confirming what you said, that we have to look at those instruments and create new instruments which would help exporters as well as investors because our policy is to allow our blue-chip companies and our good investors to go and invest in other countries as well. So, there is no contradiction.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My question is not about an import-export bank or helping blue-chip companies. The concept of the Hon. Lalith Athulath Mudali then was to help the small and medium enterprises to go into countries to which hitherto we have never exported. It is not an import-export bank.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) So, that is exactly what I said.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, that is not what my question is about. You have to answer my question, not say what you feel should be said. My question was about ensuring that you help the small and medium exporters to take our exports to countries that they never think they could go. To countries such as Iran and Iraq, people do not want to export these days because there is no L/C that performs.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) So, what is your question?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) My point is that insurance premium should be to that type of countries. Why has SLECIC not allowed that and is not doing so? When the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghes Government was there, when this was in our charge, we ensured that we went into these types of things. The then Chairman, Mr. Hemaka de Alwis, ensured that we went into it but since 2005, they have stopped it.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) All this lecturing is of absolutely no use. Can you give me some examples where a particular -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Oman - [Interruption.]

887 888

2012 14

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) If you can give me some specific examples, I can answer. Otherwise, how can I answer? Hon. Speaker, how on earth can I answer these highly generalized and, in my opinion, fictitious statements in this House?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I told you just now. Iran -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) If you give me specific cases that Mr. "X" or so-and-so wanted to export to such and such a country and was deprived of that by the SLECIC, then I can give you an answer. But, how can I give answers to this sort of fishing expeditions? - [Interruption.] So, give an example.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . -[ ]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Almost Rs. 10 billion accrued in Russia was lost to Ukraine. So, where is SLECIC? Is it helping?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) So, ask that as a question.

The Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka has issued the report titled, "State of the Economy 2012". This report has just been released. It is very interesting. I would like to bring to the attention of the House the crisis that we are facing in forest cover.

Page 66 of the report states:

The depletion of forest resources and associated losses in biodiversity have been long discussed environmental issues in Sri Lanka. The extent of natural forest in 2010 was estimated to be 1,883,310 ha, which accounts for nearly 28.7 per cent..

Now the Proposal in the Budget has been to increase this to over 30 per cent.

. , , , . , .

, . . , , . .

Page 69 of the Policy Report very clearly states and highlights the problems we are faced with regard to water resources. I hope we will be able to follow these policies so that we will not be threatened heavily by the climate change mentioned in page 71.

, . . . , (US$) 350 .

, . . .. . . Page 80 of the report states:

Currently, Sri Lankas Tertiary education system caters to only a very small proportion of the population. Due to the limited number of placements in the state funded universities, only 17 per cent of those who qualify for university education gain admission to State Universities. Each year, more than 100,000 qualified students are forced to abandon their ambitions to enter university. Compared to other comparable countries, the number of students enrolled in tertiary education is extremely low in Sri Lanka. For example, in 2009, only 3.6 per cent of 20 - 24 year olds were enrolled in a university while only a further 3.6 per cent of the same age group was enrolled in technical and vocational training

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) , . In conclusion, Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, when one examines the intricate substance of this Budget, I am led to believe that the decision-making structure suffers from major deficiencies. This Government lacks a sound fiscal policy stance. The monetary policy of this country depicts incongruence, incompetence and ignorance. I would like to coin the basis on which this Budget was formulated. I would like to call it the "Voodoo Economic Theory" that has been propagated by this Government. Actually disjointed incrementalism as expounded by Charles Lindblom has been the main methodology that this Government has adopted in terms of financial decision making.

In conclusion, let me quote from the speech made by John F. Kennedy in his inaugural address in 1961. He stated, I quote:

Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.

On this occasion, we on this side of the political aisle would like to reflect on what late President John F. Kennedy stated. We on this side of the political aisle shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to ensure that our mother Lanka is peaceful and prosperous.

With the Universal Periodic Review and the CHOGM due next year, I think there is a very critical and important year ahead for the Government.

While we welcome the allocation of Rs. 500 million to implement LLRC recommendations, we suggest that the Government acts with more credibility.

The recent outbreak in the prison will not help us and the impeachment against the CJ is also not going to be looked at favourably by the international community. Having said that, I strongly recommend to the Government to rethink of their foreign policy. We cannot challenge the West. Instead, we should use them for the betterment of our country and its future.

I would like to quote Sir Winston Churchill, who said:

When I am abroad, I always make it a rule never to criticize or attack the government of my own country. I make up for lost time when I come home.

This is exactly what we do. We do not condemn the President. We do not condemn the Government when we go abroad. But, here in this House, it is our duty and solemn responsibility to make constructive criticism that is needed by the Members of the Opposition. Therefore, we will support the Government and urge it to work without challenging the Western World. We need to support to uplift the nation that we love and to act with integrity and more solidarity keeping our political differences aside.

[3.36 p.m.]

( ) ( () - , ) (The Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa - Deputy Minister of Water Supply and Drainage) Hon. Presiding Member, the eighth Budget of the UPFA Government presented by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa on the 8th of November would benefit our entire population. It is driven with the objective of achieving peace and reconciliation and ushering in fast-track development programmes to the country.

985 986

We have entered into an era of tranquility and accelerated development. President Mahinda Rajapaksas Budget Proposals seek to maximize this situation and aim to transform the country into a poverty-free State with a vibrant society. The eighth Budget has been conceived in furtherance of the development-based Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future.

The assumption of leadership of our nation by His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa proved to be a turning point in our political history and paved the path for unity and harmony amongst the diverse communities fragmented by the 30-year long war. His dynamic efforts to develop the economy through numerous projects while, at the same time, seeking peace and reconciliation of our communities have already yielded resounding success, and I must add, within a very short span of time. Today, Sri Lanka is visibly transforming into an upper middle-income country which will surely achieve a per capita income of US Dollars 4,000 by the year 2016.

The national Budget must provide not only for the present, but for the future as well. Accordingly, President Mahinda Rajapaksa has submitted to the House what one would refer to as a forward-looking Budget. It is a development-focused Budget, which will benefit the rural farmers and the low-income groups. It seeks to boost medium enterprise. It is bent towards protecting and fostering democracy so that all citizens enjoy equally the benefits of the post-war economic boom.

This Budget has been prepared in consultation with numerous staketholders - farmer organizations, trade unions, employer organizations and several other relevant groups. It factors in the interests of all sections of the population. The basic tenor of this Budget is the achievement of a poverty-free Sri Lanka. It is built on the premise of providing gainful employment opportunities to the under-privileged segments of the population. It leans heavily towards nursing remote villages in facilitating access to basic amenities such as water and electricity. The Governments novel programme Divineguma has already reached approximately 2.5 million households, which are now engaged in food production, livestock and cottage industries, poultry farming and dairy production. The programme has generated a significant number of new sources of income for rural entrepreneurs.

Sir, I am particularly happy to note that my Ministry, the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage, has received an allocation of Rs. 2,200 million in the 2013 Budget Estimates. This provision has been made for water supply improvements in several districts, which will see that the rural communities obtain safe drinking water.

It has been the policy of the UPFA Government to encourage and support the farmer communities. The 2013 Budget Proposals contain several measures to boost

production, seed supply and storage facilities. The increase of the guaranteed price for paddy from Rs. 32 to Rs. 35 per kilo from the next "Maha" season will surely assist the farmer communities immensely. His Excellency the President has also ensured that the farmers who were affected by the drought will recover fast. Accordingly, the Budget proposes to provide seed paddy for the Maha cultivation free of charge to all farmers in drought-stricken areas and the deferment of recovery of agricultural loans and the writing-off of interests on the loans.

The health sector has been given top priority, by the provision of Rs. 125 billion for 2013. Under the modernization programme, the number of doctors, nurses, paramedical officers, technical and support staff are to be increased. The Government is also taking the initiative to manufacture pharmaceutical products locally. With regard to support staff, the Health Ministry has taken action to recruit 5,000 persons from all over the country.

The Budget also addresses the needs of the small enterprises, by exempting them from the NBT and the VAT, which will greatly contribute towards their business growth and expansion. The needs of the smallholder plantation sector have been addressed by the increase of replanting subsidies and the introduction of new plantation subsidies.

Sir, an area of economic activity that has shown tremendous growth is tourism. We wish to thank the Minister of Economic Development, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, for his well-thought-out plans and strategy in developing this industry. This year alone has witnessed over one million foreign tourists and foreign earnings of billion dollars. New hotels are mushrooming in various places including Kalpitiya, Pasikuda, Yala, Kuchchaveli and Nilaveli. This will not only generate foreign exchange but also provide employment opportunities, particularly for the youth.

His Excellency the President has not forgotten our war veterans, Ranaviru who freed our country from terrorism, in this Budget. They have been amply rewarded for the sacrifices they made for the country by the provision of Rs. 1,000 million for development of housing schemes for them and their families.

His Excellency, through the Budget Proposals for 2013, proposes to set up a new Pay Commission to formulate a National Wage Policy to address the concerns of both the Public sector and the private sector. Public servants will also get an increase in their allowances by a minimum of Rs. 1,500 from next year. Pensioners will get an increase in the Cost of Living Allowance by Rs. 500 from January 2013.

Sir,I wish to draw your attention to the extensive work done by the Government in Colombo and Sri

987 988

2012 14

Jayawardenepura. Today, the Independence Square and the board walk around the Diyawanna Oya provide safe and splendid surroundings for people to walk and exercise. The beautiful green City of Colombo, its suburbs and other cities provide the much-needed environment to develop a population of healthy body and mind. The Environment Protection Unit of the Police enforces the Environmental Law which keeps the City clean and tidy. Needless to say, beautiful and clean cities are hallmarks of economic development and progressive thinking.

Roads have been developed, small canals have been cleaned out, the rainwater draining systems have been cleared and garbage collection has been streamlined. In the last couple of weeks, Colombo did not experience flooding, although there was heavy rainfall. The credit for all these goes to Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development.

Sir, we had the privilege of successfully sponsoring the 58th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. Democracy has been restored in Sri Lanka and resettlement of displaced and affected families in the North is nearing completion. The Government has taken action to implement the LLRC recommendations which will safeguard the minority issues.

Mega projects such as the Moragahakanda Irrigation Project which provides water to the Iranamadu Tank, the Maththala Airport Project, islandwide road construction, irrigation and water supply schemes, the beautification of cities, towns and the creation of small townships will make Sri Lanka The Wonder of Asia within a few years.

Sir, I respectfully request the House to unanimously endorse the eighth Budget of the UPFA. Let us support His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa to lead our nation to the ideal state, where each and every Sri Lankan, regardless of religion, ethnicity, caste, creed and social or economic background, can live peacefully with dignity and contentment.

Thank you.

This is how it is stated in the "Lankaweb":

According to the information provided, foreigners were conspicuous among the former Prime Ministers advisers. One Mr. John Earl who was brought down by Ranil Wickremasinghe for publicity work during the 1999 Presidential Election and later named as consultant to the unit set up to develop a master plan for Strategic Communication was paid US Dollars 239,280 per year. Accordingly, his monthly pay was US Dollars 19,940 or Rs. 2,053,820. It is also a well-guarded but popular secret that whatever his designation, John Earls main function appeared to be that of selecting the former Prime Ministers clothing, and providing him with speech training and strategies to create dissension in opposition ranks. A reflection of the Prime Ministers insecurities perhaps!

One Mr. A.G. Cuthbertson who was appointed as an adviser for strengthening Government capacity was paid US Dollars 227,625 per year, which amounted to Rs 1,953,781 monthly. Two other so-called advisers Trent J. Bertrand and Thomas Maxwell were paid US Dollars 232,625 each per year, which amounted to Rs. 1,996,697 monthly each. James W. Robertson who was former Prime Ministers Senior Economic Adviser was paid US Dollars 214,000 per year, which amounted to Rs. 1,836,833 monthly.

Sir, the source of these funds have been a loan granted by the World Bank during the last stages of the PA Government.
