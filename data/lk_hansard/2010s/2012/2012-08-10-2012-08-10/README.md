DEVELOPING A STRONG SRI LANKAN IDENTITY

[2.00 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I move,

That this Parliament resolves that the requirement to state ones race and religion in government documents is an impediment and an inhibition to develop a strong national identity be dispensed with.

Thank you, Hon. Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to move a Private Members' Motion at a time when I think it is most appropriate and timely. As you know, Sri Lanka is a little Island in the Indian Ocean, which is striving to ensure that we make a very prosperous Sri Lanka. We are blessed owing to the fact that we have a multiracial and multireligious society. The very composition of this fabric is what makes a truly Sri Lankan identity. But,owing to the fact that we have been led by many foreign nations before Independence and subsequently politicians who have utilized their political power not in order to ensure that we put Sri Lanka together but sometimes to polarize us has led to a breach of the Sri Lankan identity, from my perspective. Therefore, it is timely that we look at Sri Lanka from its proper perspective. You look at countries such as Singapore, which has three big communities; you look at Malaysia, they can be proud when they say that they are Singaporeans, they are Malaysians. Even if you go to bigger countries such as India, you have the same feeling that comes out of them naturally rather than it is extracted out of them. When I add Malaysia, Singapore, I would also like to add Switzerland, which has many races that get together and make the Swiss community.

Hon. Deputy Speaker, you could see that the Portuguese led us from 1505 to 1796, the Dutch from 1796 to 1815 and the British from 1815 to 1948, that was the pre-Independence period. The post-Independence has led us for more of a economic change that took place. But, the most important aspect that comes today is: are we, Sri Lankans united in its purpose? Are we, Sri Lankans, moving towards a strong Sri Lankan identity that we can basically boast ourselves of? We have it in

935 936

us. But, why is it that we are unable to cherish the goals that we can look at. We have gone through many turbulent times; we have gone through racial problems. Thank God, we have not gone through any religious problems but we can see the makings of such taking place in the last couple of months.

So, we must ensure that we eradicate this irritance, this sand in the gears, so that we move forward towards a strong Sri Lankan identity. What do I mean by a strong Sri Lankan identity? In 1948, when Sri Lanka obtained the Independence from the British, the Right Honourable D.S. Senanayake, the Leader of the United National Party, basically had the support of all the Muslims, the Tamils. They really came together as Sri Lankans and got that Independence from the British. It was a very proud moment. We must thank all communities for assisting to get the Independence from the British without shedding any blood at all. Sometimes, because it comes so easy, the value of it is not known. But, now you could see that we are compartmentalized - the Sinhalese from one aspect, the Muslims from the other aspect and the Tamils from another aspect. I strongly believe that it is a time that we have got to look to forge the strengths together and ensure that we call ourselves a truly Sri Lankan identity. Do we not and should we not do so? After all, the industriousness of the Tamils, the business acumen of the Muslims and the large heartedness of the Sinhalese make a Sri Lankan identity, very rich.

So, at this particular moment, when we have gone through one of the worst terrorist problems that have come to an end, it is time that we re-look at ourselves and ensure that we take the rich culture that is there and ensure that we incorporate this into a Sri Lankan identity.

So, Hon. Deputy Speaker and Members, it is my intention that forwarding such an idea would only help to foster a strong Sri Lankan identity that we all look at. But, in todays context, the problem is that there are religious and racial parties that have come up. That breaks the very fabric that basically brings us together. I do not want to reawaken or create a political problem. But, I need to corroborate with evidence as to why we need to get together. I am happy that we have a Minister like the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, who does not think in line with the political Party that is governing today. He is not a racial or a chauvinistic person like the governing Party that he belongs to. So, this is, I guess, an opportune moment, Hon. Minister that you strive to do so and hope that we take this opportunity also.

But, look at todays composition, your heterogeneous alliance. You have parties that fight for elections on a religious basis. The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress was in alliance with the United National Party. They used that, got the votes and moved over to the Government. Today,

they are fighting for Provincial Councils, not from the Government but outside the Government. So, you could see that this is an auctioning of the Sri Lankan Muslim voters. I can see even the Government is basically taking that same line. Certain Members questioned as to why there is this religious orientation to the Provincial Council Election. The two big Parties that were there have been rendering yeoman service.

Unfortunately, in 1988, at that particular moment owing to executive action, the 12.5 per cent cut-off was reduced to 5 per cent. That led to an opening of the floodgates and this made the racial call, the religious call coming in and trying to bring unwanted problems to our Sri Lankan identity. So, I guess, we need to get back to that strong thinking because this is where we can move Sri Lanka to a better tomorrow. After all, is it not incumbent on us? We have seen 30 years of terrorist rule. It is not one government, it is not one leader, it is collectively each ones lack of responsibility or doing too little too late that led to the polarization of the Sri Lankan identity.

Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am happy that you are in the Chair at this particular moment. Why is it that we are unable to get together? We have strong neighbours, such as India. But, owing to the fact that we have been moving away from her, we saw in Geneva that India had even voted against us. You cannot say that it was a political decision. It was not an international decision. But, owing to the fact that we, in Sri Lanka, cannot work together as a Sri Lankan identity, is what led to this. That is my perspective.

My Party, the United National Party, is the most apt Party that brings all these communities together. The Right Honourable D.S. Senanayake started this after gaining Independence in 1948. At that time he had the courage of conviction to say that we are getting the Independence from the British. We must be competent and now that we have to carry on the future by ourselves, we must ensure that together with the Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims, the Burghers and the Malays - before too long, you would see the advent of the Chinese also coming in - we must have a Sri Lankan identity and be able to guide our destiny to a strong and best Sri Lankan identity.

He echoed those words and I re-echo those words at this particular moment because I think what he said then was sagacious. He had the sagacity to think and say that there could be a rupture in that. It did not take long. When you had the racial riots, it was further exaggerated with the many things that followed thereafter and today, we only see the spills and the thrills that are out there.

Sir, I do not wish to labour too much on that but all I want to say on the Floor of this House is that we, the 225 Members, have the right to take Sri Lanka towards a

937 938

[ ]

2012 10

better tomorrow. When you are on the election platform, you basically extol the virtues of every voter but once you are elected, you compartmentalize them, brutalizing the Sri Lankan identity. It is a crying shame on all of us! So, it is nothing but right to right the wrong. It is never too late to do the right thing at the right time. So, here is the opportunity. Instead of thinking chauvinistically to survive politically, we must be able to go beyond that. This is a time when we have a Leader of the Opposition who came forward statesmanly and said that a strong Sri Lankan identity is more important than looking at it from a political perspective. But, sometimes, that is taken as a weakness of the Opposition. No, that is the strength of the Opposition. That is why we are able to get all the political parties to march forward with the United National Party towards a Sri Lankan identity. Nobody fears talking to us because they know that we are not a racially-driven or a religiously-driven party. We can look after the Sinhalese; we can look after the Tamils and we can look after the Muslims. That is why we are called the United National Party. So, why do we not extend this towards building a strong Sri Lankan identity? I call upon all the Hon. Members to support this Motion. Let us turn a new leaf today so that we all will be able to get together and ensure that we take Sri Lanka towards a better tomorrow.

Sir, I do not want to take too much of time. All I want to do is to elicit your fullest support because I know that your thinking is in the same direction. So, please ensure that you support this Motion and that we move forward, putting behind our past sins, towards a stronger tomorrow.

Thank you. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Then, I call upon the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne to second the Motion.

[2.12 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Hon. Deputy Speaker, it gives me great pleasure in seconding the Motion brought by the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake about developing a strong Sri Lankan Identity. He also suggests that "Parliament resolves that the requirement to state ones race and religion in government documents is an impediment and an inhibition to develop a strong national identity".

We all are Sri Lankans. Then, what is the problem? Why was it such a problem when the Hon. Sampanthan waved the Sri Lankan Flag at the May Day Rally? It was welcomed by all the Sinhalese but some Tamils did not welcome it. The reason for that is, our Sri Lankaness has

been appropriated by the majority community in the eyes of the minority. We are now after a conflict which inevitably polarizes a country. However, we have an opportunity to look at unity in a new way. It has to be a unity based on equality, a unity not based on assimilation of others. Conflict polarizes, but now, we have a new opportunity. We need to appeal to the new generation to come up with their ideas as to how they would like to see our Sri Lankaness exhibited in a manner that everybody could feel strongly about it.

The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake dealt with issues regarding the Sri Lankan identity, which are very broad. In the very limited time I have, I thought of dealing with some practical issues we come across in encouraging building a Sri Lankan identity. Today, I asked from a Tamil Colleague for his National Identity Card. I found that the front of that Identity Card is in the Sinhala language, but when I turned the other side, I found the details given in both the Sinhala language and the Tamil language while those of ours, who are Sinhala-speaking, are only in Sinhala language. So, I want to know why we have this kind of differentiation. I think there are practical reasons. -[Interruption.]

I was saying that the front of the National Identity Card is in the Sinhala language. Being a Sinhala speaker, the reverse side of my Identity Card is written only in the Sinhala language. But, the reverse of my Tamil-speaking Friend's Identity Card, which I got, is written both in the Sinhala language and the Tamil language. So, the question I am posing is, why is there such a differentiation when all our Identity Cards should be written both in the Sinhala language and the Tamil language, including the front side of it?

Today, we are talking about creating a Sri Lankan identity and we need to take every practical measure in strengthening that Sri Lankan identity. I am glad to note that in the issue of birth certificates of recent times, the reference to race and religion has been deleted. So, what the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake is suggesting is that we go further.

Also, we know that recently, there had been some controversy in terms of singing the National Anthem. The National Anthem of a country is something which every citizen of that country should be able to get up and sing proudly. In the Sinhala version of the Sri Lankan Constitution, the National Anthem is referred to in page 167. " 7 " . So, it is there in the Sinhala version. When I looked at the Tamil version of the Sri Lankan Constitution, both the words and the tune are specified in page 205. I know that the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara and the Hon. DEW Gunasekara themselves, Cabinet Ministers in the Government, have been very concerned about these issues and have taken a strong stand that the National

939 940

Anthem should be sung in both languages. However, I am a little dismayed that Recommendation 9.277 in the National Plan of Action to implement the recommendations of the LLRC states, Maintain and support current practice of the National Anthem being sung simultaneously in two languages. That is the recommendation. Under the activity column, it states, Examine the implementation of this recommendation vis a vis the current Constitutional provisions, at the PSC. I find that rather amusing because that is already in the Constitution. The PSC has not yet been formulated and it is being referred to the PSC. The key institution or the agency vested with this responsibility is the Presidential Secretariat and the key performance indicator that they are looking for is the recommendations from the PSC. My submission to this House is, that which is already in the Sri Lankan Constitution needs to be implemented without reference to any other authority because the Constitution is supreme. Therefore, I urge the Government and particularly the Minister, that we do not wait till all these intuitions are formed for their recommendations, but we move ahead implementing the provisions of the Constitution which are already there and that we sing the National Anthem in two languages. It is so important that those who feel excluded feel included in the New Sri Lanka.

In Singapore, the Malays are a minority, but the National Anthem of Singapore is sung in the Malay language. I think it was foresighted by the Chinese leaders of Singapore that they should bring in the minority into the centre of their ethos, into the heart of the Singaporean ethos and I think it is a lesson we could learn. If we look at a country like South Africa, which has also come out of a very difficult situation, the National Anthem of that country is sung in four different languages. But, in Sri Lanka, we have constitutional provisions which we are not implementing and I think if we take steps to implement it by singing in the two languages, it will actually help to create a Sri Lankan identity, which everyone will feel a part of.

Sir, I do not wish to speak any further. We are Sri Lankans but we are Sri Lankan Sinhalese; we are Sri Lankan Tamils; we are Sri Lankan Muslims. The problem is, what we now call Sri Lanka, everybody cannot still fully identify themselves with. Therefore, we, irrespective of our political parties - because we are talking of something in common - should work together to create that identity so that the tension that we see even now in this election season could be overcome if we are truly committed to an all-inclusive philosophy. Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

The strong identity is this, Sir. We do not want Sri Lankans - whatever their race or religion - to go out and conspire against the democratically elected Government by a large majority of the people in this country. They carry tales to Geneva. It is a shame, Sir. Those are the people who have taken the oath to uphold the Constitution, the sovereignty and the independence of our nation. They can be tried, Sir. Even Members of Parliament could be removed by bringing in special Motions before the House. Now, there is this TESO. Their Geneva talk is over. TESO is asking for a Tamil Eelam but Delhi has told, Do not ask for it. Today, there is a nice article by Cho Ramaswamy who is a great advocate of India. He says:

- '' , '' - - " " . . '' '' , .

We have to declare him persona non grata - - and banish him out of the country. Therefore, Sir, we will have our identities: the Muslim identity; the Sinhala identity; the Tamil identity; the Burgher identity and the Malay identity and march forward as one Sri Lankan nation as envisaged by "Mahinda Chintana"!

Thank you.

[2.34 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir. I am glad to speak on this Motion moved by the Hon. Member for Colombo and I am further glad to speak at a time when you are in the Chair and quite unusually after a speech you made, something that we can agree on. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Thank you. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) You are welcome. The Hon. Member, while moving the Motion referred to the first Prime Minister, the Right Honourable D.S. Senanayake, twice in his speech and, Sir, you also referred to the first Prime Minister. But, I

would like to remind this House that although it is true that all communities in this country jointly asked for Independence, gained it and celebrated together, very soon the trust that the minorities reposed in the majority community of this country was broken and that was broken by the D.S. Senanayake Government. One of the first few pieces of legislation that was passed disenfranchised over 800,000 Tamils of recent Indian origin and it took another 40 years before they could regain the fundamental right - the basic right of belonging to this country - of their franchise. That was a great betrayal. That was a betrayal done using the larger numbers that obtained to the majority community. That was the issue that brought my party into existence. The Illankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi was born as a result of the disenfranchisement of the Tamils of recent Indian Origin.

Then it was realized that our euphoria of independence was short-lived and that we could not continue to repose our faith in a simple majoritarian system of Government because there will always be a permanent majority and there will be permanent minorities and on issues that affect the demography, the permanent majority will always prevail. This was repeated in 1956 when Sinhala was made the official language of this country.

The Hon. (Dr.) Colvin R. de Silva speaking in this House at that time said, If you have two languages, you will have one country but if you have one language you will have two countries. What prophetic words! Yet he himself was the architect of the 1972 Constitution in which Sinhala was made the only Official Language constitutionally. There was a safeguard built into the Ceylon Independence Act of 1947 under Section 29(4). It was the most ineffective Section, because at the time it was enacted if anybody wanted to know examples of legislation that it would prevent, the Indo-Pakistan Citizenship Act and the Official Languages Act could have been given as the examples of legislation that was prohibited by Section 29(4). Yet, it was passed. Although it was ineffective it was there in writing. A principle was enshrined through that Section. It was entrenched. It was a Section that could not be changed. That is why under the guise of an autochthonous Constitution, between 1970 and 1972 sitting outside Parliament, the first Republican Constitution was enacted in which the views or the participation of the Tamil people of this country was totally rejected. We know the consequences of that.

No one opposes a strong national identity. But, there are two basic elements that go into building a strong national identity. The first is that all must be treated equally irrespective of which community they belong to and that is emphasized, sometimes over emphasized. The second cardinal principle is as equal to the first one. That is, you cannot build one strong identity by suppressing different individual identities. It is only by recognizing those separate identities, it is only by granting separate identities to separate peoples in this country and by giving

due recognition, the honour and dignity that is due to those peoples, you can build one strong identity. That is something that we keep forgetting and we do not seem to be conscious of.

Even today, reference were made to our great neighbour India. How has India preserved the identity of India? Right from its inception or from its birth, they carved out the Linguistic States in India. It is the concept of the Linguistic States that has prevented India being disintegrated because people of different languages and different cultures can have a sense of identity.

They can express themselves in their own language, in their own culture. They are not asked to assimilate and deny what belongs to them. They are not asked to deny who they are and become part of another community in the name of one strong national identity. This is where we have gone wrong and we continue to go wrong. Even after more than 60 years, we do not seem to have got this right.

When you spoke, you spoke about the Constitution and violations of the Constitution. There are several provisions in our Constitution that are not implemented even by this Government, of which you are a part. There was the Thirteenth Amendment - like 29(4) of the Ceylon Independence Act under the Soulbury Constitution - however ineffective it is, still it is there in print. There is a system of power sharing and it is that very amendment - the Thirteenth Amendment - that is not implemented. Those who speak about violation of other provisions of the Constitution turn a blind eye to the blatant violation by successive governments in not implementing provisions of the Constitution. For 25 years now, that has remained a dead letter. Does the Government have a moral right even to raise the issue of supposed violations of the Constitution when there is not even one; whilst they themselves openly and blatantly violate provisions of the Constitution by not implementing the most crucial provisions of power-sharing between communities? That can build a sense of belonging of those communities to the country and thereby build a strong national identity. So, building a strong national identity has to happen voluntarily. Peoples who are numerically inferior in the country must themselves feel that they are a part of this country and come forward to building that one strong national identity. It cannot be forced down their throat. It never can be forced down their throat. If the majority people think that by force, by law, by compelling and by denying the other identities, one can build a strong national identity, they are sadly mistaken. That will never happen. It is only by recognizing; it is only by granting; it is only by honouring the dignity of all the different peoples of this country such a process can take place. As a representative of the Tamil peoples of this country, let me assure this House that we are willing to participate in that process of building one national identity. But, we will do that when we are recognized as a people and when all that is due to a people is granted; is afforded -

947 948

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, we are constrained by time. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will conclude. And, when we can have a measure of self-governance that is due to the people, we will also stand equally with the majority community and strive towards a one national identity.

. , . . , . . '', '' . , , . . [3.15 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake has brought in this Motion with very noble intentions. However, I do not believe that the country, the nation, is mature enough today to get rid of all these other nomenclatures given to the different races and religious followers. When His Excellency the President said after winning the war, "We have no more minorities", we, the minorities felt a little scared whether we all are going to be absorbed into the majority. Like that, today, if we are not allowed to state or keep our personal identities by way of our race. Then, that would be very much detrimental because even in the census, they cannot identify us on the basis of race. But, this change has to come not in documentation; it has to come from the heart. You have to make us feel that we are equal in this country in all matters and we will not be discriminated against on the basis of race. Only then, we can really develop a national identity, a Sri Lankan identity.

959 960

Our Colombo District Leader and one of our great Hon. Members who always believes in equality for all communities in this country has just suggested to me that it is better to have two National Anthems as we are disputing whether the National Anthem should be sung in Tamil or in Sinhala at different functions. He suggested that and I believe that it would be a very good solution, to this issue of National Anthem to have at public functions, only the music played where each person can sing it in his own language. If the National Anthem has been written and the music has been rendered in such a manner that you could sing it together, that difference will not be seen and each person would feel in his heart that this is his nation and he is singing his own National Anthem. That type of approach to this issue only can bring a true Sri Lankan identity rather than getting rid merely of documents and forms where your identity is not shown at all. I do not want to become a person without an identity. I want to retain my language identity, my religious identity always and by just knocking it off from documents and forms alone will not set this right. The need, as the Hon. Sumanthiran said, is for you, the majority, to accept the minority in this country as equals and make us feel that we are Sri Lankans on an equal footing with everybody else.

Even though there is a turmoil in the whole world today, still there is a President called "Obama". So, they are basically trying to enrich and foster that rich culture. So, I am trying to say that that is the way we have to think. A Singaporean will proudly say that he is a Singaporean. He may be a Chinese for sure; he may be a Malay for sure or he may be a Tamil; but at the end of the day, he gets the tag of a "Singaporean". There is nothing wrong in that. That is what we are saying. When we gained Independence, the Hon. D.S. Senanayake thanked the Muslims and the Tamils and said, We all are together getting what we deserve as Sri Lankans. -[Interruption.] Now this is basically, I would say, the lack of genuineness. You have got to blame the Capitalists; you have got to blame the British. No, let us stop this parochial thinking. [Interruption.]In that case, you must be going in a bullock cart, not in a car. Hon. Vausudeva Nanayakkara, you as the Minister -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) That is what you are.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, that is not. -[Interruption.] That is the very sadness for all of us. We are trying to break the shackles of that. All I basically say is, that absence of war is not peace. You cannot obtain solidarity at gunpoint and to you cannot bring peace by legislation. All what I have to say is that these should come through hearts and minds of the people. Then you can say, We are accommodative Sri Lankans.

963 964

Today, Muslim businessmen cannot do business in Colombo. The Tamil businessmen cannot do business in Tamil, in the way they want. But, you are saying that they can. You go to the Port. You go to the Customs. I am challenging you.-[Interruption.] Okay, I do not want to bring this up as a matter. All I am saying is, why did the Muslims form The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress in 1986? Why were there Eelam parties in the country? We do not need them. You have got the strong Sri Lanka Freedom Party to cover everybody. There is the United National Party to cover everybody. There may be the Lanka Sama Samaja Party or the Communist Party. But you do not need to have the Jathika Hela Urumaya for one lot. This is what I say which is wrong. So, all I want to do is to bring the collective strength of the Sri Lankan social fabric.

I again re-echo the main objective of this Motion. The industriousness of Tamils, the business acumen of Muslims and the large heartedness of Sinhalese need to be put together to make a Sri Lankan identity. -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) And the flamboyance of the Malays-

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, the flamboyance of the Malays - and I do not know what else of the Chinese. But, whatever it is, we have to ensure that we maintain that identity. So, all I could basically say is that a strong Sri Lankan identity is very essential. I strongly believe that we do not need race and religion in the passport; we do not need it in the Identity Card and we do not need it anywhere. But all we have got to do is, when a Tamil person goes to a particular place he must be treated in the same way a Sinhalese is treated.

So, link language, as you said -[Interruption.] Why not? Anybody can ask in English. Give it. The lack of it does not mean that we are short of it. We are not strong enough to do that. No conviction; no courage. That is the difference. When the late Hon. J.R. Jayewardene brought in the Thirteenth Amendment, what did he say? When somebody from media posed a question he said, "This is too little, too late.". Then he was asked; "Why did you not do it?" Then, he said; " I did not have the conviction or the courage." Now, we are paying the price for. Also this is in no way giving a licence to the Tamils nor the Muslims to take undue advantage of this.

I was pretty surprised when my Colleague, the Hon. Sumanthiran, said, "as if we have done an error." No,

together have done that error. They also have not done that in the correct spirit. We also have not responded in the correct spirit. That is what is important. We have not given this for the sympathy of anybody. That is not the case. We have to ensure that we protect the Sri Lankans. We have all messed up and if that is the case, we all have to get together to rectify the error. This is not pointed at one particular government, but at all governments. So, let us not postpone this for tomorrow. What has got to be done today needs to be done today and that is what we expect by moving this Motion.

Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara mentioned that this issue will be taken up at the Consultative Committee. But, I think it is going to be a waste of time. If you can have a special Select Committee on this issue and finish it off-

There will be a Select Committee on the ethnic issue; there will be a Select Committee on a Sri Lankan identity; there will be a Select Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and the future Constitution. All these are only time taking exercises.

I was very happy when the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne mentioned one thing. The LLRC was a very independent Commission put forward by the Government and we salute many of the things that they have come up with. On that, it is said that independent commissions are most important to de-nationalize or de-politicize all major issues.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Please wind up . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, just give me one more minute.

So, let us bring that forward as a starter. Then, the other one is, ensure that you implement the LLRC recommendations. That is not something I am saying. That is a Government appointed Commission to see how we can ameliorate the situation, addressing the problems that are there.

This Motion is not to exploit anybody, any community or any race, but only to bring about a strong Sri Lankan identity together. So, I hope the collective wisdom of this House would bring my Motion into play, take it forward and ensure that we have a strong Sri Lankan identity. We have to bury the past, have a Committee on truth and reconciliation set up, finish this off and then move forward towards a better tomorrow.

Thank you very much and I look forward to the support of everybody. I hope a time limit would be set on this, Hon. Minister. You mentioned that this will be taken up at the Consultative Committee. Can you ensure that this is taken up at the Consultative Committee and finished off within three months? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) You can settle that with him outside. ( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) Hon. Member, we can do it within even one month. But, the important thing is what we do there. Having considered the matter, we have to report it to Parliament as a recommendation of the Consultative Committee. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is important.

( ) (The Presiding Member) You may settle it in the Lobby after this.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Even the COPE reports, but nothing happens.

ENCOURAGING THE CULTIVATION OF PALMYRAH

[5.04 p.m.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I move, That this Parliament resolves that steps be taken to encourage the cultivation of Palmyrah known as "Katpagatharu" which is very useful for the public and to promote productions related to Palmyrah." "" , ."

I read the Tamil version of the Motion also because it is very important.

The palmyrah trade is primarily based in the Northern Province. There are over 3.5 million palmyrah trees in the Jaffna District alone. There are very many more in the areas like Hambantota, Puttalam and in certain other areas of the country. Sir, we are very happy that the Minister for Economic Development, the Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa, visited Jaffna recently and inaugurated the Palmyrah Research Institute in Kaitadi, Jaffna in order to give a boost to this industry. We are happy, Sir, that the Government of India has provided vehicles for the Palmyrah Research Institute and has supplied laboratory equipment also to the tune of Rs. 70 million. The project

991 992

will help to revive the palmyrah industry in the Jaffna District. As I told you, there are 3.5 million palmyrah trees in the Jaffna District alone. India's assistance will help in the expansion of research at the Institute, thereby improving the production and productivity in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces and benefiting around 60,000 families whose livelihood depends on the palmyrah industry, either directly or indirectly.

The industry will also help the palmyrah farmers and handicraftsmen to improve the quality of their products and provide market access, thereby generating better returns to them. The project will also generate self-employment opportunities in the North and the East.

I must also place on record our appreciation of the great strides taken by the Hon. Minister, the Hon. Douglas Devananda, and his able Deputy Minister, the Hon. Weerakumara Dissanayake, in order to help the palmyrah industry thrive in this country, bringing a large amount of benefit to the people by attracting tourists to this country. The palmyrah tree is equal to the coconut tree and both these plantations are referred to as "katpagatharu". The closest meaning that we could give to the word katpagatharu is cornucopia, which is a Latin word. That refers to a horn which gives what we desire. This tree will give what we desire. So, both the palmyrah tree and the coconut tree are considered as "kapruka".

There are certain varieties of craft produced using these trees. One is tuber-based products; fresh and dried tuber, dried tuber flour, boiled tuber flour, palm posha, biscuits et cetera. Then, there are palmyrah leaf-based products - the traditional handicraft like rattan for weaving baskets, weaving chairs, boxes for packing cashew, tea and spices, hats, mats, ekel products, brooms, toothpicks, skew sticks et cetera and flowerpots, ornamental items, wall hangers, fibre dust as growing media for horticultural plants and soil salinity control. You can just imagine, Mr. Presiding Member, what a large number of products the palmyrah trade covers.

Then, there are fibre-based products: hard fibre - heavy-duty brushes; medium fibre-cleaning and household brushes; soft fibre and coconut fibre-yarn. Timber-based products are used for construction purposes.

. , , , .

Timber is also used for making furniture, chipboard and for fuel-wood. When I was a Minister, I visited Kalpitiya. The Hon. Deputy Minister knows it. The late Hon. Mano Wijeyeratne started a palmyrah-based industry in Dutch Bay, Kalpitiya, a coir products producing centre. It gave employment to a large number of women, particularly in that area. Palmyrah is thriving in the Kalpitiya area, mainly in the Puttalam District. I would hope and earnestly urge the Minister, Hon. Douglas Devananda, to pay more attention to that area too in his future programmes.

Recently, Sir, I visited a village called Thennaimaravadi in the Kuchchaveli Pradeshiya Sabha area in the Trincomalee District. When I visited there, those people were saying, -

Sir, Minister Douglas Devananda initiated action to rehabilitate and renovate the old Palmyrah Research Institute as I mentioned to you in my introductory speech today. The Government funded Rs. 45 million for the project which was identified as one of the main industrial projects under the "Vadakkin Vasantham". ' ' . ' ' Research Centre . .

The initiative received the support of the Indian Government also which gave Rs. 70 million. The Secretary of the Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development Ministry, Mr. V. Sivagnanasothy recently revealed this. They have bought laboratory equipment, glassware, chemicals, furniture and motor vehicles to run the palmyrah research operation. The Institute is expected to revive the palmyrah industry in the Jaffna District with over Rs. 3.5 million palmyrah trees planted. -

. ,

.

The quality palmyrah products such as fruit pulp, soft drinks, jaggery, sap vinegar will be introduced soon to the market under various projects that the Ministry plans to launch with the assistance of the Palmyrah Research Institute. This was also revealed by Mr. V. Sivagnanasothy, the Secretary to the Ministry. Therefore, Sir, all in all-

, , . , ; . , .

The Palmyrah Board must have tourist centres in every town and I have proposed one in Puttalam also

1003 1004

because people are travelling the route up to Anuradhapura very much through Puttalam and you can have a centre there. Then, you can have a centre in Hambantota also because Hambantota is one of the major tourist centres in the entire Asia and it is developing to the amazement of the international community. So, you must have a Palmyrah Centre for selling all palmyrah products in Hambantota too.

Sir, I am also thankful to my Colleague, the Hon. Hunais Farook, for ably supporting me by seconding this Motion. I hope that the Ministry will get the message rightly and correctly and do whatever possible in the future for the development of the palmyrah industry and through that, the development of all people in our country, particularly in the North. Thank you.
