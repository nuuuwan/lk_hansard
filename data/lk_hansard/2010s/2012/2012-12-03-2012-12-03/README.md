What is your national planning? Do you have a think tank? I am just asking you. When I was the Minister of Irrigation, the Hon. S.B. Dissanayake was the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock. So, I told him, SB we will meet and work out a plan. Why did we do that? Because for the success of agriculture the support of the Irrigation Department - all the tanks and Mahaweli projects - was a necessity. The centre of our nervous system is there. I met the Minister and the agrarian officers to work out a plan. The former Secretary, Mr. Wijedasa also participated. We worked out a 12-month calendar to see when the shortage of onions, chillies and other things occur in this country. Kalpitiya is an area where there was no war. In Kalpitiya, you get 2 - 3 feet of high water level. There are areas like that where water storage facilities are necessary. We worked out a system with my experience as a Chief Minister and a District Minister. I did that in the North Western Province. But, I am very sad to say that you are not using these. The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, to make your Divineguma a success, first bring your Ministry in order. Do not waste millions and billions of money. There is no point in having records and all. We do not want money from foreign countries. We have the resources; we have the talent; we have the wealth, get them to task, target and work out your plan. Your officers are not running the show. I do not blame them. The peon becomes the minister; the saddest history of this country. I cannot understand. I feel sorry for this country. Take the examples of China and India. See how they have developed their agriculture. The rural sector income has gone up. People in rural areas used to go to the town areas. Now, they are coming back. That is development. That is what we want. So, I am not criticizing. I am telling you that your govi committees must have a national planning, link with the Irrigation Department and other sectors. I am telling you to work out a plan.

[11.00 a.m.] ( ( - ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran - Deputy Minister of Resettlement) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman for this opportunity given to speak when the Votes of two very important Ministries, the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage and the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources Management, are being taken up for discussion.

First of all, I would like to answer the Hon. Shritharan who spoke about the Iranamadu Scheme. He need not fear because there will not be any problem for the people of Kilinochchi when water from the Iranamadu Tank is taken to Jaffna. Now, we are going to allocate more than Rs. 20,000 million to raise the Iranamadu Tank bund by more than five feet and only excess water will be supplied as drinking water to the people of Jaffna. We have already done a project such as this in Unnichchai in the Eastern Province. We have raised the Unnichchai Tank bund by five feet and we supply drinking water to 300,000 people in the Batticaloa District. There is no harm caused to the farmers of Unnichchai due to this project. They have done more cultivation in those areas this year and have got good profits also. That is why I say that you need not fear about that scheme.

People in Jaffna are also our people. So, we have to give water to them. Otherwise, who is going to give them water? You are speaking about Tamil people, but you neglect giving water to the Jaffna people. They are also our people. That is why our Government has made a decision to provide drinking water to them. There are no bad effects created by this project.

Sir, I really appreciate our Minister, the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva. He came several times to the Batticaloa District and allocated a large sum of money to major irrigation schemes. There are more than 10 major irrigation schemes in the Batticaloa District. The Hon. Minister allocated Rs. 45 million for the Kaddumurivu Scheme. Under that scheme, he allocated Rs. 92 million for the concretion of a road used by the farmers. It is the longest road in the Batticaloa District and about 19 kilometres of the road has already been completed by now. Through that scheme, people have benefited. They

have cultivated nearly 1,000 acres of paddy during the last Yala season and have got a lot of benefits from that. At the same time, under the Wakaneri Scheme, which is one of the major schemes, he has already allocated Rs. 5 million to renovate the tank and allocated Rs. 7 million for the Sempayadi Anicut. Further, he has allocated Rs. 6 million for the Punanai Anicut, which supplies water to about 8,500 acres of paddy lands and people are doing paddy cultivation with that water. In the last Yala season, they have got a lot of harvest in those areas.

The other major scheme is the Rugam Scheme. Under that scheme, Rs. 150 million has been allocated for the Mavadi Odai Anicut. That work is going on now. On completion of that project, people of those areas will be getting a lot of benefits. At the same time, Rs. 200 million has been allocated for renovation of the dam and that also has already been done. Nearly 9,750 acres of paddy land have been cultivated during the Yala season from the water that people get under the Rugam Scheme.

Hon. Minister and I went nearly 60 kilometres into the Thoppigala Junction and we saw the Kitulwewa Tank and the Rugam Tank. We are going to join these tanks in a future project. The Hon. Minister has already ordered the Secretary and other officers to do a feasibility study in that area. If we implement that project, we would be able to cultivate 9,750 acres of land in that area. I really appreciate the support given by our Hon. Minister who is here in this House now.

The other is the Unnichchai Dam Project. The Unnichchai Dam is the biggest dam in the Batticaloa District. For that, Rs. 883 million has already been allocated from the Votes of the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources Management to raise the tank bund by five feet.

The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Minister of Water Supply and Drainage, is also present in the House. He has allocated Rs. 11 million for that water supply project. Now 300,000 people living in that area are getting the benefit. They get drinking water from that tank. At the same time, I must tell you that people there have cultivated 12,750 acres of land and they got a big profit during the last Yala season.

A sum of Rs. 50 million has been allocated for the renovation of Navakiri Tank, which comes under one of the major irrigation schemes. People of that area are cultivating 17,500 acres of land from the waters of the Navakiri Tank. I really appreciate the work done by the Hon. Minister in this regard. People in the Batticaloa District are benefited from this project and there are no more problems related to water there.

A sum of Rs. 5 million was allocated for the renovation of Wadamunai Tank and for the renovation of Welkakandi Tank, Rs. 3 million was allocated. A sum of

2059 2060

[ . ]

2012 03

Rs. 2 million was allocated for the renovation of Thumpankerni Anicut. People in those areas are getting the benefits and 47,300 acres have been cultivated by them. I must especially mention one fact. That is, during the last Yala season, many districts were affected by the drought. People in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Ampara, Hambantota, Kurunegala and Monaragala Districts lost their paddy harvest due to the drought. The harvest got from those areas was very poor. Even we, in the Batticaloa District, faced the drought, but no one lost a single acre of paddy due to the drought. I really appreciate the Hon. Minister for doing very good water resources management projects in that area. That was why people were able to harvest 300,700 metric tons of paddy in the last Yala season. Hon. Members representing the TNA from the Batticaloa District are present here in the House. They know the reality from A to Z. Nobody can deny that. I would like to again appreciate the Hon. Minister for the development work done in those areas.

The Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources Management is doing a lot of work not only in our areas but also around the country. Moragahakanda, Kalu Ganga and Kantalai projects are among those. People in the Trincomalee District are getting drinking water from the Kantalai Tank. At the same time, they are getting a lot of benefits from the development work done in those areas. Therefore, without acknowledging those facts, you cannot just blame the Government saying that the Government has done nothing in those areas. After 30 years of war, we cannot do all the development work in those areas just in three years. Development work in those areas has already been started. Water resources management projects in the Eastern Province have already been started. I really appreciate the work done by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena and the Deputy Minister, Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa.

There is one village called, Tirunelveli, where there was no drinking water; the Hon P. Ariyanethran of TNA knows that very well. More than Rs. 10 million has been allocated for the water supply project there. We are going to get water from Ampara and we will be able to complete this water supply project at the end of next year. Thereafter, people in the Batticaloa District will never face a problem of drinking water. We are going to complete drinking-water projects in those areas.

In the same way, we are going to do water resources management projects in the Northern Province also. But, are there problems. We accept that. The Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage and the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources Management have done the necessary feasibility studies and they will start water supply projects in the Northern Province as well. We are going to complete all the projects in those areas within two years. Thereafter people in those areas, especially the people in the Jaffna District, will also get the benefits. We are going to supply water to the areas in the Jaffna

District from the Iranamadu Tank. As you know, the scientists are telling now that after 20 or 50 years, the waters in the Jaffna Peninsula will turn salty, because the Jaffna Peninsula is surrounded by the sea. They have found that calcium gets mixed with the water and as a result the water turns salty. That is why His Excellency the President has given directions to start these water supply projects using the water from the Iranamadu Tank. That is for our Tamil people. Why you are neglecting them? They are also your people. We want you to give water to them. That is why I kindly request you not to disturb these kinds of projects. Come and give all the support to the Minister to supply water to those areas.

That is why I repeat again and again that I really appreciate the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva. He came several times to Batticaloa. He has completed Wakaneri Scheme in Pondugalchenai Road where people faced a lot of hardships to cross the rivers. There are two rivers. Now, he has allocated nearly Rs. 50 million. We have already constructed one causeway and the other causeway is in progress. We are going to finish that project by January. I kindly request the Hon. Minister to come and open that bridge for the people, once it is completed. We are also constructing a nine-kilometre concrete road in the same area. Rupees 60 million has been allocated for Wakaneri Pondugalchenai Scheme. We have already got the money. Work is going on very well. Now, farmers are getting a lot of benefits. We are going to do many projects like that.

I really appreciate the work of both key Ministries - one providing drinking water and the other providing water for the agricultural sector. I really appreciate His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Minister, Hon. Basil Rajapaksa in the same way, He visited our Rugam Tank two or three times. He promised to develop that tank. I am grateful to the Ministers, Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, and the Deputy Ministers, Hon. (Mrs.) Nirupama Rajapaksa and Hon. W.B. Ekanayake. I am also grateful to the staff of the Ministries and their permanent Secretaries. I really appreciate the work done by all of you. You have done a marvellous job in the Eastern Province. Thank you so much everybody.

Thank you.

In the book titled, "Towards Water Wisdom - Limits, Justice, Harmony written by an outstanding Indian scholar, Ramaswamy R. Iyer, he draws our attention to the following. On page 225, under "A Declaration on Water" he states, I quote:

1.Water is primarily a life-supporting substance and only secondarily anything else. (That is 'water for life.) Next comes water as social good (e.g., water for firefighting, hospital use, use in schools and public institutions, etc). We then have water as commodity (economic good), i.e., water for irrigation, industry, recreation, etc."

Again I quote:

2.Water for life is a basic need and right and cannot be denied to anyone. It must take precedence over the other two categories. Economic or other uses of water must not jeopardize water for life."

Then, I would also like to quote from another section. On page 227, it states, I quote:

11.There can be use rights but not property rights in relation to water. Use rights can be made tradable only to a very limited extent.

. . , .. . ..

.. . ..

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Minister, you have only one more minute.

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Yes, I will conclude.

I quote from "The Sunday Times" of 18th March, 2012. It states:

"... 30% of the food produced worldwide is never eaten and water used to produce it is definitely lost!"

.. Food circle .

It further states:

"It takes about 1500 litres of water to produce 1 kg of wheat, but it takes 10 times more to produce 1 kg of beef!"

[5.24 p.m.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman, for giving me time to speak on the Votes of three very important Ministries. Three very important Ministers are handling these three Ministries, and as such, it is a pleasure to speak on these Votes. When I entered the Chamber this afternoon, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena was speaking. He spoke with hurt because some Opposition Members had only criticized him and not praised him. But, I am sure his heart has now been soothened because my Colleague, the Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale, praised all three Ministers so much that you all must be feeling very happy now.

Hon. Minister of Water Supply and Drainage, I have been speaking to many people in this Parliament and outside. All the people feel that you are doing a great job. Your Ministry is limited to water supply and drainage. However, the projects you are handling are so large that I am sure you must be feeling happy and satisfied that you are doing something worthwhile in this country today. We are grateful to you for developing water supply schemes not only in the South but in the North and East as well because the Members of Parliament from the North and East are also full of praise for you. We, in the up-country are also grateful to you for bringing water supply schemes to the urban areas in the up-country.

However, in the plantations, it is taken for granted that there is water and people are happily enjoying the water. But, there is no proper management of water inside these estates. There are naturally flowing streams from which they tap the water by putting a small bund somewhere. But, from that bund, you could see about 100 pipes being drawn to each household. There is no system of managing water in these estates and a lot of water is going waste. A lot of money is also being wasted for providing these pipes from the original source right to their houses. So, this has to be looked into. They should have the know-how and support to create their own community-based water supply systems in the estates. So, in this regard, you have a duty to look after these people. Through such a system, a water source could be tapped and water could be brought to the area where the houses are located and then distributed in a manner that wastage will be less and water would be readily available.

We believe that natural streams are clean and the water that flows is hygienic. It is not always so. Especially today, with the use of chemicals, with the use

2169 2170

of pesticides and water being exploited at different stages, water is somewhat polluted. There is no scheme or no system to check whether the water is hygienic. There is no know-how given to those people who manage water in the plantations as to how the water could be made hygienic for consumption by the people. So, this is a very important aspect where the Hon. Minister and the Water Supply and Drainage Board should take some action. These people could be educated; they could be given the know-how; they could be given the support to tap clean water to their homes. Today, even the people in the plantations do not want to go to the stream and fetch water. They are expecting the water not only by the line-rooms, but they also wish to have the water inside their houses, into their kitchens, so that they can use water for their day-to-day purposes in the manner that all others in urban areas, or even in villages, are able to utilize water. So, in this regard, please devote some attention to the needs of these plantation people so that their water situation, the way they use water is improved. Though they have water, they are not using it in a scientific way. In this regard, I wish to point out, Hon. Minister, that the World Bank has done a study on water and sanitation issues in the plantation areas. I am sure that is available to you and I understand that the World Bank is willing to support any scheme that is going to address this issue. You must exploit this situation when they are willing to support you; make use of it to supply good water to the people in the plantations.

Talking about plantations, the watersheds are mostly in the hills. There was a scheme under the Ministry of Environment for watershed management. It was an ADB-supported project, but this project has now been abandoned. I think it was in operation for about four years and I remember when the Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie was the Minister for Environment, I met him. We had discussions and we were asked to persuade the people in the plantations not to exploit their watersheds in a manner that the water supply itself would be affected. But, today, I do not know whether there is any other project to protect the watersheds in the up-country. So, I request the Minister of Water Supply and Drainage, which is connected to environment and also to irrigation, to look into the situation of the watersheds, which have to be preserved by us to preserve the ecology and the availability of water without creating drought situations in the country. As most of the rivers are emanating from the up-country and are flowing down, preservation of watersheds is important for these streams and rivers to flourish and be available for the future.

We are grateful to the Minister of Water Supply and Drainage for issuing a statement that no groundwater will be taxed. Hon. Minister, that is a very positive statement that you have made. I do not know from where it emanated but some official or somebody in the

Government thought that water that is available underground and tapped by people who dig their own wells be taxed. This would have been a very unfortunate situation. About 25 years ago, when the Water Supply and Drainage Board started taxing water, there was a big ha-ho. We thought, "Why should we pay for water?" But, the Water Supply and Drainage Board is bringing the water to our house, delivering it and they incur a cost. They charge for that and we are willing to pay. But, when somebody digs his own well and exploits that water, to tax that water will be unacceptable. Hon. Minister, we are grateful that you would stand up for this policy of not taxing the water. Otherwise, soon we would see even the air that we breathe may be taxed. We may have to carry a meter around our neck, which will be measuring how much of air we are using to breathe, so that you could tax it, because this Government is taxing everything.

The Environment Ministry at one time said, all electronic waste is creating pollution and that they would collect it and destroy them. They said the mobile phones were creating the biggest electronic pollution in the country and they imposed a tax of 12.5 per cent on all telephone bills. But, today, it is not a tax for the Environment Ministry, it is a tax for the Government.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! The Hon. Deputy Speaker will now take the Chair.

Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER took the Chair.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) A tax of 20 per cent is imposed on all telephone bills. But, today this money is used not for the protection of the environment but it has become a further revenue measure for the Government and nothing else.

Today, this Government imposes taxes on everything. Taxes are levied on things like milk food, milk powder, flour, sugar, potatoes, all these. This again, is a revenue measure. But, normally you say that you are levying these taxesto to protect the potato farmer, to protect the local sugar industry. We also have an export cess on tea. We have an export cess on rubber. But, how much of these taxes are used for the benefit of these industries? If you are taxing flour, you must support the rice farmer with that revenue. If you are taxing export of tea, at least a part of that tax must be used for the welfare of the

2171 2172

people who grow that tea. But, that is not happening. Otherwise, at least, you support the industry. I know that Rs.1,750 million is collected as export cess on tea. But, only Rs. 200 million is given per year to the Sri Lanka Tea Board for their recurrent expenditure. If this Rs.1,500 can be given back to the tea industry for the development of the tea industry, I am sure we would reap much more benefits in the future by the development of the industry. So, all these taxes should not be merely revenue measures but they should have a deeper motive. It should go back to develop that particular industry against which you are collecting this revenue.

Talking about milk powder, milk powder without the tax would be about Rs. 200. A litre of milk from that milk powder will be about Rs. 60. Today, you buy a litre of milk from the farmer at Rs. 50. But, this tax that comes in should go back to the dairy farmer so that he is able to increase the production of milk and we can become self-sufficient in milk, at least, at some future date.

My Colleague, the Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorale spoke about solid waste management. We have been talking about solid waste management for years. You had announced that there are schemes that are coming up to collect urban solid waste and to process it. But, we see on TV every other day, there are two places where dirt is being dumped in the City. That is in Maligawatta and in Kolonnawa. Those people are suffering everyday. This type of dumping is taking place in every Pradeshiya Sabha, every Urban Council and every Municipal Council. Those areas are being polluted. We are using our solid waste only as filler to fill low lying areas and marshy lands. That should not be the way. You should have a positive plan of action to deal with this issue.

Hon. Minister, I request you to please look into this matter. Thank you.
