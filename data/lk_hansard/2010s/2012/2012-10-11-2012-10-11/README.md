[4.33 p.m.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Presiding Member, I rise to speak on the Regulations that the Hon. Minister has brought in, which are necessary. In this modern world of aviation, the right to hold inquires should be with the country where the accident takes place. So, the Regulations are very useful and necessary. We have taken advantage of these Regulations today to speak generally about the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the airports and also about the airlines that we run and how they are being run.

I wish to take up the issue of internal or domestic airports that we are trying to build in this country. Generally, there have been airstrips that were used by the Air Force and other armed forces. In a country as small as ours, those are generally used for landing domestic aircraft only in emergencies. Whether we have a potential to run domestic airlines or air services is a big question mark. Even then, this Government has, I feel, lost its priorities. They do not today think like the average Sri Lankan or like the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, which is supposed to be a party left-of-centre looking after the ordinary man in this country. But today, because the leaders are very rich, they are catering to the needs of the rich and not to the needs of the ordinary citizens of this country.

Now, you are proposing airports in Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Kurunegala and Batticaloa. Are these necessary?

421 422

[ ]

2012 11

Today, we have the SriLankan Air Taxi flying from Colombo to Nuwara Eliya twice a week. There are 12 seats on that aircraft. It lands on the Gregory Lake in Nuwara Eliya. But, on every day that it flies, it does not have more than five or six passengers to fly from Colombo to Nuwara Eliya. If our Ministers had two vehicles, one in Colombo and one in Nuwara Eliya, maybe, they would have thought it fit to travel to Nuwara Eliya by air. But, even they do not travel by this seaplane that is operated by the SriLankan Airlines. So, maybe, about 10 to 15 persons would be travelling by air from Colombo to Nuwara Eliya a week. Why are you going to open an airport in Nuwara Eliya? Does it have any benefit to the people? When His Excellency the President came to Nuwara Eliya, he had announced that there would be airports opened in Nuwara Eliya and Kandy. As a trade unionist, as a person who work closely with the working class in this country, I feel your priorities are all wrong.

Now, you have constructed a highway from Colombo to Galle and you are going to extend it from Galle to Hambantota. What is the cost of this highway? It is Rs. 75 billion! And, when you extend it up to Hambantota, it is going to cost Rs. 125 billion. Rupees 125 billion is a very large sum of money. The daily interest factor alone on this highway is Rs.12 million up to Galle, and when it is extended up to Hambantota, it would be Rs. 20 million, leaving out the repayment of the loans that we have borrowed for constructing it. Every single person in this country will be paying a rupee for a highway on which they will or may never go. So, is this our priority? I think there are more important things to be done.

The Hon. Minister of Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities was allocated only Rs. 800 million last year for the construction of houses. How many houses can he build? Maybe 1,600 houses a year. The need of the country is 1.5 million houses. At the rate of 1,600 houses a year, it would take 1,000 years to meet the requirement of housing in this country. When there is such a need for housing, you are going to spend money on airports all over the country. I do not think it is a priority for our nation. To build 1.5 million houses, you will need Rs. 750 billion. Maybe, we would be spending more than Rs. 300 billion on the airports that are going to come up. If Rs. 300 billion is spent on housing, at least 600,000 houses can be built; that would meet the dire housing need of the people.

It is said that the basic needs of a person are: first, food; second, shelter; and third, clothing. The first priority of any family is to meet the food bill and they are doing it with great difficulty because the cost of living is rising everyday. Next, they have to look after the clothing needs. But, that can be controlled because that is not a minimum need. So, people meet that need in a way that is possible for each of them. But, housing is a long-term need. Every person wants to build a house during his lifetime and they are looking up to the Government to assist them in this process.

I am sure, our Minister of the Communist Party who is sitting in this House now will think like me. People of his calibre, people from the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, maybe the Hon. Athauda Seneviratne, all of them, I am sure, do not agree with the priority of this Government to build airports. They would rather support me and say, It is better to spend money on building houses for the poor rather than building these airports which are going to cost so much of money". So, this Government has to rethink its priorities.

We are speaking about aviation today because the Governments priority is to build airports. I thought I should remind the Minister and the Government that there are greater needs of the people towards which you must look at. Today, SriLankan Airlines which was running at a profit under the management of Emirates has been taken back. Maybe it gives you national pride. At what cost? At a cost of Rs. 17 billion loss per year. Can Sri Lanka afford this? This is what we have to think. While we run an airline that was running at a profit at such a great loss, we are also going for a second airline. Are we capable? Are we rich enough to run a second airline? When Mihin Lanka was started, they said they will be flying initially to Bodh Gaya. Yes, that is a national need. Our Buddhist pilgrims have to go to Bodh Gaya. They should go there as many times as possible. That, I think is a priority. True. So, the airline tickets to Bodh Gaya were priced very fairly at that time. But, have they maintained those fares? They have increased them by 50 per cent now.

There is another personal matter of mine I want to mention. Mihin Air was flying to Tiruchirapalli in Tamil Nadu which was a great boon to those of us of Indian origin who have relatives and friends in India. We need to visit them as often as possible. So, the Mihin Air did a great thing. They gave us a ticket at Rs. 13,000 to Trichy. But, today, even Mihin Air has thought that the most lucrative destination for them is Trichy and they have increased the fare to Rs. 26,000. How unfair? How can you double the fare to a place like Trichy, which is just 400 kilometres away, from Rs. 13,000 to Rs. 26,000? This works out to Rs. 60 per passenger mile whereas SriLankan Airlines flies to London at Rs. 10 per passenger mile and to Paris at Rs. 11 per passenger mile. So, is the priority to serve those who fly to Bodh Gaya, to serve those who fly to Trichy or to serve those rich, who can afford to fly to London or Paris? This is the question that I am asking this Government. This is the question that you have to answer. We have a great need, not to fly to London, but to fly to Trichy where we have family connections and friends. But, you exploit us by charging Rs. 60 per passenger mile whereas you sell a ticket at Rs.10 per passenger mile to somebody who goes to London for pleasure. These are the wrong priorities of the Government and the Ministry of Civil Aviation and that is the reason why I am speaking today.

In the past, we had only one international airport. We also had another airport in this country, which served

423 424

passengers leaving the country. That was the Jaffna Airport. I can remember, as a student, the ticket from Colombo to Trichy was about Rs. 150 whereas a ticket from Jaffna to Trichy was about Rs. 60, less than half.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, there was a time when Air Ceylon flew you from Kankesanthurai to Trichy for Rs. 25.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) That is what I am talking about. Air Ceylon was flying from Jaffna to Trichy at Rs. 60. So, at that time, as students we used to go all the way to Jaffna to take that flight because from Colombo it was expensive. But, today Jaffna Airport is not operating. You are building an airport in Hambantota for international flights, but what we had has closed down. India offered to rebuild the Jaffna Airport but we have declined that offer. This is very unfortunate. The people in Jaffna, being Tamil-speaking people having so much of affiliations with Tamil Nadu, the Tamil people there and their cultural links, used to fly from Jaffna whenever they required. But, today, that airport is closed down. This airport today is serving the people who travel from Colombo to Jaffna. As I said, only the Sri Lanka Air Force is flying there. They are charging Rs. 18,000 for a flight from Colombo to Jaffna. Is that fair? Again, it is in the region of Rs. 60 per passenger mile. Why is it so bias, I wish to ask? Maybe you will think that I am talking in a way that is racist. But, it pinches me and I feel it is unfair because we are all equal citizens in this country. We should be able to visit our relatives, maybe in Jaffna or in Trichy on terms that are offered to those who fly to London or Paris to vist their relatives. These are matters that the Government has to think about. They should make it fair for all.

Mr. Presiding Member, I wish to conclude my speech with these few words. Thank you very much.

I quote: The Ministerial Meeting, which came up with the 'Colombo Declaration', felt that a global effort in sustainable development of aquaculture with both food security and management focus would need adequate funding to have an effective broad-based programme, which would address the total global aquaculture scenario. In this context, addressing the gathering, His

Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of Sri Lanka, who himself was one time the Minister of Fisheries in my country, proposed the setting up of a Global Fund for Aquaculture to address the multitude of issues concerning aquaculture development and management, which was widely endorsed at the Colombo meeting.
