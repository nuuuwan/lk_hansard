Sir, I would also like to touch upon the expropriation Act, which has created a lot of problems for the country. It has led to uncertainty and erosion of investor confidence in this country. A lot of foreign investors who come in say that there is protection only through the Constitution and the Government elected by the people to ensure that the Constitution is protected. Under the expropriation Act, we want to know, is the Sevanagala Sugar Company making money? Is the Pelwatte Sugar Company making money? - [Interruption.] Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne, please sit down. You have a personal interest in that. I will ensure that it is mentioned. When we are not in Parliament, you make statements. Other peoples capital is being used. - [Interruption.] I am only referring to the Ministry.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne - Minister of Productivity Promotion) Let me answer. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I do not need your answer at this moment. - [Interruption.] You expropriate somebody elses capital and try to show that you are making money. The production of 34,000 tons has reduced to 21,000 tons. Do not mislead this House. - [Interruption.] You have a personal interest in that. I will ensure that it is proved in this House. Do not mislead the House. The 31,000 tons produced by investors has been reduced to 14,000 tons. - [Interruption.] I have no interest in that except for my colleagues, who are investors, who tried to reduce the loss in this country. - [Interruption.] Today, it is shown as if they were involved in liquor brewing et cetera. There was nothing of that sort. Today, you are allocating monies in this House in order to support the loss-making institutions such as Sevanagala and Pelwatte.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne) You are off your head. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am off my head because people like you are ruining

the little that is left in this country. - [Interruption.]

1037 1038

[10.46 a.m.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir, for the opportunity given to speak on this very important Ministry. Although I thanked you for the opportunity, I am rather sad to speak just after a pathetic display of enunciation of principles that the Hon. Minister never believed in in his entire life until the last two or three years. This is so pathetic that people whom this country looked up to as socialists have now turned their back on the people and principles they said that they would die for in yesteryear. But, that is the signs of the times; that is what is happening in the country at the moment.

A social security measure that was started for the first time called Janasaviya became Samurdhi and now is being called Divineguma. Of course, the concepts are different, I understand. Names matter a lot and whatever may be our criticism of the performance of former President Premadasa, we remember him as one who had deep concerns for the poor of this country, and one of the measures that was taken to address poverty alleviation was Janasaviya.

Subsequently, succeeding Presidents changed the name, changed the concepts slightly. Perhaps the change of name is motivated by the fact that they do not want the previous Presidents remembered if those names continue to be in use, as the ones who initiated and as the ones who developed poverty alleviation programmes. That is all right so long as the poor are served. This time, Divineguma is not attached so much to the incumbent President as it is to his younger brother, the Minister for Economic Development. I am sure he would love to be remembered as one who propounded a particular programme of work for poverty alleviation. That is a good motivation. If that is a motivation, anybody, whoever it be, such person must be commended for trying to alleviate poverty in this country.

The Hon. Minister is on record saying that 2.5 million families will benefit as a result of Divineguma. Now, if that be the case, if it is 2.5 million families, there must be at least 10 million people who will benefit. roughly 50 per cent of the population of this country. The question I want to pose then is, how do we have such a big gap between what you say is a percentage of people who are below poverty line - 10 per cent - and if 50 per cent or more are going to benefit through "Divineguma" Poverty Alleviation Programme, is your figure of 10 per cent wrong? Are more than half the number of people in this country below poverty line?

When one looks at this Budget again to see the allocations; we do this year after year, and this time if one adds the figures that have been allocated for the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development, the Ministry of

Finance and Planning and the Ministry of Ports and Highways, it accounts for 66 per cent of the budgetary allocation. Two-thirds of the Budget allocation is for these three Ministries; these three Ministries of which the Minister is not a Member of this House. That underscores a point that I made during the Debate on the Second Reading that this House has been rendered impotent to seriously debate this Budget if two-thirds of the allocation is in the hands of a Minister who is not a Member of this House. What is the accountability that this Government is showing to this Legislature?

I am posing this question a day after three Ministers were seen talking yesterday about the supremacy of Parliament. Why do you talk about the supremacy of Parliament when you have surrendered one of the core functions of this Parliament to the Executive? You have abdicated the duty that has been given to you by the Constitution of this country, which is supreme.

Then, you have the gall to go out and say, "Parliament is supreme". Parliament is not supreme. You got it all mixed up. Perhaps, under the first Republican Constitution of 1972, one could have said that the concept of Parliamentary supremacy or sovereignty of Parliament was there, the old British concept. That is no longer there after 1978, the second Republican Constitution under which we live. There is no concept of Parliamentary supremacy. The only concept that we live under is the separation of powers and the Constitution is supreme. Each organ of Government: the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary have been given separate powers. As A.V. Dicey enunciated that principle, it is a separation of powers that keeps all three organs of Government in check. One checks the other and Parliament is supposed to check the finances, the spending and the allocations. That is why under Article 148 of the Constitution, it is very clearly laid out that Parliament shall have full control over public finance. Parliament does not spend. The Executive is given that task to execute, to spend but Parliament retains to itself, full control of public finance. That is the check and balance that we find in the Constitution. So it is with the Judiciary. There is a certain task given to the Judiciary. For instance, Article 125 (1) of the Constitution which is supreme states this. I quote:

The Supreme Court shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any question relating to the interpretation of the Constitution.

When the Hon. Speaker made a Ruling on the 9th of October, 2012, he made that very clear in an hour long speech. He said that under Article 125 of the Constitution, we recognize that it is the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court alone has been vested with the power to interpret the Constitution. We must bow to that even if we do not read the Constitution and understand it. At least you must bow to what the Hon. Speaker said as recent as last month. That power is a separate power not

1039 1040

2012 24

to be interfered by the Legislature or the Executive. That power has been given solely and exclusively to the Supreme Court.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) What is your point of Order, Hon. Azwer? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, my good Friend is on a wrong footing. We are discussing the Votes of the Ministry of Economic Development. He must understand the powers given to the Executive through the Constitution. He does not know the powers given to the Executive. He can have even all the portfolios if he wants according to the Constitution. The Hon. Speakers Ruling was - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) That is not a point of Order. - [Interruption.] Please continue, Hon. Member.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am talking about - [Interruption.] I am developing an argument and I have already said that two-thirds of the allocation made for the Budget has been given to three Ministries of which the Minister is not a Member of this House. I said, therefore, there is no accountability to this House. I have said that this House alone has the right to control public finance. If, in the course of Third Reading of the Budget - [Interruption.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) What is your point of Order, Hon. Azwer? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, he is a hard nut to crack. The Executive President has all the powers under the Constitution. He is responsible through the Minister to this Parliament. He does not know that. What law are you practising? Remove your black coat.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, if there is anything against the Standing Orders, that will be expunged. Hon. Member you may carry on with your speech. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) He is not only dressed like a clown, [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

he is behaving like a clown [ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

also. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, you sit down, please. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) So, this is a separate power that is given to the Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution. - [Interruption.] -

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) He is disturbing, Sir. - [Interruption.] - Hon. Azwer, you sit down. - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) It is important to recognize the different powers that have been given to the different organs of Government. It is important that we recognize the power that is given to the Executive and that this House does not transgress the power given to the Executive. It is equally important that the Executive does not transgress the power that has been given to the Legislature. Similarly, it is important, moreso today than ever before, that the Executive and the Legislature do not transgress the powers that have been given to the Judiciary and particularly, the sole and exclusive powers given to the Judiciary.

The Hon. Chief Government Whip - he is not here - stood for that; in 1984 and 1985, when a Parliamentary Select Committee sat, he upheld that principle. The then UNP Government in their indecent haste to impeach the then Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon, Queen's Counsel,

1041 1042

brought in a Standing Order - Standing Order No. 78A. That was done by the UNP, a shameful act! You agree with me, that was a shameful act by the UNP, to bring in a Standing Order, to introduce it into the Chapter called "Rules of Debate". After a Motion for impeachment of the then incumbent Chief Justice was presented, they hurriedly brought in a totally unconstitutional Standing Order merely to impeach him. It was the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike and the Hon. Sarath Muttetuwegama who stood up in that Select Committee and gave a dissenting Report to the majority Report given by the UNP Members of that Select Committee, upholding the objection that was taken before that Select Committee by none other than S. Nadesan, Queen's Counsel, that that Standing Order was invalid and unconstitutional. That was stated by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardene. - [Interruption.] Your own Chief Government Whip said that it was unconstitutional.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) What is the point of Order, Hon. Azwer? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, it must be pointed out in this House that today we are discussing the Votes of the Ministry of Economic Development, not that of the Ministry of Justice and that he is completely off the subject. Let him confine his speech to the subject before the House. He does not know where to speak as a lawyer. - [Interruption.] This is what he is doing, he is only earning through the diaspora; he is an agent of the diaspora. That is all. The Hon. Sampanthan -

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) As I said earlier, if there is anything against the Standing Orders, it will be expunged. Hon. Azwer, please sit down now. Hon. Sumanthiran, you carry on.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, that is none of his business. To speak off the point, is not his prerogative. He does that everyday. I am speaking on the point, about separation of powers.

The point is that his own Chief Government Whip upheld the principle, upheld the argument in 1985 that Standing Order No. 78A was unconstitutional. If it was so

in 1985, it is so even today. Standing Order Nos. 78A and 78B are totally unconstitutional and purport to vest judicial power of the people on the Legislature. It cannot do that. One has to read Article 4 of the Constitution to see that different organs of Government have been given different jobs to do and within their sphere of competence, they are each supreme. This Legislature is supreme with regard to controlling public finance. We should never abdicate that duty; we should not allow the Executive or the Judiciary to transgress that. Similarly, we, of the Judiciary should not transgress the functions that have been given to the Executive, which is a sole area of the Executive. But, what is equally important is that neither the Executive nor the Legislature should ever transgress the power and the jurisdiction solely and exclusively given to the Supreme Court.

Sir, there are matters now pending before the Supreme Court. Therefore, those are sub judice. I do not want to go into the substance of that except to say, firstly, those are matters that are solely and exclusively a function of the Supreme Court. We should not delve into that.

Secondly, whilst a matter is pending for determination before the Supreme Court on a question of interpretation, we follow a great tradition of not discussing or embarking on something that is sub judice at the moment. The Supreme Court has made a fervent appeal to this House without making an order that might lead to a confrontation, an eminently good order, making a polite request that this House should not go forward until the Supreme Court has had time to do its job, which is to interpret the Constitution under Article 125.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am saying it is sub judice. ( ) (An Hon. Member) You must not refer to that. There is a Select Committee appointed.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, what is the point of Order?

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, you have to expunge everything he said about the Select Committee. When the Select Committee is sitting,

1043 1044

[ . . ]

2012 24

no one, not even the ablest lawyer - he is a briefless lawyer - must comment on it in this House. You cannot allow that. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Sumanthiran, you carry on. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I am saying that I will not speak about it. But, I heard three Ministers on TV yesterday, not in the Chamber, but outside, talking about it.

( ) (An Hon. Member) Ah! How can they talk about it? .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I will not speak about it. I will abide by the rules of sub judice. I will also urge the Hon. Minister who is now getting up on his feet that he should not do that. - [Interruption.] There, one of them is standing up. - [Interruption.] All right. Okay.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne) The way the Supreme Court appealed, I made the same appeal to the Supreme Court vice versa. That is all I did. It was an appeal. The way they appealed to us, we appealed in return, nothing else. We did appeal.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) One person has just owned up. The other two, I hope - [Interruption.] Thank you. One may request the other and that is a good thing. I thank the Minister for giving that clarification.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Senewiratne) I do not need your thanks. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I can still thank you. Be gracious when somebody thanks you; be gracious and accept it. - [Interruption.]

So, one may request the other. But, here, I am not talking of an instance where a Minister, sitting outside in a press conference, requesting the Supreme Court. I am not talking about that kind of request. I am talking about

an institution, the Supreme Court, making a request to another institution, which is Parliament. How important is that? It is not about an errant Minister doing something outside but an institution making a request on the basis of - [Interruption.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran - Deputy Minister of Resettlement) . . rose.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Now, what are you getting up for? - [Interruption.]

Making a request - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) Hon. Member, please listen to me. Now, you are talking about a matter coming under justice. We have a Debate on the Votes of the Ministry of Justice coming up. On that day, you can discuss about those matters. Todays Debate is on the Votes of the Ministry of Economic Development. So, you talk about economic development.

1045 1046

You all gave weapons to the LTTE. You do not know the history. During President Premadasa's time - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Sumanthiran, you carry on. - [Interruption.] Hon. Members, please be silent.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Why is the mike being given to somebody who does not understand civilized governance? I am talking about delicate matters that involve civilized governance. Persons who know nothing about that, persons who have held kangaroo courts all their life and persons who have not even been rehabilitated from that conduct think they can stand up and disturb me. - [Interruption.] How dare he stands up! What does he know about civilized governance? What did he do? He has not even turned a new leaf. He is still doing that. He is still doing that at the behest of the Government.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] That is what he is doing. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Sumanthiran, you come to the subject. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Therefore - [Interruption.] I was talking about the separation of powers and I am urging this House to act responsibly, recognize the supremacy of the Constitution -

( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

1047 1048

2012 24

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised by the Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala. What is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) This Hon. Member is making references to the Government and the Hon.Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran saying that he is doing that at the "behest of the Government".

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

He cannot say that he is not civilized. He is a Member of Parliament. He cannot use that language in Parliament and ridicule an Hon. Member. You have to expunge all that from the Hansard.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) If there is anything against the Standing Orders, it will be expunged from the Hansard.

Hon. Sumanthiran, you can continue your speech. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Why is the Hon. Member from Colombo getting so excited? Is he doing something like that? Are you carrying out murders? Are you carrying out abductions? Are you doing child recruitment at the behest of the Government? If not, why are you getting excited? I was talking to somebody who is doing that. Why are you getting excited? You just sit down. - [Interruption.] I did not mention about betting. Why are you getting excited? If I mentioned about betting, I can understand. If I mentioned about gaming and if I mentioned about fixing games, then I can understand him getting excited. Why is he getting excited? If it is about match-fixing, I can understand. But, why is he getting excited?

Sir, this is an important issue that I am raising and I am appealing -

( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. I need to clarify since - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala, what is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala) Sir, since he has made some references, I need to clarify because he is - [Interruption.] Look here. I have a right to speak. This matter is before the courts and he is making references to -

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) That is not a point of Order. Hon. Member, you can carry on your speech.

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I did not make any reference to him. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Members, please sit down. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I asked him why he was getting excited. I did not make any reference to him. - [Interruption.] Sir, I hope that the appeal that I have made will be taken up in the spirit that I am making it.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) What is your point of Order? ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, we are bound to speak in this House according to the Standing Orders. The Standing Order 84 (xii) is very clear. It states, I quote:

Any member deviating from the rules may be immediately called to order by Mr. Speaker, or by any other member rising to a point of order.

I have pointed that out. So, he cannot proceed unless something is wrong with his upper chamber. Being a lawyer, do not bring disrepute to the lawyers family. You are a shameless lawyer. You cannot understand even the Standing Orders. You speak anywhere else.

1049 1050

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Sumanthiran, you can carry on your speech. .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Sir. I will wind up now. But, having made this fervent appeal yet again to this House to uphold the Constitution and not stray into areas that are the exclusive preserve of the Judiciary, I have to say one more thing before I sit down. In the last speech I made during the Second Reading of the Budget, I spoke for one hour, I posed several questions to the Members of the Government, several of whom responded while I was on my feet, with regard to the Governments stance on the Thirteenth Amendment. All that was changed by the Daily News and publications have been done saying that I want the Thirteenth Amendment abolished. I said no such thing. I said during the course of my speech several times quoting from joint statements made by the Government of Sri with the Government of India and with the United Nations and quoting the phrase, Full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment and going beyond that to make devolution meaningful.

That is what I said and that has been totally distorted in the Government-controlled newspapers.

Talking of two-thirds, I said two-thirds of the budgetary allocation is controlled by the Executive. While talking of the two-thirds, I can see the Hon. Minister of Justice walking into the Chamber right now. There is this "Divi Neguma" Bill that is to be passed, the Second Reading of which has commenced and been adjourned. There is the Determination of the Supreme Court that says for it to be passed, it must be passed with two-thirds majority, because the Northern Province has not given their assent to it. I want to ask the Hon. Minister of Justice as the Leader of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, I want to ask the Hon. Arumugan Thondaman as the Leader of the Ceylon Workers Congress, I want to ask all the other parties that are constituents of the Government, is it your position that you want to force down the "Divi Neguma" Bill on the people of the Northern Province who have not given their assent to it? Do you still want to do it that way? Do you want to use your two-thirds majority on people who have not given their consent to the passage of that Bill? If that is your stance with regard to the people of the North as opposed to the people of the other provinces of this country, go ahead and do it.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) The next speaker is the Hon. S.B. Nawinne. .

[11.41 a.m.] ( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda - Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development) Hon. Deputy Chairman, it is a pleasure for me to speak on the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of Economic Development for the year 2013. Today, the war-affected areas, particularly the Northern and Eastern Provinces, have started to bloom with economic activity because of the sincere commitment of the Government, especially the Ministry of Economic Development in its efforts to rebuild these regions under the guidance of His Excellency the President and on the directions of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa.

The LTTE was not only involved in armed confrontation with the Government troops but when they were unable to resist the advancing troops, they destroyed

and caused extensive damage to public property and infrastructure as they retreated. This is what they did when they retreated from the Jaffna Peninsula, when they were chased out of the Eastern Province and finally up to the time they were cornered into the Mullivaikkal strip of the Vanni region. Further, public places such as schools, places of worship and even hospitals were used to launch their attacks against the security forces, thus causing extensive damages to those buildings. The extent of damage caused by their destructive activities is enormous. The toppled Kilinochchi Water Tank by the side of A-9 road stands testimony to this statement. Further, the funds and the machinery allocated and the materials sent in the past by the Government to the North and the East for the maintenance of infrastructure such as roads, irrigation projects, tanks, canals etc., were used at the dictum of the LTTE, thus resulting in complete negligence of those infrastructure.

The Northern and Eastern Provinces not only missed the economic impetus to keep on par with the economic development of the rest of the provinces for over three decades, but also have lost all the infrastructural framework needed to reactivate the economic activities. Thus, the Government was faced with a mammoth task with the end of the conflict in May 2009. However, the Ministry of Economic Development guided by the Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the future" took up the challenge.

To revitalize and rejuvenate the Northern Province, which was in the low ebb of the economic activity, His Excellency the President appointed a Presidential Task Force under the auspices of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Minister of Economic Development. The Presidential Task Force in formulating their resettlement and rehabilitation initiative devised a three-way approach. The first move was providing relief, humanitarian assistance and resettlement of a large number of displaced persons and also development of the entire infrastructure; they planned these on the order of priority. The second was to support the returnees with livelihood assistance to recommence their economic activities, which was known as "Early Recovery Process". The third approach was the development of major infrastructure.

Thereafter, a Master Plan was drawn up by the Presidential Task Force named Vadakkin Vasantham" - "Uthuru Vasanthaya" - to fulfil the task of resettlement, development and reconstruction of the North. An accelerated resettlement programme and Early Recovery Process were also on the planning agenda. A similar plan was drawn up earlier named Kilakkin Udhayam" - "Nagenahira Navodhaya" when normalcy was restored in the Eastern Province. These plannings were done by the Government with the firm belief and commitment that only through such initiatives the stability and sustainability of those areas could be restored.

1061 1062

Today, we witness the successful completion of humanitarian assistance and resettlement of 142,230 families consisting of 469,838 members in the Northern Province and 78,916 families consisting of 282,276 members in the Eastern Province. The demining to date of 1,330 million square metres, out of confirmed hazardous areas of 1,418 million square metres in the North, was a huge task the Government completed prior to resettling the displaced.

Under the Early Recovery Process, each and every resettled family was provided with diverse livelihood assistance - the sum total of assistance package for each family was not less than Rs. 35,000 - to resume their economic activities. To rehabilitate and develop the social infrastructure of the North alone, the Government secured about US Dollars 3.2 billion. In fact, to the credit of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, I am glad to note that almost all the external funds received during the past three years had been spent for the rehabilitation and development of the North. I wish to call upon my TNA Colleagues in Parliament, who are on a crusade to tarnish the image of the Government internationally, to take note of these facts.

To enlighten them further, Sir, I wish to state some of the major rehabilitation and development activities carried out in the North by the Government under the directive of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa since the end of conflict in May 2009 until 2011. Houses numbering 9,670 have been repaired and 27,983 houses constructed. The Health sector received Rs. 3,100 million out of a total sum of Rs. 15,600 million spent for the whole country. The per capita expenditure for the North for the Health sector during this period stands at Rs. 2,924 while it is Rs. 812 for the rest of the country. Another Rs. 9,254 million has been allocated to this sector for future special projects.

Schools numbering 1,630 have been rehabilitated at a cost of Rs. 1,341 million. The total investment on water and sanitation stands at a staggering sum of Rs. 29,912 million. Restoration of electricity was done at a cost of Rs. 13,240 million. Religious places were renovated at a cost of Rs. 686 million, the detail being Rs. 132 million for Hindu religious places, Rs. 2.3 million for Buddhist religious places, Rs. 1.6 million for Muslim religious places and Rs. 550 million for Catholic religious places. Out of this, a sum of Rs. 447 million was spent for the renovation of the Madhu Church, which the Bishop of Mannar, Reverend (Dr.) Rayappu Joseph, failed to report when he spoke over videoconferencing to a Geneva audience recently. A sum of Rs. 22,623 million has already been spent for the renovation of national highways, provincial roads and rural roads and the ongoing projects would cost another Rs. 51,384 million. A total of 7,500 kilometres of roads will get a new facet once these projects are completed by the end of 2015. The

rehabilitation of the Northern railway network has commenced and is scheduled to be completed by June, 2015 at a cost of US Dollars 652 million. The Sangupitty, New Mannar and Aruvi Aru bridges were constructed at a cost of Rs. 983 million, Rs. 2,460 million and Rs. 151 million, respectively. A total sum of Rs. 33,962 million was spent directly by the Ministry of Economic Development towards this initiative during this period.

The development initiative of our Government is not confined to resettlement and infrastructure development only. The "Divi Neguma" - "Valvin Eluchchi" - programme is another brainchild of His Excellency the President for reviving the home-based economic activities executed under the guidance of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa. The people of the North benefit the most under this programme.

These initiatives of the Government have started yielding results. The paddy harvest is on the rise. The fish production is on the increase. Overall, the GDP of the North is growing steadily. It has gone up from Rs. 190 million in 2010 to Rs. 241million in 2011. The GDP share of the North has also increased from 3.4 per cent in 2010 to 3.7 per cent in 2011. The Prosperity Index of the provinces reveal that the North was in the ninth rank, the lowest of all the provinces, with an index of 43.6 in 2007. It was in the sixth position in 2011 with an index of 55.6. Sir, these are some of the salient progresses the North has made between 2009 and 2011. But, the real prosperity of the region is yet to unveil once the mega development drive undertaken by the Ministry of Economic Development is over towards the end of 2015.

I again wish to call upon the TNA Parliamentarians not to stand in the way of the development initiatives of the Government to uplift the living standards of the people of this country, particularly the people of the North and the East who had suffered the most due to the prolonged conflict.

The actions of the LTTE have caused the Tamils to lose what they already had, physically as well as politically. Although the TNA is not directly involved in violent actions, their political speeches are always pessimistic and carry the message of mistrust. The continued making of distrustful speeches may cause to induce violence and hinder the reconciliation process in finding a political solution. Hence, I kindly request them to desist from making such speeches.

Thank you.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, at this moment I would like to speak on this subject in English, if you permit me.

As we know, Sri Lanka or rather China will be launching its first satellite in a few days. While I am proud of the fact that such a project has been undertaken, I however feel that there are some grave concerns on this project. Sir, I would like to ask this House some questions regarding this project.

First of all, I like to know whether the Government has given its approval for this launch. We all know that His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksas youngest son, Mr. Rohitha Rajapaksa, and the Minister, Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana, have given their endorsement to this project. However, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission has clearly stated that it has not given its approval for this project. I refer to the article appeared in the "Daily Mirror" of 22nd November, 2012 where the Director of the TRC has clearly stated that they have not given any approval for this project.

It states, I quote:

'It is a venture undertaken by a private company and we are not involved in the project in any capacity. However, the company has applied for a downlink and uplink services licence from the TRCSL. We have not granted approval yet,'...

It further states, I quote:

'At present Sri Lanka possesses two satellite footprints but this particular satellite has not obtained approval for Sri Lankan footprints, he said adding that even if the company applied for approval to obtain a local footprint, it would take at least two or three years because approval had to be sought from the International Telecommunications Union and other neighbouring countries prior to reserving a footprint.

1069 1070

So, Sir, there is huge question here. If the TRC has not given its approval, how come this satellite is going to be launched in another two or three days? We know it was supposed to be launched on 22nd of November, but it had been delayed by five days. Still, we find that there is no approval that has been given by the TRC or by the Ministry of Defence.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, you have two more minutes.

( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana) Okay, Sir. But, this is what Mr. R.M. Manivannan, the Chairman of SupremeSAT (Pvt.) Limited., has stated in the "Daily News" of 24th November, 2012 , I quote:

'We are now closely coordinating with the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission on the necessary approvals for the launch..

So, the necessary approvals have not been given to this yet. It is clear that the TRC has not given the approval for the launch and according to Mr. Anusha Palpita, the satellite does not have a footprint in Sri Lanka while the Chinese state-owned company, China Great Wall Industry Corporation is going ahead with this launch. We have found out that this proposal was first brought in 2010. It was first called "Mihinsat", not "Mihin Air" but "Mihinsat". In the report presented by the Space Partnership International Limited., under the subject Political Benefits, it is stated, I quote:

The political benefits include the ability to manage program content broadcast to the citizens of Sri Lanka and neighboring countries, and to use the satellite system for civil and defense government purposes,...

It further states, I quote:

... a Sri Lankan satellite for government civil and defense purposes include fire, police, search and rescue, disaster and first responder communications, emergency broadcasting, as well as Coast Guard, Army, Navy and other National Security communications. Foreign policy benefits include strengthening broadcast/communications relationships with neighboring countries, ..

Sir, if this is the case, is national security not in danger of being violated because this satellite is not a Sri Lankan satellite only but it is shared between two countries, Sri Lanka and China?

So, I ask the Government to please let us know exactly what the status of this satellite is, whether they have given their approval to this satellite or not? We got to know that a European Union Parliamentarian has also been involved in getting this SupremeSAT Company involved with the

China Great Wall Industry Corporation. Basically, we need to find out in what capacity he got this deal done? Finally, I would like to ask whether the Government has sold our geo-location to a Chinese State-run company so that a handful of people in this country can become millionaires and billionaires?

Thank you. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Thank you very much. Hon. Vinayagamoorhi Muralidaran, may speak next. You have limited time.

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera - Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardana, who is aspiring to be the Leader of the UNP, today spoke completely out of the subject. Today, we are discussing the Votes of the Ministry of Economic Development, but he was talking about something else. [12. 22 p.m.] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran - Deputy Minister of Resettlement) Thank you, Hon. Deputy Chairman, for giving me a good opportunity to discuss the Votes on the Ministry of Economic Development.

First of all I would like to answer the Hon. Sumanthiran. He is an Hon. Member of Parliament and at the same time, he is a lawyer. But, he does not know how to appreciate other Members. He calls other Members, "rascals, killers" and so on. First of all, mind your words and follow Parliamentary rules. Yesterday also, the Hon. Speaker said - [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) What is the point of Order, Hon. Sumanthiran? - [Interruption.] Order, please! What is your point of Order?

1071 1072

[ ]

2012 24

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I did not use the words, "rascal" or "killer" - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Okay, thank you. That is not a point of Order. Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran, you carry on.

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) Okay, in future you have to correct those things. - [Interruption.] I really appreciate that.- [Interruption.]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) I did not use the words, "rascal" or "killer" - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) First of all I have to discuss the Votes on the Ministry of Economic Development. I think most of the Hon. Members of the Opposition do not understand the functions of the Ministry of Economic Development, which comes under the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa. His vision is a very long-term one. He has divided the activities of the Ministry of Economic Development into three sectors in order to develop the country. The first one is rural development; the second one is regional development and the third is national development which includes the City. Through that vision, he has arranged a number of programmes: the first one is Divi Neguma, the second is Gama Neguma, the third is the Pura Neguma, the fourth is the Regional Growth Centres and the other is Strategic Initiatives. Through these projects, he has allocated a lot of money to every region islandwide and because of that people are getting benefits, especially the people in the North and the East. He has also allocated a lot of money to minor irrigation projects, drinking water projects and especially in the field of agriculture. Those are the development activities he is doing. So, you have to understand what kind of development activities he is doing as the Minister of Economic Development.

Not only that, he also co-ordinates with the other Ministers and works with them very well. He co-ordinates especially with the Ministry of Education to implement the 5,000 School Development Programme, which is going on very well.

I specially want to talk about one district. That is, the Batticaloa District, the district which I belong to. For the

development work of that district, he allocated Rs. 50 million last year under Divi Neguma programme; Rs. 345 million under Gama Neguma programme; Rs. 584 million under Pura Neguma programme; Rs. 15 million under Samurdhi programme and nearly Rs. 400 million under the Re-awakening Project. He has done marvellous things. He has allocated money to start the construction work of the Kambi-Aru Bridge. The Parliamentarians from the Batticaloa District know how people suffer without a bridge there. They have to travel more than 40 kilometres to reach their village. But, after the construction work of that bridge, they will have to travel only five kilometres to reach their village. That is a marvellous thing that the Hon. Minister has done under this years development programme. Not only that, he has also allocated Rs. 100 million to start other development work.

He also coordinates with the World Food Programme. First of all, you have to understand as to what is going on in this country. He has allocated millions of rupees for the welfare of the IDPs in the North and the East. Even now we are distributing free food among the resettled people. Not only that, but he also coordinates with the international community. You know about the ADB. He coordinated with it and got a lot of money for our country. Similarly, there are development projects like JICA projects, ENReP, NECORD, NEHRP. Through NEHRP, more than 40,000 houses have been built in the North and the East. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hear! Hear! ( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) You do not know those things. That is why you are talking about more monies being allocated to the Ministry of Economic Development by His Excellency the President. First of all, you should understand what is stated in the Sri Lankan Constitution. The Executive President has the power to allocate money to wherever it is needed. That is what the Constitution says. That was done by the UNP Government. You ask them. They changed the Constitution. Executive Presidency has been brought in by the UNP Government. - [Interruption.] So, you have to ask them. Hon. Sumanthiran, you are a lawyer. You also study the Constitution. Now, you blame His Excellency the President. - [Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) He lives in Colombo. He does not know anything about Jaffna. - [Interruption.]

1073 1074

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) Yes, you live in Colombo. That is why you do not understand the programmes going on in the North and the East. - [Interruption.] I always appreciate Hon. Sampanthan. He is a political genius in Sri Lanka. He knows the history.[Interruption.] But, Hon. Sumanthiran, you do not know the history because you are living in Colombo. You are a newcomer.- [Interruption.] You do not know anything.- [Interruption.] You are talking about the Thirteenth Amendment. TNA talks about the Thirteenth Amendment not only inside the country but also all over the world. But, you are the people who threw the Thirteenth Amendment in 1987 - [Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) Remember that! ( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) Now you are talking about the Thirteenth Amendment. Why are you talking about it all over the world? Why are you discussing it with the diaspora? You are doing politics for the diaspora. That is the thing. - [Interruption.]

( ) (An Hon. Member) Not for Sri Lanka. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage - Minister of Sports ) That is for money. ( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) Yes, for money. You have to understand what is going on. That is what matters. First of all we have to think that we are Sri Lankans. We have to motivate the people that we are Sri Lankans.

( ) (An Hon. Member) ! ( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) Though there are many communities, such as Tamil, Muslim and Sinhala, we all are Sri Lankans. So, do not

divide and rule this country. Do not motivate the people to create a war again in this country. That is why I strongly urge you not to mislead the diaspora.- [Interruption.] Our President, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa never neglects the diaspora. He always calls them "Sri Lankans, the people of our country". He always talks like that. You have to understand that.

We have already formed a Select Committee, but you do not like to participate in it. So, who are you? Are you representatives of the Tamil People? If you really like the Tamil people and know their aspirations, you have to participate in the Select Committee. There you can discuss your problems.- [Interruption.] Why do you not join? The reason is, you do not have the points to talk at the Select Committee. That is why you do not like to join. That is the reason.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Order, please! Hon. Minister, please wind up your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Vinayagamoorthi Muralidaran) Give me one more minute.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! There is a point of Order being raised.

( ) (The Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera) , , . . . . . . . . . . .

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, I think you would understand that it is before Parliament deposited with the Hon. Speaker and now it is an instrument of Parliament. Therefore, it is better not to refer to it. - [Interruption.]

Order, please! I am giving an Order. Since the Motion has been accepted by the Speaker, it is an instrument of the House. So, it is better that we do not refer to it.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I understand your concern, Sir.

( ) (The Presiding Member) It is not a concern.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I understand your concern but I want to point out to you and the House that the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara made his comments in front of the Hon. Speaker of this House and I should have an equal right to make my comments before this House. I am not asking for extra

privileges. I am asking for the same privilege in this House, nothing extra.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! I was not here when the Hon. Speaker -

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) The Hon. Speaker was there.

( ) (The Presiding Member) I do not know what happened at that time when the Hon. Speaker was chairing and I do not know whether a Ruling was given or not. But, I would kindly request you -

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Thank you, I understand your concern.

( ) (The Presiding Member) I ask you not to refer to this because it is almost under sub judice.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I understand your concern.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) What is your point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) The Hon. Member is replying to the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara.

( ) (The Presiding Member) But, in any case ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) It was the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara who referred to this. So,the Hon. Eran Wickramaratne can reply.

1111 1112

2012 24

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please speak on the subject.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Sir, the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara specifically mentioned that - you can check it from the Hansard - the Chief Justice of the country was appointing judges, who were hearing cases that were related to her.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Did he refer to the Impeachment Motion?

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I am not referring to any Motion.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, according to your own version, it is very clear that he has not referred to the Impeachment Motion.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) I did not refer to it either. I did not use that word.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Okay. Let us avoid all these things. Your time is also almost up.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Yes, I know. I will conclude by replying that final point. We are the Parliament of Sri Lanka. People in this country are looking up to us. We have no reason to defend any individual. We are defending the Judiciary, not an individual. May I make it absolutely clear? We must remember that Members of Parliament have brought the accusations. Members of Parliament are going to sit in judgement. I am asking this House, what is the reasonability of this kind of judicial system? What is justice? We need to address ourselves to that question. That is not a question that could be limited to the Parliamentary Select Committee. That is a question for the Sri Lankan Parliament to answer, not just a Parliamentary Select Committee.

Thank you very much.

( ) (The Presiding Member) It is this Parliament that has appointed the Select Committee.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) That is why - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) I am sorry. I cannot allow that. I cannot allow those references. I have to uphold the dignity of Parliament from the Chair. Your time is up.

( ) (The Hon. Eran Wickramaratne) Sir, it is not the integrity of the PSC Members that are at stake. It is our integrity.

( ) (The Hon. Rohitha Abeygunawardena) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

We were told that investors were falling over each other to invest in Sri Lanka. We all know that you took planeloads of hangers-on - I am sorry to use that word - and issued glorified statements that the Americans were coming, the Europeans were coming, the Japanese were coming and the Indians were coming. Now, we are told that even the Kazakhs are coming. But, where are they? What are the factories they have set up, Hon. Minister? What goods and services are they exporting?

Unfortunately, Hon. Minister, I am sorry to say, most of this is myth. All we are getting is a bunch of "two-bit scam artists" - I am using that word deliberately - because they are conniving with some of these so-called stock market manipulators to make a quick buck of all the suckers. Even more than the suckers, we have Government- controlled private pension funds and savings banks. I do not have time to go into this. But, just to mention a few names: Environmental Resources Investments Limited or the ERI, the Browns Group or the Gold Quest are all those two-bit investors who have come here to manipulate the people's wealth.

So, Hon. Minister, you as well as I know that the BOI has underperformed. That is the truth. Dr. P.B. Jayasundera. for whom I have a lot of respect, slammed the BOI and said, "This must be changed. There is so much red tape and we cannot get investors into this country". He said it about the Tourist Board as well. So, these are the matters that we have to ensure works well, they are well-oiled and well-greased to work efficiently. Otherwise, there is no way that we can go from US Dollars 1 billion to US Dollars 20 billion. Myanmar is earning US Dollars 20 billion, Hon. Minister and we are struggling with US Dollars 600 million. Sri Lanka is a far better place than Myanmar. Look at this country. , , ? , ? -

- [Interruption.] Doctor, you have to listen carefully, otherwise you cannot answer. It goes on to say, I quote:

Sugar production has decreased from 54,000 mt in 2005 to 35,000 mt. in 2011, and sugar recovery too has decreased from 8.2% in 2005

to 7.9% in 2011"

I will not mention the name of the Minister.

"....from among eminent scientists of proven ability. But the Minister has appointed four who have not conducted any research, which any eminent scientist should have carried out."

It further states:

... at present the SRI Board is not constituted according to the Act and hence illegal. - [Interruption.]

I have one more paragraph to read. I quote:

". a national policy for sugar sector development - This policy was formulated by an expert group of scientists in consultation with all stakeholders and the sugar industry personnel. The policy was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers at the meeting held on 10th February, 2005. This policy document titled Sri Lanka Sugar Sector Development Policy had a number of recommendations. One of the recommendations is the expansion of the existing Sugarcane Research Institute to Sugar Research and Development Institute (SRDI), which could undertake activities such as better extension and regulatory functions aimed at promoting developing the sugar sector in Sri Lanka. A draft act on SRDI was prepared to be presented.."

But, the question is whether that was presented. - [Interruption.]
