There is one other matter. Since the Chief Government Whip has raised it, we expect all reports to be true and accurate. I found in the "Financial Times" that what I had said had come in three sentences. I want to bring this to your notice specifically, more than anything else, because that is one of the newspapers which is in the pay of this mafia and they are not publishing it. I know

1481 1482

that they are very much in touch with the mafia; they are very much in touch with the Central Bank, how the money is passed and what happens. I thought I should mention it so that at least people will now be aware that one of the newspapers is rigging this and they will be careful when they try to follow what the newspaper has published before purchasing shares.

Thank you very much.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) point of Order . . .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) , thank you very much. Sir, it is the Leader of the Opposition who should first know that there are various committees being held everyday in Parliament, particularly the COPE, the Public Accounts Committee, Consultative Committees and other committees. As a result, you would see that most of the time the Members attend those. They have to even attend the Committee on Parliamentary Business. Then, the seats are empty.

Regarding the other question, although I agree with him, I would like to ask how many minutes or hours the Leader of the Oppostion sits in this House? That also the country must know, the press must know. He runs away. Also, speaking on the telephone -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) , - He cannot deceive the public. How many minutes or hours for a day does he stay? Let him set an example first. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, let him set an example to his own back-benchers. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) , .

PROTECTION OF GALLE FORT AS NATIONAL HERITAGE

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) , " " :

" 1971 , 1988 .

2010 04 300 . . , , . .

."

Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, my endeavour today is to tell this Parliament that the historic Galle Fort must be preserved for posterity because the people who

came in to live there, as time went by, for the lure of foreign money, began to sell those buildings to foreigners. Now, the Dutch built the Fort - I think earlier it was the Portuguese - but these houses are sold to the Dutch. .

Sir, there is an interesting story at that time when the then Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Charitha Ratwatte was told of this deal, you know jokingly though he asked like this: " ? , ". Jokingly though, it sounded very cynical for all of us.

The Galle Fort in the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka was first built in 1588 by the Portuguese, then extensively fortified by the Dutch during the 17th century from 1649 onwards. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument, which even after more than 423 years maintains a polished appearance, due to extensive reconstruction work done by the Archaeological Department of Sri Lanka.

The Fort has a colourful history and today has a multiethnic and multireligious population. The Sri Lankan Government and many Dutch people, who still own some of the properties inside the Fort are looking at making this one of the modern wonders of the world and this is what we should also endeavour to do. The heritage value of the Fort has been recognized by the UNESCO and the site has been inscribed as a cultural heritage - UNESCO World Heritage Site - under criteria iv, for its unique exposition of "An urban ensemble which illustrates the interaction of European architecture and South Asian traditions from the 16th to the 19th centuries".

The Galle Fort also known as the Dutch Fort or the "Ramparts of Galle" withstood the Boxing Day tsunami which damaged part of coastal area of the Galle town. It has been since restored. The Galle Fort also houses the elite Amangalla Resort Hotel located near the Dutch Reformed Church. It was originally built in 1684 to house the Dutch Governor and his staff. It was then converted into a hotel and named then as the New Oriental Hotel in 1865, which catered to the European passengers, of course, travelling between Europe and the Galle Port, in the 19th century.

Then, Sir, you must also know that before the Portuguese came here, Ibn Batuta, a famous globe traveller had touched base at this Port. This was the beginning of the Fort's history, which was built by the Portuguese - I told you - along with a Franciscon Chapel inside the Fort in 1541.

The Fort in later years, also served as a prison camp to incarcerate Sinhalese natives who opposed the Portuguese. The Portuguese had moved to Colombo from

1561 1562

Galle as they preferred that place. In 1588, however, they were attacked by the Sinhalese King Rajasingha I, (1581-1593) of Sitawaka. . At Galle, they initially built a small Fort out of palm trees and mud.

Then, Sir, we must go into the demographics of the place briefly. The population in the Galle City is 112, 252. That City which covers an area of 16.5 square kilometres has developed around the Galle Fort around 52 hectares. The story of the Fort is well illustrated by many signages and plaques, which provide information about each monument. There are many Muslim Moor families who live inside the Fort - they dominate the trade - along with the Sinhalese, the Dutch, the British, the Portuguese and German families. More details could be acquired.

I wanted here to make a complaint, Sir, that these people who occupied these houses, sold it for a pot of gold to the Dutch and other Europeans. This should not have been allowed. But, the deals have gone through smoothly. Fortunately, the Minister in charge, the Hon. Jagath Balasuriya has now taken a keen interest, and a plan is afoot in order to protect the architectural and historical values of this Fort.

I must also mention here, Sir, some of the important heritage monuments in the Fort. They are the Dutch Reformed Church, the old Dutch Government House, the National Maritime Museum near the Old Gate, the Residence of the Commander, the Great Warehouse built around 1669 to store spices ship and so forth, the Meera Mosque built in 1904, the Buddhist Temple built at the site of the Portuguese Roman Catholic Church, the All Saints Anglican Church built in 1871 and the Clock Tower dated 1707 and cast in 1709 which rang every hour.

Now, Sir, the Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium in Galle, which was renovated and brought up to international standards under the guidance of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa, is a picturesque ground in the world today, where international cricket matches are played. Tony Greig, the world famous cricketer, a very popular commentator in the cricketing world, describes from the Galle Cricket Commentary Box, which carries the message of Galle Forts beauty around the world. He described in very fluent English language - it is so interesting to hear about the ramparts, the picturesque clock tower over it and beyond the blue sea, the sailing of the ships dotted with coconut palms afar. That description is so sweet to the ears, and is very attractive as far as the foreign tourists are concerned.

Now, Sir, we must protect this as a tourist-attractive place also. I must also mention a few names of the Moors

- Muslims, who have made their lovely homes there. There was Abdul Razak in the family at Leyn Baan Street - I know Mr. A.R.M. Zain of that family, 84 years old; he is the oldest living member of the All-Ceylon Muslim League. Then, Sir, there is also a private museum built inside the Fort by Ghaffar Hajiar, who was a popular Trustee looking after the Shrine and the Mosque at Kataragama. Sir, Mansoor Marikkar who was the Mayor of Galle and Mr. Izzadeen Ismail, a judge also lived in Galle. Mr. Jiffry Muhsin, my teacher at Zahira College, was also a proud citizen of Galle Fort. The Rohini was also a very respectable family of Galle Fort.

Then, Sir Mohamed Macan Markar, the most famous Fort dweller, I should say - he was the first Muslim Minister in the State Council and the first Consul for Turkey set up in Ceylon - and his family built the Bahajathul Ibramiya Arabic College. Even the Meera Mosque is there inside the Fort, as I told you. There had also been famous Sinhalese families like the Hemachandras and the Harischandras dwelling there. They had their jewellery shops inside the Galle Fort. Mr. A.R.M. Zain was also the pioneer in starting the Lions Club of Galle.

The first barrister amongst the Muslims - this would be very interesting to the Hon. Minister as well - was also from the Galle Fort. His name was M. Cassim Ismail. His son, Sabir Ismail studied at Zahira with us. One of their relatives, Mr. Nizam Ismail, is presently the Mayor of Harrow, London. He was elected by the Eurasian community - the Europeans, Indians and Sri Lankans who are living there in the County of Harrow. Then, there was Mr. I.A. Cader who occupied that Chair as the Deputy Speaker. His home place was in Galle Fort. There had also been people like Mr. Faizal Junaid, Ambassador for both Iraq and Egypt and Mr. Abdul Wahab, who was an Ambassador in Ghana, hailing from Galle Fort.

Sir, my complaint is that they have sold those valuable edifices. I am very happy that the Ministry of Economic Development has come forward in order to restore the old postoffice building into a Lanka Salu Sala outlet - as the Hon. Minister told me - retaining the historical and architectural value of the site.

The Galle Fort is our pride, our wealth, our heritage! I am only spotlighting these few issues in the House so that the Hon. Minister could take positive action in order to protect this place of glory for posterity.

Thank you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Minister, I want to get a clarification from you. Let this place be developed as a tourist resort because when foreigners come to watch the cricket matches in Galle, they go to the Fort and enjoy the sight. But, what I see is, these individuals have sold this property to others. This is a national heritage. . So, you can take action in order to protect it. That is all. Preserve it; if you are developing and improving it as a tourist resort, I have no objection to that also. ( ) (The Hon. Jagath Balasuriya) , , , . ; , . ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M.
