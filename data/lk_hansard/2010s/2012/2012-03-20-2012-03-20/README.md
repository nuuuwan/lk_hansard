First of all, I would like to answer the Hon. Member. He mentioned of an article published in today's "Divaina" newspaper about something that happened in the Eastern Province. Some incident had happened: some people were not given salaries by the owners. They had got angry and some incident had happened. We have already complained to the police now. I think that farm is under the supervision of NAQDA and it is doing very well now. There are no politicians involved in that incident.

At the same time, I really appreciate our Hon. Minister, the Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne. He encourages inland fishing and prawn farming, especially in the Eastern Province. Already 5,000 acres have been identified for the prawn farms under the supervision of NAQDA. They have done a feasibility study. At the same time, the Hon. Minister visited those areas several times and opened a prawn hatchery. More than Rs. 80 million has been spent on that farm. Annually, I think we can produce 20 million shrimp and baby prawns in those farms. Not only that, the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development encourages the local farmers also. They are doing a model farm in Kayankerni. There are nearly 150 acres and I think we are spending about Rs. 50 million on that also. The Hon. Minister came to inaugurate those projects. That is why I really appreciate him.

. . Question proposed.

RESUSCITATION OF SOCCER ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I move the following Adjournment Motion:

Since the game of Soccer is a sport extremely popular in Sri Lanka and is considered to be a poor mans game this House calls upon the Hon. Minister of Sports to take positive action immediately to resuscitate this poor mans game from the doldrums. It has sadly fallen into the 70th place in the international reckoning.

Sir, I think the latest is the 86th place in the international reckoning.

, ; . . . . . . .

, ? 186 , . , " - May God save soccer" . soccer game .

Sir, I want the Government, the Hon. Minister of Sports and even the Football Federation to focus their attention and help resuscitate this game of soccer. Also, it is sad that the Sri Lankan National Football Team, the other day, lost to Philippines in Manila by 4 : 0. Thereby, Sri Lanka had to bow out of the World Cup run to be held in Brazil in the year 2014. The past winner of the World

1169 1170

Cup had been Spain in 2010 when the finals were played in South Africa. Italy emerged as the winner before that in 2006 at the finals played in Germany. Brazil clinched the cup in 2002, when the event took place in Korea and Japan. Even a small country like Cameron had won the World Cup.

But, Sir, football in Sri Lanka is still wallowing in the shadow of our Test Cricket. I told you that. The people who are playing soccer are asking, When will Sri Lanka produce the likes of that attacking Argentine Midfielder or the Second Striker, Diego Maradona and replicas of those brilliant Brazilian footballers, formidable and forward Sir Pele, scintillating striker Ronaldo and people like Kevin Keegan of England, Franz Beckenbauer, Michel Platini, Zinedine Zidane of France?" Sir, it is a daydream to think that people of such calibre will be produced by us. But, at least, we must wake up because soccer is played at two levels: national level and even in places like Kaduwela, Avissawella and Homagama represented by the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena. In all these places, they play soccer. Even in the paddy fields, they play soccer if they do not have a place. Sir, it is a low cost sport for a club to engage in. You only have to have a ball and two nets. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Barefooted. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You had taken up boots to play in Boralugoda. We know that. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) We never wear boots. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You all are barefoot attackers. You have been successful in that. My congratulations to you!

So, Sir, whoever is the President of the Football Federation, we are not bothered about it, but he has a duty by the country and by this sport. They are getting millions of rupees. . CEO . ? . . . - Football Coaches and Trainers - . . .

Why can the Football Federation of Sri Lanka not produce a formidable team of footballers to clinch the Federation Internationale de Football Association - FIFA - World Cup? Sri Lanka is a member of the Asian Football Confederation - AFC. However, our team has yet to make its appearance at FIFA and at the Asian Football Confederation for the Asian Cup championship play. True, Sir, we were South Asian champions way back in 1995. That was a long time ago. We also did qualify for the second stage of Asians and also for the 2006 World Cup. But, that is not enough. They have to and must hit the top.

The Football Federation of Sri Lanka - FFSL - must take concerted action to train, nurture and develop a super Sri Lankan team to excel in football with a view to achieving the FIFA World Cup. Once upon a time, we produced the best goalkeeper in the whole of Asia, Mr. M.M. Hashim Deen. He was called The Prince of Football in Asia. That was the time we excelled ourselves.

Also, Sir, I want to tell about the F.A. Yaseen Cup. Mr. F.A. Yaseen who headed the Football Federation of Sri Lanka did a wonderful job of work at that time. During his tenure, several trophies were introduced and they won several championships at that time.

Therefore, Sir, if we are to resuscitate the game of football and bring it up to some level, I think the Hon. Minister must intervene in this matter. After all, though you are spending money on cricket and other sports, it is your duty to spend money on football also. We, as Members of Parliament, expect you to take very appropriate action at this moment to give football its due place again.

Then, there is the second level and that is the Sri Lanka Schools' Football Association. Sir, once upon a time, St. Patricks College of Jaffna came to Colombo Zahira College, played and at times, St. Patricks College won. They were very powerful football players. They played barefooted. I remember those days football matches of Zahira College vs. St. Benedicts College, Zahira College vs. Ananda College and Zahira College vs. Hameed Al-Hussainia College, took the topmost places in Colombo. Huge crowds mobbed the grounds to witness these matches.

Once, Zahira College, my Alma Mater, won the Brazil Cup thrice - hat-trick - and I must say, Sir, with humility, it was my brother A.H.M. Naufer who skippered the team in those three years.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Beautiful !

1171 1172

[ ... ]

2012 20

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Our Friend says it is beautiful.

Sir, as I said, Mr. F.A. Yaseen was also instrumental in introducing the first-ever publication of the football news published on a monthly basis, under the guidance of a professional sports writer and editor, Mr. Elmo Rodrigopulle who is now covering cricket in Bangladesh assisted by Mr. R. Jeeveratnam, another sports writer and a respected football administrator. Subsequently, the good work was continued by Gamini Perera who is another well known journalist.

Yaseen maintained a close rapport with the AFC. He was also nominated by the AFC as the Chairman of its Disciplinary Committee for the Asian Youth Under-16 Soccer Tournament held in Qatar in 1986. This was the manner in which even the people who pioneered soccer at that time were able to achieve success.

It was also due to his efforts that our referees were first assigned to officiate in AFC international matches both inside and outside our shores. As a novelty, Yaseen was also instrumental in organizing exhibition matches played among football officials, the Parliamentarians, the Municipal Councillors and the referees on many occasions.

Yaseen accomplished what appeared impossible for many at that time. He shaped the City League and the BCFSL into a vibrant force unfolding new vistas in administration, kept pace with the AFC and installed Sri Lanka again in the Asian map. There were so many other people who headed the Federation, prominent players like Piyadasa, Ranasinghe and many other names also come to my mind, apart from Hashim Deen.

Therefore, Sir, the whole purpose of moving this Adjournment Motion on soccer at this stage is to help the downtrodden people, the village people. In cricket you garner the support of all the village clubs and others. Why do you not do the same thing to soccer? Sir, during the time of curfew, we used to play soccer at Third Cross Street, Second Cross Street, Keyzer Street and all other streets because that is the easiest game you can play anywhere; but you cannot play cricket like that. Even the other day, we had a soccer match in Diyatalawa. It was a wonderful match in which His Excellency the President also took part and one of the formidable players who scored several goals was our own Minister of Sports, the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage.

Therefore, Sir, in all earnestness and sincerity I would say that - I do not mind who is there at the helm of affairs - football cannot be controlled by money alone now. That feudal system is gone. We are a peoples Government. Nobody can control power in any sports body because of the money they possess or the money that they can wheel

around. So, I know that the Minister is formidable, he is gallant, he is forward-looking and he is also courageous. That is the Hon. Mahindananda Aluthgamage. I leave it to you to resuscitate football and to earn a very good place in the sporting world of Sri Lanka. I would assure you, Hon. Minister, that we will be with you and your name will go down in history as the Minister of Sports who uplifted, resuscitated and gave a new lease of life to football in this country. Thank you, Sir.
