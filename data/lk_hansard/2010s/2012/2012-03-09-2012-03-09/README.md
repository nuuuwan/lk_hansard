: : PRIVILEGE : USE OF PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATIONS OF PARLIAMENT IN COURT ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Sir, the Speaker is a national office. The holder is elected by the House. He is required to act for the Head of State in a situation where both the President and the Prime Minister are incapacitated.

Similarly, the Leader of the Opposition in Parliament is also a national office holder recognized by the Speaker. He is the Head of the alternative group to the Government, which competes for power at national elections. Therefore, his functions are not limited to Parliament. It is a political office given recognition by Parliament. As a result, the functions of the Speaker and the Leader of the Opposition are not limited to travelling to and from Parliament. Their functions necessarily extend to the whole country and sometimes, even outside the country. Recognizing this, the Parliament has provided separate Votes in the Budgetary Estimates to provide facilities for the Speaker and the Leader of the Opposition to carry out their functions. In this background, I wish to refer to two matters which are of importance to both our offices as well as to Parliament as a whole.

The first is, the use of privileged communications of Parliament in judicial tribunals. On 28th February, 2012, the print and electronic media carried news items that the District Court of Colombo had purportedly issued a Notice of an Interim Injunction, restraining the Colombo Municipal Council, among others, from renting out or leasing any portion of the Mayor's Centre at No. 18, Sir Marcus Fernando Mawatha, Colombo 7. The report also stated that annexed to the petition was a copy of the letter addressed to you by me. I, myself, am a respondent in that case.

The issue of temporary relocation of the Office of the Leader of the Opposition in Colombo is a matter under discussion between the two of us. A final decision has not been taken and that cannot be taken until all the Party Leaders are informed of it. All those discussions are internal matters of Parliament.

The letter in question is an internal communication between the two of us. Matters pertaining to Parliament are outside the jurisdiction of the court. Parliament's internal matters are inclusively within its own

jurisdiction. This has been very clearly ruled upon by the Speaker and the House. Our proceedings are, therefore, not open to challenge. Therefore, making such an application to court, using Parliament's internal documents is a violation of the Parliament's rights and privileges.

In the circumstances, all parties responsible for producing the said letter, namely the plaintiff and his lawyers, are acting in breach of Parliamentary Privilege. I, therefore, request you, as the guardian of the rights of Parliament and its Members, to look into this matter and take necessary action.

The second is with regard to the use of vehicles made available by the Government. Due to the security situation in the country, bullet and blast-proof vehicles have been supplied to some Members of the Government, to yourself, to me, as the Leader of the Opposition, and to other persons whose lives are under threat. In addition, all of us are provided with security personnel. All those vehicles belong to the Presidential Security Division. In addition, I have also been provided with other vehicles for my security. Those vehicles and personnel are available to us at all times. My security officers, who are assigned to me by the Government, assess my security needs at any given moment depending on the circumstances of each occasion. The same practice applies to all others.

Therefore, I need your confirmation, firstly, that the vehicles, including the bulletproof vehicles provided to me and the other persons whom I have mentioned, remain the property of the Government at all times and that no legislation has imposed any restriction on the use of such vehicles, and secondly, that I am entitled to use all the facilities given to me for the purpose of my personal security including such vehicles.

Thank you, Hon. Speaker. I hope you would look into the matters and give a Ruling.

GRANTING A HIGHER POSITION TO THE QUAZI COURT SYSTEM

[4.03 p.m.]

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Deputy Chairman, I move:

That this Parliament is of the opinion that the Quazi Court System that was established in Sri Lanka under the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Ordinance of 1929 and subsequently amended under the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act in 1951 must be upgraded with powers vested with the Quazi judges to adjudicate upon all matters concerned with disputes arising in Muslim families and also the status of the Quazi Court System must be upgraded in such a manner where sittings be held in premises congenial to the dignity of the system and as the Quazi judges are appointed by the Judicial Service Commission they should be placed on a respectable and an acceptable salary structure payable to other judicial officers.

Sir, the Sri Lankan State is very unique in that the religious injunctions of the Holy Quran practised by the Muslims throughout the world and even in Sri Lanka are embodied in our Constitution. They are part of our

Constitution. This, evidently, is not there to be seen in certain other countries. That is why we call Sri Lanka a unique State in the entire world.

The atmosphere of tolerance and co-existence that prevails in Sri Lanka is symbolized by the Quazi Court System that was established in the 1930s. The Quazi Court System has helped to preserve in Sri Lanka, the religious laws and customs of the Muslims, which had been protected and applied by the Sinhalese Kings and even the Dutch and the British rulers after they took control of certain parts of Sri Lanka in the 18th, 19th and 20th Centuries.

It was the decision of the Supreme Court in The King versus Miskin Ummah NLR - Vol. 26 P.330, holding that a Muslim marriage can only be terminated at the instance of the wife by the District Court, and that the practice of a married woman or her father appointing a Quazi for this purpose had no legal effect, that first led to agitation by the Muslims for the reform of the law. This agitation resulted in the appointment of a Select Committee by the British in the Legislative Council to make suggestions with regard to the reform of the existing law. The Committee chaired by Justice M.T. Akbar, the then Acting Attorney-General, also included the Mr. N.H.M. Abdul Cader, Member, State Council, Mr. H.M. Macan Markar, later Sir Mohamed Macan Markar, Member of the Legislative Council and also Dr. T.B. Jayah, that great educationist and national leader, and five others who were non-Muslims.

The Committee recommended the establishment of Quazi Courts with original jurisdiction, and a Board of Quazis with appellate jurisdiction to deal with matrimonial disputes among the Muslims of Sri Lanka, and the enactment of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Registration Ordinance of 1929. Since the system established by the above-mentioned legislation did not work smoothly, the then Governor appointed a Committee in 1939 to consider further amendments to the law. This Committee consisted of the Registrar-General, who was its ex-officio Chairman, and leading Muslims such as Justice M.T. Akbar, then a retired puisne Judge, Dr. T.B. Jayah and Advocate M.I.M. Haniffa, an Islamic scholar of fame, who has written several books to his credit. The book written by him, "A Short Catechism of the First Teachings of Islam, which we also used as a text book in college, was co-authored by Allama Abdul Aleem Siddique Al-Qadiri, who was world famous, and was called a "Rowing Ambassador of Islam". This Committee made far-reaching recommendations, which resulted in the enactment of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, No. 13 of 1951. The present Quazi Court System is governed by this legislation.

The decision of the Supreme Court in Jailabdeen versus Danina Ummah, NLR - Vol. 64 P.419, the Hon. Minister of Justice knows very well, which held that the

973 974

[ ]

2012 09

provisions of the Act dealing with the appointment of Quazis and Members of the Board of Quazis, was inconsistent with the Constitution and made it necessary to amend the Act in 1965, to vest the power of appointment in the Judicial Service Commission.

Although several other amendments were made to the Act in the 1950s and 1960s, and one further amendment was made in 1975, there was much agitation for further reform to deal with the issues and challenges faced by the litigants, in particular the women who had to undergo untold sufferings due to deficiencies in the law.

Sir, yesterday was the International Womens Day and our First Lady graced the occasion. The Attorney-General, Hon. (Mrs.) Eva Wanasundera made a very illuminating speech at this International Womens Day Celebration held at Temple Trees" She said: " , . . , , . ."

It was a very enlightened and very fine speech. I also take pride in the fact that I was one of the signatories as a Member of the Parliamentary Council in appointing her as the Attorney-General and the Chief Justice as well as other respective officers.

Here, I must point out that even Muslim women, due to certain circumstances, suffer when they go to the Quazi Courts. That must be looked into deeply. Even a Muslim country like Albania has inquired from us as to how we are dealing with such situations. I, as the Hon. Minister, told the Speaker of the Albanian Parliament, Jozefina Topalli how we are dealing with this aspect of Islamic law.

Some of these questions were addressed by a Committee appointed in 1972, chaired by Dr. H.M.Z. Farouque who was later to become a Professor at the Monash University of Australia. He was a former Registrar-General of Sri Lanka, with several distinguished Muslim personalities as members, but the recommendations made by this Committee could not be enacted into legislation due to various reasons.

Sir, this is what Justice Saleem Marsoof has said in one of his essays: "The agitation for reform of the law continued, and in 1990, the Hon. A.H.M. Azwer, the Minister of State for Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs, appointed a 15-member Muslim Law Reform Committee under the chairmanship of Dr. A.M.M.

Sahabdeen and several other distinguished personalities to report on necessary amendments to the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, No. 13 of 1951". Sir, I have got the names here and I will read it out later. He says that nothing has been done to give effect to the reforms proposed by this Committee because by that time the Government was dissolved and it could not proceed further.

Sir, I am happy to state in this House today that for the first time I appointed two ladies for the reformation of this Islamic legal system : Deshabandu (Mrs.) Jezima Ismail and Roshan Aboosally, the daughter of one of our leaders, the late Hon. M.L.M. Aboosally.

Meanwhile, the problems faced by those who were intended to benefit from the Quazi Courts System have become even more acute with the passage of time. In this context, it is heartening to note that the Cabinet of Ministers, has in late 2010, appointed another Committee representing various shades of opinion under the Chairmanship of Justice Saleem Marsoof, PC, Judge of the Supreme Court, and consisting of distinguished personalities of the calibre of Mr. Shibly Aziz, PC, former Attorney-General, Mr. Faisz Muzthapha, PC, former Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, Prof. Sharya Scharenguivel, Dr. M.A.M. Shukri, Director of Jamiah Naleemiah at China Fort, Ash-Sheik M.M.A. Mubarak, former Principal of Gafooriya Arabic College, Maharagama and former General Secretary of the All-Ceylon Jamiathul Ulama Association - the highest theological body of the Muslims - and Ash-Sheik M.I.M. Rizwi Mufthi, President of All-Ceylon of Jamiathul Ulama Association, Deshabandu (Mrs.) Jezima Ismail and the late Mr. S.M.A. Jabbar, former Chairman of the Board of Quazis, who passed away two weeks ago.

At this moment, I must make reference to this great gentleman, Mr. Abdul Jabbar, who was a very close friend of mine. He was the Chairman of the Board of Quazis. He did a wonderful job of work and won the laurels of every one. Even the former Chief Justice, Mr. Sarath N. Silva, was also involved with him in order to send a delegation to Kuwait to meet the Amir. There was a grant of US Dollars 200 million given to put up 65 Quazi Courts throughout the country. I think the money had been returned. I would ask the Hon. Minister to look into this and see that the money is brought back because they are prepared to give us. But, our loss has been a gain for the Maldives because Maldives was able to get that money later.

This Committee has received extensive representation from the public including Muslim organizations. It had conducted several public sittings and an intensive study of the relevant problems and issues, and is in the process of finalizing its report, which is expected to contain some far-reaching recommendations. It is my fervent hope that the deliberation of this Committee should receive the

975 976

utmost attention of the Government and the Hon. Minister concerned, and its report be given full effect, as the difficulties faced by the Muslims in the resolution of their matrimonial disputes need to be addressed and redressed as an urgent measure.

In dealing with Quazi Court matters, one factor that has got to be taken very seriously is the sufferings of the Muslim women. When maintenance has to be paid according to Matha concept, they do not pay it as ordered. The Quran also teaches us that we should strive hard to bring about a reconciliation. The Quran enjoins upon us to appoint a person, a counsellor or an arbiter - one from the male side and the other from the female side - so that we will be able to bring about a reconciliation.

Sir, in Islam, divorce is allowed. That is as a last resort. Allahu Thaala detests divorce. That is something He detests most. Therefore, it is left to all the Islamic scholars, moulavis, ulamas, the Ministry personnel as well as the civil society personnel to formulate a scheme, so that what is detested most in eyes of Allah could be eliminated and this problem could be resolved. There is a Quranic Chapter, An-Nisa. Nisa means "The Women" in Arabic. This is the fourth Surah in the Quran. Sir, It states, I quote:

3If ye fear that ye shall not Be able to deal justly With the orphans, 508 Marry women of your choice, Two, or three, or four; But if ye fear that ye shall not Be able to deal justly (with them), Then only one, or That which your right hands possess. That will be more suitable, To prevent you From doing injustice. 509

(Verse : 3)

There is a descriptive footnote also, which states, I quote:

Footnote: 508. Notice the conditional clause about orphans, introducing the rules about marriage. This reminds us of the immediate occasion of the promulgation of this verse. It was after Uhud, when the Muslim community was left with many orphans and widows and some captives of war. Their treatment was to be governed by principles of the greatest humanity and equity. The occasion

is past, but the principles remain. Marry the orphans if you are quite sure that you will in that way protect their interests and their property, with perfect justice to them and to your own dependants if you have any. If not, make other arrangements for the orphans. Footnote: 509. The unrestricted number of wives of the "Times of Ignorance" was now strictly limited to a maximum of four, provided you could treat them with equality.

See the teachings of the Holy Quran. They confine us to that, and if you are unable to deal with everybody, circumstances are there. During the time of the Holy Prophet and even before, there were men who went for war and died. As a result, there were widows and orphans left behind and it was allowed for men to marry those widows and orphans. Even in that instance, if you are unable to deal justly with them, then you be with only one. That is the Quranic injunction. Let them not always say that we can marry four, five, six or seven. From where you get these numbers, I do not know.

Mr. M.H.M. Yehiya, President of Quazi Judges' Forum of Sri Lanka of 134/2, Colombo Road, Ratnapura, who is a great man and has been a Quazi for the last four decades has sent me a long letter dated 6th March, 2012. The Vice-President of the Forum is Mr. U.LM.A. Cader and the General Secretary is Mr. I.S.A. Latheef. At the beginning of that letter he states, I quote: the administration of Quazi court functions were under the Ministry of Home Affairs. Considering the Judicial functions of the Quazi Judges, the administration was transferred to the Ministry of Justice, effective from 2005. With the transfer of administration monthly allowances of Rs. 6000/= for Quazis and Rs. 5,000/= for Secretaries and stationeries, totalling Rs. 11,000/= is paid. What a paltry sum it is? They are judicial officers; they are judges - ; . n . This letter further states, I quote: A substantial increment is necessary for all the Quazis. In addition, reasonable allowances should also be paid to Assessors, and office maintenance. Sir, they must be given better facilities. They must be looked at as Quazis, not otherwise.

As I told you, in 2005, a delegation comprised of the District judge Mackie Mohamed, Supreme Court Judge S.I. Imam, former Secretary to the Ministry of Justice, Mr. Suhada Gamalath, former Chairman of the Board of

Quazis, late Mr. S.M.A. Jabbar, the former Quazi Judge of the Memon Community, Haji Admani Muhamed Ilyas and some others visited the State of Kuwait on the invitation of the Amir.

Then this letter further goes on to state, I quote: During discussions when pointed out the need for Separate Court houses for Quazi Judges the Emir of Kuwait agreed to provide funds for the construction of 64 Quazi Court houses in Sri Lanka. A new Quazi Court house was build by the government in the new court complex in the city of Kandy. Up to end of the year 2010 some more court houses were built in Kinniya, Oddamavadi, Kalmunai and in Trincomalee.

Grama Sevaka, Mr. M. Hanifa is also there. He is always sending us good news and making representations to us regarding the upgrading of Quazi Courts in Oddamavadi. There were plans to build courthouses in other Quazi Court areas also but they have not been erected yet. It is understood that the funds provided by the State of Kuwait have been returned. I mentioned that earlier. I think we have to get it back and do justice for our people. This letter further states, I quote: According to Section 73 of the Act, Quazi Judges too are public servants. It has been declared. This letter sent by Quazi Judges' Forum of Sri Lanka goes on to state, I quote: As enjoyed by some categories of public servants, we request consider issuing of permits to import a vehicle for those Quazis who are in service and have performed satisfactory service for over 10 years. In the event of a permit issued all cost related to purchase, maintenance and repairs will be borne by the purchaser, and nothing will be claimed from the state. The Quazi Judge, M.H.M. Yehiya assures us that, Sir.

The amendments proposed to the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act were recommended by the Committee headed by Mr. Saleem Marsoof, Judge of the Supreme Court and those had been referred to the Department of Legal Draftsman on the 9th of February, 2012. It must be implemented. In conclusion, this letter states, I quote: We strongly believe that your honour would take up this matter in parliament and arrange providing us these long felt needs. This will be considered invaluable service for the whole Muslim community in Sri Lanka. Thanking you Yours sincerely QUAZI JUDGES FORM OF SRI LANKA President M.H.M. Yehiya.

Therefore, today is a historic day. We have come to this stage after the pioneering efforts taken by Justice Akbar, the late Hon. N.D.H. Abdul Cader, Sir Mohammed Macan Markar and Dr. T.B. Jayah. At the later stages, there were also great persons like Sir Razik Fareed, Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel, Dr. Badiuddin Mahmud and persons of the calibre of Dr. M.A.M. Shukri. After their pioneering efforts, we are here today to carry the flag further. I am also very happy to see today that one of our faithfuls, the Hon. Rauff Hakeem, holding the prestige portfolio of Minister of Justice, who is asked to do justice for our Quazis.

When you travel abroad with him, you can see that the appointment of a Muslim Member of Parliament as the Minister of Justice is hailed by all the governments in the world, particularly the Muslim governments. When we went to Palembang in South Sumatra, for the OIC meeting they always surrounded him. There were lady MPs and men in their traditional Arab dresses. They asked, Is he your Minister of Justice? Wazeerul Adel? Adel means Justice. They asked him, Wazeerul Adel Sri Lanka? and they welcomed him saying, Ahlan Wa Sahlan! Marahaba.

Sir, we are very happy that today he will be taking another initiative, a gigantic step forward so that the problems of the Quazis, the Quazi Courts and the people who are manning the Quazi Courts will be redressed before long and that the Hon. Minister will prepare a Cabinet Paper out of the good suggestions that we are making in this House, and forward it to the Cabinet.

Then, I must also make mention of Dr. M.S. Jaldeen, who was appointed to the Law Commission by me when I was the Minister of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs. He is a scholar and has written the book called The MUSLIM LAW of Marriage, Divorce and Maintenance in Sri Lanka. This book was earlier published by the FAMYS Publication and the others were published by the Ladies Circle of Sri Lanka. There is also a book called "The Muslim law of Succession, Inheritance and Waqf in Sri Lanka" written by Dr. M.S. Jaldeen.

Thank you very much, Sir, for giving me a patient hearing and we believe that we have executed the functions that Allah has beckoned us to do because this Quazi Court System is a Quranic injunction. My good Friend, the Hon. Hunais Farook, Member of Parliament, was a Member of the Waqf Board and he knows the importance of these matters.

Today, Sir, we have done the duty entrusted upon us by Allah Subhana-wa-tala. May God help all of us to live together with the rest of the population in this country, respecting their personal laws and the countrys law and let us, as Muslims, get together at this crucial hour, be it Geneva or anywhere, to protect our country from local as well as foreign conspirators, in order to make our country a better place for all of us to live in.

Thank you.

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer has brought in this Motion to highlight certain deficiencies in the Quazi Court System in this country. I must thank the Hon. Member for having refreshed even my memory about the history of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act as well as the Quazi Court System. In that process, he referred to many of our distinguished forefathers, who had contributed immensely to the Quazi Courts System in the country. Both, the Hon. Mohamed Aslam and the Hon. Hunais Farook made very useful suggestions to be taken into account when the intended reforms are introduced to the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act.

Sir, I am very pleased that the Committee appointed to look into the reforms that need to be included in the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act has been doing very hard work during the past several years and is almost on the verge of completing their report. As a matter of fact, last month, Justice Saleem Marsoof, who is the Chairman of the Committee, invited me to his chambers and we had an interactive session with the other members of the Committee about the progress of the work that has so far been done, and I was given a virtual sneak preview into the various areas regarding which that Committee has focused attention. I do not think it would be appropriate for me to give a detailed account of what is in store when it comes to the intended reforms that the Committee will make. But, in any event, I felt that the Committee has engaged in detailed deliberations and has invited witnesses to come before it to consider a variety of different aspects that need to be updated and improved in the existing legislation. That relates to, as to whom the Act should apply, and also the creation of a Muslim Marriage and Divorce Advisory Board, which will be in a position to advise both the Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs, under whom the appointment of Muslim Marriage Registrars comes, as well as my Ministry, which oversees the functions of the Quazis and provide them the necessary facilities to conduct their sittings. I feel that that is a very novel suggestion which would be included in the new recommendations that are proposed to be submitted to my Ministry.

Then, the Committee has also looked at a variety of different recent judgments, which have impacted on the manner in which the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act applies to people in this country and those different judgments have also been gone into. There is a recent

judgment relating to one Jainulabdeen versus Danina Ummah, which has some implications and that too has been taken into account. Then, the appointment and disciplinary control of marriage registrars too has been looked at afresh.

The status of Quazis, the appointment and disciplinary control of Quazis and the related transitional provisions that need to be included, the qualifications of Quazis, whether the Quazis should solely be lawyers learned in the Shariah, the registration of marriages, would registration be compulsory, the test for validity of marriages between persons professing Islam and the role of sect or madhab, the minimum age of marriage and role of wali ensuring consent of the bride to marriage, issues relating to polygamy and the provisions that need to be further reinforced, types of divorce and procedures for the same, including registration of divorce and several such matters are intended to be included, I am told, by the Committee, the details of which I would be able to submit to Parliament as soon as the Committee submits the report to me. It would be, as is the custom, for me to then refer it to the Legal Draftsman after I have gone through the amendments suggested. And, if I am satisfied that they are in order, I would then be referring it to the Legal Draftsmans Department and as soon as the Legal Draftsman submits the draft Bill, I will have to submit it to the Cabinet, get the necessary approval and thereafter, bring it to the House for enactment. I am sure that a variety of those issues have been addressed in earnest by that Committee. I look forward to that historic opportunity during my term of office and I would consider it an honour to have those amendments enacted through the House.

I must thank the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer for having touched upon this most important subject. There are a variety of other incidental issues which cannot be addressed by the Act itself. Those relate to the facilities that need to be provided for the Quazis, which may involve certain financial implications and that again needs to be sorted out through a separate Cabinet Paper. I am sure, once the recommendations are made, in keeping with those, I will have to try and obtain the necessary approval to see whether we could improve the existing facilities of the Quazis. I must also say that certain distinguished individuals, to whom the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer made reference, particularly the former Chairman of the Board of Quazis, Mr. Abdul Jabbar and Mr. M.H.M. Yehiya, the President of the Quazi Judges' Forum of Sri Lanka, have been the people in the forefront, who have made very valuable suggestions and who have been taking much of their valuable time in persuading several administrations before this administration came into office to improve the conditions of the Quazi Court System. While once again reiterating what has already been said by the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M.

985 986

2012 09

Azwer, it is also my duty to correct the record when it comes to certain misconceptions relating to certain agreements that have been reached with friendly countries on improving the Quazi Court System.

I think it was mentioned by the Hon. Azwer that the State of Kuwait has agreed to fund the building of Quazi Courts in this country. To my knowledge, it was not to build Quazi Courts but to put up a Board of Quazi Courts Complex in Colombo.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Minister, it was informed to us at that time that 64 Quazi Courts were to be built around the country.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) We are building them with our own funds.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) This money was given to us earlier.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No. In fact, I have the -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Somehow or other if the work gets done, it is okay.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) What I will do is, table* the Memorandum of Understanding that has been signed to be included in Hansard so that it will be helpful for us when we visit the State of Kuwait to revive -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) When are you going? I hope that we will also be included in the delegation to throw more light on the subject. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) In fact, I propose to go there next week on my way to Geneva. Most probably, I will be visiting Kuwait in order to canvass support for the country at the Geneva Human Rights Sessions. I have asked my Secretary to get in touch with our Ambassador in Kuwait to make an appropriate appointment with my counterpart as well as the Chief Justice who had been involved in the discussions with the delegation that went to the State of Kuwait where His Justice Saleem Marsoof and a variety of other distinguished members had taken part and signed the MoU. I would be able to refresh the memory of those officials in the State of Kuwait and try to revive the issue once again.

There are certain suggestions that have been made which are very useful, about the necessary police protection for Quazi Court sittings, regarding which certain representations also have already been made to us. We will have a discussion with the IGP to see that necessary support, when requested by Quazi Judges, be provided by allocating an officer or two to be in attendance when the sittings take place.

I must say with much pride that under the "Mahinda Chintana", His Excellency the President had provided funds last year for completing twelve separate courthouses for Quazi Court sittings and this year too, I am in a position to construct an equal number of new Quazi Court buildings in several parts of the country. We have also made provision for the sittings of the Board of Quazis to take place in far-off outstation areas. There are regular Board of Quazi sittings in Kalmunai taking place now. We propose to extend it to Puttalam as well and in time to come, cover the Central Province and we will be able to arrange for Sittings of the Board of Quazis to take place in Kandy as well, as soon as possible.

With those comments Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would once again thank the Hon. A.H.M Azwer for having brought up this all-important issue which has been pending for quite a while. I am quite confident that the Committee would be in a position to submit this report to me within the next few weeks, so that I will be in a position to bring in the necessary amendments and also consider bringing in a Cabinet Paper in order to provide better facilities to the Quazi Courts in this country.

Thank you.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Hon. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I am very thankful to the Hon. Minister for the encouraging speech that he made as far as the great institution, the Quazi Court System is concerned. I feel that everything is in safe hands at the moment.

As I told you earlier, in this generation we have discharged our duty as far as the Quranic injunctions are concerned.

Sir, the "Message" by the former Chief Justice, Sarath Nanda Silva in the book, "The Quazi Court System in Sri Lanka and its Impact on Muslim Women" by Saleem Mahroof states, "The appointment of Quazis and Members of the Board of Quazis by the Judicial Service Commission ensures the independence of these institutions. The Quazi is not only a judge but is also a mediator. He is expected to make every endeavour to reconcile estrange spouses coming before him. He should always bear in mind what the Prophet of Islam said in the course of his Farewell Sermon: Ye people! Ye have rights over your wives and your wives have rights over you. Treat your wives with kindness and love; verily we have taken them on the security of Allah.

This has even been quoted by the Augustus Caesar.

In the "Foreword" of that book, Mr. M. Jameel, former Judge of the Supreme Court has said:

"........... one should not lose sight of the fact that while it needs two persons to make a marriage, it also takes two persons to make a quarrel. It should also be borne in mind that out of all those actions which have been made permissible in Islam, divorce is the most hated by Almighy Allah, and has been granted as an act of mercy to mankind, only to be used as a last resort. Therefore, every person, whether male or female, who gives consideration to the option of divorce should remember that, To Him is the return.

Then, Sir, when referring to the Muslim Law Reform Committee appointed in 1990 I had missed certain names. One is Mr. M.Z. Akbar, a true disciple of the late Justice M.T. Akbar. I told the names of Mr. Faisz Musthapha, PC, Mr. Shibly Aziz, PC, Dr. M.A.M. Shukri, Dr. M.S. Jaldeen, Messrs S.H.M. Maharoof, A.A.M. Marleen, the former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia who is no more with us, M.T.M. Bafiq, M.M. Zuhair, Mohamado Markhani, -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I will wind up, Sir.

Moulavi S.M.A.M. Muzzamil and Al-Alim A.R.M. Zarook. Then I told about Mrs. Roshan Aboosally Mohamed and Miss Yasmin Ghaffoor, who were the first women to be appointed as members of the Commission or Committee to suggest changes in the field of Muslim family law in Sri Lanka. The services of Alhaj S.H.M. Jameel, my secretary, are also to be commended.

Then, as a last word when referring to Mr. S.M.A. Jabbar, I think I must express this fact so that his family members might know. He said that he will come and sit in the gallery with our mutual friend, Alhaj M.B.M. Mahir, the founder Secretary of the Islamic Centre of Sri Lanka, to witness the proceedings of the House when I move this Motion. He is no more and I would say, "Inna lillahi Wa inna Ilaihi Rajioon"

Thank you, Sir, for your kind patience. You being from the minority community, I am happy that you are holding the balance of power in the House, when we are discussing the balance of the Almighty God's Judgment.

Thank you and I also thank the Hon. Minister once more.
