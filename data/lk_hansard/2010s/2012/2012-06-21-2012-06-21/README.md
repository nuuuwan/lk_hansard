QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE

TRANSACTIONS MADE THROUGH EMPLOYEES' PROVIDENT FUND AND EMPLOYEES' TRUST FUND

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Mr. Deputy Speaker, the monies of the Employees' Provident Fund and Employees' Trust Fund belong to the members. The EPF has over 13 million contributing and non-contributing members while ETF has 2.3 million accounts. The Government agencies which have custody of these Funds play only a fiduciary role, managing the Funds in the best interest of the members including investment in Treasury Bills and shares.

Recently, the media carried news items alleging fraud and market manipulations in share transactions. This includes a push-and-dump strategy in which speculators pushed up the value of shares and then dumped them on these two Funds resulting in a loss for the Funds and a gain for a ring of speculators. These reports state that the loss in respect of five companies is alleged to be in the range of over Rs. 4 billion. This has caused consternation among the members, trade unions as well as employers, who contributed on behalf of their employees. It has also impacted on the financial market. Now, there are media reports that this issue will also be taken up at the International Labour Organization in Geneva.

The Standard and Poors Banking Industry Country Risk Assessment has stated, I quote:

Our economic risk score of '8' for Sri Lanka reflects a 'very high risk' assessment of economic resilience and credit risk in the economy, and a 'high risk' assessment of economic imbalances, as our criteria define those terms.

I see today the Central Bank has given a reply, so I think the House must go into both these and also look at the Standard and Poors Analysis system. The Report has also stated, I quote:

.....we see a potential conflict of interest in the central bank's role. In addition to policy formulation and supervision of banks, the monetary board of the central bank also oversees Employees' Provident Fund investments.The fund is a large investor in Sri Lankan banking stocks."

This is a very important issue regarding the conflict of interest. The Central Bank has not made its views known.

It has been done by the Monetary Board. There is a statement by something called the Employees' Provident Fund. But, under the Employees' Provident Fund Act, there is no separate board for it like the EPF. Either the Commissioner of Labour or the Monetary Board has to issue a statement. Who issued this? Who is the official? Which cap he puts on, I do not know.

We, in Parliament have a duty of oversight over these funds and safeguarding the rights of members. We have also to inquire into the findings of the Standard and Poors Report in regard to the EPF because monies of the EPF and ETF are in this. What is the truth? Is it what the Central Bank says, what the Standard and Poors says or is there something in between? Under Article 148 of the Constitution, the Cabinet of Ministers and individual Ministers are responsible to this House, both in regard to the Government as a whole as well as subjects and various functions coming under the individual ministries. Section 9 of the Employees Trust Fund Act states, I quote:

The Board may utilize any money in the Fund for the purpose of securing shares for employeeswith the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers..

So, this specifically brings in the Cabinet of Ministers.

However, full details of the investments made by these Funds are not available to Parliament or its Members. In view of the media reports by the financial agencies and the reaction of financial and trade union sectors, it is imperative that the Parliament takes action to fulfil its obligations. Otherwise, we may be found fault with for not exercising proper oversight in regard to these Funds. Inactivity on the part of this House will not be excused after the NSB scandal. We finally have the oversight functions on this, Sir, and with so many reports coming in, with the S and P Report and the possibilities coming in Geneva, we should not be found fault with.

Therefore, this House requires details of all the transactions of the two Funds, to make a considered decision regarding the truth, or otherwise of these allegations and further action, if any, to secure the Funds. The Government has an obligation to this House to make available all the information required by the House to make its own determination on this matter. Not only the Ministers but even the officials have a duty to keep the House informed of all the information required and give truthful answers. Article 4(a) of the Constitution has vested this House with the powers to ensure compliance.

So, once we have all the details before us, then this House can decide whether any further action is required. If so, what is it? Is it an Adjournment Debate or some other Debate or is it a Select Committee? But, without it, none of us can exercise the obligations we have as Members of the House.

1077 1078

2012 21

These two Funds and the Central Bank come under the Ministry of Finance. In these circumstances, I request this Government to inform the House of the present position of the investments made by the Funds by tabling a detailed statement in the following format*, of all EPF and ETF shares purchased from 1st January, 2010 to 30th April, 2012, inclusive of both days, certified by the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Planning who is the Chief Accounting Officer of the Ministry under which the EPF and ETF operate, because the way this is going and the way news items are published, the possibility is being taken elsewhere. If we do not act immediately, we will be found fault with.

*Format referred to above:

DETAILS OF ALL EPF SHARES PURCHASED FROM 01 JANUARY 2010 TO 30 APRIL 2012

Therefore I brought this to the attention of the Government because this is a function of the House that we have to exercise and we should do it with proper regard to what has taken place.

Thank you.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Sarath Amunugama, you may speak now.

() ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama - Minister of International Monetary Co-operation ) Mr. Deputy Speaker, I wish to give a comprehensive reply to the matters raised by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. I will advert to all the matters raised by him and also present in this House, the details and the statistics that he has asked for.

The EPF has authority to make investments in the stock market. Section 5 (1)(e) of the Employees Provident Fund Act states that "the Monetary Board may invest the monies of the Fund in such securities as the Monetary Board may consider fit and may sell such securities". The EPF has also consistently maintained that all its investments have been made in line with the

Name of Shares Date Pur-chased

Pur-chased Price

Quantity Total value of each share on date of purchase

Total value of each share as at 01 May 2012

guidelines issued from time to time by the Monetary Board. Further, in response to recent allegations, the EPF once again issued a Press Release on 6th June 2012, where it reiterated that it has followed investment policy guidelines.

The EPF investing team and the Department is completely independent of the Bank Supervision Department. In the same way, the EPF is independent of the Public Debt Department as well. As is well known, about 93 per cent of the EPF funds are invested in Government securities which are issued by the Public Debt Department, while only a very small fraction of EPF funds have been invested in banking shares quoted in the Stock Exchange. In both instances, the EPF maintains integrity, and is not privy to any information that can have a material bearing on a banks share price. Accordingly, there have been no instances of conflict of interest or insider trading that has occurred at any time.

The Monetary Board has provided overall guidelines for investment, and within such guidelines, the Investment Committee is permitted to take collective decisions in relation to the choice of its investments.

It has been explained on several occasions that the EPF has invested around 93 per cent of its funds in Government securities, and only around 6 per cent in the stock market. The balance 1 per cent has been invested in corporate debentures and short-term Government securities. The investments in the stock market are made with a long-term focus to generate profit and enhance the Funds capital base over the longer term. In such an exercise, the EPF considers, inter alia, the intrinsic value of shares of companies and their longer term outlook, the possible enhancement of share value in the medium to long-term, the companys governing structures, future plans, the quantity of shares available of such companies, the viability and growth potential of the relevant industry and the possible impact of the growing economy on the company.

Further, as is practised by many large long-term funds all over the world, the EPF maintains its equity portfolio as a pool of investments, which comprises a varied collection of stocks representing key sectors, including banking and finance, diversified holdings, oil-based enterprises, healthcare, land and property, telecommunications, plantations, power and energy, tourism and leisure, trading and manufacturing.

In the case of equity investments, it must be noted that the performance of different companies and the market values of the shares of companies within the portfolio at different times, depend on global, economic, political, financial sector-specific and company-specific factors. In that background, companies as well as the entire share market does not perform uniformly, nor does the market prices of shares continue to rise at all times.

1079 1080

Accordingly, there may be times during which the value of certain stocks could be lower than the cost, but such situations are almost always reversed when external factors change for the better, over time. Therefore, it is in that background that the diversification of EPF equity portfolio has been done, so that the fund value will yield above-average results, over the longer term. To support this investment decision-making process of the EPF, a team of professional and well-qualified staff assess and recommend the investment opportunities from the point of view of the several aspects enumerated above, and thereafter such recommended investments are approved by the high-level Investment Committee, and finally ratified by the Monetary Board. Therefore, a dynamic and diligent process is followed, so as to ensure that the investments are made with care, so as to safeguard the Fund and ensure its profitability, stability and growth.

In each of the decisions to invest in the shares of a company, the Investment Committee has been guided by extensive research which has indicated that these shares have potential for long-term growth and enhancement in value. Such research is available at the EPF for perusal by any authorized person, including the auditors.

What is currently experienced in the Colombo Stock Exchange is a bearish trend in the market, where prices of all shares are trading at considerably lower rates than those that prevailed several months ago. This is not an unusual phenomenon today, where almost all stock markets the world over are experiencing downturns.

It should also be stated that the pragmatic policies of the EPF has resulted in the EPF recording substantial gains, and the EPF has realized Rs. 2,504 million as capital gains and dividends in 2011, and realized over Rs. 1,559 million as capital gains and dividends, so far in 2012. In fact, at the time when CSE's ASPI reached a peak in the latter part of 2010 and early 2011, the EPF equity portfolio taken together recorded a huge unrealized capital gain of Rs. 19 billion. Nevertheless, even in the face of such gains, the EPF was of the view that it would be more advisable to retain such stocks in its portfolio over the longer period, considering the probable gains that such portfolio could generate in the longer term, when the country's economy grows substantially over the next four to five years.

The EPF categorically rejects the statement allegedly made by some Members of Parliament as reported in several newspapers on 15th May 2012, where the EPF has been accused of fraudulent transactions in the stock market. Such statements read in conjunction with several past statements of a similar nature seems to be designed to systematically discredit the EPF and discourage its investment activities.

It is clear that an attempt is being made to attack the EPF taking advantage of the temporary bearish

environment of the stock market, where almost all investors are experiencing a downward trend in their investment valuations, and where some investors are compelled to take losses particularly due to calls on their margin accounts.

However, as is quite normal in all stock exchanges in the world, the large-scale institutional investors have the capacity and the ability to hold onto their portfolios without having to dispose of their investments during a downward trend in the market, and in Sri Lanka where the EPF is clearly one of the largest institutional investors, it will also act in a similar manner. Hence, there is clearly no risk of the EPF incurring any real loss during this bearish phase of the stock market.

In these circumstances, the EPF wishes to reiterate its position that its portfolio of stocks has intrinsic value and therefore would hold onto certain stocks where the market values may have temporarily reduced below cost because such stocks have potential to yield satisfactory dividends, and also make substantial gains when the ASPI moves up in due course. The EPF also wishes to emphatically state that no fraudulent stock market transactions have been made by the EPF and that all transactions have been carried out with utmost care, diligence and professionalism.

Further, all EPF transactions including its investments are audited by the EPFs internal auditor which is a reputed audit firm, while in terms of Section 6 (1) of the Employees Provident Fund Act, No. 15 of 1958, the annual financial statements of the Funds are audited by the Auditor-General. In that context, the financial statements for the year 2010 have been audited by the Auditor-General and the Annual Report of EPF for 2010 together with the Auditor-Generals Report has already been published. In such an Annual Report, information on stock market investments, comprising of the investment portfolio and trading portfolio, have been published where the names of companies, value of shares and year-end market values have been disclosed as is required by the accounting standards. At the same time, the financial statements for the year 2011 have been submitted for audit to the Auditor-General by February, 2012 and the EPF has published such unaudited income statements and the balance sheet in the newspapers in early May, 2012 for the information of its stakeholders.

The EPF also wishes to state that as a result of its prudent investments and sound management, it has been able to declare an impressive rate of return of 12.5 per cent in 2010 and 11.5 per cent in 2011. Such rates of return are substantially above the interest rates applicable to normal deposits in the financial market during the respective periods. Further, the EPF is confident that its sound investment decisions will prove to be pragmatic, sensible and profitable over the longer time frame.

In all instances where direct answers were given, the information requested regarding stock market operations,

1081 1082

[ () ]

2012 21

has been with regard to individual stock market transactions which are sensitive and where disclosing such information would be detrimental to the Funds investment strategy. The management information and investment analysis prepared by the EPF for its own research and its future investment strategies are its confidential and valuable intellectual property, and disclosure of such information would enable competitive investors to benefit by the strategies implemented by the EPFs investment team. Hence, the disclosure of such information has been considered detrimental to its own operations and consequently to the members of the EPF.

The purchase of the shares of companies is made by the EPF with a long-term view to generate profit in the future, considering the intrinsic value of shares of such companies and its long-term future outlook.

At the same time, in certain other instances, the EPF may not purchase shares of certain companies, which may not be due to an inherent weakness of the company, but due to EPFs own investment strategy at a given point of time. However, these different investment strategies of the EPF may be misinterpreted by outsiders, without in-depth knowledge, who may only look at the buying and selling of shares by the EPF without understanding or appreciating the underlying rationale of the particular investment decision at that particular time.

Information on stock market investments of the Fund are published in the Annual Reports of the EPF, where the names of companies, value of shares and year-end market values are made available for the information of the general public. This is the type of information that is disclosed by all fund managers, both nationally and internationally, and there would be a huge damage caused to the EPF and the Colombo Stock Exchange if this normal disclosure principle, which is common to all funds, is departed from by the EPF.

When day-to-day transaction details of the EPF investments are made available, different individuals may also interpret the information in various ways and as a result, they may also attempt to tarnish the image of the Fund and the Central Bank in particular and the Government in general. Some people may also attempt to use such information to discredit the Central Bank and the Government to support their own ends, political or otherwise. The fact that such Parliamentarians have been silent when the stock market was making gains, when the EPF had made unrealized gains of over Rs. 19 billion at a particular time, is clear evidence of this debacle and their true intentions. In this regard, the Opposition Members have singled out a few share investments where the values have come down and are basing their argument on such reduction in value. However, it must be appreciated that the EPF is not a hedge fund where investments are made mainly for short-term gains, but a Fund that makes investments with the intention of realizing long-term gains.

In an era where interest rates are likely to decline in the medium to long-term, the EPF has taken the view that returns from investments in government securities and debt instruments only would not provide sufficiently high returns across such a long-term time horizon. Therefore, the need to diversify the EPF investment portfolio has been considered important while maintaining the overall safety and stability of the Fund.

In that background, over the recent past, the EPF has made several investments in various listed corporates through the Colombo Stock Exchange and also in selected, unlisted corporates on the basis of, inter alia, intrinsic value of the company, its growth prospects, the possible enhancement of share value in the medium to long-term, its governing structures, its viability and prospects of the industry, the quantity of shares available, the future plans, the impact of the growing economy on the company et cetera.

Such shares in various corporates have been gradually accumulated over the past several months in a methodical and professional manner. Other than in the case of a comparatively fewer transactions within the smaller trading portfolio, which has also yielded capital gains of several hundred million rupees, the larger portion of the share acquisitions over the recent past has been made with the intention of holding over the medium to longer period. That is why even at the height of the bullish trend of the share market when the ASPI reached its peak in the latter part of 2010 and early 2011 resulting in significant unrealized gains in the EPF long-term portfolio of over Rs. 19 billion, the EPF Investment Committee took the view that it would be best to hold those stocks in its portfolio over the longer period since it was considered likely that the gains in the longer time frame would be substantially higher than the unrealized gains that were recorded at the last peak of the market.

In this background, the current concerted effort to highlight the decreases in values of certain selected stocks in the wide portfolio of the EPF during the period of a temporary slump of the market, is obviously an endeavour carried out by certain persons who are attempting to discredit the EPF to further their own agendas.

I will now turn to the ETF. I wish to inform that under Section 8 (d) of the Employees' Trust Fund Act, No. 46 of 1980, the ETF Board is empowered to conduct day-to-day investments including share operations. Under Section 9 of the same Act, Cabinet approval is obtained only if the ETF Board acquires a controlling interest of an enterprise.

As at 18th June, 2012, the total investment portfolio is Rs. 140 billion, out of which Rs. 130.6 billion, that is, 92.95 per cent, is invested in State sector investments, whilst Rs. 8.3 billion, only 5.88 per cent, is invested in shares. Further, I wish to inform you that according to a

1083 1084

Board decision, the ETF can invest only up to a maximum of 6 per cent of its investment portfolio in shares.

Now, I want to take some time to inform you of our position regarding the Standard and Poors assessment of the Sri Lankan banking system. I would also like to draw your attention to a contrary view that has been taken by the IMF, for example. After the recent review, the IMF held a press conference and this is what the Head of the review mission Dr. John Nelmes said about our banking system, who had been quoted by the "Daily Mirror" of 20th June, 2012 in an article. I quote:

'There is a small issue in terms of non-performing loans in the banking system but this is really a very small issue. Overall, the banking system remains sound, solid and well capitalized with a strong liquidity position.

To date, there has been a very small increase in NPLs. However, these are natural movements that you can expect to see in this macroeconomic environment,'

So, that is the approach of the IMF vis-a-vis the analysis regarding our local banks. I would like to put on record what we think of the Standard and the Poors assessment. With regard to the statement by Standard and Poors issued a few days ago on the Sri Lankan banking system, it is our view that this statement is factually incorrect, illogically analysed and is highly contradictory.

Quite contrary to the rationale for the statement, the Sri Lankan banking system is sound and resilient with the performance of the banking sector improving over the past few years. As indicated in the table given in the response of the Central Bank to the Standard and Poor's assessment - I will give you the table later - the key financial soundness indicators of the banking sector, which account for 55 per cent of financial system assets, were maintained at healthy levels.

The Key Financial Indicators display a conspicuous improvement in the gross non-performing advances - NPA - ratio from 5.2 per cent in 2007 to 3.8 per cent in 2011 with absolute volumes of NPA indicating only a relatively lower growth of 25 per cent in comparison to the overall credit growth of 69 per cent during that period. This evidence is contrary to the comment in the Standard and Poors assessment on the existence of a "weak payment culture".

The capital base of the banking sector has increased nearly two-fold since 2007 with the introduction of the Basel capital standards and enhanced minimum capital requirement for banks. Profitability of the banking sector, which has continuously increased, has further reinforced the level of capital. These factors have contributed to the improvement in capital adequacy ratios despite the significant growth in assets.

It is pertinent to note that the core capital ratio and total capital ratio of 5 and 10 per cent respectively, imposed by the Central Bank are more stringent than the international standards.

Liquidity of the banking system has been well managed with the statutory liquid assets ratio being maintained well above the limit of 20 per cent. The growth in deposits and significant representation of retail deposits, further support liquidity risk mitigation.

Concentration of credit exposure is regulated by the Central Bank with directions on maximum amount of accommodation, lending to related parties and banks being advised to impose sector-wise exposure limits. Any concentrations to certain entities have been permitted by the Monetary Board in consideration of national priorities and/or national interest and the ability of the banks to withstand any potential risk arising from such exposure. Mandatory lending of at least 10 per cent of the advances portfolio to the agriculture sector was introduced with the intention of enhancing the food sustainability of the country.

Despite the global financial distresses, the Sri Lankan banking industry stands resilient and the regulations in force are of international standards. Licensed banks are required to comply with the requirements of the Banking Act and directions are issued on fundamentals such as capital adequacy, liquidity, related party exposure, ownership of share capital, classification of loans and advances, income recognition and provisioning, risk management in foreign exchange business, integrated risk management, off-shore banking transactions and assessment of suitability of bank directors and the key management. The compliance of banks with these regulations is monitored strictly on an on-going basis and corrective action has been initiated, where necessary.

A mandatory direction on corporate governance encompassing all aspects of good governance and transparency is already in place. All these prudential regulations are given effect in line with the Basel Core Principles of effective bank supervision issued by the Bank for International Settlement, Basel and in text and action, they are more stringent than those in many countries in the region as well as globally. Additionally, the mandatory requirement for banks to obtain certifications from external auditors on their compliance with corporate governance directions and internal controls on financial reporting, which are required to be published along with the audited financial statements provides an independent assessment for the general public on each banks level of internal controls, transparency and governance.

Further, anti-Money Laundering procedures and Know Your Customer requirements are also in place with respect to all banking transactions. Sri Lanka possesses a well-developed payments and settlement system to

1085 1086

2012 21

facilitate banking transactions, which is subject to the provisions of the Payments and Settlements Act.

Thus, the views of Standard and Poors that "the risk management practices are evolving" and that "the banking regulations in Sri Lanka are somewhat weaker than international standards" and specifically "governance and transparency are weak by global standards" are totally baseless. Importantly, this statement of Standard and Poors is self-contradictory with their contentment on key regulations for Sri Lankan banks.

The Central Bank has a continuous supervision process which is an uninterrupted monitoring of banks to assess the trends of banks on an individual and a system-wide basis. This process facilitates early identification of any potential risks. Spot examinations of banks are carried out on specific issues, as and when required, based on triggers identified through the continuous supervision process. Thus, the supervisory process is well equipped to proactively detect any build up in risks.

Further, the affairs of banks are assessed through on-site examinations which are conducted at least once in two years. However, the Central Bank conducts follow up examinations on a more frequent basis based on the risks and significance of the examination findings. Measures have already been initiated to increase the frequency of conducting on-site examinations in the future.

Hence, Standard and Poors statement that the frequency of on-site supervision may not be sufficient to detect risk build ups in banks, is not justifiable. With a view to further strengthening financial stability in the country, the mandatory deposit insurance scheme was introduced in 2010. This has helped ensure continued depositor and investor-confidence in the financial system. The deposit insurance fund amounted to Rs. 4.7 billion by end 2011. The financial safety net mechanism afforded by this is further strengthened and supplemented by access to the "Lender-of-Last-Resort Facility" available through the Central Bank.

There have been no banking failures in Sri Lanka despite the global financial crisis. In December 2008, a licensed bank faced a distress situation due to a crisis in a credit card company within the Group and not due to a failure of a finance company. The resolution framework put in place by the Central Bank in late 2007, well before the global financial crisis emanated, proved to be an anchor to the overall financial system stability especially when other countries, including ones with advanced financial systems, were struggling to protect the financial systems stability at the cost of public funds.

In addition to banks, all licensed finance companies - LFC - and specialized leasing companies - SLC - are also closely monitored and regulated by the Central Bank. LFCs and SLCs are subject to on-site examinations at least once in every two years and weekly, monthly and quarterly reports are obtained through a web-based data

reporting system. Apart from the regular supervisory procedures, spot examinations are conducted when the Central Bank identifies an issue.

Both LFCs and SLCs are also subject to appropriate prudential regulations which include directions on capital adequacy, liquidity, business transactions with related parties, classification of loans and advances, income recognition and provisioning, assessment of suitability of directors and key management personnel and corporate governance.

Further, the Finance Business Act, No. 42 of 2011 was enacted recently, which provides for enhanced supervisory and regulatory powers on LFCs and powers to curb unauthorized financial businesses. All LFCs are required to list with the Colombo Stock Exchange in order to increase transparency of finances and corporate governance.

So, on behalf of the Government, we wish to assure the public that the Sri Lankan banking system is sound and resilient and is not prone to high risk as indicated in the statement of Standard and Poors.

So, that is our position in regard to the Question raised by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. I am grateful to him for raising this matter so that we could give a very comprehensive overview of what has happened. This will go into Hansard. This will be in the public domain and we are certainly very happy that you gave us the opportunity to make these facts public. Also, as requested by you, I am tabling* the Equity Investment Portfolio of the Employees Provident Fund and the Summary of the Investments of the ETF.

Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.

, Finance and Planning Ministry "A Guide - The National Budget Making Process" .

According to that, the issuance of the Budget Call with guidelines and directions for budget preparation is the first step. Then, comes the submission of Cabinet Memorandum on Formulation of Budget, the submission of budget requests to the Department of National Budget by spending agencies - , by ministries and departments - reviewing of budget requests with spending agencies, finalization of budget requests submitted by spending agencies, the submission of Cabinet Memorandum on the next years Appropriation Bill to the Cabinet and then, the presentation of the Appropriation Bill to Parliament - the First Reading. So, before the presentation of the Appropriation Bill, we go through a long process. Then follows the Budget Speech - the Second Reading of the Budget - the Second Reading Debate, the Committee Stage Debate, expenditure authorization - issue of warrants by the Hon. Minister of Finance and Planning - and the preparation of Cash-Flow Statement for the year concered by the Treasury based on the cash forecast and approved Budget Estimate.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Order, please! I call upon the Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran to start his speech. [3.23 p.m.] .. ( .. ) (The Hon. M.A. Sumanthiran) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member. Before I stood up to speak I was looking for a personality very close to the back of the Government Benches and was relieved not to see that person but now I see him only too well in a prominent place in the House.,

I am happy today to participate in this Debate in support of the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala. I am very much in support of the suggestion that has been made that there must be a Budget Committee established so that detailed Estimates that are presented to us, year in and year out, can actually be examined in the context of a committee meeting rather than the Parliament meeting as a whole committee at the Committee Stage. With just two years experience that I have had, I am firmly convinced that the Committee Stage Debates do not deliver anything.

The obligation to exercise full control over public finance is an important function of Parliament. Perhaps, next to its legislation making function, all Parliaments around the world have been vested or most Parliaments around the world have been vested with this very important function. Even under a system of Executive Presidency, our Constitution has continued to vest in Parliament, the total control over public finance and even the finances that are allocated to the Office of the President. So, this is one area in which even though many of its powers have been taken away by the Executive Presidency, Parliament still retains - or at least, the theory is that the Parliament retains control. I say "theory" because, more and more, we have seen that control reducing and Parliament becoming irrelevant in terms of its actual control over public finance. One of the reasons for that is that the Budget Proposals are presented in the House and the main debate or the Second Reading Debate takes place. Then, when we move into the Committee Stage, there is hardly a difference between the Second Reading Debate and the Committee Stage Discussion. There is a difference but there is very little that you can

actually figure out. As I said before, the detailed estimates are seldom gone into. Only if someone raises an issue, then to counter that, those figures are looked at. It is a token cut that is proposed and all information that the 225 Members here are supposed to study and debate, are never gone into. As we work in Committees in Parliament, we have also had the experience: the atmosphere is very different; there is less acrimony; there is less consciousness of party divides and the subject matter is taken up for discussion far more.

Hon. Presiding Member, you have been in the centre of the storm with regard to insisting that Members speak only on the subject matter even if you breach that all the time when you speak, but that is an important issue. We have had situations where the subject matter is something but if anybody sat in the Gallery and listened, he would not really know what the subject matter on paper was because anything and everything is generally spoken to the Galleries. That is not a healthy trend, I do agree with you. It is not a healthy trend because one has to contain himself or herself to the subject matter at hand and do justice to the matter at hand.

The Budget Debates that go on for 26 days, as the Mover has stated, is one that people of the country follow with great interest. They are interested because increase/decrease in prices, changes in cost of living, all those are matters that drastically affect their lifestyle. And, little do we realize that there is a very detailed examination by most of our people on the contributions that are made in Parliament with regard to Budget Proposals. Their expectations are generally not met fully because of this present system that we have, which is not efficient to say the least.

We have a lot of issues that the Parliament must deal with and it is dealt with most efficiently in Committees than in the House. I can give various examples. There are minute and very detailed matters which are generally discussed at the Consultative Committees, COPE or PAC but with regard to the Budget, there is hardly any opportunity to go into detailed matters. That is not only with regard to Budget, but also with regard to other matters.

The Hon. Presiding Member will appreciate that presently we have a situation of various developmental programmes that are undertaken, particularly in the North and the East. Various assistances are being given and are being handed out to people. Our constant complaint in this Parliament has been that the people's representatives are not consulted with regard to this process as to who the beneficiaries are of housing projects, as to who should be the recipients of the distribution of bicycles. There was one instance when I raised the issue about tractors. Today, we have an issue in the Mannar District where the Indian Government is offering boats to fishermen. The recipients had been identified and were to receive those

1105 1106

[ () ]

2012 21

but at the last minute, that list was withdrawn and a particular Minister concerned is now about to give those boats to his supporters.

Now, these are all detailed matters with regard to which there must be a system where in Committees, the matter must be discussed. It is only in Committees that such details as to who a better recipient is, can be determined. It is also an opportunity for people's representatives to participate. Even if the meetings are held in Colombo, people's representatives should participate in those detailed discussions, rather than leave it entirely at the whims and fancies of persons who have power in those areas and who disregard the elected members wishes and their participation, their views in conducting or getting on with developmental work.

So, I would like to endorse the Motion and would like to thank the Hon. Member who has proposed it. I think this is one Motion on which there will be consensus on both sides of the House today. So, there is nothing that should prevent us, nothing that should prevent the Hon. Speaker, to take this on board and perhaps form a committee to discuss further how this Budgetary Estimation Committees or other committees can be formed and, if necessary, amend the Standing Orders also in that regard. That is, if it is necessary at all.

If we move in that direction, by November this year itself when the Budget Proposals are to be placed, we will have a new system in place and as has been said by many people already, this is a trend that we see worldwide. We can draw many lessons from other countries as to how these things happen, that the wisdom there can be used with attendant results - even bad experiences.

There have been many Parliamentary Delegations that have visited many countries, even from this Parliament, in the last two years. All those observations the Hon. Members have gathered from their visits to other places: how these committee systems work in other places, how it does not work, all that can be pooled together and we can have an efficient system to debate the Budget Proposals.

Thank you very much. ( ) (The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana. You have 15 minutes. [3.36 p.m.] () ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) Hon. Presiding Member, I am very happy to support the Adjournment Motion which has been brought in by the Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala, to set up a separate

Committee for Budgetary Proposals because I think it is a vital need to discharge the responsibilities of this House to the people of our country. We all know that besides legislative functions, we have the task of approving the Budget and based on that approval, to make sure that what is being proposed by the various ministries is fully implemented.

In this connection, I am happy to say that we, along with the Speaker, went to China and the Hon. John Amaratunga also was a part of our team. One of the things that we learnt there was that they have an Economic Affairs Committee at the highest level in their Parliament. They have this set up and it meets regularly round the year. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) There is a difference. There is no Opposition in that set up. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana) Whether there is an Opposition or not, they are going ahead because they have a system that works. So, let us learn from that experience. But, even countries which have an Opposition have resorted to this type of thing. So, I think that this Committee that is going to be set up should not be something that only meets occasionally, it should meet right through the year, where it gets an input from the various planning authorities. But, here I must say that this is a very weak area in our system. There is no - shall we say - adequately-staffed Planning Commission like there is in India, which is operating right round the year. I visited the Planning Commission in India, the Scientific Affairs Committee. They had seven PhD holders who were heading various divisions and this was a fully-fledged office with adequate staff and which was getting in data right through the year and then coming out with information which could be used not only for planning purposes but also for monitoring what was going on. So, I think we need to have a Committee which will function in that way. If we can do it to that extent, then we can effectively ensure that the public funds are properly utilized in the way that is approved by Cabinet and by Parliament.

We have had a brief experience of a Select Committee which was put into operation before the last Budget. This was headed by the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva and the Opposition also participated in it. During that process - I am giving my own experience - it performed an extremely useful function.

We, as Senior Ministers, have been given a certain mandate, which I will read out. Firstly, coordination of activities in Ministries related to subject areas such as science, research, technology, education, information

1107 1108

technology, industry, skills development and engineering services with the objective of scientific development in Sri Lanka. Secondly, cooordination and review of programmes implemented by relevant institutions aiming to utilize scientific research and technology sectors for national development. This is a very important function in my view, especially in the context of a weak planning mechanism. I am not finding fault here with those who are in the planning mechanism. It is not their fault if they are not adequately staffed and not provided with the resources to perform their functions properly. But, in this context, what has been given to us is an important task. To implement this task, I submitted a proposal and when it went up, I am sorry to say, it was not included in the Budget Proposals. I do not know for what reason. Thereafter, the situation was such that if I was to exercise my mandate with the limited amount of funds that were given to a Senior Minister, it was impossible to carry out this task. Therefore, I worked out a project and in terms of that project requested Rs. 60 million to be earmarked for the setting up of a framework, which would also have a backup of information technology to get up-to-date information from all these ministries and institutions so that it could be tied up with the national development objectives. But, what happened? It was not included in the Budget Proposals. Fortunately, this Select Committee was there and I was able to bring it up there. The Select Committee accepted that this was a necessity and they advocated inclusion of this Rs. 60 million in the Budget but if it cannot be included from the Consolidated Fund, that the funds be made available for this purpose. But, I am sorry to say that up to this moment - six months have lapsed - I have not received even one cent of that money. I was prepared to go ahead with this whole programme: we had got everything ready; we had a task force, worked out the details of what should be done but it was not possible to implement this. So, when we took this matter up at the Committee Stage Discussion of the Budget, this was approved and when we took it up subsequently with the Treasury, they said that the scheme of recruitment of the people whom we require for this has to be approved by the Salaries and Cadre Commission as well as by the MSD before they could release any funds.

Now, Sir, the responsibility of the Treasury is not micromanagement. Micromanagement is the task of the concerned ministry. Macroeconomic management is what they should be concerned with. Once Parliament has agreed to release that amount of money, then it should be given to us so that we can proceed with what Parliament has mandated. So, I think even if we set up this type of a Budget Committee, it should have powers to make sure that what is approved by that Committee is implemented in a timely fashion and effectively. So, I make this suggestion to the House.

I agree with what the Hon. Leader of the Opposition said that there should be a committee set up which will

look into these matters and work out as to how this whole mechanism should be put into practice. I am very glad that the Opposition is supportive of this very good Motion which has been moved by the Hon. Thilanaga Sumathipala. And, through this, I am sure, that we will be able to make effective use of such a Committee especially where a new set of ministers like the Senior Ministers, who have a new function of co-ordinating, monitoring and reviewing, is coming up. That also needs to be put into effect. It needs to be provided for in the Committee that will be set up.

I would like to state that we have to work out some way in which - while we look at the national allocation of funds - the division of funds among different sectors, different ministries, could be done. Within each sector, there has to be some process by which the needs of that sector are adequately dealt with. For this purpose, there maybe a system of subcommittees which will be set up in terms of the whole Committee so that these subcommittees can meet and look into particular sectoral needs of individual ministries and institutions. So, if it is done in that matter, I am sure that we will be able to work out an effective system which will meet the needs of our country.

Thank you. ( ) (The Presiding Member) The Hon. Joseph Michael Perera, please. Twenty five minutes has been allotted to you. [. . 3.48]

Budgetary powers were among the first to be acquired by the Parliament and have been further strengthened with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. The European Parliament now approves, on an equal footing with the Council,

all the expenditure contained in the annual budget of the European Union.

With 43 members and the same number of substitute members, the Committee on Budgets is mainly responsible for drafting the Parliaments position on the EUs annual budget (EUR 147.2 billion in commitments and EUR 129.1 billion in payments for the financial year 2012).

In addition to that, the Budgets Committee is also in charge of preparing the negotiations of the Multiannual Financial Framework (or financial perspective) which determines the framework for the annual budgetary procedures for a period

of 7 years. Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, where it was once again reiterated that the EU Budget has to be fully financed by own resources, the Budgets Committee is now working on some important legislative

proposals aiming at reintroducing genuine revenue into the EU public purse."

, "International Symposium on The Changing Role of Parliament in the Budget Process" .

The printed version of the above symposium states, I quote:

"Budget Reforms and Parliament's Role in the Process: Experiences in Turkey and Selected EU Member Countries"

. . .

Budget Committee Herbert Boesch . He states, I quote:

"A Committee for Budget and another for Budgetary Control:

The increasing complexity - and workload - as regards both the establishment and the control of the budget for a modern society makes it necessary for a parliament to have a specific committee for the two different functions.

1123 1124

Parliaments are free to organize the work as they find best and the absence of a constitutional provision for the creation of a specific control committee cannot be seen as a hindrance. On the contrary, a Parliamentary initiative to create a separate control committee would be a strong signal to the public showing that Parliament cares about the use of public money. "

.

He further states, I quote:

"A parliamentary control committee should not be too big. The Committee on Budgetary Control in the European Parliament has 40 Members which some consider being a bit too many."

Matters mainly depending on the committee's own decisions"; "Focus"; "Accept the role"; "Relations with the sector specific committees", , . Committee system P.D.T. Achary, Editor in his "Practice and Procedure of Parliament" .

In page 867 under the heading "Committee on Estimates" states, I quote:

"The Lok Sabha, even though it discusses the estimates for a sufficiently long period, nevertheless finds that it has neither the time nor the flexibility to discuss the details and the technical aspects of the estimates. The Lok Sabha has, therefore, set up a Committee called the Committee on Estimates for this purpose."

It further states, I quote:

"It was in 1937 that an enquiry was first made in the Central Assembly whether the Government had any proposal for the setting up of an Estimates Committee on the lines of the Select Committee on Estimates of the House of Commons."

1937 .

It goes on to state, I quote:

"In 1949, the Secretary of the Constituent Assembly (Legislative), in a Memorandum on the reform of Parliamentary Procedure in India, emphasized the need for subjecting the estimates, presented to Parliament to a detailed examination. Since sufficient parliamentary time could not obviously be made available for examining in detail the estimates ...."

1949

Constituent Assembly Memorandum . ?

It further states, I quote:

"......... House endowed with necessary powers to examine both the appropriation accounts and the estimates. The proposal was 'strongly supported' by Speaker Mavalankar. The Government accepted this recommendation and the Minister of Finance referred to it in his Budget speech on 28 February 1950."

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Dr. Harsha De Silva, you have 10 minutes.

[6.07 p.m.]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, I think it is a very timely move by the Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala to have brought in this Adjournment Motion today to establish a Budget Committee and hopefully expand the scope of that Committee. I applaud the Hon. Members courage to bring this type of Motion to this House. I hope that he will get the necessary support to take this forward.

Beyond the Budget Committee, Sir, we need to look at two other types of Committees: one is a Public Finance Committee and the other one is a set of Oversight Committees. As the Hon. Leader of the Opposition has already stated, these two Committees have been proposed previously. What is important here is this. I will just read the first sentence: There shall be a Committee to be designated, The Committee on Public Finance consisting of a Chairman and eleven Members nominated by the Committee of Selection provided that the Chairman shall be a Member of the Opposition. So, that is a crucial point. The proposal of the Hon. Sumathipala does not have anything like that. But, it is important that the Opposition also plays an equally important role in implementing what is in the Constitution of this country. Article 148 of the Constitution specifically states, I quote:

Parliament shall have full control over public finance.

1149 1150

[ ]

2012 21

It does not say that the ruling party shall have full control over public finance. When it says "Parliament", it means all 225 of us, save the Speaker. So, what the framers of this Constitution really meant, Sir, is that both sides of this House have equal opportunity to participate in that process. It is true that the Government presents the Budget. But, it is also true that the Opposition has equal responsibility to ensure that the tax payers money is spent in the most appropriate way.

Now, Sir, we debate here the Appropriation Bill for a month but we do not debate at all how much loans we take, how we take those loans and on what terms we finance this expenditure. As a matter of fact, there is only one sentence in the Appropriation Bill that gives a limit on what the Treasury can borrow for that year. So, I think if we create a Public Finance Committee and, like the Hon. Leader of the Opposition along with some other Members have previously proposed, a set of Oversight Committees, nine Oversight Committees, to look into the various aspects of Government, from internal administration to environment and natural resources to international relations. Therefore, it is the spirit in which the framers of this Constitution envisaged that this House will conduct the duties of managing the nations finances.

Talking about the nations finances, in the last few days we have been in a very harsh debate on the Employees Provident Fund. I do not intend going into it in detail. But, in the context of an Oversight Committee, had we had an Oversight Committee, had we had a Budget Committee, we would have been able to summon these officials. Now, we are talking about the Public Accounts Committee. That is bean counting - closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. That is not what we are proposing here. Sir, the Employees Provident Fund has not come to the Public Accounts Committee for the duration of this Government. For six years these people have not come to the Public Accounts Committee.

So, Sir, how is it then possible for us as Members of Parliament to have full control of public finance.

As a matter of fact, there is a clause in the 1958 Bill of the Hon. T.B. Ilangaratne that if the EPF is unable to make a minimum payment of two and a half per cent to the members of the EPF that this House shall allocate such funds from the Consolidated Fund and subsequently those funds should be paid back. Therefore, it is very clear that the EPF has to be managed in an appropriate way and this House is responsible for that.

Now, we know that the day before yesterday an international agency, the Standard and Poor's rating agency, had issued a statement alleging that there are conflicts of interest in the way the Employees Provident Fund is managed. Those conflicts of interest have been very specifically referred to by the then Attorney-General, I believe in the early 2000s, and the logic for that is that

the Monetary Board, while regulating the commercial banks, also regulates the EPF. Therefore, the conflicts of interest can arise because it is the same regulatory agency that is looking at both the commercial banks and the EPF. That is why the Investment Policy created then very specifically said, No, the EPF should not be investing in banks and financial institutions. It said, No, it cannot. It also said, among other things, that it can invest only in what are called blue-chip equities, meaning, companies of repute, meaning companies that are at least listed on the main board of the stock exchange; not those companies that are listed in the secondary board. Now, what has happened is, in the recent past, all those regulations, or shall I say, the guidelines have been violated. The EPF has violated its own investment guidelines and are now engaged in buying and selling shares of stocks and also in the process nationalizing these private banks because if you look at the shareholding structure of most of the large commercial banks today, you will find either the EPF or the ETF and the Government-owned banks and insurance companies control the largest number of shares individually and collectively. So, while there are guidelines, these guidelines have been violated.

Now, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama read the Governments reply to the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition - ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon Member, please wind up now. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, can you please give me three more minutes, I will finish quickly.

Yesterday, the Central Bank issued a statement with its usual allegations that the Opposition is trying to destabilize this economy. Regularly, they say this. Then, they say, "Based on the above, the EPF wishes to affirm that there is no conflict of interest and that the EPF believes that the statement by S & P seems to be based on certain recent allegations that have obviously been designed to achieve the objective of discrediting the EPF". We have no intention of discrediting the EPF.

We are not here to do that. We are not bankrupt politicians. That is not what we are saying. Sir, all what we are saying is that if there are certain guidelines laid down, those guidelines must be adhered to. In a situation where we do not have any authority to question these people before problems arise, and even afterwards when we have no opportunity to summon them before the Committee on Public Accounts for six years, how can we, Sir, live by what we are supposed to live by, according to the Constitution of this country?

1151 1152

The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama today said, The EPF investing team and the Department is completely independent of the Bank Supervision Department. So, why he is saying that is because the Bank Supervision Department is the department that regulates the banks and the EPF Department is the department that invests in those banks. Therefore, the point is being made that there is complete independence between these two departments. I do not have time to go into this but I am going to -

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up now. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, I will wind up now. I will just make this point. We can talk about this later in great detail. I am sure it will become a point of debate. The Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena yesterday tabled a document on the dates of the Investment Committee meetings and persons who have attended for that in the year 2011. Of the people who are in this Investment Committee for 2011, the first person is the gentleman by the name of Mr. P.D.J. Fernando. He left subsequently and joined a company called Taprobane Holdings Limited, which is owned by a gentleman by the name of Mr. Ajith Devasurendra who has been in the news. Subsequently, the Deputy Governor, Mr. B.D.W.A. Silva was appointed as the head of the Investment Committee of the EPF. But, what we found out was that he is the Deputy Governor in charge of bank supervision.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, I am winding up. He is in charge of bank supervision. He is the Deputy Governor in charge of bank supervision. He is heading the Investment Committee of the EPF. How can the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama come here and say that there is independence between the Bank Supervision Department and the EPF? These questions can be discussed later on. To wind up, Sir, once again I commend the Motion brought by the Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala. We would like to support that and in addition to that, we would like to propose that the Public Finance Committee and the 10 Oversight Committees also be looked into that.

Thank you.

[6.21 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, when we are asked to discuss certain structural alterations in our Parliamentary system, I feel, Sir, that I have to perform a pleasant task and I remind this House that the Executive President, who is called upon to be present in this House once in three months is a very significant and progressive piece of constitutional provision in our Parliamentary system, came to this House 42 years ago and first entered Parliament on the 6th of June, 1970. He has completed 42 years since he first entered Parliament and today, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa is hailed as one of the great leaders in Asia. Significantly, today he is addressing the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil together with all great leaders in the world. So, for little Sri Lanka, he has been a beacon of light and has assumed almost the leadership of Asia because he is the most senior leader in this part of the world.

Sir, I should remind that he came to Parliament from the Beliatta Electorate at the age of 24 as the youngest Member of Parliament. He polled 23,103 votes with a majority of 6,626. That is a percentage of 57 per cent. On that occasion, he had a poster pasted in his Electorate, with a kavi, which I quote:

That is how he registered his first entry after the great victory and still, he is reigning victorious. This kavi was quoted by Mr. C. Kuruppu, the Librarian of the Parliament, in his article " 42" published in the Silumina newspaper of 27th May, 2012.

Now, Sir, the Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala, my dear Friend and Colleague, has earned the goodwill of perhaps both sides of this House and there is concensus -[Interruption.] Yes, the Hon. Member is my "dear Friend" outside the House and inside, he is my "Honourable Colleague" and he has moved a very timely Motion.

What does it call for, Sir? I would like to quote from "Practice & Procedure of Parliament" by M.N. Kaul and S.L. Shakdher and edited by P.D.T. Achary. What the Hon. Member exactly envisages is given in that book under Parliamentary Committees - Chapter XXX - of the Lok Sabha. It states, I quote:

A. Committees in General

1153 1154

[ () ]

2012 21

Parliament transacts a great deal of its business through Committees. These Committees are appointed to deal with specific items of business requiring expert or detailed consideration. The system of Parliamentary Committees is particularly useful in dealing with matters which, on account of their special or technical nature, are better considered in detail by a small number of members rather than by the House itself. Moreover, the system saves the time of the House for the discussion of important matters and prevents Parliament from getting lost in details and thereby losing on matters of policy and broad principles.

What a truth the Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala has realized in Parliament today! This is the system that is followed in the Lok Sabha, the greatest democracy in the world!

Sir, Parliamentary practices and procedures are based on traditions. This is what Erskine May, the authority on Parliamentary procedure and practices, says in the Introduction of his voluminous book, I quote:

'The law, privileges, proceedings and usages of Parliament in a nation with a long history and an unwritten constitution must be discovered largely by observing its practice, rather than by consulting fundamental texts and the decisions of a Supreme Court.

The Great Britain has an unwritten Constitution and up to this day, they have not faltered in their Parliamentary system. It is the Mother Parliament. We are following the same system which is called the Westminster system. Erskine May further goes on to state in its Introduction, I quote:

The law of Parliament includes those aspects of Parliamentary activity that depend for their effectiveness on recognition by the courts, and such law - although it may be unwritten - is only changed by way of statute. But most Parliamentary procedure and usage derives from the admitted right of each House to regulate its own proceedings,

That is, the House of Lords and the House of Commons there. We had the Senate earlier. Now, we have only one Chamber. Earlier, we had a bicameral system; it is a unicameral system that we have today. So, these practices and procedures are being adopted and followed by democracies all over the world.

Sir, I have here a very important magazine called "The Parliamentarian" which we receive regularly, and that also mentions about the practices followed in various Parliaments in the world including the Parliaments of Tongo, Panama, Seychelles etc. It is very well edited by the Commonwealth Secretariat, UK, and the Hon. Members of this House also receive copies of it regularly.

Sir, now I must also add a word of caution. That is, Parliament is Supreme. The whole power vests in Parliament. We are the voice of the people. We derive the power from the people's sovereignty. Of course, we say, in our Islamic terminology, that we derive power from God. But, in the Parliamentary system, it is from the people.

When we try to shift or reshuffle it a little bit here and there, there should not be any injuries caused to the existing system because our Parliamentary system is foolproof. It has been thought of very well and the Standing Orders are very well drafted. We are very clear on that. There are 142 numbers in our Standing Orders, which have provisions for the various Committees like the COPE, the Committee on Public Petitions, the Committee on Public Accounts, the Consultative Committees and so on.

Today, what has happened is that there is a freak Opposition; the Opposition is in tatters. For a healthy Parliamentary democracy, there must be a powerful Opposition. Sir, I would recall the first Election in 1947. Through manipulation, you can make the winning party lose and the losing party win. Sir, take for example, the 1947 Election, It was a staggered election. It was held for 19 days: from 23rd, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 30th of August and 1st, 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 20th of September, 1947. For how many days had it gone on?

Now, we have a foolproof system that we have the election conducted in one day covering the entire Island. That is the progress we have made through this. What happened at the Election held in 1947? The United National Party polled a total number of 751,432 votes, securing 42 seats. Out of a total of 95 seats, six, of course, was nominated under the Soulbury Constitution.

Sir, the most important thing is, the Opposition received about 111,000 votes at that Election.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, it is almost 6.30 p.m. now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Then, Sir, the tornado sent down by that fearful speedster, the Hon. (Dr.) N.M. Perera, just missed by, what we call in Cricket parlance, a "whisker", missing the off stump of that clever batsman, the Hon. D.S. Senanayake and lobbed into the gloves of the wicketkeeper, Lord Soulbury. The ball flew within a kissing distance, so to say. The Hon. Thilanga Sumathipala knows that cricket parlance.

Today, we would say healthy Parliamentary traditions could be built as a consensus has been reached in this House between the Government and the Opposition. In future, we can look forward to having great and healthy traditions built through Parliament of Sri Lanka, which

1155 1156

would be a lesson to most of the Parliamentary democracies in the world.

As I began, Sir, may I again pay the tribute of the entire House to His Excellency the President, who has rendered a distinguished service since becoming a Member of this House 42 years ago.

Thank you, Sir.
