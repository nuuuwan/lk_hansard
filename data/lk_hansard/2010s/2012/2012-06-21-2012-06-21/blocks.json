Perhaps, next to its legislation making function, all Parliaments around the world have been vested or most Parliaments around the world have been vested with this very important function. Even under a system of Executive Presidency, our Constitution has continued to vest in Parliament, the total control over public finance and even the finances that are allocated to the Office of the President. So, this is one area in which even though many of its powers have been taken away by the Executive Presidency, Parliament still retains - or at least, the theory is that the Parliament retains control. I say \"theory\" because, more and more, we have seen that control reducing and Parliament becoming irrelevant in terms of its actual control over public finance. One of the reasons for that is that the Budget Proposals are presented in the House and the main debate or the Second Reading Debate takes place. Then, when we move into the Committee Stage, there is hardly a difference between the Second Reading Debate and the Committee Stage Discussion. There is a difference but there is very little that you can",

But, even countries which have an Opposition have resorted to this type of thing. So, I think that this Committee that is going to be set up should not be something that only meets occasionally, it should meet right through the year, where it gets an input from the various planning authorities. But, here I must say that this is a very weak area in our system. There is no - shall we say - adequately-staffed Planning Commission like there is in India, which is operating right round the year. I visited the Planning Commission in India, the Scientific Affairs Committee. They had seven PhD holders who were heading various divisions and this was a fully-fledged office with adequate staff and which was getting in data right through the year and then coming out with information which could be used not only for planning purposes but also for monitoring what was going on. So, I think we need to have a Committee which will function in that way. If we can do it to that extent, then we can effectively ensure that the public funds are properly utilized in the way that is approved by Cabinet and by Parliament.",

Secondly, cooordination and review of programmes implemented by relevant institutions aiming to utilize scientific research and technology sectors for national development. This is a very important function in my view, especially in the context of a weak planning mechanism. I am not finding fault here with those who are in the planning mechanism. It is not their fault if they are not adequately staffed and not provided with the resources to perform their functions properly. But, in this context, what has been given to us is an important task. To implement this task, I submitted a proposal and when it went up, I am sorry to say, it was not included in the Budget Proposals. I do not know for what reason. Thereafter, the situation was such that if I was to exercise my mandate with the limited amount of funds that were given to a Senior Minister, it was impossible to carry out this task. Therefore, I worked out a project and in terms of that project requested Rs. 60 million to be earmarked for the setting up of a framework, which would also have a backup of information technology to get up-to-date information from all these ministries and institutions so that it could be tied up with the national development objectives. But, what happened? It was not included in the Budget Proposals. Fortunately, this Select Committee was there and I was able to bring it up there. The Select Committee accepted that this was a necessity and they advocated inclusion of this Rs. 60 million in the Budget but if it cannot be included from the Consolidated Fund, that the funds be made available for this purpose. But, I am sorry to say that up to this moment - six months have lapsed - I have not received even one cent of that money. I was prepared to go ahead with this whole programme: we had got everything ready; we had a task force, worked out the details of what should be done but it was not possible to implement this. So, when we took this matter up at the Committee Stage Discussion of the Budget, this was approved and when we took it up subsequently with the Treasury, they said that the scheme of recruitment of the people whom we require for this has to be approved by the Salaries and Cadre Commission as well as by the MSD before they could release any funds.",

Macroeconomic management is what they should be concerned with. Once Parliament has agreed to release that amount of money, then it should be given to us so that we can proceed with what Parliament has mandated. So, I think even if we set up this type of a Budget Committee, it should have powers to make sure that what is approved by that Committee is implemented in a timely fashion and effectively. So, I make this suggestion to the House.",

For this purpose, there maybe a system of subcommittees which will be set up in terms of the whole Committee so that these subcommittees can meet and look into particular sectoral needs of individual ministries and institutions. So, if it is done in that matter, I am sure that we will be able to work out an effective system which will meet the needs of our country.",

Now, what has happened is, in the recent past, all those regulations, or shall I say, the guidelines have been violated. The EPF has violated its own investment guidelines and are now engaged in buying and selling shares of stocks and also in the process nationalizing these private banks because if you look at the shareholding structure of most of the large commercial banks today, you will find either the EPF or the ETF and the Government-owned banks and insurance companies control the largest number of shares individually and collectively.
