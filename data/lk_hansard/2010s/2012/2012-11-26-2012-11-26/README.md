. . . a . .

The functions of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has been significantly expanding during the recent years due mainly to the issue of sovereign bonds, increased international reserves and investor promotions for Government securities.

Further expansion of the functions due to emerging economic activities and foreign exchange liberalization was envisaged and the need for opening offices in selected international cities was expected.

Accordingly, the CBSL, in 2010, sought legal opinion of the Attorney General on the possibility of purchasing premises abroad. The Monetary Board, at the meeting held on 10.01.2011, having considered the views of the Attorney General and the reduced property prices now prevailing, approved the purchase of building properties suitable for offices in selected international cities on a case-by-case basis with the prior approval of the Monetary Board. The Monetary Board also approved the renting out of such building properties to the Diplomatic Missions of Sri Lanka at market rates until such time the CBSL requires these buildings for its own use.

A team consisting of the Chief Government Valuer and senior officers from the Ministry of External Affairs and the CBSL inspected several buildings in New York City and recommended the purchase of the second floor

of the Diplomat Centre Condominium Building, No. 820, 2nd Avenue, New York at US Dollars 5,250,000. After negotiations with the owner, the purchase price was reduced to US Dollars 5,075,000. The Monetary Board, at the meeting held on 25th April, 2011, approved the purchase of this property at a cost of US Dollars 5,075,000.

This property was purchased by the Central Bank on 30th August, 2011. The complete details of this purchase were notified to the Cabinet of Ministers by Cabinet Paper No. 11/2076/504/171 dated 18th October, 2011 by the Minister of Finance and Planning.

The property was rented out to the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of Sri Lanka through an agreement dated 28th May, 2012 for three years from 1st June, 2012 at a monthly rental of US Dollars 68,000 payable in Sri Lankan Rupees.

All those are given there. There are 12 points.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I am asking about revenue and expenditure. Look at Table 1.1. You start with Table 1.1. It does not give the estimates and the actuals. It only gives 2011-

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Revenue projections are all there in the Budget. - [Interruption.]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I am not talking about the Budget. I am talking about Section 12(2) of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Hon. Member, I want to point out that this has been the regular format from the time this was introduced by you all. - [Interruption.]

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) No. - [Interruption.] () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No. It was brought in at the time - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, this is not a Debate. You may ask Supplementary Questions. Let the Hon. Minister answer. If you want a Debate, you can ask for it later.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) If there are any ways in which we can improve it, we will certainly consider it.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Let me ask this question. By Table 1.14 you are giving the estimates and the actuals for cash flow. I understand that. Thank you very much. But, the Act states that you must give the same information for revenue and expenditure. All what I am asking is, where is that?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) All what I can say at the present moment is that we have been following the established format. If there are other suggestions, maybe, to bring it in line with the Act, we will do so. I think this was brought in 2003 by the present Hon. Leader of the Opposition.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) But the Hon. Leader of the Opposition -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) So, now we have been following that format.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) Sir, can I ask my third Supplementary Question? ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Certainly. () ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) My third Supplementary Question is this. The Supreme Court has said that the Appropriation Bill for 2013 is unconstitutional. Are you going to do something about it before the Vote on the Third Reading of the Budget is taken?

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) We will inform you well in time.

() ( () ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) This is the same thing that you all are doing. What is in the law does not - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Is it a matter of Privilege or a point of Order? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, the other day, mentioned about newspaper reports on the Resolution before Parliament against the Chief Justice. The headline of todays Daily News also refers to the Resolution before Parliament against the Chief Justice. The Hon. Speaker very clearly stated that he would call certain editors who publish privileged information creating a distortion. If it was an equitable presentation, that does not matter. But, this particular headline states that certain bank accounts have not been declared -

1225 1226

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is the newspaper?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is the "Daily News" of today. It is the headline.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) If there is anything pertaining to the investigation by the Select Committee, - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, it is. The entire article is pertaining to the Chief Justice.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) If there is anything pertaining to the investigation by the Select Committee, certainly that will be looked into and dealt with. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, the very fact that I got up to raise this is in the headlines of today's newspaper and the damage is done. - [Interruption.] I mean, have we assumed judicial powers? - [Interruption.] You see, 117 Members have cast aspersions on the Chief Justice and they are saying that the bank accounts information - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) As per the provisions of Standing Order No. 78A(8), whatever pertaining to the investigation by the Select Committee shall not be revealed to a third party.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I appreciate that. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) So, had that been revealed? - [Interruption.] The Hon. Speaker will look into that and appropriate action will be taken.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Will you bring the editor before - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Certainly, if information pertaining to the inquiry before the Select Committee is revealed. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is todays headlines - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) We do not know because we have not read it. Now that you have brought it up, if it - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, you can read it. [Interruption.] If one of my Colleagues from the Opposition mentioned that or even if somebody attempted to mention something on this matter, it would have been brought before the Committee on Privileges. But, when it is done by the Government - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) This is not the time for arguing.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is mentioned here and I quote the headline: The damning charges over 20 bank accounts not declared in declaration of assets and liabilities ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Okay. I have given you a hearing and also given an Order. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Deputy Speaker, what more can this be than a blatant violation?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Thank you for allowing me to raise this matter. There is a news report on page 1 of today's Daily News titled Ethics and Entrances. I do not want to read the whole report. So, I quote the relevant portion of it:

.The President and the Chief Justice are entitled to use that entrance by virtue of office. However, the CJ let two members of her retinue - lawyers we are told - to use that entrance as well, and it is now being asked what is the moral integrity of what she did? Does her rights as Chief Justice extend to others including hangers-on or faithful retainers as well?...

Now, Sir -

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Right. Now, you have brought that to the notice of the Chair, that will be looked into.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I have to make my submission.- [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Order, please! You have brought that article referred to in the said newspaper to the notice of the Chair. So, I will refer it to the Hon. Speaker and appropriate action will be taken.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I have a right to substantiate what I say. They stand accused of affronting the Order issued by the Hon. Speaker and thereby undermining the supremacy of Parliament. Even Ministers, Members, Secretary to the President are subjected to the security search.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) All that will be taken into consideration. ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition)

. . rose.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Yes, Hon. Leader of the Opposition. ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Hon. Deputy Speaker, I think we have given enough publicity to the Daily News and the Daily Mirror but I would like to talk of an issue where publicity has not been given.

a . , . . . , . , . , . . [ ]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) It would have been due to a delay in obtaining an order from the Hon. Speaker to expunge certain portions. I will look into the delay and see to it that the video clips are released today.

( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) To my knowledge, there was no order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Leader of the Opposition, I will look into that and see to it that the relevant -

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) I understand that some adjustments have been made and the CD and verbatim report have been sent back. Why do you not give an order that it be published after erasing that particular sentence?

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) That will be done. I will be attending to it in the course of the day.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Please release it this morning. ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Sajith Premadasa, what is your point of order? Too many points of Order today from all factions.

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) Sir, thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to speak on Heads 119, the Votes of the Ministry of Power and Energy and Head 115, the Votes of the Ministry of Petroleum Industries.

First, I will deal with the Votes of the Ministry of Power and Energy. The Hon. Minister is well-known to me. He was a signatory to the PA Manifesto along with my Friend, the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena. I want to ask the Hon. Minister whether he went through the articles published in "The Sunday Leader" of the 18th and 25th of November regarding the import of substandard coal. I want him to go through it and see that action is taken to punish those people who are responsible for importing substandard coal. Actually, what happened was, they arranged with the Noble Company -

a ( ) (An Hon. Member) Hon. Member, are you referring to Power and Energy or Petroleum?

. ( . ) (The Hon. A. Vinayagamoorthy) I will come to that. The headline of the news item that appeared in "The Sunday Leader" of 25th November 2012, states, USD 8.8 million coal exchanged for poor quality. What happened was, 85,891 MT of coal which was brought here last April could not be unloaded due to inclement weather conditions. So, the three parties involved: the Ceylon

1301 1302

Shipping Corporation, the Ceylon Electricity Board and the Lanka Coal Company, got together and decided to re-sell it, to re-export it.

I do not know how they found the Taurian Company and gave the entire shipment worth US Dollars 8.9 million with an understanding that they would replace them some months later with the same standard of coal. Then, before they brought it here the standard was checked both at the Indonesian Port as well as our Ports Authority. Thereafter the Ceylon Shipping Corporation gave an order and got down the substandard coal. This was tested twice at the Indonesian Port by an Indonesian Agency and by some other company. I do not know why they wanted two certificates. The Indonesian company did not give a favourable report. Then, at that stage itself this company should have stopped it. But, they brought it here. They got it checked again by a Swiss company and the Swiss company said that this cannot be used. So, we are losing nearly US Dollars Rs. 8.8 million due to poor quality coal which cannot be used. I hope and want the Hon. Minister to take proper action against this coal company, which was responsible for importing this substandard coal. I hope you will go through the newspaper articles and take necessary action to see that this is not repeated. I think you also intend to have a coal power plant in Trincomalee with the support of an Indian company. There, of course, the Indian company will be responsible for importing coal. Though you wanted only five acres of land, you have already acquired 15 acres. So, kindly allow the people to go and reside there in those 10 acres.

Now, according to the Auditor-General's Report of your Ministry, proper documentation had not been maintained by the CEB in respect of the transformers handed over to the Lanka Transformers Limited either for repairs or to be condemned and details of transformers to be returned to the CEB from LTL. I hope you are aware of this. The CEB had invested a sum of Rs. 6,028,000, which is Rs. 6 million, for the purchase of shares of LECO, but no dividends have been declared by the company for the years 2002, 2003, 2007 and 2008.

The Auditor-General's Report states that they were unable to ascertain the accuracy and completeness of the infrastructure work in progress and the balance appropriately amounting to Rs. 590 million due to unavailability of adequate information. Then, for the Samanalawewa Project, a sum of Rs. 100 million which is due to your Ministry from the Treasury has not yet been received. So, kindly see that the money is received as early as possible.

Then, an amount of Rs. 45 billion as at 31st December, 2009 has been converted to a loan payable to the Treasury by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation in the year 2012. I do not

know how you are going to manage when you owe money like this to the Treasury.

There are several subsidiary companies under your Ministry which do not maintain accounts or the annual financial statements. That is what your audit report states. So, kindly get the subsidiary companies to prepare their annual financial statements. Then, there is lack of evidence in audit. According to the physical verification of boats, the actual number of boats available was three whereas according to the Fixed Assets Register, it was shown as nine boats. No information has been made available regarding the action taken in respect of the six missing boats. What has happened to those boats?

Then, the CEB had incurred a foreign exchange loss of Rs. 414 odd million monthly due to the foreign exchange payment and due to purchase of power from IPPs. The following differences between the ledger and the billing system cannot be verified due to non-availability of audited information. In the Kelaniya Branch - Rs. 17,549,628, Kalutara Branch - Rs. 7,285,036 and Galle Branch - 5,217,914. The payable balance according to confirmation receipts of the Ceylon Electricity Board and Lanka Transformers (Pvt.) Limited did not agree with the balance in the general ledger by Rs. 37.4 million and Rs. 3.1 million respectively for which no satisfactory explanation was received. Further, the receivable balance according to the confirmation receipts from the Ceylon Electricity Board did not agree with the general ledger by Rs. 16.3 million for which no satisfactory explanation was received.

Hon. Minister, I know you are doing very good work. But, regarding the Vadakkin Vasantham, there are still some areas which need to be electrified. So, I will give you the names of those villages to which electricity should be given. Kindly see that you try to bring down the losses and also the burden on us as far as possible.

Regarding the Petroleum Corporation, in the first instance, it should not have taken over the Caltex Company and the Shell Company. The real reason as to why those were taken over was the government at that time thought that those companies were helping the late Hon. Dudley Senanayake to run the government. Now, what is happening? Why did you enter into a hedging deal? What was the necessity? Do you know the amount of money we lost? From where can we get that money back? The Treasury cannot give money to you every month for such expenses. I think the Government cannot give you Rs. 500 million to pay as legal fees to the UK over the hedging deal. If you run the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation in this manner, a time will come where the entire Government will become bankrupt. So, you must appoint some qualified people to higher positions. It must be run as a private company and not as a government institution. If we do so, we will not incur losses.

Thank you very much.

US sanctions on Iran costs SL dear

. . . , . . ,- [ ] , . [ ]

.. ( .. ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) .

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) . . , , . , . .

Hon. Minister, you have told that US sanctions on Iran cost Sri Lanka dear. You do not need to tell this House, you knew it well before because the Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie, the previous Minister of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development previously knew this. He had put a special Cabinet Paper to get a report from the KBC Advanced Technologies PLC on this particular issue and for Euros 1.5 million he got it done, but nothing has happened thereafter. This was done five years ago. So, even though Iran is a good friend of your Government it is not a friend of the world. So, on that -

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) KBC Advanced Technologies PLC did the feasibility report and they submitted it in the latter part of 2010. By that time of course, American sanctions were there.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Even 2010 is long ago. .. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) No, no. At the end of 2010 - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You all did not have the courage of conviction to go ahead with this because you all were basically flirting with Iran, you do not have the money -

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) No, we tried our level best.

1357 1358

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, unfortunately, I do not have the liberty of having surplus time on my hand. Please ensure that the time is given from the Government side.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) We tried our level best, but the Iranians were not interested in that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, all I say is, you should have prepared for this. You need not tell us because the world knew that sanctions were going to be put on Iran. So, you should have prepared for that and ensured that the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery is operated with crude oil bought from some other country. Do not give us answers.You all have been there for 18 years ruining the country and the economy.

Now, look at ENOC. You got substandard oil from ENOC. It is not once, twice, thrice or four times. For how many times it went on; from one to the other, it moved. Can you tell me how much you have got as compensation? Still nothing.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) According to our calculation it is around Rs. 55 million.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What is Rs. 55 million with the impact that was there, Hon. Minister?

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) That is the calculation.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) But, still, we have not got compensation as such. You should have told, "This is the impact on the country and this is the compensation we need". But, it was not done.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) They have promised.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

They have promised. This is like your promise of Rs. 10,000 salary increase. This is like giving a loaf of bread at Rs. 3.50. . , . . . 22,600 -negative return - , . .

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) Actually several of your Members have referred to this same issue before. You are the third Member who is repeating the same facts. Only thing is, your words are different.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

Obviously. We come at different times. I do not know what the others are saying. You said that I am the third one raising the same issue but for five years you have been saying the same thing. The Hon. Fowzie - [Interruption.]

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) You all had been advised by the same person.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake)

No, no. We stand on our own feet. We do not need anybody advising us what to do. Okay. That does not matter.

Look at the hedging deal. In regard to that also you will say this is the tenth time it is being raised. I went to court on this issue. Your Government stopped me from going forward. If we allowed the injunction, then, you would not be having a problem with the Deutsche Bank, you would not be on your knees negotiating with the Standard Chartered Bank. You had the courage because your deal was approved and asked to go forward. It is your own Attorney-Generals Department that said we have the strength and the will to do so.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) There is a possibility of cases being filed even in other countries.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That does not matter. At least if the injunction was allowed, this bank would not have gone to courts. You would have said, "I do not know". You all are going to impeach the Chief Justice of things that are unheard of and unknown.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) That is of no relevance. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, there is a relevance because if the injunction was allowed you could have said, " I am sorry, the local courts prohibited me from going forward". You would have had that amount of support from us. Now, those are excuses gone by.

Look at the CPC. It is running at a loss but you are allowing the SriLankan Airlines to have Rs. 21 billion outstanding as a debt to you.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) More than that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Even more. So, Hon. Minister, you make a bad case worse.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) But, now there is an arrangement.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Just now we had an investigation into Mihin Air at the COPE.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) We were paid Rs. 12 billion about three months ago and the balance, of course, has been rescheduled.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Mihin Air owes you Rs. 2.8 billion. The CEB owes you almost Rs. 60 billion. Then, the Ministry of Economic Development also owes you money. Hon.

Minister, you also owe him. I thought you basically pay all the money even from your own pocket. Almost Rs. 1,717 million is outstanding from you.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) Compared to others, it is a small amount.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes, small amount! So, Hon. Minister, with that in mind I look at this most important institution, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, it is a huge financial risk to the country because you have a foreign exchange exposure there. I am informed that the impact on the Bank of Ceylon and the Peoples Bank is roughly in the range of Rs. 3.1 billion. Is that right? I do not know. So, on that particular basis, you have an impact of almost Rs. 44 billion there. So, you have got to ensure that you take the correct step. Have you got Risk Management Advisers? I do not think that you have still got them. We have been telling this before. Why have you not been listening to us? We asked you to get a Risk Manager for CPC and to buy in advance. These are the problems. I congratulate you for admitting that the hedging is a total flop. I support you for that. But, did you have the courage to tell that in the Cabinet? The Governor of the Central Bank, who thinks he knows it all came and showed in September 2006, how good it was. But, when the problem comes, he is the first one to bow out and put it on the Hon. Fowzie. He lost his job also because of Mr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal. Now, he does not speak of those. That is why you should have a Cabinet with the courage of conviction to speak even in front of the President and say, "I am sorry. We cannot go ahead with this". You tell the media. I appreciate that. But, at the end of the day, the problem goes on unabated.

So, Hon. Minister, all I want to know is, how are you going to rectify this negative reserve in the CPC? It came before COPE a week ago and I was horrified to find that there was a negative reserve in that. If it was in the private sector, it cannot trade because it is technically insolvent. Now, just because the Government is there, you get the support. But, there is something wrong because if, by chance, the monopoly in your hand is lost, it is due to inefficiency and corruption or there is something radically wrong. So, I do not want to waste much time because the answer is blowing in the wind. You know that. But, all I want to ask is, how you are going to overcome this problem? Remember, you have got to equate yourself, compare and contrast with LIOC which is making a huge profit with 226 people. Now, you will tell me that they do not sell diesel; they do not sell kerosene. Well and good! They are a commercial entity which is having all the problems. They have really got to pay taxes while you only have a left pocket to right pocket chain because it is the Government that collects

1361 1362

your taxes on one side and subsidizes on the other. So, this is why you have got to take a commercial decision, which is important. Now, only you are talking of the competitive element that should be there. Remember, five or six years ago when only one-third share was given, if you had brought in competition at that moment, today you would have been able to fight anybody who is there. That was why we wanted to have a commercial establishment going on without having subsidiaries at every corner. .

Now, it is told that within the next week or two, the second stage of oil exploration is going to be started. Is it done through a tender process? Are the Mannar Basin and Cauvery Basin coming through? How many slots are you giving? Are you selecting to appease India and China? Now, you are sending satellites with China to keep India under control. Likewise, are you giving one to Cairn in India and another to China?

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) Cairn is not an Indian Company. It is a British company.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes. They do the round and get back to India.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) They have their branches.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , .

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) We are going for tender process.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If you are going for a tender process, is it given on the basis how Krrish Group was given the land or on the basis how the Carlton Sports Club got a television channel? Is that the way? Because that was also done through a tender procedure. There was only one person to apply and it happened only within a week.

.. ( . . ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) There are big companies like Caltex Lubricants Lanka Limited and Exxon Mobil Corporation that have shown interest.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Well and good! I hope it is in the right direction. I look forward to seeing you do that. traffic jam . , ? Night races . [ ] , traffic jam . [ ] . traffic jam . races ? , , . [ ] , . . . , . ? ; go-karts . , . Go-karts cart . . . , . . , , . . . , -
