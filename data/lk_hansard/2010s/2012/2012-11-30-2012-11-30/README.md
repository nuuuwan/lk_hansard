Ltd. 7. Taprobane Securities Ltd. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) First of all, I am thankful to you. At last, after about eight or nine months we are getting an answer.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) We are answering all the Questions. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Yes, you are doing that. We appreciate that very much as the Opposition. My question is this. Why are you not disclosing information just because there is a case in the Supreme Court? Parliament is supreme, not the Supreme Court.- [Interruption.] The Hon. Speaker delivered a Ruling yesterday.

1841 1842

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I appreciate your concern, my good Friend, but the fact is that there are certain submissions being made. I believe, if I am not mistaken, the Hon. Leader of the Opposition himself has raised this issue and said that people had gone to the Supreme Court and -

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) No, no -

()

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Why not? He is present in the House. He can answer.- [Interruption.] He has said that it is difficult to raise these matters in Parliament. I do not know. That is what I was told.

o ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition)

Hon. Minister, I said, "if there is something sub judice". But in this instance, with regard to Question No. 2 (i) to (vii), if the Monetary Board can inform us with regard to the EPF issue what is sub judice and what is not, then the Hon. Speaker can decide. If it is not sub judice, you will have to answer. You will have to say which one of these questions is sub judice. Then the Hon. Speaker can decide on it. That is all, I would say.

() ( )

(The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) We can take that up as suggested by the Hon. Leader of the Opposition. You also made a good suggestion. We can take that up, when we take up the Votes on the Ministry of Finance. Thank you.

o ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Then, on the 8th of December, we will do so.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Yes.

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) We expect that you would give all the details on the 8th. Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, do you have any questions?

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Yes. I would like to ask the second Supplementary Question, Hon. Minister. It is regarding the EPF. The reason as to why we want to get this information is because we find that there is concert activity between the Central Bank and some people around it. If you look at the activities done before the Central Bank -

()

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) This is most unfair. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, would you be hearing my - ()

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) A Question has been asked and we have given the reply. The Supplementary Questions must flow from the answer you get.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, it flows. The reason why we want to know this transaction is because of the activities that take place at the Central Bank -

()

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) No, that is only an allegation. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, there is no point in asking Questions if you only want to satisfy your ego.

()

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Since he has raised this issue, I have a full statement and I request that it be appended to my reply.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Speaker, my Supplementary Question is fully reflective of the answer that the Hon. Minister has provided. Unlike the case that you have ensured as sub judice, the case of EPF before -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . () ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Now, we have finished.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, the question of sub judice stands only in the case of the National Savings Bank. There is no such issue here. So, when you want, you hide behind sub judice. But, yesterday, the Hon. Speaker said that Parliament is supreme. So, my Question -

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) Sir, how many times - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Listen to what I am saying. I am saying that there are higher authorities in the Central Bank who tell to buy shares and sell them before the Central Bank' s shares and they make -

( ) (Mr. Speaker) , .

()

( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) That is an irresponsible statement. So, we do not give answers.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) . ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) It is a very sensitive Question. - [Interruption.] But, my Question has to be answered.

() ( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama) I have answered the Question. - [Interruption.] What more?

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , "2013 , -2012.11.30 - 112 10 " .

Hon. Chairman, at the outset I would like to congratulate Palestine because yesterday there was a vote taken in the UN on a Resolution to raise the status of Palestine in the UN and the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly voted for the Resolution, except for a few countries like Israel and the United States.

Sir, during the last one year or so, our country had suffered several setbacks in the international arena. Though the Minister might say that everything is good, when you look back, for the first time in the history of our country, the United Nations appointed a UN Committee to go into certain aspects of the conflict. The Minister assured all of us and the whole country that the UN will never appoint a committee to inquire into certain aspects of the conflict. But, that was proved to be wrong when the Secretary-General appointed a Committee to go into the conflict and they gave a report which is now called the "Darusman Report". When that Report was out, the Government said, we are appointing another committee - the LLRC - to go into the aftermath of the war". But, even those recommendations have been incomplete. They have not been implemented by the Government and subsequent to that, there was a UN Resolution.

So, for the first time in the history of our country a UN Committee went into what happened during the last stages of the war; then there was a UN Resolution and now the Government is saying that everything is excellent. In 2008, when the Universal Periodic Review met, there were 100 recommendations against Sri Lanka - 100. In 2012, Sir, when they met last week, the strictures and recommendations had doubled. It had gone up to 220. So, how can the Foreign Ministry and the Government say that they have done their work, when in 2008 we had over 100 recommendations and two weeks ago when the Periodic Review met after 4 years, we had over 200 strictures and recommendations? So, how can you say that you have done well on behalf of the country? I hope the Minister will answer that.

During the last three years, there has been mistrust between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Western world. It is no secret. Everyone knows it. How did this mistrust begin? Soon after the war, there was a Resolution in the UN, tabled by us in May, 2009. There, the UN Human Rights Council voted in Sri Lankas favour.

Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka who was there at that time rendered a yeoman service and the Human Rights Council voted in favour of Sri Lanka. Why did they vote in favour of Sri Lanka? At that time Sri Lanka said, We will give a political solution based on the Thirteenth Amendment; we will inquire into serious violations of international law and we will resettle the combatants". We gave these assurances. It is there in black and white. But, as time went by, the world community realized that we were not sticking to our promises and that is why they appointed a UN Committee, which issued a report called, "Darusman Report". Then, you said, We will appoint another committee - the LLRC. That Report was out. Even there, you did not implement the important proposals,

This is what the President said in the Joint Statement between him and the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, on the 26th of May, 2009. Both of them issued a Joint Statement - the President and the Secretary-General. It states, I quote:

President Rajapaksa expressed his firm resolve to proceed with the implementation of the 13th Amendment, as well as to begin a broader dialogue with all parties-

Have you done that? During the war, you said, "Thirteen Plus". When we said, "Thirteen" you said, "Thirteen Plus". But, you have not honoured the commitment you gave. What happened? There was a Resolution against Sri Lanka in the Human Rights Council for the first time in the history of our country. I must tell you that we have been commended for resettlement. But, regarding key issues - rule of law, disappearances, media freedom and independence of national institutions - we are way behind and that is why we have fallen foul with the international community.

Now, there is another Resolution coming in March. Hon. Minister of External Affairs knows that there is a possibility of another Resolution in March. Now, how are you going to tackle it? Are you going to wait till the last day to canvass? I think last time, 15 countries voted for Sri Lanka. Can you be sure that those countries will vote for us? - [Interruption.] Yes, but Cuba is not there; Russia is not there and China is not there. So, you have lost three of them already. The Hon. Minister of External Affairs said, Things are good. What about Malaysia? Malaysia abstained from voting last time. Sir, very recently, on November 28th, there was a meeting in the Malaysian Parliament.

This is what that news report states: A Malaysian Parliamentary Caucus on the Abuse of Human Rights in Sri Lanka has been set up, announced Malaysian Minister in the Prime Ministers Department Datuk Seri Nazri Aziz. Nazri said members from both sides of the House agreed to the caucus as they viewed with great concern the alleged human rights violations happening at this very

1863 1864

2012 30

moment in Sri Lanka. - -

This news report further states: "The caucus will continue to monitor the progress of the United Nations Resolution.

A country like Malaysia has a large investment portfolio in Sri Lanka. Even they are monitoring whether we have fulfilled the recommendations of the Resolution on human rights. So, it is a very serious matter. You have already lost three countries. The way the things are going, Malaysia might vote against Sri Lanka next time. I was told even His Excellencys visit to Malaysia is in doubt. He is to go there next week or week after, but even that is in doubt.

() .. ( ) ( () .. - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris - Minister of External Affairs) No. The President decided not to go - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I do not blame him. I hope he will not go. - [Interruption.] Anyway, I do not want to comment on that. The fact of the matter is, now you are canvassing for the next session of the UN Resolution against Sri Lanka which has been scheduled for March, 2013.

Then, you have gone to Africa on a safari. We do not have any cultural links with Africa. We do not have any trade with Africa. You cannot make friends like that, Hon. Chairman.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Hon. Member, European countries deal with Africa.- [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) They have business. Africa is a new frontier. I agree. Even China is there. Europeans are there; Americans are there. There is a special programme everyday on CNN called African Voices. Everyone wants to go to Africa because Africa is a new frontier where very few people have gone to. Do we have business contacts with them? They are going for business. We are not going for business or trade.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Africas economy is much more developed - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) At the moment we do not have any business with Africa.- [Interruption.]

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) . . rose. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) You can reply later. Now, Sir, what I want to tell the Minister is, when you are conducting foreign policy, if you are on the right side morally and legally, then only the international community will back you. If you are on the wrong side, if you are violating international law, if you are violating human rights, no country will back you. This is what you have to realize. You violate the Constitution in the country openly, you use the two-thirds majority to trample everyone and you violate the international human rights law. So, how can you go round the world? You must do the right thing. I will tell you why. A country need not be big, Hon. Chairman.

Now, take the case of Cuba. There was an embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba. About six to seven months ago, there was a Resolution in the UN to lift the embargo. Only the United States and two other countries voted for the embargo. The entire UN General Assembly voted in favour of Cuba. How is that? Cuba is a small country like Sri Lanka. Why did they vote for Cuba? They defied the USA. Even Europe defied the USA. Only three countries voted against Cuba. How is that? That is because they are on the right side morally and legally. Is Sri Lanka on the right side? I want the Hon. Minister to answer that question. Are we on the right side?

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) I will answer that.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Then, take the case of Palestine. Yesterday, there was a UN General Assembly Resolution. Only three countries voted against the Resolution. Palestine is not even a State with observer status. But, everyone has accepted that there should be a Palestinian State because that is the correct thing. You must do the correct thing. You do the wrong thing and expect the whole world to support you. It will never succeed. Even at this late stage, only three months before March, I hope you will mend your ways.

1865 1866

Now, you are canvassing African countries. We have never heard some of those countries. Why are you doing this? You are constructing roads for them and give various inducements to them. You constructed a road in Maldive Islands. Then, I think you gave something to Uganda President and also to Swaziland. Is it a done thing to canvass these people like this? It is against the protocol to canvass. - [Interruption.] I do not like to use the word "bribery", but that is what is happening now. I do not like to use that word. Now, you gave Rs. 500 million to the Maldives. For what? To construct a road. Is it correct to construct roads there when there are so many villages here without roads? Then you gave some money to the President of Uganda. Is that correct? - [Interruption.] Anyway, you can go on your African safari. I have no objection. But, I assure you that it will not work.

Sir, how can you canvass Africa when you cannot canvass India? You cannot even canvass India. When the UN Resolution was looming large on the horizon, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe said India would support us one hundred per cent. Did it happen? So, if you cannot build a good relationship with India, how can you go beyond that? When the UNP was in power from 2001 to 2004, our leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe used to always tell us that for Sri Lanka what is important is Tami Nadu, not New Delhi. He told us to establish contacts with the South Indian States, which you have neglected. No powerful Minister has ever gone to the South to meet the Chief Minister of South India. -[Interruption.] I do not think so. Last time, New Delhi wanted to vote for us. You said Delhi wanted to vote with the Sri Lankan Government. But, there was pressure from South India and they voted against. In fact, very recently an Indian gentleman working in the Prime Ministers Office had stated, if India voted with Sri Lanka, the Indian Government would have collapsed because today in India, the States are more powerful not like the good old days. Earlier the Congress Party was popular all over India but it is not so today. The State parties are more powerful. So, New Delhi has to listen to the States. That is why I am telling you to establish links with South India, which you have neglected. You are neglecting India and going to Africa. [Interruption.]

Now, Sir, internationally, whether you like it or not, we are in the dock. There are disappearances, media suppression, serious violations of international law and I do not want to repeat this ad nauseum. Everyone knows about it and when all these things are piling up, you bring an impeachment against the Chief Justice. Then, there was the Welikada riots, which was a massacre. Then, on the 28th the students who were having a peaceful demonstration were assaulted in Jaffna, and a Tamil Member of Parliament was assaulted. Is it correct to assault those students? Whether you like it or not, in the South, a lot of people in the army died. In the North, also

due to the war, several families lost their loved ones. So, when they commemorate their deaths, there is nothing wrong with it.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) They are commemorating the deaths of Tigers.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) So, anyway, you do not know the difference between a Tiger and an ordinary Tamil person. [Interruption.] If the students of Jaffna commemorate the deaths of their loved ones, is there anything wrong in it? When I went for the May Day rally in Jaffna, I met a family that had lost six people. They spoke to me. So, there is nothing wrong in commemorating them. Is there anything wrong? - [Interruption.] Now, the fact of the matter is, you are in the dock internationally and then you have started this impeachment.

Yesterday, the Hon. Speaker gave a Ruling. So, because of that, the Members of the Select Committee need not appear in court. We respect that. We have to respect that as Members of Parliament. But, I want to ask you one thing: whether we go before court or not, if the Supreme Court makes an Order, if the Supreme Court gives an interpretation of the Constitution, are we bound to follow it?

, . . . , . ? , . . -

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) We are not bound by their - [Interruption.] Your Leader said - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, no. He did not say that. Do not take things out of context. You just sit and wait. .

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You cannot force the Hon. Minister to answer you. Sir, it is against the Standing Orders.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) No, I am not pressurizing him. But, several times, he had agreed to reply but did not. . .

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) This is not an inquisition. You have no right to get up there and demand an answer from me this very minute. Certainly not; I am not going to do it.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Sir, this is the Committee Stage, where - I do not know about this Parliament, I remember in the old Parliament - Members never made speeches; it was always an exchange of views.

( ) (The Chairman) . ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) The Committee Stage is not for speeches; it is to clarify various matters. So, I ask you because you are a learned Professor of Law. Kindly enlighten us. If the Supreme Court gives an interpretation of the Constitution with or without us going there - [Interruption.] All right. Okay.

( ) (The Chairman) . .

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Now, you all are hoping to host the Commonwealth Heads' of Government Meeting. Referring to the news release by Gabriela Knaul, on 20th November, 2012, under the caption "2013 Meeting: Many Commonwealth Governments will Reconsider Participation if the Chief Justice is Impeached and Removed", the "Colombo Telegraph" reported, I quote:

"The participation of Britain and several other countries at the 2013 Commonwealth Headin the balance with the Sri Lanka Government moving to s of Government Meeting to be held in Hambantota hangs impeach the Chief Justice, a move that has led to serious concerns by the international community, including the United Nations."

Now, you are trying to host the Commonwealth Heads' of Government Meeting. You are quite aware that we, in all these Commonwealth countries, are bound by the Latimer House Principles, under which the independence of the Judiciary is sacred. You drafted the 2000 Constitution. The impeachment is a process brought under Standing Order No. 78A, which is peculiar because the complainants are Members of Parliament, the prosecutors are Members of Parliament and the decision is also taken by the Members of Parliament, the same group, which I think is a bit obnoxious. It maybe there in the Constitution, but it is a bit obnoxious.

( ) (The Chairman) , ? [ ]

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Give me just five minutes.

Because this Standing Order was obnoxious, when you framed the 2000 Constitution, you suggested that senior Commonwealth Judges should be included in a panel. Did you not suggest that?

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Hon. Member, what our objective was - [Interruption.]

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) It is not a legal argument.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) After Mr. Neville Samarakoons impeachment, there was no reason to go into this; there was no occasion.

1869 1870

Now, because of the current situation, we all are discussing this. In the 2000 Constitution, you recommended that when a Chief Justice is impeached, when the Impeachment Motion is handed over to the Speaker, the Speaker should refer it to a panel of three judges consisting of a Judge from the Commonwealth and two Senior Judges of the Appeal Court. I think that is the way to do it and that is what our Leader has been saying always. Give her a fair trial.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) But, was that document not burnt in Parliament?

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) But, you proposed that.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Yes. Who burnt it? You burnt it.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Hon. Minister, you had said that when an Impeachment Motion is handed over to the Speaker, he has to give it to a panel of three judges. Why can you not do it even now? You did away with the Seventeenth Amendment in two weeks. Did you not do that? There was no consultation with the Opposition parties; there was no discussion. You did away with the Seventeenth Amendment in two weeks. Therefore, give her a fair trial. As our Leader suggested yesterday, give her a fair trial; give her a fair chance. In the eyes of the world, you will be held in high esteem if your proposal is adopted. Can you not do that, Hon. Minister, even now? So, it is up to you.

Finally, in concluding, I wish you all the best for the Ides of March! But, you are going to have a really tough time, I must say.

Thank you.

[10.31 a.m.]

(The Hon. Neomal Perera - Deputy Minister of External Affairs) Thank you, Hon. Chairman, for giving me the opportunity to open the Discussion for the Government on the Vote of the Ministry of External Affairs under

Head 112. First of all, I would like to quote what His Excellency the President stated in the "Mahinda Chintana - Vision for the Future".

I will continue Sri Lankas non-aligned foreign policy. During the last four years we witnessed the benefits of maintaining friendly relations with India, Japan, China, Pakistan and other Asian countries. I am committed to continue these friendly relations in the political, economic, defence, trade and cultural arena. I will ensure that Sri Lanka abides by the global treaties and agreements on environmental and climate change and will strengthen Sri Lankas ties with the UN Agencies. I will maintain the dignity of my country in foreign relations and will initiate a new programme to forge relations with countries.

I must also mention that yesterday was a historic day for Palestine. His Excellency the President, as a young Member of Parliament in 1970, spoke about Palestine in his Maiden Speech. I think his vision of that day, just like the vision he expresses in the "Mahinda Chintana", had been fulfilled yesterday. Sri Lanka co-sponsored and supported the Resolution on Palestine yesterday at the UN. So, I would like to mention, as the Deputy Minister of External Affairs, that the international community has recognized the efforts of the President after such a long time and has given Palestine a much better membership at the UN. She may not be a voting member at the UN, but she has been recognized. They have achieved a lot in that sphere.

I do not want to go into detail about what the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella said. He did not mention about the benefits the Ministry of External Affairs has gained, about the immense contribution it has made after the end of the war and the improvement in trade relations with all the countries.

He mentioned about South India. People-to-people contact has improved, trade has improved, and many trade agreements have been signed with India.

Sir, a large number of grants and loans have been given on a very concessionary basis to Sri Lanka by many countries such as, Japan, Korea, China, Hungary, Malaysia, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, India, Pakistan, Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Spain - even at the present state - the UK, the European Union and the USA. - [Interruption.] You can raise your questions during the Question time and I will reply them.

All the treaties that we have signed are for the benefit of the people. People have increased economic benefits and thereby the trade has improved. People's contacts have improved. Many people have come to Sri Lanka and vice versa. Hon. Chairman, I do not want to condemn what the Hon. Leader of the Opposition did while he was in power or his policies with India or the USA which brought his defeat and contributed to the defeat of the foreign policy as well.

I would like to mention about the Consular Affairs Division of our Ministry. It is the only section I think in this whole country which is open at 6.00 o'clock in the morning. It receives and accepts people and gives them a very good service so that they do not have to waste several days, like in the past. The office is open at 6.00 a.m. and starts functioning at 6.30 a.m. Also, there has been an increase in income. More than the increase in income, people have been satisfied and they have got authentication of documents under the Consular Functions Act. Up to now, we have got an income of Rs. 101 million. As far as the budgetary allocations are concerned, we have received and will be continuing to receive in the next few years, much more money to improve, establish and strengthen our diplomatic relations and increase our staff and improve their capacities. Compensation has been received by the Consular Affairs Division which were pending for a long time. Educational Section, Miscellaneous Section, Repatriation Section, and the Document Authentication Section in the Consular Division have done an excellent job. I must thank all the staff who have been motivated by our Minister, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris and the Secretary, Mr. Amunugama and other able secretaries of our Ministry.

I would like to mention about the African Division on which we have started a lot of contacts, improving relations. I do not think the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella knows about the number of countries in South Africa. He said that he has not even heard of certain countries that our Minister has visited. I am sorry to hear that because he had also been the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. These countries did not start to exist yesterday, they were there during his time as well.

As far as Seychelles is concerned, many Heads of States, foreign ministers, UN agencies have visited that country. Sir, many foreign visits have been undertaken by His Excellency the President, not for anything but to improve relations, for the benefit of the people. To improve trade relations, we will be soon signing a Preferential Trade Agreement with China where they will give preferential trade duties for us to benefit from their market.

Now, there is a huge parity between the exports and the imports from the two countries. But, as a result of many visits to China and many requests by the President and my Minister and my able staff from the Ministry, we intend to increase our trade from US Dollars 400 million to US Dollars 2 billion, by four times, within a course of two years. We have held many meetings, conferences showcasing Sri Lanka and its developments. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference was held this year in Sri Lanka. Out of the 54 countries, 53 countries participated. It was an excellent job done by the Speaker and the Hon. Members, our Protocol Division and our Ministry. When we go to these countries, we hear from the very mouths of those who have been criticizing

about Sri Lanka, after seeing - there is a saying that seeing is believing - that Sri Lanka has really changed. So, those people who visited Sri Lanka, who did not want to visit Sri Lanka, are speaking and as a result tourism has increased. People are coming here and they all are talking good of Sri Lanka.

Hon. Chairman, we have increased diplomatic relationships with many South African countries. According to the Mahinda Chintana, when His Excellency the President took office in 2005, we concentrated more on exports to African region when the purchasing power of that region was reducing. Why is the whole world looking at Africa? Because the price of natural resources went up during the last decade. It went up by 10 times or in some cases 30 - 40 times. The African Continent has 80 per cent of the platinum deposits, 55 per cent of chromites, 49 per cent of palladium, 45 per cent of vanadium and 55 per cent of gold and diamond in the world. So, it is no wonder that the whole world is looking at South Africa. Then, of course, petroleum and gas deposits are also seen in similar ranges. So, obviously when there is a possibility for entrepreneurs to make money, they look at such countries. As a result of our diplomatic relationships, many of our Sri Lankans are also working in such countries. I have met them when I visited there. They are working in water projects, hydro projects and agricultural projects. With the expertise they have, they are looking at other countries to invest as well. This was not the case sometime ago. We were looking for investors. Of course we are looking for investors. But, our investors, our entrepreneurs are looking at other countries to invest. So, we have been co-ordinating. We have improved relationship with such countries. We have signed many agreements for the benefit of the people with South Asia, the SAARC Region, African Region and with East Africa. Next year, there are many more visits planned by Heads of Governments and the CHOGM is another event you all will see.

I hope you all will coordinate and cooperate because it is going to be held in our country. The CHOGM will be held in November 2013 in Sri Lanka. It will be eventful. His Excellency the President has extended his full support and the Hon. Minister of External Affairs is expecting to take it to the highest level possible in the history of CHOGM to showcase this event not only to Sri Lanka but to the whole region. Many leaders have already confirmed their participation. Even a few Fortune 500 companies are expected to attend this event and to speak to the world from Sri Lanka as the hub of Asia or the Miracle of Asia looking at the benefits of it.

Hon. Chairman, this did not come overnight. Our Hon. Minister tirelessly worked, canvassing; His Excellency the President tirelessly worked and the staff of the Ministry of External Affairs tirelessly worked to bring CHOGM to Colombo. At every forum, whether it is

1873 1874

Non-Aligned, UN, Commonwealth or SAARC, we have been speaking of bringing economic benefits to the North and the South as well. There have been many UN multilateral affairs meetings that have taken place. As the Deputy Minister of External Affairs, I am very happy at the state of affairs and the follow-up actions that are being taken by the staff of the Ministry led by the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, Minister of External Affairs according to the wishes of the President and the "Mahinda Chintana".

Hon. Chairman, we have opened many diplomatic missions but we are short of staff. Diplomatic officers cannot be recruited overnight because they need experience. We have recruited many and also, we are on the verge of recruiting more to improve and strengthen our missions abroad because three years ago, we did not have enough staff. Our Missions were on a different track but today, it is on the track to develop the economy for the benefit of the people of our country, whether they belong to the Opposition or the Government.

I would like to mention here about the number of visits which have been made by foreign leaders. Sometimes, within a week, there have been two to three Heads of States visiting Colombo. Our Protocol Division as well as the other staff in our Ministry have been working 24 hours tirelessly and there has not been a single adverse incident to report. So, I thank them because with a few staff, they have done an excellent job.

I thank you very much Hon. Chairman, for giving me the opportunity to open the Discussion today but 15 minutes is not enough to speak on international affairs. Like the few who went abroad and commended and spoke as Sri Lankans, I wish that everybody will speak of the achievement we have made as Sri Lankans, when they go abroad in future without criticizing only the shortcomings. Thank you, Hon. Chairman.

[10.48 a.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am glad to be able to say a few words on the Votes of the Ministry of External Affairs. I do want to assure the Hon. Minister, who is a much beleaguered person, that what I do say I do not say in a spirit of confrontation, but I think it is our duty to bring to the notice of the Government various matters which we think are important. Sir, we are all concerned with Sri Lanka and its international relations as of now and we are all concerned with its present standing within the international community. I mean, there is so much of controversy pertaining to Sri Lanka and its international relations, largely flowing from the domestic situation in

this country which cannot be but a matter of very urgent and important concern to all the people who live in this country and who would like to see a more prosperous Sri Lanka, which is more respected by the international community and a Sri Lanka of which we all can be proud.

If I might say so, the most recent gaffe on the part of the Ministry of External Affairs has been the statement that they have issued recently in response to the Report of the Secretary-Generals Internal Review Panel on United Nations Action in Sri Lanka. What the Ministry of External Affairs had said is that the Report is regrettably unsubstantiated, erroneous and replete with bias.

Sir, this is a rather serious condemnation of what has been done by a Panel appointed by the United Nations Secretary-General and who have come up with a Report. Largely, they have done a self-criticism of their own activities in Sri Lanka when the UN was functional here particularly during the time that the war was in operation in 2009 and the years prior to that.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) That was one part of the Report but it went far beyond that.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Yes, I know that. I am going to refer to some parts of the Report. The Hon. Minister can respond to what I had to say when he speaks.

The position of Sri Lanka, Sir, was very much the same when there was a Report issued by the Panel of Experts appointed by the Secretary-General of the UN; that Report was issued in April, 2011. There was a Panel of three Experts appointed by the Secretary-General to advise him on accountability issues. One is inclined to pose the question, Sir, whether such summary rejection of reports prepared and submitted by competent and independent persons at the instance of the United Nations or the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the best interest of the country. Is such rejection made after a careful study by competent people of the findings in the said Reports or is such a response based upon an erroneously-structured policy framework of the Government suited to serve only its purposes and not in the interests of the country?

This is a question we have to ask. When you make such criticism about international efforts, particularly from the UN or from the Secretary-General, I think it has long term interests, long term impacts, as far as the country is concerned. In fact, I talked about the reports of the two UN Panels: one appointed by the Secretary-General in regard to accountability issues and the one

1875 1876

[ ]

2012 30

appointed also by the Secretary General in regard to the workings of the UN mechanism in Sri Lanka. We also have the Governments response to the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission Report, a Commission appointed by the Sri Lankan Government itself and comprising only Sri Lankan persons. Now, even with regard to that Report, which was submitted unanimously by a group of Sri Lankan persons appointed by the Government, the Government has spoken with different voices in regard to the contents of that Report. Different people from within the Government have spoken with different voices. There has been no unequivocal acceptance by the Government of that Report; there has been no unequivocal commitment on the part of the Government that it will implement that Report either. Why? You attack international reports, even your own Commission Report which had been prepared and made public by Sri Lankans appointed by you. You have spoken with different voices and there has been no commitment either that you accept the Report or that you will implement the Report. A great deal of uncertainty prevails in regard to the genuine implementation of the constructive recommendations contained in that Report. Some of those recommendations outlined in the Resolution were adopted by the UN Human Rights Council in March this year. This uncertainty, even in regard to the LLRC Report, falls within that erroneously-structured policy framework of the Government. What that erroneously-structured policy framework of the Government is, I will deal with shortly.

The Government seems to be obsessed with an attitude of indifference to the views of others, however responsible they may be, and even one observes the measure of impunity in regard to the possible consequences of such indifference. The attitude seems to be, "Who cares? You can say what you like. But, we will do what we like and the consequences do not matter". Such an attitude on the part of the Government, Sir, may serve its interests domestically for a period of time, but I do not think it can serve the interests of the country and certainly from an international point of view, it can be quite harmful to the long-term interests of the country. The Governments attitude seems to be, Well all these things will go away after some time. We do not have to bother about it now because after sometime it will just disappear". Well, knowledgeable people seem to be of the view that some of these things will not go away, that they will continue to haunt you for a long time to come.

Talking of the present situation, Sir, I am reminded of what happened to the GSP Plus concession sometime ago. We had three Ministers speaking on behalf of the Government. The former Minister of External Affairs, Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama was one of them. The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, who was the Minister in charge of Disaster Management and Human Rights, was the second one. The third one was the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, who was also concerned with external trade, one of

the subjects in his portfolio. We observed that they were speaking with different voices, like what is happening within the Government now, in regard to the LLRC Report. The Governments attitude, once again was one of indifference, one of impunity and an attitude of "Who cares. We could not care less with what decision the European Union takes in regard to GSP Plus". We know what happened. We lost that facility.

When this controversy was raging at that point of time, we decided that we should not add fuel to the fire because we were concerned about the employment prospects of perhaps hundreds of thousands of youth in this country. I did not utter one word that GSP Plus must be removed or that facility must be denied to the Sri Lankan Government. I did not speak in Parliament one word advocating such a position or outside Parliament because we were concerned with the employment prospects of several hundreds of thousands of youth in this country, though we knew that almost the entirety of that youth came from the majority community. But, the fact of the matter was that they were all Sri Lankans and it was no pleasure for us to see several hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans losing their jobs as a result of that facility being removed. The Government was concerned more with, I think, a false sense of prestige. Who cares about what these foreigners have to say? That was their approach.

As you know, the GSP Plus was removed and as a result of it being removed, today, I think some considerable difficulties are being experienced in regard to the export of garments to certain parts of the world and this matter is becoming a matter of grave concern to the exporters of garments. Since that facility is not available, prices of Sri Lankan garments have gone up and consequently we have to face very stiff competition. It is my view that the GSP Plus could have been preserved, could have been retained and we need not have lost it at that point of time, if we handled that whole issue more carefully with better judgment, so as to ensure that whatever action we took was not based upon a false sense of prestige but was done in the interests of the country. That was not done. I am afraid that your present attitude in regard to some vital issues seems to display a similar attitude, which can end in much harm to this country. What does the Report of the Secretary-Generals Internal Review Panel on United Nations Action in Sri Lanka state? As I said before, it is largely a self-criticism of their own functioning, particularly in the Vanni, during the course of war in 2009. But, it also refers to other matters, which I shall refer to shortly. All the UN officials were compelled to leave the Vanni in September 2008. It was not merely they but the INGOs were compelled to leave; the NGOs were compelled to leave. The media had no access to the Vanni. It was a war being fought without any witnesses. You wanted to get all the independent persons out of the Vanni.

1877 1878

I want to deal, Sir, with some aspects of the Report because I think that is important. I will read paragraph 1(4) of page 41 of the Report which gives us some idea of the state of the UN-Sri Lankan relationship during this particular period of time. It states, I quote:

The UN had a generally difficult relationship with the Government, which used its control of visas, as well as harsh and even defamatory articles in the domestic media, as a means to pressure and intimidate any staff perceived as critical of the State. Several Resident Coordinators (RCs) were declared persona non grata (PNG) and a number of senior staff were withdrawn by the UN before they suffered the same fate. Candidates proposed to replace them were apparently rejected because of past experience in conflict situations.

It goes on in that way. That is not a very good situation. You seem to have had a very bad relationship with the UN in terms of this Report. According to this Report, the Panel appointed to conduct investigations seemed to have taken the view that relations between the UN staff and the Sri Lankan Government were not cordial at all. That is not a thing that we can be happy about; that is something of grave concern to us, the people of this country.

The UN Report, Sir, also deals with the question of accountability and that is contained on pages 43 and 44 of this Report. I would like to read a part of that Report in regard to accountability. It states, I quote:

While calling for a human rights monitoring capacity, a second objective of UN strategy was to push for action on impunity for violations. This was given new urgency after the August 2006 execution of 17 staff of the NGO Action Contre la Faim (ACF) in Muttur. As in the past, the Government rejected calls for an international inquiry and instead established, in November 2006, its own Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate 16 incidents, including the ACF killings. In October 2006 an OHCHR internal report said 'There are several serious problems in the domestic legal system that will hamper the effectiveness of this CoI [including]. the lack of witness protection programs, and prohibition in the military law in utilizing the concept of command responsibility. it is difficult to see how this CoI could be effective in leading to prosecution'. The internal report of a second OHCHR mission to Sri Lanka, in February 2007, confirmed the steady deterioration in the human rights situation, and the limited impact that was to be expected of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry. In a compromise, the Government accepted that the commissions work be monitored for conformity with international standards by an International Independent Group of Eminent Persons (IIGEP), established in February 2007. One year later, on 6 March 2008, in a public statement on the Presidential Commissions work, the IIGEP said '[T]he proceedings of inquiry and investigation have fallen far short of the transparency and compliance with basic international norms and standards', and regretted flaws such as 'restrictions on the operation of the Commission. refusal of the State authorities at the highest level to fully cooperate with the investigations and inquiries. a climate of threat, direct and indirect, to the lives of anyone who might identify persons responsible for human rights violations.' [T]here has been and continues to be a lack of political and institutional will to investigate and inquire into the cases before the Commission.

This is what they say on the question of accountability. This is not a happy state for us to be in. This is in regard to the 17 aid workers in Mutur. Another matter being inquired at that point of time was the massacre of the five students in Trincomalee which took place in January, 2006. You made certain commitments at the last Human Rights Council Meeting in March, 2012 in regard to these investigations. You said that certain action would be taken in regard to these two particular matters: the 17 aid workers been killed in Mutur and the five students been killed in Trincomalee. What have you done? Has anything been done? Have you addressed the question of accountability in regard to those issues? These are not matters that will go away.

What is happening now on the question of accountability? The UN Human Rights Council Resolution in March, 2012 talks in terms of Governments responsibility, Governments obligation to conduct independent, transparent investigations on the question of accountability. What has happened? Have you done anything? Anything whatever? We know you appointed some military officials to conduct investigations into certain matters and their reports to be submitted to the Military Commander. All these investigations are in respect of service personnel. But, everything is being done within the same orbit; within the same area. You have not appointed any independent domestic mechanism which can be regarded as being impartial, trustworthy, credible and legitimate, to conduct any investigation on the question of accountability. What have you done to satisfy anyone that you are moving in regard to these matters with a commitment towards ascertaining the truth?

I want to also refer, Sir, to the Report of the Internal Review Committee on the question of food. It appears on Page 55, Paragraph 45 of the Report, which states, I quote:

The Government continued to insist that there were no more than 70,000 people in the Wanni. According to the most credible information available, the actual number was at least 360,000 (see Annex II). The UN believed there to be about 350,000, but did much of its assistance planning on the basis of a figure of 200,000 beneficiaries. Using WFP calculations of nutritional measurements per person, the total food needed for the period October to December alone was 10,350 metric tons for the beneficiary planning figure of 200,000, and 18,630 metric tons for the actual population of 360,000. Between 2 October 2008 and 15 December 2008 a combined 4,120 metric tons of food were dispatched to the Wanni by the UN, about 40% of the requirements for the planning figure and just under 20% of the requirements for the actual population numbers. The food sent to the Vanni during this period comprised of less than 20 per cent of the actual requirement by the number of people who were there at that point of time. How can you get away with this? Why did you put the figure at 70,000? According to our own figures, there was, in the Vannni at that time, a

1879 1880

[ . ]

2012 30

population of around 400,000. The UN says 350,000 or 360,000. Eventually, over 290,000 people came out of this area. How were you able to put the figure at 70,000 when eventually 290,000 people came out of the area? Did they fall from the sky? Did you underestimate the figure and keep it at 70,000 because you wanted to reduce the number of casualties? Did your underestimation of the figure at 70,000 have anything to do with the number of civilians eventually killed? These are the questions that have to be addressed, Sir; these are not questions that can go away.

The Panel of Experts appointed by the UN Secretary-General comprising of three persons said that tens of thousands of civilians had been killed, that up to about 40,000 people had been killed. Based upon the number of persons who eventually came out of the Vanni and the number of persons who were admittedly in the Vanni, the UN says the figure was 350,000 or 360,000 and other figures put it at 400,000. There is an estimation that well-nigh over 70,000 civilians were killed in the Vanni. So, the question is very legitimately posed: did the Government says that there were only 70,000 people in the Vanni because it wanted to obscure the actual number of casualties that happened in the Vanni as a result of the war being prosecuted in that particular way?

Then, Sir, I want to deal with the amount of medicine that was available in the Vanni at this point of time. It is referred to in this Report. I refer to page 75, paragraph 111 of the Report, which states, I quote:

111. On 16 March, the Regional Directors of Health Services of Mullaitivu and Killinochchi addressed an open letter to the Secretary of the Ministry of Health saying ' less than 5 percent of the combined quota of drugs and dressings that are meant for the last quarter of last year and for the first quarter of this year have been sent to us, so far. You are well aware of the fate of the remaining bulk - to be kept in Vavuniya awaiting security clearance from the Ministry of Defence, despite our repeated requests and reminders made to you Since January 2009, more than 500 civilian deaths, either on or after admission, have been registered at hospitals and thousands of civilian deaths could have gone unrecorded as they were not brought to the hospitals Most of the hospital deaths could have been prevented if basic infrastructure facilities and essential medicines were made available We have been supplied with no antibiotics, no anesthetics and not a single bottle of IV fluid '. A separate source described deaths related to the lack of medicines as being from war related injuries .." and other causes.

It goes on to state, I quote:

"The source referred to ships under ICRC flags that could have brought in medicines, but which experienced heavy shelling in their immediate vicinity, forcing them to withdraw. 'Badly wounded civilians on the beach, who needed urgent transport to a full medical facility in Trincomalee or Pulmoddai, would often die when the security forces attacked preventing the ships from being able to pick them up or causing the ships to leave early '

We know you were fighting a war. We know you were fighting an enemy who was a dangerous enemy. There is

no question about it. We do not mince our words in regard to that matter. But, did you show any concern whatever for the poor civilians who lived there in their hundreds of thousands? You not merely educed their numbers, but did you make any food available to them? Did you make medicine available to them? They lived under trees. Did you make shelter available to them? They were subjected to aerial bombardment; they were subjected to heavy artillery fire. This is your problem. You know what happened. Why did such things have to happen? I must say, Sir, that many of these matters that I have referred to have been referred to by us in Parliament as and when they occurred without any demur from the Government benches. What is the use of a bold denial saying, It is unsubstantiated; it is replete with bias? Nice faces! One does not have to look for faces when you have somebody like the Hon. (Prof.) Peiris as your Minister. It comes to him quite easily. But, what are the hard facts? Are you answering the hard facts? Sir, I might, at this point, briefly refer to the editorial written in The Hindu newspaper on 17th November, 2012 in regard to this Report that has been published by the Committee appointed by the United Nations Secretary-General. What does it say ? I quote:

In the report, Sri Lanka emerges none the purer, as it contains cogent evidence of how Colombo worked to stave off international scrutiny and brazenly hounded U.N. and aid agencies out of the conflict zone so that there were no witnesses to its undoubted excesses."

It further states:

"The government deliberately underestimated the population trapped in the Vanni region and issued patently false denials about targeting no-fire zones and hospitals. It carried on a campaign of intimidation and calumny against U.N. officials, detained its national staff and shelled convoys carrying essentials for the trapped population. That is what a respected newspaper like The Hindu had to say about the situation that prevailed in the Vanni. Sir, I think you need to do much more than merely engage in a bold denial of this position.

Now, I want to say a few words, Sir, in regard to the question of a political solution. I do no want to dwelve much about it; I have dealt with it at some length in the course of previous debates. But, I want to tell you this very frankly and with much candour; you cannot deny that you have been fibbing and fudging, I repeat those words, you have been fibbing and fudging on the question of a political solution. It is all part of the same mindset: concealment of the truth in regard to the violations of human rights, in regard to your excesses, in regard to what happened during the course of war to Tamil civilians, it is the same mindset that makes you fib and fudge in regard to a political solution. I want to however, Sir, - I dealt with this at some length in the past - refer to some aspects in regard to this matter because it is very important.

1881 1882

I want to refer to the National Report of the Government of Sri Lanka to the Human Rights Council for the Universal Periodic Review in 2008, presented by the Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe. I will read the second point of para E. 98. from page 21, what is the commitment you made? It states, I quote:

Full implementation of the 13th amendment to the Constitution

What you told the Universal Periodic Review in 2008, four years ago, was the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Have you implemented the Thirteenth Amendment? What is happening now?

Then, I want to read something else, Sir, appearing in para 87 on page 19 of the same report, when the Minister said, and I quote:

One important initial step in the implementation of police powers, under the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, was the recent induction of 175 persons of Tamil linguistic origin (including 50 women) into the police force in the Eastern Province.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, you have another three minutes to wind up.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) No, Sir. I have got more time from the UNP. They have given me 45 minutes, but actually they have increased it to 50 minutes.

( ) (The Chairman) You have already taken 44 minutes.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) I will stick to 50 minutes. The Hon. John Amaratunga agreed to that.

That is the position, Sir. They say that they are going to implement the Thirteenth Amendment fully, that is a national priority that will be done, and in fact they go further and say that they have commenced the implementation of the police powers. Is that happening? Can you answer me? Was the Minister being very economical with the truth or was the Minister being very uneconomical with the reverse of the truth when he said that this is a national priority four years ago and they are going to implement the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and it will happen. What does all this show?

I want to also refer at this point of time, it is important that I refer to it, to the statement made by the Indian Ambassador to the UN in Geneva at the last Universal Periodical Review that took place on the 1st November this year. The Ceylon Today of 3rd November, 2012 states, I quote:

We recall the commitments made by Sri Lanka on the implementation of the 13th Amendment and building on it to achieve a meaningful devolution package. We urge expeditious action to take forward the political process for early political settlement. the Ambassador said.

So, this is the position that India has stated at the Geneva Sessions of the Universal Periodic Review held in November this year. You talked of implementing the Thirteenth Amendment four years ago. You have now made a commitment to India not really to implement the Thirteenth Amendment, but to build upon the Thirteenth Amendment first to bring about a meaningful devolution, and there was a reference to it by the Indian Ambassador at the Universal Periodic Review held in Geneva in November this year. So, what is your position? Our position is made public. We are for a reasonable, acceptable, workable and durable political solution within a united, undivided Sri Lanka. We are committed to that position. What is your commitment? Are you prepared to put aside your selfish interests and are you prepared to work towards a political solution? Is there any indication on your part that you are prepared to do it? What does the International Crisis Group say in their Report which has been released just a short time ago? This is what the International Crisis Group says. The Report of the International Crisis Group dated 20th November, 2012, states, I quote:

The Sri Lankan Governments refusal to negotiate seriously with Tamil leaders or otherwise address legitimate Tamil and Muslim grievances is increasing ethnic tensions and damaging prospects for lasting peace. The administration, led by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party of Mahinda Rajapaksa, has refused to honour agreements with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), broken promises to world leaders and not implemented constitutional provisions for minimal devolution of power to Tamil-speaking areas of the north and east. Militarization and discriminatory economic development in Tamil and Muslim areas are breeding anger and increasing pressure on moderate Tamil leaders.

This is what the International Crisis Group says in regard to your performance. What is your answer? I said a while ago, Mr. Chairman, that the Sri Lankan Government has a particular policy framework within a given mindset, a policy framework that is not merely eschewed, it is fatally flawed, a policy framework that has its foundation, majoritarianism, the entrenchment of majoritarianism and the rejection of the much-honoured principle of unity in diversity. That is your problem. Your problem is that you are obsessed with the idea that any solution must be on the foundation of majoritarianism and that you will not accede to the much-honoured concept of unity in diversity, equality and justice in a country that is essentially pluralistic in character. You

1883 1884

have to make the choice. Until you do make the choice you will sink more and more into the mire until a point where you will be beyond redemption. That is what the future holds for you. There is no purpose in furiously opening missions all over the world. There is no purpose in giving money to other countries and trying to win them over. You will not succeed in winning them over. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella referred to some of these matters in the morning today. Do the right thing; address the question of accountability. Carry on proper investigations in regard to the five students killed in Trincomalee and the 17 aid workers killed in Mutur. Bring about a political solution. You do not have to fret so much. You do not have to sink into the mire more and more. You will be automatically redeemed. The choice is yours. We leave it in your hands. But, I want to assure you on the Floor of this House on behalf of myself and my Party and the Tamil people that if you will take the right steps, you will have our complete and unstinted support. Thank you, Sir.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) That is not correct.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) No, that is right. , .

Today, the Hon. R. Sampanthan was talking about different voices. With all respect to you, Sir, I started by saying that you are the most respected Member of Parliament in my book. But still, I want to remind you that when you say we are speaking in different voices, you must realize that when you point a finger at us, there are three fingers pointed at you. Why do I say that? You are telling us today that there are Members in this Government, parties in this Government, who are talking in different voices of the LLRC. But, as a Government we have stood together and said, We will implement and we are committed to implement the LLRC proposals. What about your side?

At the last Presidential Election, you who are supposed to be the champions of the Tamil-speaking people, supported the candidate who once said that Tamil-speaking people are second-class citizens in this country. Is that different voices or different strokes? He gave an interview to a Canadian magazine and said, "Tamil-speaking people are second-class citizens". The Tamil National Alliance at the last Presidential Election supported that candidate. So, for you, sometimes when you want to swim freestyle, you start swimming freestyle and then later on when you want, you go backstroke and then when you want, you would go breaststroke. What about the Opposition? Sometimes you all are together with various people in the Opposition on a common platform. You are together with the JVP on the same platform today. But, the JVP position on the Thirteenth

1887 1888

[ ]

2012 30

Amendment is different from yours. That does not mean that you agree with the JVP. So, when you are together in an alliance, a common front, you have different views. But, you work together. As a Government, we are committed to implement the LLRC proposals. When we appointed the LLRC Commission, you came to this House and said, We are not very sure about the credibility of the Commission. But, when the Report of the Commission came, everybody accepted it. As a Government, we are committed to implementing it. As individual parties, some parties who are in the Alliance have different views, in the same way that you have different views in your common Opposition.

There was an incident about three-weeks ago, where a TNA Member of Parliament, while speaking on the Floor of this House on the Budget Debate, happened to say that he does not agree with the views of another Member of the TNA itself. This happened about three weeks ago. Then, who is speaking in different voices? Those are not different voices but different strokes. Hon. Sampanthan, you must realize the fact that you are also playing ball with politics and the rights of the Tamil people when it is convenient to you.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) You are not -

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) You are accusing the Government of fudging away from a political solution. Well, you are the party who is doing it. Go before a mirror and say it because the Government has invited you. [Interruption.] I cannot give way. I listened to you, Hon. Sampanthan.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Can I please -

Hon. Chairman, let me now go into the subject of External Affairs, of which much was spoken today from the Government as well as the Opposition Benches. I think we have to take foreign relations in the context of the very rich and traditional history that Sri Lanka has had.

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Dilan Perera, what is the point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. Dilan Perera) , . . .

( ) (The Chairman) .

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) From thousands of years ago up to now, during periods of invasion, we had to fight for our territory. Then, we had to fight for our Independence. And, in the recent history, for the past 30 odd years, we have been fighting for our sovereignty. This is a fundamental issue that we have to recognize in the external affairs in Sri Lanka. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, this morning made a comment to say, "What is wrong in LTTE commemorating their "Mahavirs day"? What is "Mahavir"? A "Mahavir" is an LTTE cadre. A "Mahavir" is a terrorist, an LTTE cadre who was killed. He had the audacity to come to this House and ask, "What is wrong in commemorating terrorists?".

Therefore, Hon. Chairman, the external affairs of Sri Lanka in the recent history has been focused in terms of protecting our sovereignty. In the 30 years of war and in the aftermath of the war, certain powerful nations of this world have been basically pointing fingers at us and is on a witch-hunt, on a persecution of purported human rights violations that we have done. That is what we have had to defend. Generally, external affairs or bilateral relations

1917 1918

with countries consist of trade, investment, culture, tourism, commerce and people-to-people contact. But, in todays context, it has been clearly confined to by certain nations to the aspect of human rights and the purported violations of human rights. The majority of our energy is driven towards keeping these people off us, in protecting our sovereignty.

The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella spoke about engagement. Yes, we have been engaging on a daily basis but that does not mean that we have to circumscribe ourselves to the position that our enemy wants us to; that does not mean that the diaspora can dictate terms to us and that does not mean that we have to give away our sovereign right as a free nation to conduct our own affairs. That is a fundamental difference that one has to see in terms of propagating our foreign policy abroad.

Now, let us for a while look at the purported human rights violations that are being spoken about. During the 30 years of war, we have seen hundreds of thousands of people dying: our fathers, our mothers, our brothers, our sisters, our children. There is not a single person in this country who has not lost somebody, even a close relative or a distant relative, due to the war. There should be an equal mechanism if they talk about human rights violations.

We have very amply and ably demonstrated the fact that the quantum that is unaccounted for is about 4,600 odd people. What does the TNA say? What does the Tamil diaspora say? They say, hundreds of thousands. Is this not equal to all? When we talk about purported human rights violations, there must be an equal standing. Last year, in end October, the Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe presented in Geneva the National Action Plan on Human Rights, with the pledges that we have undertaken, which were suggestions given by member nations and along with that, the LLRC Action Plan - the matrix that we have done in terms of implementation. Now, to strengthen all this, in this Budget, I believe an amount in excess of Rs. 700 million has been allocated for the purpose of implementation of those LLRC proposals. Therefore, as you can see, our Government has been taking a very steady path to progress in these matters. It is not a question of whether we are not conducive to such an approach, but we have in fact taken such an approach and we are progressing steadily. Thirty years of war and the aftermath of that cannot be rectified in just one or two years. That is why we have asked for the time and space to enable us to conduct these affairs. More than 28 independent agencies are involved in the implementation of the LLRC process and with adequate funding coming to that through this Budget, I am sure that the implementation process will take place in time to come.

Let us talk about the reconciliation process. That is another vital area, I believe, that the TNA always keeps harping on. The Hon. Sampanthan said today that we, during the war, have deprived the Northern polity of the basic food requirements and medicine requirements. I am saddened by the fact that not a single TNA Member is in this House as I speak, as they usually do, because they do not want to face the truth.

( ) (An Hon. Member) They are in the restaurant. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Yes, they are always there. In fact, it was Neil Buhne, who was the then Resident Representative of the UN, who made a very categorical statement, which I table*, to say that adequate food stocks were, in fact, given to the people of the North.

In fact it was the LTTE that was disrupting such convoys. Making that clear, Sir, if we take time off just to see the development that is taking place in the North, our consistent policy has been that we will do reconciliation at a pace, whilst ensuring that economic empowerment is given to the people of the North. What good is reconciliation without economic empowerment? The Hon. Sampanthan referred to the fact that people were under trees. But, is it because of us? No. We are the people who are giving them shelter today - the Government. It was because of the LTTE that their basic essence of livelihood, the basic essence of life was deprived to these people. That is what we are rectifying today and perhaps that is what the TNA does not want to happen for electoral gain that they always connive for.

Therefore, Hon. Chairman, if one goes to the North, one sees for oneself what is actually happening there. Look at the quantum of funds that have been channelled to the North, for every sphere: education, health and infrastructure. Now, the Northern economy is growing at a rate of 27 per cent but yet, the TNA comes to this august Assembly and says there is nothing happening. Today, people are given houses; they are given a livelihood; they are given water; they are given highways and economic activity. Sometimes, when I go to my electorate my people ask me, Why can you not give us also at least a portion of that? We are also deprived of these things. But, then we take the time to inform them the necessity to develop those areas, because for 30 to 40 to 50 years, they have been neglected. That is exactly why the TNA today does not talk anything about

1919 1920

[ ]

2012 30

development in this House. They only talk about political power, political power and political power. That is for their own survival.

It was only yesterday that I heard that the TNA Members of Parliament have been on a trip to Europe. In that trip to Europe, they have had many seminars, workshops with the diaspora and also, I have heard that Eric Solheim, the international mercenary, has been organizing all these seminars against Sri Lanka for the TNA. Now, just look at the pathetic situation, Sir. Here are MPs represented in this House, who have vowed to uphold our Constitution, trotting around Europe, at events organized by mercenaries to disintegrate this country. Now, this is the factuality.

Therefore, the point I am trying to make is todays job of defending Sri Lanka, todays job of propagating proper foreign policy, is not an easy task. Whether it be you in Government, whether it be us in Government, there is one principle at stake here - our sovereignty and also the aspect of whether we are willing to allow third parties and diaspora who has not even stepped into this country to come and then prosecute and hang our armed forces. Is that what is expected of us, or is that what we have to defend? If there are wrongs that have been done, such wrongs will be found and punishments will be given. We have a law in this country.

Now, take for example, the Darusman Report. In the Darusman Report, they go on to say that so many atrocities have happened. But, then they also say that the names or the witnesses from whom they got these details will be locked away for 25 years, and then they expect us to prosecute these offenders. Now, is that something that we can do? There is a legal system in this country. The law of evidence applies.

Now, it is in that context that we face a huge challenge in terms of our foreign policy. But, nevertheless, we have not side tracked, we have not lost focus from the larger picture of having excellent relationships with other countries. We have, in fact, gone forward, we have forged new alliances, we have equal relationships with countries in Asia, in Europe, the US, the Middle-East, in Africa, in Eastern Europe, and also the Latin American countries. So much so that we have had continuous interactions, engagements and, I must say, quite a lot of support from all these nations. But, of course, todays foreign policy and foreign dictates are decided by two or three very powerful nations. The European Union gets together as one; thirty odd countries getting together as one and with a single voice, then stands the United States of America.

Therefore, it is an arduous task. Whilst maintaining our bilateral relationships, whilst maintaining the sovereignty of our country and whilst propagating investments, trade, tourism, we have to forge ahead. So,

the future of Sri Lankas foreign relations is looking good now. It is looking good for the simple reason that we have also been able to concentrate on developing economic activities, forging ahead with new tourism potentials. At the same time, the aspect of human rights and the aspect of the persecution of Sri Lanka is something that we will defend to the last minute. That, we will not compromise. I am sure the Hon. Sajith Premadasa will agree with me when I say that there is no compromise one can do when it comes to defending your nation.

I am happy that the Hon. Suresh Premachandran has come back to the House because I made some references to the TNA. Hon. Member, I would like to make a personal request from the TNA. I know you are a tough person who believes in the path that you have taken. The TNA must come to self-realization. The Government may have faults. We are not 100 per cent perfect. But, the Governments initiative in terms of developing the North today, in terms of giving the people an economic empowerment must be one factor that is recognized by the TNA. If you do not recognize that, the TNA cannot get up and say, There is absolutely nothing happening. It is true that more the economic empowerment that comes, the more the development of the infrastructure, and more the progress that takes place there. Perhaps, the TNA will dwindle in numbers in time to come. That is the political reality that all of us have to face one day.

... ( ... )

(The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sure. ( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Therefore, the TNA must take a practical and pragmatic view in terms of engaging with the Government in resolving this issue. Why I am saying this, Hon. Member, is because the Hon. R. Sampanthan, for whom I have great respect, spoke at length in the House today. The Parliamentary Select Committee is there. Everybody speaks about the Thirteenth Amendment now; whether the Thirteenth Amendment is needed, whether it is going to be rescinded. All these things can be discussed: whether you need more power with the people or whether you need more power to the TNA. We have a forum. That is, the Parliamentary Select Committee which a time-bound, time- defined process.

Now, of course, I think the TNA has got a new role in terms of the Hon. Sumanthiran becoming a regular, daily member of the Supreme Court. That is fine. That is his business. But, in terms of the sovereignty of Parliament, I think I must touch on that subject as well because it was spoken about at length. The JVP today is talking about -

1921 1922

the way the Hon. Vijitha Herath spoke, basically tantamounts to the fact that Parliament is a non-existent entity. It is true that there is a very clear distinction between the separation of powers in the Constitution, between the Legislature, the Judiciary and the Executive. But, the sovereignty of this House, the sovereignty that we protect, the franchise of the people that we enjoy in this House is something that cannot be compromised.

I was amazed two weeks ago by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella and the Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe, who actually ridiculed the President of Uganda and the King of Swaziland who visited Sri Lanka. Why are you doing that? Even today in the House, the policy of Sri Lanka's approach towards forging relationships with the African nations was ridiculed. Why is this? What is wrong with the African nations? Should we not forge alliances with them? If we can forge alliances with, China, the USA, the UK, Kazakhstan and Singapore, why not Africa, why not Uganda?

So, I take this opportunity, Hon. Chairman, to apologize to those respective Heads of States on behalf of the Opposition for ridiculing such Heads of States who have come to our country.

Lastly, I would like to conclude my speech by quoting a statement about relationship between Middle East and Africa vis--vis the United Kingdom made by Sir Winston Churchill as far back as 1921. I quote:

In the Middle East you have arid countries. In East Africa you have dripping countries. There is the greatest difficulty to get anything to grow in the one place, and the greatest difficulty to prevent things smothering and choking you by their hurried growth in the other. In the African colonies you have a docile, tractable population, who only require to be well and wisely treated to develop great economic capacity and utility;

Hon. Chairman, this statement was made in 1921. Sir Winston Churchill had the foresight to recognize the importance of Africa. I am saddened by the fact that the Hon. Members of the Opposition ridiculed these countries. Let me conclude by saying that it only shows one thing, and that is, how insolvent those personalities are today.

Thank you.

[2.07 p.m.] ( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana) Hon. Chairman, as we are discussing today the budgetary allocations for the Ministry of External Affairs, I would like to take this opportunity to speak a few words on the state of our countrys foreign service.

Sir, when it comes to international relations and diplomacy, Sri Lanka has had a rich history that we, as Sri Lankans, can be proud of. Actually, the first recorded act of international diplomacy can be traced back to the third century BC, during the reign of King Devanampiya Tissa, when he sent a high-profile delegation to India, including his Prime Minister to establish friendly relations with Emperor Ashoka. In turn, Emperor Ashoka despatched his son and daughter, the Arahat Mahinda Thero and the Arahat Sanghamitta Theri to spread the word of the Buddha in Sri Lanka. This first act of diplomacy between Tissa and Ashoka changed the course of history and created an identity amongst the people of this land. To this day, Sri Lanka stands as a bastion of Theravada Buddhism in the world.

Centuries later, the post-Independence Sri Lanka produced some exemplary and world-class diplomats and foreign Ministers such as the Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, who by their commitment and hard work brought pride to our country, established respectability and firm relations with other nations. But, what has become of our foreign service now?

Hon. Chairman, Sri Lanka has faced many challenges in the last 20 years. Thanks to the leadership of the President, and especially due to the brave men and women of our armed forces, Sri Lanka won the war against terrorism. However, since the end of the war, President Rajapaksa and his Governments handling of foreign relations and formulating foreign policy has been nothing short of a tragedy.

Sir, Sri Lanka did not win the war alone. We had help from many other countries that gave us the necessary military hardware needed to fight the LTTE. Some gave us the necessary technological assistance by providing satellite imagery of exact locations where the LTTE ammunition dumps were held, both on land as well as sea and, of course, the necessary political encouragement to end the war. But, since the end of the war, relations between Sri Lanka and some of these nations have somewhat become strained, largely due to the stubbornness of the President and the incompetence of the Ministry of External Affairs.

Hon. Chairman, it is no secret that post-war Sri Lanka now faces many challenges, especially regarding its human rights record and the implementation of the LLRC recommendations. The fact of the matter is, Sri Lanka has lost its respect among the international community. Incidents such as the Welikada Prison massacre and the Impeachment of the Chief Justice are not going to win us any hearts and minds or sympathy from countries that will participate in the upcoming United Nations Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva next year.

1923 1924

While I stress the fact that Sri Lanka should not, in any way, compromise its national pride and bow down to international pressure, I must also say that the Government should, however, strengthen its diplomatic channels and compromise on certain issues, especially on issues regarding human rights and the LLRC recommendations.

Diplomacy is the key to facing many of these challenges, especially at the upcoming UNHRC meeting. Sri Lanka will not have China, Russia or Cuba to depend on as they will not be sitting as Members of the UNHRC with voting rights next year.

Unfortunately, without strengthening its existing diplomatic ties, the Ministry of External Affairs has adopted an African-centric diplomacy in order to win friends, while undermining the strategic relationships built over decades with Commonwealth nations and countries that have contributed significantly either by aid, trade or tourism. Countries that were seen as allies and friends a few months ago are now changing their attitude towards Sri Lanka. For example, it is learnt that the Malaysian Government, which abstained from voting during the US Resolution against Sri Lanka at the UNHRC last March, has now appointed a Parliamentary caucus to investigate the human rights violations in Sri Lanka. It is also said that the invitation extended to His Excellency the President to attend the World Islamic Forum in Malaysia next month appears to have been withdrawn.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) That is not correct. ( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana) That is what I heard, Hon. Minister. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Chairman) Yes, Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris. () . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Hon. Chairman, I want to correct that for the record. It is absolutely incorrect to say that the invitation that was extended to His Excellency the President was withdrawn by the Government of Malaysia. That is totally incorrect.

( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana) Thank you for clarifying that, Hon. Minister. Hon. Chairman, the deterioration of our Foreign Service is due to the Government not having a clear foreign policy and also because of the number of unqualified political appointees to key diplomatic missions.

Who is actually leading our foreign policy? Who is leading the Ministry of External Affairs? There are newspaper reports that there is a rift between the Hon. Minister and my Friend, the Hon. Member for monitoring the Ministry of External Affairs. - [Interruption.] I am just quoting newspaper articles. - [Interruption.] You can respond during your time, Hon. Minister.

() . . ( () .. )

(The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) I want to tell my Friend - he is young; he is starting his life - that it would be a great mistake to accept, as gospel truth, everything that you read in newspapers.

( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana) Hon. Chairman, while many countries have one spokesperson on foreign policy, we have different spokespersons speaking on different foreign policy issues, who, at times, contradict each other with their statements. With all these confusions, how is one to understand what direction our foreign policy is taking? While we have a learned Minister of External Affairs, - I think he might correct me if I am wrong - again what we hear is that he is not entitled to deal with certain countries and that other Ministers, civil servants and even the Presidential Secretariat are given the task of doing so.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) Actually, you must take responsibility for something that you state in this House. What are the countries that the Ministry of External Affairs cannot deal with? You must tell us.

( ) (The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana) You can respond during your speech, Hon. Minister, because I only have a few more minutes to speak.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris)

But, all of this is completely wrong.

1925 1926

( )

(The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana) Okay.

Sir, the subject of political appointees in the Foreign Service has been a regular topic of debate over the years. While every Government, throughout the years, has been guilty of this act, this particular Government has taken the art of bringing in political appointees to the Service to new heights. The haphazard appointments of friends and family as Heads of Missions undermine the value of the Foreign Service staff and also lower their morale.

There is a certain structure that has been placed in the Foreign Service, a set of six stages a career diplomat has to go through before becoming an ambassador. First, a diplomat will be appointed as a Third Secretary of a Mission, then as Second Secretary and after completion of 10 years in service, he or she will be appointed as First Secretary. Later on, he will be appointed as Counsellor, Minister Counsellor, Minister and after years and years of experience in service, he will be appointed as an Ambassador. But, because of the haphazard appointments, career diplomats who have sat for the exam and accumulated years of experience in service are sidelined for incompetent and unqualified political appointees who are, in many cases, friends and family of the higher-ups in the Government. There is also the fact that many former military heads too have been appointed to these Missions. Even during the UNP Government, political appointments did take place, particularly during President J.R. Jayewardene's Government. I am in no way denying that. Even during our Leaders time, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghes tenure as Prime Minister, he appointed my Colleague, the Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake, as Head of the Malaysian Mission. Though she is not a career diplomat, she turned out to be one of the best Ambassadors and did our country proud.

But, there is nothing wrong in political appointments as long as the person who is appointed is professional and has a clear understanding of what his or her duties are. Once they are appointed as Ambassadors, they will be representing this country. Actually the reputation of this country is on the line. At the very least, I think the person who is appointed should have a good command of the English Language, if not, the language of the host country and have some basic skill in the art of diplomacy. There are reports that some Heads of Missions are busy attending to their personal businesses, rather than finding diplomatic solutions to the challenges in front of them. There are reports that some Heads have asked commissions from multinational companies which have inquired about investing in Sri Lanka.

Sir, in my view, the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar was perhaps one of the most outstanding Foreign Ministers that Sri Lanka was fortunate enough to have. If

he was still alive, this country would not be entangled in the diplomatic mess that it finds itself in at this very moment. During his time, the Hon. Kadirgamar, if I am not mistaken, made it a policy that 60 per cent of appointments to Missions should be made through the diplomatic cadre, while the rest or the 40 per cent consisted of political appointees, and he made sure that the political appointees underwent some kind of training in diplomacy before taking charge of their Missions. I strongly recommend that this Government adopt that policy when appointing Heads of Missions in the future.

Sir, there are also questions arising on the methods used by the Ministry when recalling Heads of Missions. From what I have learnt, countries which usually recall their Heads of Missions do so only when there ensues a high degree of hostility between the two countries. So far, this Government has recalled four Heads of Missions. Simply put, these are Heads representing our country in foreign lands and when they are abruptly recalled, it reflects badly on the Foreign Service.

Sir, since we are speaking on the budgetary allocations for the Ministry, I would like to ask why we are spending so much of money on opening up Missions in Africa, as my Friend, the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, said. I do not have any problems with South Africa. I have no problems with African countries. But, why are we spending millions of rupees in acquiring or renting properties in these countries when most of these countries have missions in India? Can we not actually work through them or can we not ask these countries to come and have Missions in Sri Lanka? Why do we have to go there again?

() . . ( () .. )

(The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) That, again, is completely wrong. We are not opening Resident Missions all over. There is a difference between strengthening diplomatic relations and opening diplomatic missions. The two things are different, they are not the same.

( )

(The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana) Hon. Minister, what I am saying is, it is very well if you are not spending millions in renting or buying properties there. But, the fact is, a country like Singapore which is so advanced and has so many resources, has less than 50 overseas missions. - [Interruption.] Exactly. But, Sir, it is not a secret that the Government already finds it difficult to maintain some of the current missions abroad. So, if you are putting up more missions in other countries, they will need more money. It is no secret that some members who are in these missions have not even got money to pay rent for their premises and have been

1927 1928

2012 30

told to evacuate. In a situation like this, why are we still going and opening up new missions in other countries? Even if the Government is going to buy or rent out properties abroad, should it not be first brought into Parliament and scrutinized before doing so? - [Interruption.] But, it should be done because there are actually problems.

I think my learned Friend, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris will be speaking about the Central Bank buying property in the United States and renting it out to the Ministry of External Affairs.

Actually, what I really want to know about is the moving of the Mission offices in Washington to a new location. I have learnt that the Government is planning to buy a mansion in Washington, the address being 3052 Whitehaven Street Northwest, Washington DC 20008. The listed price for this mansion, Sir, is US Dollars 7 million which, I believe, was to be paid in cash by the Bank of Ceylon. While the country is now having financial problems with loans piling up and having to start repaying the loans by next year, should we be spending so much money on relocating our offices in the United States? What is wrong with the current premises where this chancery is located?

There is also an issue about the American real estate agent who is involved in selling this property. DC Real Estate is a company that is working as the real estate agency for the embassy. The agent involved is a person called Mr. Jack Shoptaw who was the former head of the company called Hammer Communications LLC. This company was declared bankrupt and Mr. Shoptaw and his company were sued in federal court for non-payment of loans. His creditors have sued him for nearly US Dollars 5 million and have also evicted him from office premises for non-payment of rent. How can the Embassy trust such a person with such a bad track record and use him as an agent to spend US Dollars 7 million? I hope the Hon. Minister will answer that question.

Thank you, Sir.

In this context, our emphasis has been to persuade the Sri Lankan Government to move towards a new system of institutional reforms, including a devolution package, building upon the 13th Amendment. The Joint Press Statement issued on May 17 after Sri Lankan External Affairs Ministers visit to Delhi stated this position. , o . , 2012 17 .. , . . It states, I quote:

The Government of Sri Lanka has on many occasions conveyed to us its commitment to move towards a political settlement based on the full implementation of the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution, and building on it, so as to achieve meaningful devolution of powers. We look forward to an expeditious and constructive approach to the dialogue process. We believe that continuation of the dialogue between the Government and the TNA would pave the way for political settlement, including under the rubric of the Parliamentary Select Committee. I discussed this matter with His Excellency the President this morning. The President assured me that he stands by his commitment to pursuing the 13th Amendment plus approach.

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Mr. Deputy Chairman, I stand up in this House today to salute the Speaker, Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa, for delivering a historic Ruling in Parliament yesterday, upholding the supremacy of Parliament and thereby safeguarding the honour and dignity of all Members of Parliament. That Ruling will go down in history as one of the most remarkable Rulings ever given by an Hon. Speaker. We are very happy that he is holding the

1941 1942

Chairmanship of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, Members of which came to Sri Lanka recently to participate in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference held in Colombo. The Ruling given by the Hon. Speaker will be a landmark Ruling for all the Commonwealth nations to follow in the future.

Sir, we are also proud to announce in this House the historic role played by Mr. Rohitha Rajapaksa, enabling Sri Lanka to enter the Space Age. - [Interruption.] . . . Mr. Rohitha Rajapaksa, entering into the field of communication technology, launched the SupremeSAT-I satellite from Xichang Launch Centre in China with the partnership of the China Great Wall Industry Corporation. - [Interruption.]

Mr. Rohitha Rajapaksa has, by his heroic deed, brought glory to the Rajapaksa family. - [Interruption.] It is so encouraging to see the three sons of a great leader in Asia perform gigantic tasks in various fields - politics, sports and now, aerospace engineering - bringing glory not only to the Rajapaksa family, but also to the entire nation.

-

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] , -

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] ! Sir, we are very happy because there is a fine article published in today's "Daily Mirror" written by that versatile and senior journalist, Ameen Izzadeen, under the caption "After 65 years, some justice at last for Palestinians". -[Interruption.]

; . , ? .

Sir, I would now pay my attention to one of the most historic and illuminative speeches made by one Miko Peled - [Interruption.] Yes, he may tag himself with the name "Rajapaksa", if he knows what a great name it is. There is a road named only after Mahinda Rajapaksa in Ramallah, in Palestine. Miko Peled spoke of the contents of his book, The Generals Son.

We have formed a special Foreign Affairs Forum with Alhaj M.H.M. Fazal as Chairman, Mr. F.A Yaseen; former Minister, Hon. M.S.S. Ameer Ali and former Mayor of Colombo, Mr. Omar Kamil, and Mr. Sameer Effendi as Adviser. They met and discussed the Palestinian issue. Last night in our Forum office, we discussed the views of the Palestinian Miko Peled who has referred to the double standards of the US in respect of Israeli and Palestinian people. He referred to the speech of Mr. Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel, in the United Nations this year in regard to the rights of the Jews to return to their ancient homeland. He talked of those Jews who had lived there 1,000 - 2,000 years ago and about the return to their homeland, while the Palestinians who were forcefully kicked out of their homes in 1947, just 65 years ago, are not allowed to return to their homes.

The article of Mr. Ameen Izzadeen in the Daily Mirror of 30th November, 2012 throws light on the whole Palestinian issue. It is a valuable and educative article. We are very happy today that after the consistent policy followed by the backbencher Mahinda Rajapaksa up to being President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the European Community and other countries have accepted that there should be an independent Palestine.

He talks of the Jews then. "If this is not double standard then, what is double standard?", Miko Peled has asked.

Now, the Prime Minister is talking about digging up the town closer to Jerusalem adjoining the Wailing Wall in search of archaeological evidence in regard to King Davids era which was about 3,000 years ago uprooting the Palestinians numbering over 50,000 living in this area. On 29th of November 1947, exactly 65 years ago, the United Nations carved out a state called Israel which had a population of less than 500,000 while the Palestinian population was over one and a half million. They robbed the land and the birthright of the Palestinians. This is why we are opposed to the Zionist moves. The United Nations gave a larger portion of the land to the smaller community - the Jews - while the larger community namely, Palestinians, were handed out a smaller portion. Within a few months the Zionist forces

1943 1944

[ ... ]

2012 30

began the ethnic cleansing, like what the Zionist Tigers in Jaffna did 20 years ago to the Muslims of that area. Between 1947 and 1948, Zionist forces destroyed over 500 towns and villages - our blood is boiling even now - including its schools and mosques. At that time, the Israelis had well-trained army personnel of over 40,000 while the Palestinians had none.

I have read the book Exodus written by the famous author Leon Uris. He gives all the details about the atrocities committed by the army called "Haganah" against the Palestinians. At that time, Haji Amin Al-Hussein was the Grand Mufti of Palestine. I have met him in Beirut and the Secretary-General of the World Muslim Congress, Dr. Inamullah Khan with Alhaj M.A. Abdul Hassen, President of the Kal-Eliya Muslim Ladies Arabic College in 1970. Dr. Inamullah Khan had written copiously about this struggle and the plight of the Palestinians.

The mother of Miko Peled who still lives in Jerusalem is now 86 years old. Listen to her pathetic story. She had stated that prior to 1947, she had lived alongside the Palestinians in harmony and without any fear. In 1948, after the Palestinians were chased away, the Israelis were offered the homes occupied by the Palestinians. But, his mother had refused to accept it. Zuraika Omar Kamil, who went recently to Jerusalem with Omar Kamil, Mohamed Rafi and others tell me that this old mother speaks of a sense of shame even today. Miko Peled's father, General Matti Peled, after leaving the army, became a Champion of the Palestinian rights.

In 1967, after the six-day war, 25 years after the holocaust, Israel began their biggest ethnic cleansing to de-Arabise the country chasing away the Palestinians. In 1993, Israel began to falsely negotiate with late Yasser Arafat giving a picture that they were negotiating peace while ensuring that the occupation of West Sahara and East Jerusalem was irreversible.

On September 4th, 1997, Miko Peleds niece, his sisters daughter, Smarder Elahem, only 13 years old, was killed by two suicide bombers. At the funeral, being a grand daughter of an Israeli General, there were mourners. Among them were media men who had asked Miko's sister whether she would want revenge and retaliation for which she has said that she, as a mother, knows the suffering of losing her own daughter and therefore, be it a Jewish, a Christian or a Muslim, she does not want any suffering to any mother of this sort. She would not think of any revenge or retaliation, but feel sympathetic towards the two suicide bombers who had taken their lives because of the despair brought on them by the provocations of the Israelis depriving them of their land, water, home et cetera. I think we have to send the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena to supply ample water to the suffering Palestinian people. That decision also we may, perhaps, take soon.

Then, she had further said that her own Government, at that time too Mr. Netanyahu was the Prime Minister, is to be blamed for such brutal oppressions carried out against the Palestinians. This is a human story of blood, Sir.

Therefore, this has got to be solved. Sir, I am very happy that President Mahinda Rajapaksa, in his true form and consistent policy, issued a statement on the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestine People by welcoming the decisions taken by others towards Palestine State.

Then, Sir, in 2008, Israel attacked West Bank for 21 days. There were over 800,000 children living in the West Bank attending school. The bombings commenced around 7 a.m and again at 11.30 a.m. That was the time schools commences their first and second sessions when a large number of children were on the road on their way to or from school. If this is not terrorism, what is terrorism? That is the international terrorism which the UN is duty-bound to erase from the international arena as our heroic President did in Sri Lanka. Today, Sir, many American Jews are able to see the reality and this message is now being addressed widely by many of them.

Sir, I would also like to talk about our foreign policy. What are the Hon. Members of the Opposition doing? Why are they going to Tamil Nadu? Sir, I am very surprised to hear the Hon. Laskman Kiriella, the UNP's foreign affairs spokesman - Alas! It is pity to call him as the UNP's foreign spokesman - saying, There is nothing in Delhi. Everything is in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Is this the policy of the United National Party, I ask in this House? He wants us to go and meet Jayalalitha. Let him, if he wishes, go with the Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake and meet her and find out who is better in solving this problem. I must also tell that the Hon. Sajith Premadasa made a fine speech about Palestine. Okay, keep it up! Do not bow down to the pressures of the Zionists and the Israelis, I would warn you.

Then, I must also say, Sir - ( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) I rise to a point of Order. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) What is that? ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) What is the point of Order, Hon. Sajith Premadasa?

You can ask the Assistant Secretary-General. According to the Standing Orders - [Interruption.] Please go through the Standing Orders.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) If there is anything mentioned against the Standing Orders, it will be expunged.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) He cannot impute motives - [Interruption.] Mr. Deputy Chairman, let me clarify. I am under no pressure at all in formulating my own opinions with regard to foreign policy.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) You are not raising a point of Order. You raised one before and I gave a Ruling that anything stated against the Standing Orders would be expunged.

( ) (The Hon. Sajith Premadasa) Sir, I am on a point of Order.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) You cannot allow that, Sir.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Azwer, you carry on with your speech. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Deputy Chairman, he will be put out; he is qualifying to be sent out soon from this House before he will be sent out from "Sirikotha".

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, give me two more minutes, please. ( ) (The Deputy Chairman) You have already taken three minutes extra. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Then, Sir, in formulating our policies and taking it forward, particularly, in the United States, there are several people who are helping our Foreign Minister. One is, Mr. Jaliya Wickramasuriya, the Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the United States. Then, the other one is that indefatigable and brave personality, General Shavendra Silva, Deputy Ambassador. Come what may, he is espousing the cause of Sri Lanka in the United States against all odds. Then, Sir, I must also congratulate the "Three Rajakattuwa of foreign affairs. I call the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, Minister of External Affairs, my good Friend, the Hon. Neomal Perera and the Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena as the "Three Rajakattuwa- .

Azwer) I must appreciate the good work done by Mr. Karunatilaka Amunugama, Secretary to the Ministry of External Affairs and also Mr. Majintha Jayasinghe, Chief Protocol Officer of the Ministry who had performed a good job at the airport receiving foreign distinguished visitors.

Then, I must also say, yesterday, when speaking about our foreign policy, the Hon. Ranjan Ramanayake brought the sky down to the earth. He criticized the Shariah law. It is a law accepted by that country too. We are duty-bound to respect the Saudi Law, just as we respect the laws in our country. He does not understand that the Shariah law is a Quranic Law, it is a Divine Law and no one has the power to change it.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer)

One moment, Sir. I will finish. Then, Sir, in implementing foreign policy, we must understand the cultural values and aspirations of all communities in the world.

Now, Sir - ' ' . . . . , 57 ' ' . .

Then, I would also ask the Hon. Minister to send as much as possible, officers with Arabic knowledge to the Middle East. There are many Arabic-educated people

who are coming out from Jamiah Naleemiah in China Fort, Beruwala. They will be of immense service to our Foreign Service.

Finally, I thank all the Hon. Ministers and their officials.

( ) (The Deputy Chairman) Thank you very much. The next speaker is the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.

[3.22 p.m.]

( ) (The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe) Hon. Deputy Chairman, today in the Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of External Affairs, very important points were raised. But, I am not going to say that some of the ideas expressed by either side are correct. I think we will have to look at both sides. During the last three to four years, especially after the conclusion of the terrorist war, we have gone through a turbulent period in this country. We know that different types of interferences and influences have been made on Sri Lanka. It is easy for us to make allegations against foreign elements, foreign countries or foreign organizations but the issue is, can we reconcile or resolve the issues by making these allegations? Our's is an internal issue. Our conflict was commenced three decades ago with the people living in the North and the East speaking Tamil, and since then, we could not resolve our own conflict, the disputes at our home and therefore, we have opened the floodgates for various countries to get involved in our internal affairs.

, ; . . , , , . 20, 30 . Now, we are living in a global village. Therefore, no country can survive on their own. We must not forget that we are a small Island in the Indian Ocean.

Whereupon MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES left the Chair, and THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER took the Chair.

[3.41 p.m.] ... ( ) ( ... - , ) (The Hon. W.D.J. Senewiratne - Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs)

Mr. Presiding Member, I am glad to take part in the Committee Stage Discussion on the Votes of the Ministry of External Affairs. I believe the Discussion that has been going on from morning has afforded ample opportunity for the Members of both sides to express their valuable views on the foreign policy of our country.

Sir, our able Minister of External Affairs, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris has been the guardian in protecting our motherland from various hostile forces, both from outside and inside, who have relentlessly unleashed a campaign to tarnish the good name of our beloved country. He has withstood these inimical forces and adequately confronted the alleged charges of violations of human rights especially targeting the final stages of the concluded Eelam war in 2009.

With the ending of the 30-year old war by our heroic armed forces over the Tamil-tiger terrorists, we are now confronted with a new form of war by certain Western

countries under the influence of the international network of the hard-core Tamil Tigers, based outside Sri Lanka, in the guise of alleged violations of human rights and war crimes, with the ulterior motive of roping the leaders of our country to be charged or tried for war crimes before the International Court. Towards achieving this horrendous crime of being tried for war crimes at the International Court against all those who stood and defeated the dehumanized barbaric terrorist outfit of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the concocted Darusman Report, the attempt to stifle Sri Lanka in Geneva at the UN Human Rights Committee and many other dubious attempts by forces under the behest of Prabhakarans cronies in the Tamil diaspora are being used, somehow or the other, to make a case against those who liberated our sacred land from the clutches of the inhuman Tamil Tigers. Herein lies the significant role played by our Minister of External Affairs, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris in defusing and thwarting such moves, as mentioned by me earlier. Let me congratulate the learned Professor for all his efforts and also his Deputy Minister to bring sanity and reason to the international community.

Let me, at the very outset, say that we are not alone although being a small country in our defence against malicious charges made against our country. Just to mention a few countries: China, Russia, India, Pakistan, countries from the Middle East, some Latin American countries and also some African countries are with us in our struggle for justice and fair play against these unfounded malicious charges.

I record my gratitude to these friendly countries in coming to our rescue at this crucial time. Countries such as the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Germany and other powerful countries, by their double standards whilst breaching all norms of international conduct, human rights and the rights of independent sovereign States in destroying life and property of other countries and occupying lands of others, with the very same breath to preach and punish a small sovereign state like Sri Lanka on alleged violations during the last stages of the Eelam war, is a deliberate attempt to misconstrue the ground realities faced by Sri Lanka at the final stages of the Eelam war. It is highly deplorable and unethical to harass Sri Lanka on the part of the above-mentioned countries when a small country like Sri Lanka, after ending a 30-year war, is making a valiant effort to bring normal life and freedom to all communities of the Island.This is nothing but an attempt to throttle a convalescing nation from making a recovery after a prolonged war, which has shattered and battered the very foundations of her existence. These powerful nations must be happy that Sri Lanka has won a decisive war against a most powerful fascist terrorist outfit of the world. In fact, Sri Lanka has shown the way to the world how terrorism could be ended.

1955 1956

2012 30

Sir, during the Second Reading of the Budget, a former Minister of Foreign Affairs who had now found refuge in the UNP, spoke disparagingly on a visiting Head of State, the President of Uganda. A good part of his speech had to be expunged but still Columns 1496 and 1497 of the Hansard of 17th November, 2012, gives a glimpse of his rapacious remarks, not only referring to the President of Uganda but also to the people of Uganda that 60 per cent of the population of Uganda has HIV/AIDS. Sir, we are not surprised at the over-concern about HIV/AIDS by that Member.

Sir, Sri Lanka with the complete military victory over the LTTE in May 2009, undertook a massive operation to relieve the displaced civilians well over 300,000 to their original habitats, as far as possible, with the necessary infrastructure built in with all the resources at the command of the State.

Whilst the State is doing all what could be done for the benefit of the displaced, the hard-core LTTE members began with their fully-oiled disinformation apparatus in the foreign countries to tarnish the Sri Lankan State painting Sri Lanka as a failed State with gross violations of human rights in the eyes of the world community. Further, Channel 4 produced and televised, with the help of known LTTE members, documentaries to show alleged war crimes by the Sri Lankan Armed Forces.

Sir, we being a small country can ill afford to idle and allow the propaganda machine of the diaspora and foreign-based hard-core Tamil Tigers to paint a completely distorted version of what has happened in Sri Lanka.

All States should be informed by aggressive propaganda to counter the damage caused by untruths propagated by Sri Lankan enemies with factual in-depth information whilst all international bodies, whether controlled by the United Nations and by independent agencies, have to be canvassed with ground realities of what actually happened and what is happening in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan State should use every expertise available locally and recruit foreign professionals to counter ill-effects propagated by enemies of the Sri Lankan State. The necessary finances for this purpose have to be allocated generously. I am in full agreement that the new concept of opening up diplomatic relations with the African states should continue.

The Ministry of External Affairs should be vigilant to all new developments concerning all detrimental effects caused by anti-Sri Lankan groups, within and outside international establishment and it should, nip in the bud, all such conspiracies. The Ministry of External Affairs of Sri Lanka should, at all times, be aware in advance of any plans by interested groups to frame charges against Sri Lanka, based on utter falsehood created to arouse contempt and displeasure in the minds of world leaders.

I am confident, Sir, that Sri Lankas foreign policy, formulated from the times of the late Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, further strengthened during the tenure of office of the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgarmar and now, in the safe hands of the present Minister of External Affairs, the Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, would surmount all obstacles and anchor to the shores of the comity of nations.

Thank you. ( )

(The Presiding Member) The next speaker is the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake. You have 20 minutes.

[3.51 p.m.]

( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Thank you, Mr. Presiding Member, for giving me this opportunity. I would love to contribute my knowledge to the Ministry of External Affairs, the Votes of which are being debated at this moment.

May I start by quoting from the "Mahinda Chintana, Sri Lanka: the emerging Wonder of Asia.

I will follow a non-aligned, free and progressive foreign policy. Priority will be given to political, defence, economic, trade and cultural spheres to the cordial and friendly relationships that we already have with countries in the Asian region including India, Japan, China and Pakistan."

That is from the Bible of the SLFP - the "Mahinda Chintana".

Actually, our foreign policy should be an extension of the country's domestic interests. I am sure that is well engrained and I do not need to be telling that to the Minister of External Affairs or the Deputy Minister because that is absolutely practical realism. It should also be richly and realistically projected against the backdrop of the ever-changing international scenario. With malice to none and being magnanimous, we must adopt the policy of friendship to all, but alliance with none. But, unfortunately, is that what is happening? We must realize that little Sri Lanka is part of the world, not think that the world is inside Sri Lanka. That has been the hallmark of the foreign policy of the "Mahinda Chintana": they think that all nations are inside Sri Lanka and that they have got to dance to the whims and fancies of the Government in power when required. So, I guess changing that quickly and adapting to the realistic situation would be the best for the country.

1957 1958

Hon. Minister, I know you have a hard task. You were with the SLFP, then you came to us and again, you are back with the Government. So, you have a difficult task to go ahead with. But, that is not what we are commenting on at this particular moment. We are talking of the foreign policy of the country. It is, for good reasons or bad reasons, in your hands. Have we looked at it progressively and if we have looked at it practically, have we gone forward? Are we in a better place than we were before the war? Within the three-and-a-half-year post-war period, have we managed to win the hearts and minds of the international community? There are 224 other Members and we, at this precarious moment facing an economic onslaught in the world, have only helped to create more enemies in the world rather than friends?

Now, let me take up the Labour GSP because you and I were part of the effort of getting it in 2001 under the pragmatic leadership of the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe and the then UNP. We managed to show the vacuum that was there and obtain the Labour GSP for the country. Today, we have lost it. You know that we tried to mention this to the Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama, the then Foreign Minister. He ignored it. Then, we mentioned to you that the best policy for the country is to have a situation where the Government and the Opposition work together, talk with the international community and ensure that we protect the Labour GSP that has been given to us. At that time, the members of the Central Bank, who are now economic pundits, mentioned that it is of no avail and that it has no impact on the business community. Today, what do the captains of the Chambers of Industry say? It is only 14 months after the Labour GSP had been withdrawn. The impact is US Dollars 1.3 billion. That is not something that can be just ignored. That is not something basically the taxpayers can afford. If that US Dollars 1.3 billion was in the hands of the countrymen, that means, the industrialists, they could have given better salaries, would be able to compete better internationally and we would have been enjoying it today with that US Dollars 1.3 billion in the State coffers. But, what did the Government say at that particular moment ?

We can lose it, but we will give the benefits to you", they said. Have you even paid what was promised when the war was going on? There were many promises that were given. It has not been paid, Hon. Minister. So, at this particular moment, you, Hon. Minister, and the Deputy Minister have to carry on the tough task with an incompetent Government. I am saying so owing to the foreign policy adopted. It just would not help the country regain its lost prestige in the world. That is what I am saying.

The Labour GSP, at this moment, is still to be negotiated. I am happy that Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha - he is a competent person - in the European

Union is doing his best. - [Interruption.] I am sorry, wherever he is stationed, I am informed that he has started negotiating on behalf of the Government, which is a step in the right direction. We, from the Opposition, will give all the support if it can be brought back into operation because Labour GSP is something very important and that does not go off from the taxpayers' money. If it does not come into operation, you have got to subsidize and then, it goes off from the money of the taxpayers of this country.

You know that regional politics takes place with India playing an absolutely important role. Today, our greatest friend has been made a suspicious friend. Why? Because you all are trading China against India. You may say no, but that is the reality. India has been a friend who has been with us at all times. When has India stood and voted against us in Geneva? It happened during your tenure, during the tenure of the Government that you are representing. Today, we are faced with an odd situation where we are being looked at as pariahs internationally, as is being said. This is something which has got to be eradicated, Hon. Minister. We are saying this because what you do, reflects on the country as bad foreign policy . If you mess it up, at the end of the day, we, as the alternate Government, will have to bring that prestige back again internationally. That is democracy.

After the Geneva vote, you all were called to the United States. You went and met Hilary Clinton. The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, my Colleague, mentioned very aptly how Members of your own Cabinet made fools of themselves, staging fasts unto death, a farce by itself. You ridiculed by burning their effigies and then, went back to the very persons, Hilary Clinton and Obama. What do you get out of that? Today, you are still saddled with the problem and those guys are doing nothing, but only fanning the fires of extremism.

Then, let me refer to the statement made by the American Ambassador to the UN, Eileen Donahoe, on Sri Lanka at the Universal Periodic Review just a couple of days ago. In that particular statement, she commends you for the resettlement, which was mentioned very aptly by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella. So, I do not want to mention it again. "We remain concerned by the consolidation of executive power, including the passage of the 18th amendment, and that no agreement has been reached on political devolution. Former conflict zones remain militarized, and the military continues to encroach upon daily civilian and economic affairs. The Ministry of Defence has controlled the NGO secretariat since 2010" is what the United States of America, where you went after the Geneva vote against you, writing a three to four-page letter to them saying that the LLRC recommendations is your base and the way forward, said. You had this being mentioned by the United States among the other 220 comments that have been made by

1959 1960

many countries at the Universal Periodic Review in Geneva. The Ambassador's statement further stated, I quote:

"Serious human rights violations continue, including disappearances, torture, extra-judicial killings, and threats to freedom of expression."

Is that not true? She went on to state, I quote:

"Opposition figures have been harassed, detained, and prosecuted. There have been no credible investigations or prosecutions for attacks on journalists and media outlets. In the past 30 days, a judge who questioned executive interference in the judiciary was severely beaten in broad daylight by multiple assailants and derogatory posters appeared in Colombo threatening the director of an NGO......"

These had been mentioned by the American Ambassador to the UN, no less a person. Might is not the right at this moment. There is no necessity, just because you are a big country to bully small countries. We are small. We have the right to stand on our own feet, but that does not mean that you must misuse your powers. Neither the others nor should we exploit situations that directly threaten us. You know that just before you went, Hilary Clinton had written to the the Congress saying, Do not meet Sri Lanka. You were happy that you were successfully able to meet them. What was told by them is known by you and the rest of the world. But, are you complying with that? These are the matters that you have got to look at.

Now the problem, Hon. Minister, is that de jure you are the Minister but de facto there are other people. That is the problem that you are faced with. The commands have to come from other people. I am happy, at least the de facto Minister is able to do something better than the de jure. But what is this? You have got to copy all messages to such and such people. This is what the Ministry of External Affairs people are telling us.

( ) (An Hon. Member) ? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) ? . , .

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) ? ( ) (The Presiding Member) Do not use unparliamentary words.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Do no take my time. , , . So, this is the real situation. All messages have got to be copied. This is what the Ministry of External Affairs people are telling us. Never has it fallen to this low level. You must take over the command and correct the situation. Before you try to trick the world, get it done in your own home, get it done in the Cabinet. You must have a collective policy. Your Cabinet of Ministers must know as to what you are doing. The Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe is given one aspect of it: "UN calls for quick political solution." Now, it is on this aspect he goes and speaks to the Secretary-General, a step in the right direction. Then,"US warns Sri Lanka in writing to stop all dealings with Iran". Now, Hon. Minister, this is part of your external affairs. You knew five years ago that this would be coming. What have you done? Today, the institutions are having a loss of Rs. 110 billion and you are saying that Iran cannot trade with Sri Lanka, so we are losing. What were you doing five years ago? The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie saw the writing on the wall and extended the oil credit facility and did certain things. But, he was overridden by commission-oriented people who subsequently succeeded him and today, you are being lampooned due to this problem. You are losing money. You are unable to trade because you were not prepared. Here, it very clearly says, "in writing". In January, you all were in a complacent mood and said, "US has allowed Sri Lanka to import from Iran" not knowing that Iran could not export to Sri Lanka. Is this the Ministry of External Affairs that you are guiding? These are not personal criticisms, Hon. Minister. You may be an erudite person, a scholar in all spheres but practically this is not the way you have got to run a country. You must know what the problems are. In todays difficult world where every country is at each other's throat, you have got to ensure that these are looked at. The Sunday Times newspaper of 25th November, 2012 states, I quote:

Lanka, Iran work out a deal on a huge oil bill

Iran owes Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka owes Iran, so we will use the money flagrantly violating the UN sanction that is imposed on, which we have to abide by.

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) Hon, Member, can I take one minute, please? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) If Government time can be given, then it is okay. - [Interruption.] There is the de facto Foreign Minister. -[Interruption.] I will listen to you but time should be taken from your side, not from me.

1961 1962

( ) (The Hon. Sajin De Vass Gunawardena) The US Government has given permission for certain quantities to be brought to Sri Lanka.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is what I said. You were not listening, de facto Minister of External Affairs. What I said was, they permitted Sri Lanka to import, but if Iran is not allowed to export, then, what happens? That is the problem. Now, I said here that money is due to the United Nations. You cannot barter the two and say, I owe you. So, you promise me a loan and we will use that and go forward". That is what I am saying. So, ensure when you guide the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the President and see that these are taken into consideration. This is an information given by the Opposition, free of charge. We are only giving this because when you mess it up, we have got to take the reins of the mess you have created.

. , . . ? Plug , , , ? . , do not play around with the integrity of Sri Lanka. This has been built upon through professionalism and do not let it be spoiled by jokers who come just because Mr. J.R. Jayewardene gave a right to the small parties to come into this system.

Hon. Minister, now I do want to mention what the United States of America in the Universal Periodic Review had mentioned about Sri Lanka. Now, I am just giving a standing example, a classic example of the inaction of police. You know on the 2nd of February, 2011 we had a protest and the Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, the Hon. (Mrs.) Rosy Senanayake, the Hon. Karu Jayasuriya, and myself, all of us, were hammered brutally on that day. That was two years ago. Yesterday, I got a letter from the police saying that a complaint has been made by us and asking us to come and give evidence regarding that matter. This is two years after the event has taken place. What are we talking of? Is this what you are basically telling a Member of Parliament who made a complaint?

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) They may have thought that it has happened one month ago.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) No, this happened one year ago. These are the things that you are projecting to the world. Furthermore, while

you are talking of the Universal Periodic Review, you impeach. You all did an impeachment confirmed by Mr. Udaya Gammanpila and Mr. Pradeep Jayewardena. They never sent it up and at the worst of time, you bring in an impeachment against the Chief Justice of this country. Then, you tell the rest of the world, What is this international community playing around with Sri Lanka? Have you not got the foresight or the brains? If you want to do this, do it at least one week later. What do you do? You put pressure on the rest of the country and then they point the finger at them and tell that they are violating international rights by interfering with Sri Lankas internal affairs. Hon. Minister, I am sure these are the things that you have got to look at and ensure professionalism is brought in.

Look at the Tamil students. One of my Colleagues raising a Privilege issue mentioned in Parliament as to what type of problems he had to go through. These are matters of Members of Parliament who had these particular things got done - I do not believe, but he mentioned - by the forces that are there.

Then, the next one is the prison riot. You had armoured cars going into prison. These are high security areas where nobody can go in. Leave alone arm and ammunition or armoured cars, you cannot even take a small pen into the prison. You go and brutally kill 100 people there. This is how the rest of the world sees these types of things. Then, the media has been stifled; there is no independence of the Judiciary; all this is very well known.

Hon. Minister, yesterday there were various arguments and the Hon. Speaker gave a Ruling.

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.] when he basically pronounced the Ruling on the Divineguma Bill, he gave his interpretation on the 9th of October, 2012. Column 13 of the Hansard dated 9th October, 2012 states, I quote:

The right to interpret the Constitution is the province solely of the Supreme Court that must not be disturbed and their learned decisions on interpretation must be treated with great respect.

( ) ( - )

(The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa - Minister of Economic Development)

That has nothing to do with yesterdays Ruling.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Hon. Minister, I am speaking on foreign affairs, on a matter on which I am building up an argument.

( ) (The Hon. Basil Rohana Rajapaksa) But, that has nothing to do with foreign affairs.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Well, you just told the interpretation given by America.

( )

(The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you are discussing -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What are you worried about? I am the one who is speaking here.

( ) (The Presiding Member) I am in the Chair. You listen to me, Hon. Member.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am speaking. What is the reason for your interrupting me?

( ) (The Presiding Member) You must be tamed; you must be disciplined. You listen to me.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) What is there to listen?

( ) (The Presiding Member) Listen to me. You are discussing about the Ruling of the Speaker. You cannot do that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We have heard that the Speaker should be only hearing, seeing and not interfering.

( ) (The Presiding Member) You are discussing about the Ruling given then and now. You cannot do that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am quoting from the Hansard.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Even using the Hansard, you cannot discuss the conduct of the Speaker. You are casting aspersions on the Speaker.

( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am not casting aspersions on the Speaker. I am quoting a statement made by the Hon. Speaker.

( ) (The Presiding Member) That will be expunged from the Hansard.

. ( . )

(The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera)

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) He is a person who has controlled this House. He was a Speaker.

(The Presiding Member) You are a former Speaker. You must set an example to others.

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) ?

( ) (The Presiding Member) , . . So, that will be expunged. You carry on.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) How can it be expunged? I am quoting from a Hansard where the Speaker has given a Ruling.

( ) (The Presiding Member) It will be expunged from the Hansard. You carry on with your speech.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am quoting what the Speaker - ( ) (The Presiding Member) You have only one more minute.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Hon. Speaker has stated, I quote:

The right to interpret the Constitution is the province solely of the Supreme Court that must not be disturbed- So, on that particular basis, you are telling the Americans that this is what you are doing - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Joseph Michael Perera, do not call upon the backbenchers to be unruly. It is a very bad example.

( ) (The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) A very bad example.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, please conclude your speech. - [Interruption.] Order, please! Your time is over.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You cannot interfere with my speech. If you interrupt, you give me your time.

( ) (The Presiding Member) No.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You cannot be playing around with our time - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) You have to abide by the Ruling of the Chair. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You have bulldozed the court and you are going to bulldoze Parliament. You cannot do that.

( ) (The Presiding Member) You have to abide by the Ruling given from the Chair, be it the Speaker or anybody else.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) You cannot be bullying us from there - [Interruption.] This is what the world must see.

( ) (The Presiding Member) I command all the powers that the Speaker enjoys when he is in the Chair. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The world must see what is being done to us. - [Interruption.] -

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The Chief Justice is being impeached. - [Interruption.]

(The Presiding Member) That is the Order of the Chair. You must abide by it. You cannot challenge that. - [Interruption.] If you want, there is a remedy elsewhere. - [Interruption.] Hon. Joseph Michael Perera, I can send you out. If you misbehave, I can send you out.

( )

(The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) You cannot send him out.

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Try to do that. . ( . )

(The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) .

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. DEW Gunasekara, - [Interruption.] ( )

(The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I want time to finish my speech.

( )

(The Presiding Member) No, no. Your time is over. Your time was taken by others.

( )

(The Hon. Sujeewa Senasinghe) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Presiding Member) There is no point of Order. Hon. Minister, you speak. - [Interruption.] - No, no. You cannot deliberately disturb the House. - [Interruption.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Presiding Member) What is your point of Order, Hon. Rauff Hakeem? - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I want to clarify, Mr. Presiding Member, - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I must finish my speech.

( ) (The Presiding Member) We are not dealing with bullfrogs. Hon. Joseph Michael Perera, behave yourself. You are a former Speaker. You are setting a very bad example to others. - [Interruption.] Hon. Rauff Hakeem, you may continue. - [Interruption.]Hon. Member, do not try to bully the Chair. You can try that elsewhere.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Hon. Presiding Member, let me clarify since the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake raised this issue about the Hon. Speakers Ruling yesterday. He has got his wires crossed in this sense. The earlier Ruling by the Speaker regarding the Supreme Court's competence to interpret the Constitution is one matter. But, to interfere with the legitimate functions of Parliament and its Select Committee through issuing summons to Members in the Select Committee is another matter. [Interruption.] Therefore, do not try to confuse. - [Interruption.] No, no. Both issues are not at cross purposes. You are confusing the whole issue. The Hon. Speaker is well within his rights to - [Interruption.] That is a different matter.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Chairman) What is your point of Order, Hon. Member? ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Sir, I was on my feet. Then, the Member who was in the Chair gave a bumptious judgement on one of my

1971 1972

2012 30

Colleagues. As a result, we had to suspend Sitting for a couple of minutes. We mentioned that the lost five minutes should be given to us. Now, it needs to be corrected and my Colleague needs to be brought back, as well as the lost time should be given to us.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, now that an Order is given - ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I am sorry, Sir.

( ) (The Chairman) I take your point of Order.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We have basically mentioned certain matters and that is how we resumed the Sitting. It was mentioned that the lost time will be given to us.

( ) (The Chairman) The lost time will certainly be given on agreement and if there was any issue that had taken place, the Hon. Speaker is willing to investigate into that.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) Please investigate into it and ensure that such Members do not sit on the Chair anymore.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Speaker had a discussion with one of your senior Members of Parliament.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) This happened to the Hon. Leader of the Opposition, when he was speaking. Now, this happened to the Hon. Ajith P. Perera.

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Member, there was a discussion between the Hon. Speaker and a senior Member of Parliament of your

Party. According to him, the issue is resolved. The Hon. Speaker undertook to look into the matter and take appropriate action. The senior Member, a former Hon. Speaker, also agreed to it. So, taking into consideration the traditions and standards of Parliament, I would request the Hon. Ajith P. Perera, since there is an Order given by the Chair at that time, to keep away for today -

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) We cannot allow that type of thing to happen. That is not what we have agreed upon. Why should he be subject to an irrational judgement given by the Chair?

.

( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

. ( . ) (The Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera) . . .

Now, we can go on. There is no problem. According to the Order, he went out of the House with us. Now, we are back here. The Chair did not mention any time or date. It is very clear.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) That is also an irrational judgement given from the Chair. There are traditions of Parliament, Sir. That is important as there are Standing Orders -

( ) (The Chairman) Since I was not chairing at that time, I have to ascertain as to what really transpired. So, based on what transpired, we will have to come to a decision. In that case, let us suspend the House again for five minutes, initially to discuss and ascertain by checking the video clip - [Interruption.]

Hon. Member, let us the check the way in which matters have transpired and the way in which - [Interruption.]Hon. Member, the Chair does not belong to a party. [Interruption.] - The Chair belongs to both sides of the House. - [Interruption]. Order, please!

Please listen to me. The Chair belongs to both sides of the House. So, for the Chair to take a fair decision, the Chair has to listen to and watch the video clip to ascertain what really transpired and to ascertain what the Order has been. Therefore, I suspend the House again for 10 minutes in order to ascertain that.

I was on my feet when there was a decision unfairly taken on what I was reading from the Hansard. We regret that. But, now things have been put back to order. At that particular moment I was referring to the Universal Periodic Review. It was mentioned by no less than the United States of America: Opposition figures have been harassed. We are being harassed inside.- [Interruption.]

[Interruption.] If we are going back to the Standing Orders, let us forget all our decisions and go back to the Standing Orders. You cannot have it both ways. - [Interruption.] No, you cannot have it both ways. You can abide by the Party Leaders' decision or go back to the Standing Orders.- [Interruption.] You cannot have it both ways.

( ) (The Chairman) This issue can be taken up at the Party Leaders meeting. For the time being, the Hon. Speaker has allowed it. Therefore, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, you can continue. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) But, we cannot have it both ways. [ ] . . . [ ] . [ ]

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Ravi Karunayake, you may speak. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) At that particular moment it was mentioned that the Opposition figures are harassed - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) Hon. Ravi Karunayake, you may continue. - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) At that particular moment it was mentioned that the Opposition figures are being harassed. This is a clear example to the world that there is harassment going on. What I mentioned at that particular moment is what is in the Hansard, on which the Hon. Speaker has given a ruling. I refer to Column 13 of the Hansard dated 9th October, 2012. It states, I quote:

"The right to interpret the Constitution is the province solely of the Supreme Court that must not be disturbed and their learned decisions on interpretation must be treated with great respect."

Hon. Chairman, on this particular basis there is an interpretation - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) I am raising a point of Order. - [Interruption.] Are we going to uphold the Party Leaders decision or are we going to totally erase the Party Leaders decision and fall back only on the Standing Orders? Please give me an order on that.- [Interruption.] Without the consent of the House, you cannot change the Party Leaders decision.[Interruption.] The Party Leaders decision stands - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) An order in respect of this issue was given by the Hon. Speaker. Therefore, let us have a meeting of the Party Leaders. - [Interruption.]

Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Hon. Chairman, we all are glad that some sanity has returned after some turbulence in the House. With the limited time that is available to me, may I at the outset, say that the Ministry of External Affairs, during the

period under review, has been conducting its work with the necessary skills at its disposal. I must say that a few days ago, we, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress wanted to move an Adjournment Motion on the issue of the Israeli attack on Gaza. Unfortunately, since the Hon. Minister of External Affairs was not available to reply, we could not take up that Motion. But, I just want to say a few words, in the first place, to congratulate the Palestinian Authority in having attained admission as a non-Member Observer State yesterday in the United Nations General Assembly.

Sri Lanka has been a stout and loyal friend of the Palestinians and, I must say, His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, from the days in which he had been a Member of the Opposition, has led the Palestinian Solidarity Movement in Sri Lanka and had been, throughout, showing his commitment and friendship towards the Palestinians and indeed, for all of us, this is a very proud moment.

I must also say in the very same attempt to achieve this status as a non-voting Member, it is recorded that the British Prime Minister had made a specific request from Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, that in order for Britain to go along with the Resolution, he must give an assurance that the Palestinian Authority will not use the newly acquired status to press for war crimes charges against Israel. This is the attitude of Britain.

Similarly, last time when a similar move was made, particularly, this whole issue of trying to agitate for their statehood within the UN system arose as a result of the Israeli attempts to build settlements in the occupied territories. When the first attempt was made, the US made an attempt to threaten the Palestinians that they will withdraw the assistance given to the Palestinian Authority, if they insist on statehood. Finally, Mahmoud Abbas, had to relent and seek admission to the UNESCO. When they sought admissions to the UNESCO, finally what the US did was to cut off funds that they were committing to the UNESCO, ultimately depriving the UNESCO of assisting poor nations in promoting education in all the underdeveloped world. This was the attitude of both the US and Britain. These are the so-called superpowers today trying to protect one of their surrogate States.

In that process, I must say that we faced the same wrath of US in the UN Human Rights Council last March, where against all traditions, they brought a country-specific resolution. In that, we learnt many things like what deficiencies we have in our diplomatic sphere and we have taken a very prudent decision now to establish and re-establish relations with the African Continent and with Latin America. I must congratulate the Hon. Minister for this paradigm shift in our foreign policy to begin diplomatic relations with almost 15 African countries in the African Continent and similarly,

1983 1984

2012 30

13 other countries in Latin America. This, I believe, is a very significant move and this has never occurred in the past and I believe, this is a paradigm shift which has occurred under the Mahinda Rajapaksa Regime. But, I feel there are some who are pointing fingers at the Government for such a bold decision in expanding our diplomatic horizon.

Definitely, as the Hon. Minister explained, the move is not to set up resident Missions in every one of these countries. Knowing the financial commitments involved, they will very carefully analyse the needs in setting up these missions and we will selectively be setting up resident Missions and wherever it is not possible, those Missions will operate from capitals close to those countries.

As at present, in the African Continent, we have missions in Kenya, Libya, Egypt, and we have a commitment to set up a Mission in Nigeria. But then, going by the happenings in the last Human Rights Council in March, I must say very categorically here that when we look at the African Continent, there were three States - Benin, Cameroon and Nigeria - voted in favour of the motion brought by the United States whereas, we managed to get three States to vote against the motion, Congo, Mauritania and Uganda. Together with that Angola, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Djibouti and Senegal abstained from voting.

This, indeed, is a tribute to the diplomatic efforts pioneered by the Hon. Minister and his team in travelling to all these capitals and impressing upon them. Finally, it resulted in five abstentions and only three African nations voting for it. There again, I must say, we have succeeded in where Americans have failed miserably when the Resolution was brought in the UN Human Rights Council.

Similarly, when you look at the Arab world, there again we find, with the exception of Libya, which obviously for the time being is unfortunately seen as a surrogate State of the West with its recent military involvement in its civil war, all the rest in the Arab world either supported or abstained. That in itself shows how the Arab world has stood with us in these difficult times.

Therefore, Hon. Chairman, the fresh focus on bilateral relations especially in the context of Sri Lankas reorientation of further strengthening relations in the African region as well as the Latin American region must be appreciated and we must congratulate the Hon. Minister for these efforts.

Together with that, we must also realize the need to understand the circumstances in which today, multilateralism is being pushed aside and unilateral decisions are being imposed in various multilateral bodies. This is seen as a continuation of the imperialist

colonial mindset of the West in trying to subjugate developing nations. We have, in the recent past, seen similar attempts to point fingers at us by trying to bring in various allegations and I am sure, the Hon. Minister, will succeed in his new efforts to meet all these challenges. So, I must once again congratulate him for all the attempts that he has made during this year and also his team, the Deputy Minister and the Hon. Sajin De Vaas Gunawardena, the Secretary and other officials for having conducted the foreign affairs of this country in a very admirable manner.

Thank you. ( )

It is important to know the meaning of the word, "diplomat". The word "diplomat" refers to an ambassador or an envoy who is appointed to represent his State or country for maintaining foreign relations with other governments. A diplomat is usually known for his skills and usage of tact in communicating with people. After all, a diplomat is answerable to his country for safeguarding integrity, culture and peace. At the same time, a diplomat has to ensure that trade, cultural and political interest of the other country is not harmed. So, he has to exercise assertiveness. A diplomat can also be referred to as a person who prefers to conduct himself in such a manner that he or she does not get into arguments or conflicts. What does diplomacy mean, Sir? Diplomacy is known as the art of forging relationships without resorting to arguments or conflicts. I ask this House today, do we have diplomats who know diplomacy?

... ( ... )

(The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Yes.

( ) (The Hon. Harin Fernando) I am not talking

[ .] [ ] [Expunged on the order of the Chair.]

You just got kicked out and you are back again here. So, please sit down and listen to what I have to say. - [Interruption.] Hon. Speaker, today we have ambassadors who are -[Interruption.]

( ) (The Chairman) . . . . .

( ) (The Hon. Harin Fernando) . . Hon. Chairman, Today, we have ambassadors posted to key cities who are engaged in either marketing or sustaining their tea businesses. We have ambassadors posted in New York, in London and elsewhere, who are actually doing their tea marketing business. They are the so-called ambassadors we have. Also, there are certain ambassadors, the same ambassadors whom you have appointed, who write to the Sunday newspapers criticizing your foreign policy.

Hon. Chairman, how many of our ambassadors can speak Tamil? I think it is very important if we can appoint ambassadors who can speak Tamil to the countries where there is a large Tamil diaspora. Then, matters could be dealt with in a much easier manner. It is important to note here, that the late Hon. Lakshman Kadirgamar, who was respected by all communities had a much easier task than any other Foreign Minister or any other diplomat and that was indeed because of the language skill that he had.

Sri Lanka had a miserable failure at the recently concluded vote on the UN Resolution against Sri Lanka. That clearly exposed the weaknesses in our foreign policy, not to mention the busting millions of dollars spent over that through the tax payers money. It was a joy ride for a few people. A jumbo delegation of over 50 odd went there. Actually, they went to the corridors of the UN and tried to negotiate with members who were representing different governments. It would have been much more worthy if they went to the capitals of those countries and met the Heads of States of those countries, not the representatives at the UN building. I think that was a big miscalculation done by you.

Sir, the LLRC Report has become an ugly joke and none of the countries would take us seriously anymore. What has the Ministry of External Affairs given to these ambassadors to market us? The ambassadors are supposed to market us abroad. What have you all given them? Is it the Action Plan that you all have given them with no action? Is it the LLRC Action Plan that you want them to sell? I do not think that it is going to be good enough for them to sustain. Also, there is no hope of reconciliation, Hon.Chairman. There are certain patriotic movements like the famous Patali Champika and Wimal Weerawansa combination who are actually opposing reconciliation and the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution - together with the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena - which is also a disgracing fact.

Hon. Chairman, on what rationale is the Ministry of External Affairs expanding Foreign Missions? I need to understand this. Today, there was a programme on Derana TV, about the ambassador in Italy who does not go to the Embassy until 5 oclock in the evening and then works till 12 oclock in the night. His own secretary has made a complaint against him for keeping her to work till 12 oclock in the midnight. I think these are big problems that you all are having. This ambassador has three particular persons who have been taken as his staff members.

In conclusion, I wish to say that all ambassadors of Sri Lanka and diplomats in the Ministry of External Affairs have to work as one team. I would like to quote what the famous British Diplomat and Ambassador to India, Lord Gore-Booth said.

He said once and I quote:

Foreign policy is what you do; diplomacy is how you do it. Of course the two get mixed up especially when a diplomat is advising on policy or a member of the Government normally engaged in policy decision takes over a diplomatic operation which seems to merit top level or summit discussion. But generally speaking the task of a government is to decide and the task of a diplomat at any level is to try to make the decision work. While wishing you all the best, Hon. Minister, I hope with the reshuffle, you will remain in your position and the so-called "awaiting Minister" might not surpass you by any chance. Hon. Deputy Minister, I think you have been doing a good job and I wish you all the best. But, I think it is time for the official Minister, the official Deputy Minister and the unofficial Minister to get together and work as one team, not to be divided but actually to revamp the whole foreign affairs system.

Thank you.

The UN News Centre reported on 14th November, 2012, under the caption UN independent expert concerned over reports of intimidation of judges in Sri Lanka. I quote:

I urge the Sri Lanka Government to take immediate and adequate measures to ensure the physical and mental integrity of members of the judiciary and to allow them to perform their professional duties without any restrictions, improper influences, pressures, threats or interferences, in line with the countrys international human rights obligations, the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Gabriela Knaul, said in a news release.

. . .

I further quote:

The irremovability of judges is one of the main pillars guaranteeing the independence of the judiciary and only in exceptional circumstances may this principle be transgressed, Ms. Knaul said, while also expressing her uneasiness with the procedure of impeachment of the Chief Justice of the countrys Supreme Court, Dr. Bandaranayake, launched before the Parliament on 1 November.

Mr. Chairman, we are drawing towards a close of a long day which was punctuated by considerable drama and a series of interruptions. It is with a sense of sadness, Sir, that I witnessed these developments because there were many serious points which were raised by the Hon. Members who participated in this Discussion and those are points that are worthy of a serious answer. But, the atmosphere which prevailed in this House during the latter part of the afternoon, detracted substantially from the decorum of the House. However, thanks to your own

1993 1994

skill, Sir, order has now been restored and I would like to do my best to respond to the queries that were addressed to me and the observations that were made by the Hon. Members who participated in this Discussion. I think this series of incidents is particularly unfortunate because of the nature of the subject that is being discussed today.

Much more than in any other aspect of public policy, a bipartisan approach is definitely required in respect of the formulation and the conduct of the countrys foreign relations. The thrust and parry of party politics is a fact of life. But, it is the duty of all of us to try to carve out a certain niche, within which a different approach is adopted and when we face the world to defend our motherland, we must have the foresight, the sagacity and the maturity to forget our internal differences and to take a common stand on behalf of our country. It is in that spirit that I appreciate the comment that was made by the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe who told us about an instance when, as an Opposition Member of Parliament, it fell to his lot to defend his country and he did so with all the ability at his command.

I also appreciate the fact that the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, who made a very constructive contribution to this Discussion, is here now at this late hour to listen to my reply. I am afraid that this cannot be said of many other Members who made vitriolic comments, sometimes very irresponsibly, but do not have the interest in the subject matter to be present when a reply is delivered to the very points they made. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella stated that we will have no problems with regard to our foreign policy if we do what is right. He was postulating, as the total solution to our problems, a certain commitment to ethical and moral positions. With all respect to the Hon. Member, I do not think that that is a realistic assessment of the situation.

Many of these issues arise from self-interest. The Hon. Harin Fernando talked about the diaspora. What does it mean? It is a fact of life. The groups that were close to the LTTE have, today, not changed their objective; they have only changed their methods. The fact of the matter, Sir, is that they are no longer able to use weapons, bombs and suicide squads because the war is over. Thanks to the leadership of His Excellency the President and the yeoman service that was rendered to this country by Mr. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. So, the war is over with the help of our armed forces. However, these groups are still continuing an economic onslaught on our country. The nature of the campaign is different. What they are trying to do is to dissuade tourists from visiting this country, to discourage foreign investment and to diminish volumes of international trade. So, it is an economic war against our country. I do not think the use of the word war is a misnomer there. That is the situation we are grappling with and these are forces that cannot be dismissed in cavalier fashion. They have the advantage of colossal

pecuniary resources which they have accumulated over the decades. They have a very sophisticated media network and that is what accounts for their influence in many countries. I would like to tell the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella that there was an instance - I will not name countries; I will not name individuals - where a particular Member of Parliament was hounding out Sri Lanka relentlessly every month, asking questions and then, the person concerned lost his or her seat in the Legislature in question, and within a matter of weeks, accepted paid employment in one of the organizations that are funded by those people. That is the reality of the situation. It is also a fact that Members of Parliament in certain countries who speak up for Sri Lanka are threatened. There have been instances where they have received letters saying that they will not be given nomination next time, that everything possible would be done to prevent their parties from giving them nominations. Just four days ago, there was a vicious attack on a Member of Parliament of another country who visited Sri Lanka to see for himself the development which has taken place in the northern part of the Island. So, that is what we are up against. It is not a question of doing the right thing and then getting full marks for adopting a position that is moral and ethical. These are the mundane realities: the forces of money, power and manipulation. That is the principal challenge that Sri Lanka faces today at the international level.

I would like to tell the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella that this state of affairs results in two problems. One is, the lack of a balanced view. These countries are not personally angry with us. They are responding to political pressures. Every government has a political base. The Government of Sri Lanka has a political base. Also, these other governments have a political base and when pressure is exerted on them by the constituencies on which they depend for continuing tenure of political power, naturally, they have to respond to those pressures. So, that is what is happening. In consequence of that, they are not able to arrive at a balanced view of the situation here. Sometimes, credit is given where credit is due very grudgingly and the negatives are emphasized. I would like to ask you, Hon. Member, to look at any post-conflict situation in the contemporary world.

How much has Sri Lanka achieved within such a short period of time? When we consider the magnitude and the complexity of the challenges and the brevity of the period within which we have accomplished so much in respect of the resettlement of internally-displaced persons, reintegration into society of ex-combatants, the completion of de-mining operations, all of this, is there any situation, be Cambodia or former Yugoslavia where so much was accomplished within such a short period of time?

Then, the other problem is a total lack of consistency or uniformity with regard to the standards that are applied. This degree of pressure that is exerted on this

1995 1996

[ () .. ]

2012 30

Island is without parallel in any of these other situations. The international system would be worthy of respect, if there is objectivity with regard to these standards that are formulated and applied. But, if there is a high degree of selectivity and subjectivism, then, it is a political agenda and not a moral and ethical agenda, as was vigorously contented for by the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella. So, that is the gravamen of my reply to my distinguished Friend on that particular score.

The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella also referred to the Petrie Report. The Petrie Report, I would like to tell him -

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) I did not refer to that.

() . . ( () .. ) (The Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris) I am sorry, you did not refer to that. That was the Hon. Sampanthan. I will come to that.

So, on the question of ethical and moral criteria, that is the essence of my reply to you.

The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella asked a very legitimate question. He said the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission is a Sri Lankan creature brought into being by His Excellency the President and asked why we are not implementing all its recommendations. I would like to tell the Hon. Member that that again is a total misconception. The political responsibility is not with the members of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission but with the appointing authority. The LLRC consists of men of great integrity and distinction. It is their allotted task to look at the evidence, to make an indepth analysis of it and to give of the benefit of their wisdom and expertise to the appointing authority, namely, His Excellency the President. But, the decision as to the recommendations that are going to be acted upon is a political decision. It is not a decision that can possibly be made by the Members of the Commission. They are not elected; they are not responsible to the people of this country and they have no moral or legal capability to make final decisions in that regard. Consequently, Sir, it is not necessary for the Government to make any apology or to be evasive in any manner, whatsoever, in stating with total clarity the position that the ultimate responsibility for determining what recommendations are going to be implemented rests, solely and squarely, with the Government of this country. Of course, we are adopting and applying the vast majority of those recommendations. But, to say that one hundred per cent of it must be done, it is axiomatic, it must necessarily happen, is to subscribe to a total misconception with regard to the nature of commissions and responsibility with regard to the implementation of their recommendations.

The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella was very sarcastic about our policy with regard to Africa. I make no apology for that. I would like to tell my Friend that there are 17 countries in West Africa, many of which are developing rapidly. The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella may not be aware that Sri Lanka is not represented in any one of those countries. That is a total lacuna. Now, the Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana thinks that when we do anything about this situation, we are sinking colossal sums. This is not the case. I would like to tell him that - a young Member of Parliament with promise, and I think it is necessary to respond accurately to what he had to say - what we are proposing to do with regard to West Africa is, to start by establishing a resident Mission in Abuja, Nigeria. Now, the Nigerian High Commissioner, Hon. Wijayawardhana, is already in Colombo. He has met me. He has come here before we have sent our High Commissioner to Abuja. Now, what we want to do is to use Nigeria as a base to establish and consolidate our relationships with the whole of West Africa. Then, we already have a Mission in Pretoria, South Africa where Shehan Ratnavale is our High Commissioner. We are using that to ramify our relations in the rest of Southern Africa. As far as East Africa is concerned, we will use Nairobi, Kenya as our base. Just as with regard to the northern part of the African Continent, we will use our Mission in Cairo, Egypt. So, it is not wasteful expenditure, it is not duplication of institutions unnecessarily but it is an effort to make the optimal use of limited resources which we invest in a timely and productive endeavour which is going to confer very substantial benefits on this country. It is not only Africa. As the Hon. Rauff Hakeem pointed out, we are establishing relations with 19 countries in Africa. We did not have relations with these countries. Then, we are establishing relations with 13 countries in Latin America and we are strengthening our relations with the Arab world. We have an excellent relationship with the Arab world.

There was a very famous Foreign Minister of a certain country who said that his Government does not have friends, it has only interests. President Mahinda Rajapaksa does not subscribe to that cynical conception of foreign relations. We value our friends and we stand by them through thick and thin. It is a matter of immense and profound pride to us that when we had to face some of the trials and tribulations that confronted us in March, the Arab world stood solidly with us.

Then, what about the CIS countries? His Excellency President Rajapaksa returned last week from a visit to Kazakhstan, which in terms of oil resources is only second to the Russian Federation in that part of the world. Their per capita income is US Dollars 12,500. They are high spenders and they are looking for exotic destinations to travel to. So, this is a whole new world that is opening up. To say that we must shut ourselves from all these countries is to delude ourselves. That is an attitude that smacks of snobbery. Snobbery is not the cornerstone of Sri Lankas foreign relations.

1997 1998

I also want to say a word largely in response to the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella with regard to the foundations of Sri Lankas foreign policy at this time. I entirely agree with the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, that is one of the few statements he made with which I am able to agree, that foreign policy is an extension of domestic policy. That is certainly the case. There is no bifurcation or dichotomy between the two.

When the war was being fought, our foreign policy had one principal objective: to enable this country to rid itself of the scourge of terror. The armed forces were the principal contributors but foreign policy also played its part. There were occasions in the recent history of Sri Lanka when the war was about to be won, victory was snatched from us by the intervention of foreign forces. That happened. That is a matter of contemporary history. But, thanks to the skill and the finesse that was displayed in that regard by President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He was able to handle those situations in such a way as to reassure the relevant powers and to prevent their intervention in the manner in which they had intervened in the past to make a decisive change with regard to the fortunes of the war at a critical moment. So, that was how foreign policy of Sri Lanka was structured at that time. Now, we are in a different situation: the transition from a society in conflict to a society enjoying the fruits of stability and prosperity. Consequently, the imperatives of our foreign policy have to be fundamentally transformed.

I would like to ask the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, - I understand that he is the principal spokesman of the United National Party on foreign policy - if you were making this decision, what would you regard as the pivot of Sri Lankas foreign policy right now? What is the principle purpose which must be subserved by this Islands foreign policy? I would say, undoubtedly, without any question whatsoever, it is economic diplomacy. Here is a country emerging from the shadow of an excruciatingly painful and sustained conflict. It is standing on its own feet. Foreign ambassadors including ambassadors from western countries have told me that wherever they go in the country, they see for themselves the mood of emancipation and confidence on the part of the people of this Island. Foreign policy then must feed into that and administer an impetus, a fillip to economic and social development. Because of all the problems that we had during the last two hours, I am not able to give you the details which I would like to give you. But, from a wide range of countries such as Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Peoples Republic of China, India, Kuwait, Qatar, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia, - as my distinguished Friend, the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama would readily confirm - there are vast resources flowing into this country to support ambitious programmes connected with irrigation, housing, most of all highways and railroad systems, the power and energy sector. All of

this is coming alive. It is being nourished by resources that are coming to us from large swaths of the globe. This does not happen fortuitously or coincidentally. It is happening because of a foreign policy that is appropriate to the needs of the time. The needs of today are quite different from the needs as they existed during the conflict. So, in the transformed situation, we have had to revamp our foreign policy in order to make the country the worthy recipient of these substantial material resources which we are today benefiting from.

The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella wanted me to reply instantly because he thought that I would run away from his question. I have no intention of doing it. Although it is not directly relevant to our foreign policy, since he asked me the question, I will reply very briefly to that. He asked me a question on a Constitutional issue which has already been dealt with quite extensively by the distinguished Speaker, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa as well as his predecessor, the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike. But, my specific answer to his question is this: Whether this House accepts a ruling of the Supreme Court depends on a variety of considerations. In the particular context that he envisaged, I think the governing provision is contained in Article 4(c) of the Constitution, which basically states that judicial power is exercised by Parliament through courts and tribunals established by law in the generality of matters. That is a rule. But, there is an exception and the exception is set out in this way. I quote:

.except in regard to matters relating to the privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament and of its Members, wherein the judicial power of the People may be exercised directly by Parliament according to law. You have a legal background yourself. I would like you to consider particularly the phrase Powers of Parliament. Where that is concerned, judicial power is exercised directly by this august Assembly, not obliquely or tortuously or indirectly, through the courts; it is exercised directly by this Parliament and if any ruling by the court detracts from that or is inconsistent with that, then, in my respectful submission, that ruling is not binding on Parliament. As you said, the Constitutional instrument is supreme. Here is the Constitution and that is what the Constitution says. So, if any ruling by the court purports to derogate from the powers of Parliament as they are enshrined in Article 4 (c) and in respect of which direct exercise of judicial power is given to this body and to no other, then we are bound to uphold the letter and the spirit of the Constitution of this Republic. That is my respectful answer to him. - [Interruption.] Please, I cannot get into a debate because I have to answer other questions also which relate to foreign policy.

I am genuinely sorry about the speech that was made by my Friend, the Hon. R. Sampanthan, one of the longest serving Members of this House, for whom I have great respect. And, it is a matter for deep regret that he

1999 2000

[ () .. ]

2012 30

is not even present here to listen to what I have to say in answer to him. The Hon. R. Sampanthan found fault with my Ministry for criticizing the "Petrie Report''. What else would any self-respecting nation do? That, I say, is a dishonest piece of work and I say that without fear or contradiction. It is a dishonest piece of work. It is not just mistaken but it is dishonest.

First of all, it was leaked and that is not the way we expect the United Nations system to work. We may be small; we may not be a very wealthy nation but we are also Members of the United Nations. We have been Members since 1952. We expect dignity and equality of treatment. That was a very shoddy behaviour on the part of the authors of that report. They leaked it, and then they commented on their own leak. What did they do next? They redacted - that is the word used, redacted. That is, they blacked out portions of the report. That is, a report was prepared and then they decided to expunge from the report, any paragraph which could entail any conceivable benefit to this country as a result of interpretation or construction. They blacked it out. So, you have the report, you have the redacted portions and you have the mould, the expurgated version, which was arrived at in consequence of a thoroughly dishonest process and I do not mince my words about that. Then, what is said in that Report? The Hon. R. Sampanthan quoted figures about food and medicine sent to the North. That is contradicted by Neil Buhne, who is a Canadian and he was in charge of the United Nations operation in this country at this time. So, contemporaneous reports prepared, not by the Government of Sri Lanka but by the highest officials of the UN system in this country are in flat contradiction to what Petrie has to say. The Hon. R. Sampanthan expects me not to contradict that report and not to criticize that. Certainly, I have no intention of complying with his wishes in the matter.

Then, this is very sad. The Hon. R. Sampanthan said this. I was so appalled that I actually took it down. He is not talking about me personally or even the Government. He is talking of this nation. This is what he said. I quote:

You will sink more and more into the mire.

Now, any kind of fiendish delight in that calamity to befall this island nation is something to be deeply regretted; to be sad about; not to gloat over; not to be jubilant upon. But, as long as we are responsible for the affairs of this nation, we will do everything on our part to prevent that calamity from manifesting itself. I would like to tell the Hon. Sampanthan, for whom I have a genuine respect, that this is really the wrong way to set about things.

I read a statement three days ago in the media made by an Hon. Member of Parliament of the Tamil National Alliance calling upon countries that are assisting Sri Lanka to suspend aid. "Stop aid", so says the Member of the Tamil National Alliance.

Last year, just before the Human Rights Council Meeting that was held in March this year, there was a delegation of the Tamil National Alliance that visited Washington. They had some meetings with the Department of State and one of the Members of the TNA on his return to Sri Lanka made a statement to the media. Believe it or not, it really happened. He said that the resolution that was moved against Sri Lanka was instigated by the TNA delegation. They spoke to the State Department and they persuaded the State Department to come up with that resolution against Sri Lanka.

Now, we have reports in the press that the Tamil National Alliance is proposing to visit Washington once more, and no doubt to work towards some further mischief when the Human Rights Council convenes in March this year. Now, I would like to ask, is this the way to sort out a problem? If the people of this country believe on reasonable grounds that if aid is stopped, resolutions are passed and problems arise with regard to trade and other relationships, all of this is manipulated, engineered and initiated by the Tamil National Alliance, does that help to bring about, to engender, an atmosphere which is conducive to resolving a problem, which this country to its great detriment, has had to live with for a very long time? So, who is obstructing a solution? I mean, you have to create circumstances that are conducive to forward movement with regard to so volatile a matter. Is the TNA really doing it or is it doing the exact opposite of that? It is a great pity that the Hon. R. Sampanthan, having delivered himself of all these condemnations and denunciations, does not even think it worthwhile to turn up here in the evening, as the Hon. Lakshman Kiriella has done, to listen to what the Government has to say in reply to his arguments.

I am conscious, Sir, of constraints with regard to time. Then, the Hon. Sajith Premadasa also raised some questions. The Hon. Sajith Premadasa is not somebody I would like to criticize, as an older person and as a person who has taught many people, I would like to say this. I do not think quotations in a speech are the main thing - to quote Adam Smith, Abraham Lincoln and so on. A man must construct his own speeches. You use quotations only to buttress what you say. I mean, quotations can be got from a thesaurus and they are available in Penguins and Pelicans. So, I do not think that that is the hallmark of a great speech. The late H.B. Perera, Queens Counsel, who sat on the Rhodes Scholarship Board when I was selected as a Rhodes Scholar of this country said, You can find authority for any proposition in some part of the world. The authority is not what matters". He always told his juniors, Argue from first principles, be clear and logical and then you will find that these principles can be supported by authority. So, I would like to say that - not in order to humiliate him, but simply as a word of advice - that that is not the best approach to the construction of speeches. He asked me and the Government to think out of the box. I would return the compliment and say that

2001 2002

he, in organizing his thinking on these matters, must act in a spirit of fidelity to his own advice.

Then, he stressed the principle of non-interference by countries in the internal activities of others. I do not think the Hon. Sajith Premadasa is aware of the history of the Human Rights Council. The Human Rights Council came into being because its predecessor, the Human Rights Commission, was thought to be profoundly unsatisfactory. The world community thought that the Human Rights Commission had been unduly politicized. The Human Rights Council is there to uphold and to maintain uniform standards against rich and poor, against big and small across the world, without distinction and without discrimination. That is the only respect, the only manner in which the international law can command the respect of humanity because international law, unlike domestic law or what is called municipal law, is not backed up by force. There are no prisons. There are no police officers. The only thing that it can rely on, the ultima ratio is moral persuasion. So, the world community felt that the Human Rights Commission had become unduly politicized. It all depends on who you were, how powerful you were and their whole attitude depended on their assessment of your clout, your influence. Therefore, the General Assembly of the United Nations took action to do away with the Human Rights Commission and to substitute for it the Human Rights Council, which is today the functioning instrument.

It is however a matter of empirical experience and a matter for deep regret, that the Human Rights Council has become even more politicized than its predecessor, the Human Rights Commission. Today, it is a matter of politics; it is a matter of countries getting together, groupings of countries, it is a question of who leads them, who has a clout to phone countries and say you vote in this particular way. You have a situation where 27 countries of the European Union vote in one way. Although privately they tell us that they do not agree but there is precious little they can do about it. Now, that is the reality of the situation. Of course, we have to work within the framework of that system, but, we have an obligation together with other countries, to try to do something constructive to reform that system. That is why, contrary to all the cynicism which was manifested in such liberal measure by speakers from the Opposition, Africa is important; Latin America is important; the CIS countries are important and the Gulf countries are important, because those are our natural allies in bringing about changes in the international order, which will serve in the long run, the cause of humanity.

The Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, in the course of his contribution, made a reference to sanctions. On behalf of the Government, I would associate myself unreservedly with that point of view. The whole problem about sanctions, - he spoke of sanctions, Sir - is that they can

never be accurately targeted. You aim at X and you hit A, B and C. Now, when sanctions are imposed on Iran, the economies of so many other countries are affected adversely. That is not an intended consequence but it has a foreseeable consequence. When sanctions are imposed against a country, it is usually the most vulnerable, the poorest that are affected both within that country and in other countries that have commercial relationships with the country against which sanctions are imposed. For those reasons, Sir, the Government fully agrees with the observations on that matter by the Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Presidents Counsel.

The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake spoke of India and presented this as a major disaster; that everything has gone wrong with India and that India, which was our friend, on ally and our supporter, has suddenly turned against us. I would like to remind him of his own observation, which I think is a correct observation, that domestic policy is the root of foreign policy. Foreign policy, in every substantial fairness, is an extension of domestic policy. We all know that the internal dynamics of the Indian situation dictated a certain course of action. Here is a question of timing: what was happing at that time, what was the Legislation, the Budget, relationships within India - the Centre and other States - those are the dynamics which dictated a certain course of action. Politicians, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, understand other politicians. Now, one swallow does not make a summer. How many times has India supported us? In the United Nations and in other multilateral fora, they have tended consistently to support us. This is the exception and not the rule. We understand the reasons why they acted on this solitary occasion as they did. But, it is a rich and full and a meaningful relationship. The largest number of tourists coming to this country come from India. Indian investment into this Island is very substantial. Trade with India has improved by 700 per cent since the Free Trade Agreement was entered into with India in 1998 and came into force in the year 2000. The newly elected Minister of External Affairs of India, His Excellency Salman Khurshid, who was kind enough to meet me within days of his appointment, in the midst of a particularly heavy schedule, assured me that from his own countrys point of view, the relationship with Sri Lanka is very crucial and that assurance was repeated in exactly the same emphatic terms by His Excellency Anand Sharma, Indias Minister of Industry, Commerce and Trade. We have an excellent relationship with India. How many Indian Ministers came to this country in a matter of six months? It was unprecedented. We had Kumari Selja; we had Anand Sharma and we had Jairam Ramesh. They all came here not because they did not have other things to do but because of the value, the inherent and the intrinsic value they attached to their bilateral relationships with Sri Lanka.

In the words there were many very just compliments that were paid to my distinguished predecessor, the late

2003 2004

all countries or in the vast majority of countries, it is more than seven years old. So, it is wrong to say that these people are having a whale of a time, unlimited money for entertainment, for housing; that is not the case at all.

The Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana asked about the situation regarding premises in Washington. I would like to tell the Hon. Ruwan Wijayawardhana that these are premises that were purchased way back in 1948, when the late Sir Claude Corea was our Permanent Representative in New York. In fact, my father served in that Mission for some time. This was way back in 1948. Now, there are 24 employees of that Mission. Those premises are simply not adequate. So, we have now come up with the policy of purchasing premises - if the Treasury has funds - one a year, in discussion with the Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, the Secretary to the Treasury and others because it is certainly a wise policy in the long-run instead of paying rent, as the rents are exorbitant. It is an investment. We cannot do it all at once. We do not have the resources but one at a time. Now, in Washington there was a considerable reduction in property prices. So, we made use of that. Some years ago we bought property in Pretoria in South Africa again making use of fluctuating market conditions. So, that is not an irresponsible act, it is not an extravagant act; it is an act that is intended to save money for this country and to serve its interest. So, those are the main points that I wanted to make, Sir.

It only remains for me to express my warm appreciation to all those who have made the work of my Ministry, both pleasant and productive. These are not things that any one person can do, whatever his commitment and whatever his ability. This is necessarily team work, Sir. It is team work which requires a team spirit. I know, myself, that sometimes officials of the Ministry are there at 7 oclock, at 8 oclock in the evening. If something needs to be done, they will be there. This is because of the time differences. When we are sleeping they are getting up on the other side of the Atlantic, on the West Coast. So, because of that, people do not stick to rigid time lines and I never had to force them to do it. They have done it spontaneously and with great goodwill. The Consular Affairs Section gets up at 6 oclock in the morning.

We work very closely with my Friend, the Hon. Dilan Perera because there has to be a symbiotic relationship between these two Ministries. One of Sri Lankas great strengths is our human resources. I would like to tell you Sir, that today, US Dollars 7 billion, that is, US Dollars 7,000 million, comes into the Sri Lankan Exchequer from Sri Lankans working abroad. It is one of the largest sources of revenue for Sri Lanka, hardly second to the money that is generated by the export of apparel products. It is a matter of great satisfaction that we have been able to serve these people - mainly the Hon. Dilan

2005 2006

Hon. Lakshman Kadiragamar. In the picturesque ways of the Hon. Lakshman Kadiragamar, the relationship between these two countries goes so back in time that it is lost in the mists of time. That was the colourful phrase that was used by the Hon. Lakshman Kadiragamar to portray the depth and the quality of the relationship between India and Sri Lanka.

The Hon. Vijitha Herath spoke of the need for a particular identity and focus in the development of a countrys foreign policy. I agree entirely with that point of view. That is why, Sir, after His Excellency the President brought the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies under the purview of my Ministry, I have invested a great deal of effort to develop the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies as a think tank which will serve the Ministry of External Affairs, presenting policy papers, options; that is material that we need very much to formulate and to apply a foreign policy that is suited to the needs of our time and a foreign policy that will serve the public of Sri Lanka.

The Hon. Rauff Hakeem and many other speakers referred to the very happy development in the United Nations with regard to Palestine. I want to say, Sir, every year that President Rajapaksa attended the UN General Assembly sessions in New York, without exception, he put in a paragraph in his speech about Palestine. And, he said that Sri Lanka fully supports the United Nations Resolution which goes back to 1948 advocating the two-State solution and the sanctity of the borders of the two States; the State of Palestine and the State of Israel. When I represented the President in New York this year, he told me specifically, "When you speak at the United Nations General Assembly, please remember to mention this point with all the emphasis that is possible". I did that and that was greatly appreciated by the President Mahmoud Abbas of Palestine. Then, Sir, I am about to conclude, I will not trespass on your time much longer.

I want to tell the Hon. Harin Fernando that it is not really in the best taste to make criticisms of public officers who do not have the right of reply here. If you criticize me, I have the right to reply. But, if you criticize Sri Lankas Ambassadors or High Commissioners abroad, they do not have the right to reply to you. So, it is not going to be my policy to comment on individuals. They are running a service, a professional service, and as their Minister, they have the right to expect my support in situations where they are unjustly criticized.

It was said that there is a great deal of waste; that is not the case. In fact, after discussions with His Excellency the President, I am about to submit, Sir, a Cabinet Paper which draws attention to the parlous state of the vehicles that are used by many of Sri Lankas envoys abroad. Some vehicles, Sir, are 13 years old. The Ambassadors vehicle in Brazil is 13 years old. In almost

Perera but with our support - and in situations where these people get into difficulties, sometimes very painful situations, we have been able to recover US Dollars 184 million last year to help them as a result of direct intervention.

Then, there was also some comment about professionalism. I do not know whether the people who made those criticisms are aware that last year, no fewer than 16 officers of the Ministry were sent for Masters' programmes. Skills development, you have to learn on the job. Nobody comes to a job fully prepared or fully equipped. We have done that. We took a new batch into the Ministry last year and we held an examination this year to take a further batch.

So, I would like Sir, as I conclude these remarks to pay my warm tribute to the officials of the Ministry headed by the Secretary, Karunatilaka Amunugama; I will not mention other individuals because it would be invidious but they have the warm appreciation of their Minister in carrying forward the foreign policy of this country at a particularly challenging and critical juncture in the countrys history. I also wish to thank very sincerely, Members on both sides of the House who made very constructive contributions to this Discussion.

I thank you Sir.

PUBLIC DEBT MANAGEMENT

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) , . I will quickly move the following Adjournment Motion:

One of the most important functions in running countrys economy is that you should be able to have your public debt manageable, affordable and repayable. The reason to take loans is to ensure the Government ambitiously embark upon capital intensive projects which are for the well-being of the people. However, if the borrowings are consumption-oriented and for corrupt projects then the country can head in for a debt crisis.

Budget deficits are also contributory factors to increase in public debt but fiscal policy should keep in mind good governance, poverty reduction and pro-development. Budget deficit to GDP is a very important tool of country that helps to measure overall public debt, the Government must have consistent policy of total public debt and should be reflected against GDP. However, we now see through letters exchanged with International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the 5th July, 2012 the budget deficit being given a new twist, the budget deficit of the Central Government and consolidated Government balance.

Therefore, will the Prime Minister explain:

1. As to why the Government is misleading the country and

international community by showing the budget deficit of 6.8 per cent in 2011, when actually in fact, it is 8.6 per cent.

2. What is the actual total public debt (foreign and local debt) as

at today?

3. What is the additional impact on to public debt owing to rupee

devaluation in year 2012 only?

4. What is the real foreign reserve as at today excluding debt

repayable (short and long)?

5. What is the revenue stream available to make payments for

capital amortization for the next three years? The Government policy of paying loans has been by taking new loans. Is this the basis or is it through generation of new revenue?

Sir, the necessity to bring in this Adjournment Motion was because the countrys economy is certainly in dire straits. That is not a reflective statement just because we are in the Opposition - that is the general impression created - but it manifests even in the Ministry of Finance and Planning itself. I may be subject to correction, Hon. Deputy Minister, but even the salaries of the officials of the Ministry of Finance and Planning had not been paid

2009 2010

on the given date. The Directors in the Ministry of Finance and Planning have still not been paid their salaries up to this particular moment. I would like that to be corrected if it is not correct. Therefore, it is in order to show the gravity of this situation, that this Adjournment Motion was brought in.

Sir, we are a developing country. We are trying to show the world how developed we are by using statistics. Our per capita is well beyond the actual, practical, achievable levels.

( ) (Mr. Speaker) Order, please! Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees will now take the Chair.

, .

, , .

Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES took the Chair.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) As of today, there is a very high degree of public debt. The public debt, which was at Rs. 1,784 billion on the 1st of January, 2005, is, as of today, 30th November, 2012 - it may be subject to correction - at Rs. 6,950 billion, to our knowledge. That is a giddy amount. Has there been reciprocal benefits to the country? These are the questions that we want to ask.

In the same process, while the budget deficit creates certain economic development, there is a necessity to finance that. The Budget deficit needs to be financed through new revenues and debt. If debt is used for public consumption, it is dangerous. But, if it is used for capital intensive projects or Capital Expenditure, which will give revenue for tomorrow, then it is in safe mode. But, is it happening today? There is duplication of Capital Expenditure. Sir, I will leave that aside.

Then, I would like to ask one very salient question. Institutions that are under the Central Government have been classified by a letter written by your predecessor, the Hon. Gitanjana Gunawardena and Dr. Ajith Nivard Cabraal on the 5th of July, 2012. It reclassifies the real public debt of the country. They basically classified consolidated debt and the Central Government debt. What does that mean? Are we a federal country? We are a unitary country where the Central Government bears the responsibility of all acts that go down. Sir, I, at this

particular moment, once again seek your approval to table* page 17 of that letter written on the 5th of July, 2012. I do not read it out because of the time factor.

The IMF accepted a letter sent by you where the budget deficit was shown, not as 8.6 per cent but as 6.8 per cent of GDP. This figure was read out even by the Minister of Finance and Planning, His Excellency the President, in this House. Is that not a distortion? The total public debt comes under the Central Government, irrespective of whether those institutions come under it or not. We are not a federal Government. So, we ask you, Hon. Deputy Minister, to inform this House as to why this reclassification has taken place. Is it just to dupe the investors? Is it to dupe the lenders? When the real budget deficit in 2011 was 8.6 per cent of GDP, why was it mentioned as 6.8 per cent of GDP? These are questions that we beg to ask.

On the same basis, today there are a lot of contingent liabilities that are coming up. The hedging deal is one such thing, where we have to pay US Dollars 77 million to the Deutsche Bank. There is another US Dollars 162 million owed tothe Standard Chartered Bank, which is being negotiated. We were lucky that we managed to bail ourselves out on the Citibank issue but it has been appealed, I am informed. All these tantamount to the high public debt.

In the meantime, in 2010, the IMF wanted to look into two public institutions: the CEB and the Petroleum Corporation. When they gave the loan in June, 2009, they very specifically wanted these two institutions to show no losses from athe year 2010. But, it did not happen. Once again, Sir, I would like to get your approval to table* this letter dated 19th June, 2010.

I quote from page No. 3 of the letter. Beyond 2010, we remain committed to further fiscal consolidation in terms of the broad framework stipulated in the Fiscal Management Responsibility Act (FMRA) to reduce the budget deficit. We have thus set a fiscal deficit target of 6.8 per cent for 2011......" That is, under the Central Government. I am not referring to the consolidated debt.

"....and 5 per cent for 2012,.. None of these targets have been achieved. Once again, the IMF has accepted the importance of the consolidated debt. That is what they are looking at and that is why they have said that institutions such as the CEB, which is running today at a loss of Rs. 105 billion, the Petroleum Corporation, which is running at a loss of Rs. 86 billion

clarified because the Directors called me and said We, in the Ministry of Finance and Planning, are yet to be paid our salaries. The junior officers were paid their salaries only two days ago.

Sir, I wind up leaving my Motion to be seconded by the Hon. R. Yogarajan.

( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) The reason why I talked about it is that the IMF zeroed in on the CPC, the CEB -

Public sector public corporations . , public corporations . CPC CEB .

and the SriLankan Airlines, which is having a lavish operation of their own, losing Rs. 19 billion, have to be brought into this budget deficit. If that is the case, the budget deficit in the year 2012 would not be in the range of 7 per cent, but roughly in the range of 8.2 per cent of GDP.

So, I would like the Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning, with his experience, to guide this House to the actual public debt that is prevalent. The impact of the devaluation or the reduction of the value of the rupee that took place in 2012 - from 10th February, 2012, it slid from Rs. 113 to Rs. 134 - had an increase of Rs. 85 billion in public debt. These are matters of a macro nature that needs to be looked at. Answer as to how such public debt could be borne by the country. The public debt per capita has increased from Rs. 102,000 in 2005 to Rs. 343,000 today. Is this something sustainable? So, these are matters that we would like to hear about from you, considering the fact that the savings in this country are reducing by the day.

Let me once again table* a document which gives the savings of a number of countries compared to the GDP, taken from the ADB Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific (2012).

In China, it is 52.3 per cent, in India, 32.3 per cent, in Malaysia, 39.5 per cent, in Indonesia, 36.4 per cent and in Vietnam, 28.3 per cent while in little Sri Lanka, our motherland, it is 15.4 per cent, at this particular moment.

I guess the country is taking on certain things that are of a duplicative nature like the Hambantota Port, which has operated only 20 ships in 25 months and which is a complete constraint on the Colombo Harbour, which has lost out Rs. 7 billion owing to the fact that they have got to pay the interest and the capital on behalf of the Hambantota Port.

Sir, how many minutes more have I got? ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Only a minute. ( ) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) So, I will allow the Motion to be seconded by the Hon. R. Yogarajan.

Finally, I would greatly appreciate it if these matters are looked into. The officers of the Ministry of Finance and Planning are yet to be paid their salaries. Get that
