PREVENTION OF USING IMAGES OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES [2.25 p.m.] / / / / / / / / ( +1) (The Hon. Ravi Karunanayake) I move, That this Parliament resolves that all religions must equally be respected and that images of Lord Buddha, Jesus Christ, Lord Shiva or Prophet Mohammed should not be used on any commercial advertisement or any other form of non religious items. Hon. Speaker, the reason why I basically moved this Motion is for nothing else but because we are a multiracial, multi-religious country. This is a Buddhist country as enshrined in the Constitution. But, as much as it is a Buddhist country, Christianity, Islam and Hinduism also play a pivotal role. When we gained Independence in 1948 and prior to gaining Independence,

517 518



one of the most important reasons for the Rt. Hon. D.S. Senanayake to gain Independence was to ensure that what we get from the British must be enshrined and used in a better manner, so that we are able to respect all religions and all communities and ensure that we have a better Sri Lankan society. With the same spirit, Sir, I bring in this Motion today, at a time when everything is being commercialized, when parents are being commercialized, religion being commercialized is a very small matter. So, I thought it was my bounden duty to look into this because innocent people come and ask us as to why religion is being politicized, commercialized et cetera. So, I thought I will bring up this matter through a Private Members Motion and I am sure we will get the support across the Divide to ensure that we have a better moral value and good effect that will be taken forward. Hon. Speaker, as I said, we are a multi-religious, multiracial country. In that spirit, every religion must be respected. There was an article which appeared in the Lankadeepa newspaper of 1st August, 2012, which stated that in the recent past, some foreigners had gone and tried to take photographs in front of the statue of Lord Buddha. That had been highlighted by some people and it was stopped. But, by that time it was commercialized and finished; they had taken photographs, gone to the website and done various things. I do not think this type of thing should be permitted at all in a country. "f" ? R, u % I 8 N 4 c   L =.  @~? R. W?  = . /  /V =, L 8_ yR cX =. Then, there was another article which appeared in The Island newspaper in June, 2012, with regard to this. I think with the assistance of certain important officials in Beruwala, they have stopped the sale of shoes with Lord Buddha's image. This is a despicable act. This should not be allowed to happen. This is not something which you gain a momentary thrill or some money out of it but this basically impinges into the social behaviour of people. / %, ? ? R, Stop sale of shoes with Buddha image, =. This was something that had basically come to Sri Lanka from a "Tibetan" style operation. / %, R,  R  L 8_ =? c .  %M = .   4 8 N 4 c X  )5 4 c . I take it from the Christian point of view. There again, you have photographs of Jesus Christ like "Jesus Christ Super Star" and various other things. Now, "The Last

Supper" - all this, once again tries to bring hatred into one religion through another. So, as much as we condemn activities which bring disrespect to Buddhism in this country, it should be the same for even Christianity. So, I request the Ministry of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs to look into these types of things and ensure that they bring in a permanent solution to this because I can see that they basically make commercial sales out of these. Now, that websites are there and anybody can do anything, you know taking a photograph in order to get Rs. 50 or Rs. 100 is a major thing for the uneducated or the unemployed young people. So, I guess these are areas that we should bring some moral turpitude and necessary legislation in order to ensure that such crimes are punishable. Then, Sir, as I mentioned before, in certain Chinese restaurants in Sri Lanka, which are not owned by Sri Lankans but BOI companies with Chinese, they have printed "Laughing Buddha" on the menu card. But, these are things that should not be permitted. I think not only in Sri Lanka but nowhere should it be permitted. There is no necessity for it at all. Then, Sir, there are many other things, for example, in Chinese restaurants, there is a soup named, Buddha jumps over the wall. Sir, I am only trying to show that these type of things are not good for the overall body and the religious activities of this country. Sir, recently throughout the world there was a huge uproar on the film, Innocence of Muslims by Nakoula Basseley - if I have pronounced it incorrectly, maybe there are Muslim Members here to correct me - which was an anti-Islamic film brought in to insult the religion. There were certain DVDs also that were brought into this country of these types of things and sales were done. So, I think this should be stopped by the Customs and necessary legislation should be brought in. This is not like certain political parties breaking mosques and then doing elections. That is a different matter. I am talking from a religious point of view. When the mosque was broken, a political party used that and made big posters in order to get the fundamentalist factor vote on to that problem. I do not condone those types of things. That has nothing to do with this. This is only using religion from a commercial point of view, not from a political point of view. This is an area, I thought, which drew world attention. As a matter of fact, even the producer of this film, I think, is in custody at the moment. So, if a country like that can do certain things, little Sri Lanka can also very well attune itself in order to ensure that there is religious tolerance in this country. Likewise, Sir, in Hinduism, I basically was unable to find anything specific. But, I also see certain areas where images of Lord Shiva, Lord Ganesh and Lord Vishnu

have been done. So, ensure that those type of things are also stopped. My entire exercise in bringing in this Private Members' Motion, in a multi-religious, multiracial society, is to ensure that people have the right to profess any religion they want as well as respect every religion that is there and ensure that we have a much cleaner image and a much more tolerable religious atmosphere in this country.

Sir, and I look forward to the support of the entire Parliament to ensure that this is legislated and passed on to the Ministry of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs to ensure that necessary legislations are put into place.

Hon. Speaker, my good Friend, the Hon. Ravi Karunanayake states in his Motion that images of Lord Buddha, Jesus Christ, Lord Shiva or Prophet Mohammed should not be used on any commercial advertisement or any other form of non religious items. As far as Islam is concerned, it forbids the use of any figures or images of the Holy Prophet of Islam, Sallallahu 'Alaihi Wa Sallam. Therefore, if anybody cites a figure or an image as being of Prophet Mohammed, it is bogus. Sir, this is a timely Motion moved by my good Friend. I must also place on record that it is due to the generosity of the Government, at your request, that this Motion is now debated in the House. Otherwise, normally, according to the Standing Orders, when the Mover of the Motion does not turn up, the Motion lapses. My Friend is so much used to doing this in the mornings, during Question Time and perhaps, he wants to follow the same this time also. Anyway, that apart, as far as Sri Lanka is concerned, I should say that we profess in various faiths: Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, certain Jainism and other religions. So, we totally disagree and vehemently oppose these religious leaders being brought to ridicule. This is the pastime of the Western world fully backed by the Zionists movement, which is anti-human in its origin and nature.

Sir, the other day when I walked into the Library, our Librarian, Mr. C. Kuruppu, told me that somebody has told him that presently in the "YouTube " - I do not know whether you have seen it, Hon. Ravi Karunanayake - there are certain naked and half-naked women embracing the statues of Lord Buddha. I do not know whether the Ministry of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs has taken action on that. If not, forthwith you should go into that and protest against it. The whole world, even the American President Barrack Obama rightly or wrongly has asked the "YouTube" to remove these things. The "YouTube" has become part and parcel of their blood vessels. Without the "YouTube", they cannot exist. Sir, we must also recall that in 1977, when the late Hon. A.C.S. Hameed was the Minister of Foreign Affairs, he went to the United Nations. Somebody there had brought him a mug from a pub with the picture of Lord Buddha. He straightaway took up the matter with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and sent his report to Sri Lanka. There was a mass protest and that was withdrawn. Sir, likewise, there is this movie, Innocence of Muslims also in the "YouTube," their blood vessel or their oxygen, I should say. If that oxygen is not there, they will not live for a moment, perhaps they will die. Innocence of Muslims is also a part and parcel of the vilification of religions. Sir, we respect our Prophet, Sallallahu 'Alaihi Wa Sallam, more than our life. The Quran says that. We are asked to say: "Sallallahu Ala Muhammad, Sallallahu 'Alaihi Wasallam Sallallahu Ala Muhammad, Ya' Rabbi Salli Alaihi Wasallim" So, nobody can erase from our mind the respect that we give to our Prophet, Sallallahu 'Alaihi Wa Sallam. I should tell you about another incident. When Dr. T.B. Jayah, as the Leader of the All-Ceylon Muslim League -you know him very well and his life story also - was presiding at the Working Committee Meeting of the All- Ceylon Muslim League and I was a teenage Member of the Working Committee at that time, a Muslim pavement hawker brought a basin from the Pettah pavement and said, There is a picture like this. I do not know what to do". He was frightened to sell it. Dr. T.B. Jayah straightaway ran up to the Hon. A.P. Jayasuriya, who was the Minister of Home Affairs at that time, discussed the matter and got the basin withdrawn from all the pavement hawkers. That is the way people who respect religion behave. The Zionists in the West have no concern for religions at all and they stand condemned in the eyes of humanity and the civilized world. There is a fine article written in the "+. "

% :11 ) : 19 % 01 - 14.

"Innocence of Muslims" "   ". We must carefully analyse this and see why one should not get provoked by others. If somebody blackguards me and I look the other side and say, "That fellow is only capable of that", it ends there. If I go to fight with him, that never ends. Here it states, I quote: "Innocence of Muslims"    "  "You Tube"  & () &  (+ , - -./ 1 -./+ 2 3 4,   71 +. "2   - (Trailer) -./  - 8- + ): )+ - ).  ;< (+   7+(+.

Therefore, all right-thinking people in the civilized world - we are so - the Asians and particularly the Sri Lankans are a proud nation and we respect our religious leaders and our religions; we follow the religious precepts of all religions; we send a message, a warning to the Western world to stop this nonsense. Otherwise, humanity will turn against you. Thank you, Sir.

I must accept the fact that was mentioned by the Hon. Azwer. He mentioned about - I am sorry; it was an oversight on my part - a photograph that should not be used in an Islamic area, which I should know better because my wife is also a Muslim. Irrespective of that, I am saying this in good spirit, that all religions must be treated alike. That was what was expected of it and I did not want to leave any religion out of it. The most important fact mentioned by the Hon. Sri Ranga was that we have just finished the ethnic war and we should not, in any way, trespass into an area which

would lead to a religious war like what is going on in Syria and Bahrain, where an incalculable amount of damage is being done. Therefore, we must step forward in the right direction. Let me also state this. While commercialization is bad, politicization is even worse. As I mentioned before - Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara is present here - take for instance, the situation that arose during the election time in the Eastern Province. A Mosque was damaged in some other area and certain political parties took advantage of it. I must say that the Government should be very firm on such incidents. Certain Government MPs stood up and fought against such fundamental political parties but after everything was over, they resorted back to the same old game. These are matters which are bad for the body politics of a country and it is worse, taking religion into the body politics. That is what should be eradicated from our society. As it was stated by the Hon. Sri Ranga, the late Hon. (Dr.) Colvin R. de Silva once stated, Two languages - one country; one language - two countries. That should be the basis on which we should act upon. Buddhism is given the foremost place in the country and it is enshrined in the Constitution but that does not mean that you preclude any other religion. So, I hope you would fortify the relevant areas by embracing all these facts. / %, f  R . / %, % _ yR I , _ N } R } M T?, T? /)_ 10= R =.  / 1  11 R/  .  R . )   1f, 1f _ N } , i _ N = a  R . c }1 ~ X M  m R %  L 8_ ~ .   , T _ N [ R %X. ) X t?  _,  8( j,  _ N _ N } } i  =.  1 T K/ L  % =  N / R N % .

Since we are talking about three languages, Sir, I would like to table* this Motion in the Sinhala and Tamil languages so that this will benefit all communities living in the country. Today, there is a Presidential Task Force for a Trilingual Sri Lanka, established under the guidance and leadership of His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The Chairman of this Presidential Task Force for a Trilingual Sri Lanka is the Secretary to the President, Mr. Lalith Weeratunga and the Vice-Chairman is Mr. Sunimal Fernando. They have drawn up a comprehensive programme for this. Sir, today we are on the threshold of becoming an advanced nation in the world, linguistically and intellectually. I should stress upon that fact because linguistically, we are bound together and intellectually, our country is about 99 per cent literate. (  ) (Mr. Speaker) Order, please!  1 f / %c R p R.

Whereupon MR. SPEAKER left the Chair, and MR. DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES [THE HON. MURUGESU CHANDRAKUMAR] took the Chair. / _ / _ / _ / _ ... . . .     (  '4 .". . 7) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, we are marching forward in every sphere. On the one hand, economically we are advancing, the country is developing, and on the other, linguistically and in other fields of academic sphere, we are advancing to a great extent, so much so, we are an example to most other countries not only in Asia but to the whole world. Sir, this Trilingual scheme was inaugurated by none less a person of the calibre of Dr. Abdul Kalam, former President of India. Dr. Kalam is one of the most distinguished scientists of India with the unique honour of receiving honorary doctorates from 30 universities and institutions. He has been awarded the coveted civilian award - Padma Bhushan in 1981 and Padma Vibhushan in 1990 and the highest civilian award Bharat Ratna in 1997. He is the recipient of several other awards and a Fellow of many professional institutions. It is such a distinguished, globally-accepted figure who came and inaugurated this trilingual policy of Sri Lanka at the function held at "Temple Trees" under the Presidentship of His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa. There, he said so many things about Sri Lanka. He has given many interviews to the newspapers and said that he came to Sri Lanka in order to promote a great State. "The Sunday Observer of 22nd January, 2012 states under the heading Trilingual initiative will lead to peace and harmony. He expounded that thought. This article states, I quote: The former President, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, will embark on a mission to promote peace, harmony and prosperity for all societal constituents in Sri Lanka and propagate an agenda for an inclusively developed nation. Then, the correspondent posed a question, which the article further states as follows, I quote: How significant is the Trilingual Initiative and what kind of a change do you think it can bring about in Sri Lanka? Abdul Kalam: This initiative has to be a start for inclusive growth in Sri Lanka. This initiative will enable the students to learn their subjects better in their mother tongue. For example, I learnt in my mother tongue, Tamil up to tenth class.

He was born in South India. It further states:

Also, it can bring cultural and civilisational unity. Above all, the individual languages can enrich each other.

That is the idea that he propounded in Sri Lanka and I think the President and others who were involved in the project have given the correct lead, Sir. As I said, Mr. Lalith Weeratunga was a very distinguished old boy of Royal College of the 90th batch and one of his batchmates, my good Friend, A.F. Sameer Effendi - according to his ancestry, he relates himself to the Ottoman Empire - said, Mr. Lalith Weeratunga has been very consistent from his school days and was very talented and able in whatever subject he tackled. _ T , T  ? =

The Daily News of 20th April, 2012 under the caption President responding to peoples wishes through Trilingual SL states, I quote: .according to the school census data shown in it, there were only 1562 teachers teaching Tamil as a second language and 536 teachers teaching Sinhala as a second language in the whole public school system, even though the system would need 23,000 trained teachers to teach Tamil to Sinhala students and Sinhala to Tamil students in the country.

That is what is being found out now.

The article reports as Mr. Fernando having further said, I quote:

" 'The task of the Public Administration Ministry would be to evolve a Trilingual public service at all levels of administration while it would be the responsibility of National Languages and Social Integration Ministry to provide language learning facilities for public servants, judiciary, the security services and the general public throughout the country. In this daunting task, state-of-the-art teaching skills, curricular, training and translation skills and material resources must be accessed and provided'......" " 'The broad objective of the 10 year national plan was to spur the country within the next 10 years towards a Trilingual society in which all people would be conversant in Sinhala, Tamil and English. Sinhala and Tamil would be the languages of discourse and discussion and English would be a life skill for accessing information and technology from the outside world and for qualifying our people for employment in the global society' .......

This type of trilingual schools are not found even in India. They may have separate mediums of instructions, but now there are Sinhala schools in most parts of the villages, to which Tamils and Muslims also attend. If Sinhalese schools separately teach English, the Tamils and the Muslims would not be benefited and vice versa. Therefore, I think these schools must be brought together in certain areas. Cluster them together and teach all three languages, so that in future you would have a full-fledged citizen who would understand the aspirations of the other communities and would respect other communities unlike the Zionists and the Western world - as I told you earlier in the Motion - where they vilify religion and culture. They do not have any culture at all. So, these schools must be clustered together and all three languages must be taught. Now, look at our Parliament. We are a model unto all Parliaments in the world. I speak in all three languages simultaneously. Sometimes, I feel sorry for our good interpreters because I switch, as the occasion demands, from Sinhala to Tamil and from Tamil to English. They are doing a very efficient service. Similarly, the Hansard Reporters write in all three languages and the script is ready the following day for printing. They both are the best in the world! In Lok Sabha, it is not so. It takes months and months. Nowhere, not in any State Assembly in India, do you find this arrangement. Therefore, we are a model unto Asia; we are a model unto the great Bharatha Nadu, as far as the use of languages and the assimilation of culture are concerned. I must pay tribute to the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, an original Trotskyite and a progressive Socialist, who propounded this idea much earlier in his political life and is carrying on a vigorous campaign. He has started, even in Parliament, classes in Tamil. I think soon - we have got notice from the Secretary-General - a class will be conducted in English as well. In other countries, people are in darkness without knowing the other person's linguistic skills and they, therefore, know not how to respect other cultures and the religious feelings of others. Even in this respect, we can give a lead to the whole world: follow Sri Lanka in trilingualism; you would be a developed nation! Sir, the other day, from your area, Jaffna, the Parameswara College cricketers came to the Ananda College, Colombo. They stayed in Colombo for three days and played a cricket match. Mind you, Sir, I think this must be told aloud: after 30 years, a Tamil boy has come into interaction with a Sinhalese boy. All these days,  .  .

Vasudeva Nanayakkara to pursue this policy vigorously. Hon. Minister, you are doing one of the greatest services in modern Sri Lanka. The other day, Mr. Sunimal Fernando had a workshop at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike International Hall, and I too happened to be there. Even Dr. (Mrs.) Nirmala Chandrahasan, the daughter of the late Tamil leader, Dr. E.M.V. Naganathan, came all the way from Geneva and attended that. She is the wife of Mr. Chandrahasan, the son of the late "Thanthai", the Hon. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam. This is the way that we are going to progress. But, what do the Tamil leaders do? I am very sorry that they are not here even to say something about the Tamil Language when we are discussing about it. The Tamil Language is flourishing in Sri Lanka more than anywhere else, even more than in Tamil Nadu, I should say. All the Tamil books that are published in Tamil Nadu are brought to the Colombo Tamil Sangam in Wellawatta and they had been released on several occasions. 9A  "   . 9 2"1  9 A " . 9 " 8 1< 1 - 1;  " -. , 9 2  - 7 "2 9A2 .

When marching forward into the future as a single people, it is my view that the Sinhala and Tamil-speaking people should engage with one another in each others language. That was the sterling call by His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa when he launched the Ten-year National Plan on 14th Februar, 2009. Now, Sir, there is a comprehensive Ten-year National Plan for a Trilingual Sri Lanka which was presented to the nation. I am privileged to obtain a copy of it from Mr. Lalith Weeratunga, the Secretary to the President and also the President of the Task Force. Sir, it behoves me to mention my good friend, Lalith Weeratunga, who hailed from the Royal College, Colombo 61-Group and

presently, the Secretary to His Excellency the President Mahinda Rajapaksa. My good friend, M.F. Sameer Efendi, who was a batchmate of Mr. Weeratunga, opines that Mr. Weeratunga has been consistent in his sustained efforts to uphold and establish the National Strategic Framework for a Trilingual Sri Lanka. When such a sublime concept, with the passage of time, turns into reality, it is the country as a whole, which would integrate its citizens to a closer understanding and harmony amongst those very individuals who are now recovering and emerging from the aftermath of the terrible conflict of civil war. Lalith has been a bulwark in this vitally important ten-year national project, which in fruition, will dawn on a nation that the Sinhala and Tamil youths will integrate in perfect consonance with what is envisaged in this isle, transforming it into the Wonder of Asia. ?  =>  X  R . t j L  /u  ?  BX. Implementing the Sister School Programme for a Trilingual Sri Lanka shaped to exchange teachers and students on short-term exposure by linking individual schools in majority Sinhala-speaking areas with Tamil-medium schools should be seriously addressed by the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration and also, as the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara said, by the Ministry of Culture and the Arts. Now, Sir, I must place on record my deep appreciation of the brilliant speech made by one of our greatest, distinguished scholars, the Hon. J.R.P. Sooriyapperuma - %c%c%c%c R R R R (I1,    ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Azwer, please wind up now.

%c%c%c%c R R R R (I1,    ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The one hour allotted to your Motion is over. So, please wind up. / _ / _ / _ / _ ... . . .     ( '4 .". . 7) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) I will wind up soon, Sir.

The Hon. J.R.P. Sooriyapperuma has a deep knowledge of Buddhism. Also at the same time, we must listen to him as he ventures out to wax eloquent on Islamic civilization and history. Sir, I also must thank the Hon. Ajith P. Perera for the valuable suggestions made. The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara's reply was comprehensive and very encouraging. I think we are forging ahead with him as the Minister of National Languages and Social Integration to build a united Sri Lanka. Then, before I conclude, Sir, I must tell you something as it is my duty. Yesterday, when you were presiding - it is reported in today's Thinakkural newspaper - a death threat was issued to me in this House. The newspaper states, I quote: " ?  ... .."

"   ! " # & ,  ! (   ) .. ,-  !   01" @ '.' + ( +  D ,. If that is a threat, Sir - I consider it not as a veiled threat - it is against another Parliamentarian, a citizen of this country. Sir, if such a thing happens, I think I must warn Parliament as to who should be held responsible. I will bring this to the notice of the security forces and the Hon. Speaker as well. And, Sir, you also must take action. All in all, today has been a very happy day in my life, as I told you, because I was able to promote national unity, integration and harmony and to express my opinion on how we can live in a united Sri Lanka happily hereafter. Thank you.
