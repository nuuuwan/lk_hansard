( ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Harsha De Silva) I will continue. Hon. Member, I am not scared of you telling me not to speak my mind. I have not brought disgrace to anyone. I said and I will repeat, Pradeep Kariyawasam is the lawful wedded husband of the Chief Justice.

( ) ( - , ) (The Hon. Douglas Devananda - Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development) I propose that the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer do now take the Chair.

, . . Question put, and agreed to.

, ... .

, , ... . Whereupon MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER left the Chair, and THE HON. ALHAJ A.H.M. AZWER took the Chair. [2.58 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Hon. Presiding Member, we are discussing an Order pertaining to a Strategic Development Project, in this instance, a coal-based power plant to be started on a Build, Own and Operate basis and to be situated at Sampur, an ancient Tamil village in the Trincomalee District. I believe the Order is brought to Parliament because the project will be entitled to certain tax exemptions and Parliament sanction is required for those exemptions to be granted.

My primary concern, Sir, is that this project is being located in Sampur. I do not find the Hon. Deputy Minister here. In fact, I was hoping that the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, the Minister of Economic Development, would be here but unfortunately he is not here and his Deputy Minister, who moved the Motion, is also not to be seen in the House. Nevertheless, Sir, I would like to place on record what needs to be placed.

The area in which this project is to be sited is an area from which a large number of Tamil families - I have given the particulars in Parliament before - have been displaced and we have assurances given by the Government in that regard to both the Supreme Court and on the Floor of this House when a Debate took place sometime ago in October, 2011. The Hon. Basil Rajapaksa gave me the assurance - it is contained in

Hansard of 21st October, 2011 - that those people will be resettled in Sampur, and apart from the land required for the power plant, on all other land people can be resettled. There are people in a number of villages who have got to be resettled in that area called Sampur. Now, six months have gone since that assurance was given to me on the Floor of this House, but the assurance has not been implemented.

We have not raised objections to the power plant because we appreciate that power is required for the countrys development, though in fact there are concerns about pollution and so on and so forth. But, still we have not raised objections. The fact remains that in terms of the assurance given to the Supreme Court and on the Floor of this House by the Minister concerned that people must be resettled on the lands from which they were displaced and there is plenty of land available there for the Power Plant to be sited and also for people to be resettled.

In fact, I might mention to you, Sir, that recently I had the good opportunity of meeting with Mr. M.M.C. Ferdinando, Secretary, Ministry of Power and Energy and Chairman and Director-General of the Board of Investment, who is virtually in charge of this project on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka. I have found my discussion with him extremely encouraging and I found in him a very upright, frank, transparent public servant who told me that there was a proposal to start a heavy industrialized zone in this area. But then, there was a meeting held under the chairmanship of the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa and when this matter came up, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa had ruled that apart from the land required for the coal power plant, apart from the land identified for the coal power plant, all other lands must be returned to the displaced people and they must be settled on those lands. I was extremely happy to hear that from Mr. Ferdinando and I have written to both the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa, Minister of Economic Development and Mr. M.M.C. Ferdinando, Secretary, Ministry of Power and Energy and Chairman and Director-General of Board of Investment confirming my conversation with him in the course of which he assured me that the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa had ruled, as the Minister of Economic Development, that apart from the land required for the Coal Power Plant, on all of the land in that area people can be resettled and people should be resettled.

Unfortunately, it is not happening. I am tabling* Sir, these two letters and I would be grateful if you would kindly initial them and have them included in Hansard.

265 266

* . * . * Produced at end of speech.

Unfortunately, sometime ago, a couple of months ago, the food being given to these people was stopped. I met the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa and asked him why the food has been stopped. In my presence, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa phoned the Commissioner-General of Essential Services, spoke to him and told him to resume the supply of food to these people. That happened about three months ago. But thus far, the resumption has not commenced.

There are some people at the local level, Sir, the Governor and the Government Agent, who seem to be having a policy different from that of the Government. I think those people are the impediment to the resettlement of these people in Sampur despite the Government's assurances that the people can be resettled. Despite the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa giving an order to the Commissioner-General of Essential Services that food supply must be resumed, that has not happened for three months because the Governor and the Government Agent at the local level have got their own agenda. They want to starve these people and compel them to go to some other place of their choice and not stay here. Are they working in tandem with anybody else contrary to the Government policy, contrary to the assurances that the Minister of Economic Development had given this Parliament on a Question raised by me that the people can be resettled?

This must stop, Sir. And, now the monsoon is going to set in. I went to the camp recently. I found the people suffering and undergoing immense deprivation. This is their ancient village where they have lived for generations and centuries. This is one of the most ancient Tamil villages in the whole of the country.

People want to go back and live there, people want to get back to their lands. The Government is prepared; we can identify the land for the Coal Power Plant and all other lands can be given to the people. There is plenty of land available but somebody is stopping it, somebody is preventing it. Now, the monsoon is setting in, rains are coming and the people there are living in temporary hovels, they are living under tarpaulins. They have lived like this for five years. Five years have gone by. In fact, immediately after they were displaced, nobody less than the President said, We had to displace these people because we had to take charge of the territory which was under LTTE control. Now that it is no longer under LTTE control people can go back, but they have still not been able to go back.

I do not know whether the Deputy Minister has come back. I want him or at least some other Hon. Member here to kindly convey my concerns to the Minister of Economic Development and inform him that these people should not be allowed to suffer any longer, that these people must return to their lands, they must be resettled and they must be given their food which has

been stopped. The Hon. Minister has ordered the Commissioner-General of Essential Services to supply the food, but the food is not being given. Who is doing this? The Minister states one thing in Parliament; a diametrically opposite thing is being done on the ground. Why are the Governor and the Government Agent doing this? At whose behest are they doing it? Are they working for some other government? Are they working on the basis of a different policy? Are they working on the basis of a different agenda? If that be so, whose policy is that? Whose agenda is that, we need to know? This cannot continue, Mr. Presiding Member.

The Governor and the Government Agent have been there for far too long. The Governor is a person against whom are all the Ministers in the Provincial Council. The Chief Minister is a Tamil, the other Tamil Minister, the Muslim Minister and the Sinhalese Minister, all unanimously resolved that the Governor must be removed because he does not respect them. That man is being kept there and now he has been reappointed as the Governor for the Eastern Province. The Government Agent has been there for the past six years. No Government Agent remains in a district for more than three years. He has been kept there for the past six years. Why is he being kept there for so long? Is he being kept there to fulfil an agenda? Is he being kept there for a certain purpose? Are you going to bring about reconciliation to this country on this basis? You are talking about reconciliation. How can you bring about reconciliation when this type of a blatantly unjust thing is happening, when the Government is behaving so capriciously and so arbitrarily?

So, these are the points I want to mention, Sir, in regard to this matter. This cannot go on, this must stop. I want to appeal to the Government and even though the Minister of Economic Development is not here, I want to appeal to his deputy that these concerns of mine be conveyed to the Hon. Minister.

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) The Minister of Power and Energy is here.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Since you are here Hon. Minister of Power and Energy, I want you to kindly convey to the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa that these people must not be allowed to suffer any longer. This is unacceptable, this is intolerable and these people must be resettled in their lands in Sampur at the earliest. I am prepared to extend the Government my maximum co-operation to settle this matter. We want the matter resolved and I want this conveyed to the Hon. Minister of Economic Development.

Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The Adjournment Motion to be moved by the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah.

, REBUILDING OF LIVES OF WAR-AFFECTED TAMILS IN NORTH AND EAST [3.35 p.m.]

. ( . . ) (The Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I move the following Adjournment Motion: Whereas three years have elapsed since the end of the armed conflict in the country; And Whereas several hundred thousand Tamils and others have been displaced from their original places of residence in the North and East during the period the said armed conflict raged; And Whereas throughout the armed conflict particularly during the final stages of the armed conflict tens of thousands of Tamil civilians were killed or maimed - several hundreds of thousands of Tamil civilians were displaced, their houses and other assets

destroyed and they were rendered destitute and who have not been able to recommence their lives with basic facilities; And Whereas large numbers of those persons are still prevented from returning to their original homes and to their lands and resuming their livelihood activities/occupation; And Whereas since the letting of violence, a large number of Tamils have fled from Sri Lanka and become migrants or sought refuge in other countries, all over the world, particularly in India, and who wish to return to Sri Lanka and their original places in the North and East; And Whereas no conducive atmosphere has been created yet for the refugees in India or others to return to the North and East in Sri Lanka; And Whereas there is no structured programme of action to address the urgent and essential needs of this large number of affected people to enable these people to rebuild their lives; And Whereas there are several actions by the State and its Agencies and others with political influence, pertaining to civilian administration, land, to places of religious worship, to cultural places, to development activities and to other areas of importance to the affected Tamil people, harmful to genuine reconciliation and the future well-being of these people in territories which they have historically inhabited; It is urged that urgent steps be taken;

(i) To expeditiously evolve an acceptable political solution that addresses the core causes of the conflict, and vest political power in the people of the North and East;

(ii) That a structured programme be implemented urgently to enable the displaced and affected people to meaningfully rebuild and recommence their lives;

(iii) That immediate action be taken to reverse, rectify and redress, the several actions that have adverse political economic social and cultural consequences to the Tamil people and thereby impedes genuine and meaningful reconciliation.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) , Hon. R. Yogarajan to second the Adjournment Motion. [4.05 p.m.] . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, on behalf of the United National Party, I am pleased to second the Adjournment Motion moved by the Hon. Mavai S. Senathirajah of the TNA.

I second this Adjournment Motion without any hesitation because they have remained so patient for three years before they brought a Motion of this nature in this House asking that people be resettled, rehabilitated and be given their political rights. They have been very patient for three years and this patience itself has to be commended. The Tamil people of the North and the East very patiently fought for 30 years for their political rights in a peaceful manner. When they failed, the youth of the North and the East took over and there was a war again for another 30 years. Still, this nation which became independent has not given a fair deal to the people of the North and the East. It is very sad. Even after 30 years of war, if the people in this country do not realize that they have to treat their brothers who speak Tamil in a fair manner, then that means they have no feelings.

This Government, three years after ending the war has still not thought of addressing the issue that caught us in a 30-year war. It is very unfortunate that three years after ending the war, you still have no idea as to how you will move forward. You are only putting forward a Parliamentary Select Committee through which, I think you expect to reinvent the wheel by creating a new peace process. There has to be a start which would ensure that we reach some point where we all can live together in a reconciled atmosphere as brothers in this nation.

289 290

Usually, the Government says that the people in the North and the East are asking for roofing sheets, bricks and cement. The Members of the United National Party made two visits to the Northern Province: one in March and the other for the May Day. We did not make it just a public meeting or a gathering when we went there for the May Day or when we visited the North before that. We made it a point to meet the people in the North so that we understand their feelings; assimilate their aspirations and then address those issues in a realistic manner. During our visit, we met a lot of people: religious leaders, people related to civil society organizations and the common public. The people there need houses and livelihood assistance but more than all that, they are looking forward to a political solution that will restore their dignity so that they can live with self-esteem in their areas. They have a right to live and they have a right not live there as subjects but as equal citizens with all political rights. Towards this end, the Government should first implement the Constitution in the North. An election to the Northern Provincial Council is called for. An elected government in the Northern Province can definitely contribute to resettlement and rehabilitation of the people there. It will also lead to reconciliation between the two communities which all of us expect to achieve in this nation.

Are we truly moving towards reconciliation? To move towards reconciliation, the day-to-day issues of the people in the North and the East have to be met. There have been studies done by an organization co-ordinating humanitarian affairs in the North and the East. They say that 50 per cent of the people who have been resettled are still living below the poverty line. More than 10 per cent of the children suffer from acute malnutrition. Over 65 per cent of the people are still spending more than 60 per cent of their income for food alone. That means, they are just surviving as human beings and not living a proper life. The food expenditure index being over 60 per cent is very unfortunate.

Today there was an opportunity for me to ask the Hon. Minister for Resettlement at his Consultative Committee, how far the housing issue has been addressed by the Ministry of Resettlement. He had to confess that there is a need for 100,000 houses in the Northern Province alone and out of this, only temporary housing has been provided but permanent housing has not been given thought of. I feel it is now time - three years after the war - to resettle the people, whom the Government claims to have resettled. Resettled? Yes, to the extent that they have returned to their own lands or their own areas from which they came. But, have they been rehabilitated or resettled in a proper manner? If 100,000 houses have to be built, that means 500,000 people are there without proper housing. They live in temporary shelters. The Government has given them 15 roofing sheets and they

are being provided Rs. 25,000 as livelihood assistance. Is this sufficient for them to rehabilitate themselves? That is the reason why more than 50 per cent of them are still below the poverty line.

Do you not think that the Government has a responsibility and duty to look after these people in a proper manner? If you do not do that, the Government is failing. You are building roads; you are spending billions of rupees on roads. Roads are necessary for economic development. True, but today, for a man who has no roof over his head, is it important for him to have a highway on which he can go at a speed of maybe 80 or 100 kilometres per hour? It does not matter to him because he is looking forward to a proper house first and everything else later.

Regarding livelihood, the economy has collapsed. They lived under a situation of war. They were issued dry rations for their mere survival. They have no income source. There is very little -

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Order, please! Hon. Yogarajan, your time is over. Do you want to take Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswarans time?

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Yes, I am taking 20 minutes. ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, the Hon. (Mrs.) Vijayakala Maheswaran is not coming.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Okay.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Sir, when the economy has crashed, when there is no economic activity, livelihood is so difficult to meet. To meet the livelihood needs, the economy has to be boosted. The only way to do that would be inviting more investments or providing capital to the people to rehabilitate some sort of enterprise, so that they can live on that income. But, the Government has provided Rs. 25,000. What is Rs. 25,000 today? It is two months salary. Can you rehabilitate a family with two months salary of a person, who is at the bottom of the cadre in Government Service? Can a family be rehabilitated with a mere Rs. 25,000? This is the question that I wish to ask this Government. Why do you not feel that it is necessary

291 292

[ . ]

2012 09

to support these people to revive themselves? Why do you not feel that they have to be pulled out of poverty - a poverty level where they live with less than one US Dollar? Twenty five per cent of those people who are below the poverty line are living with less than half the poverty level requirement of one US Dollar per day. So, this issue has to be addressed because this has not been addressed even after three years of ending the war.

In May last year, I read a statement issued by the UN sponsored OCHA. At that time you said, you were attending to this but up to date, nothing has happened. This is very unfortunate. Does the Government have a plan of action? You have been asked to present a plan of action as to how you are going to implement your own LLRC Report. Under those circumstances, I ask that question from you. This is not an issue where the international community has to come in. A Government has the duty to look after its citizens. Do you have a plan of action to provide housing to these people in the North? A hundred thousand houses means nearly Rs. 100 billion. To find it, there is worldwide sympathy for these people. If you do approach proper donors, there are people who are willing to help. Why are you not concerned about these people and provide them permanent housing? If after three years of ending the war, you have no plan as to how you are going to address this issue even after 30 years, I do not believe you would do it. You are expecting those people to revive themselves with empty pockets and come out of this morass themselves by not providing them with some support.

When talking about the political rights of these people, as I said before, there is a need for a political solution. Your own LLRC Report has suggested that there should be a political solution. You recognize that there is a need for a political solution because whenever a foreign dignitary visits this country or whenever our leaders go outside the country, they always talk of granting a political solution but we are not moving forward. What is the reason? We have the Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana, here. He was given the task of formulating an indigenous political solution, a solution that can emerge from our own midst. The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana painstakingly sat through 128 meetings and brought out a document. Maybe there is one clause in that which you would not like. That is the abolition of the Presidency and reverting back to the Prime Ministerial system. Okay, leave that out. But, he has also suggested that there be a Provincial Council system in which there is no Concurrent List.

Why do you not consider that Report as a basis for the Parliamentary Select Committee? If the Government adopts or states publicly that you can start from the APRC Report and discuss further in the Parliamentary Select Committee, I am sure the TNA would consider joining the Parliamentary Select Committee and we can move forward.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) That is a good suggestion.

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Yogarajan) Or else, the Hon. Douglas Devananda has always stood for the Thirteenth Amendment. At least move that the Thirteenth Amendment be the starting point where we can move forward. Move forward does not mean that you remove the legislative powers of the Provincial Councils as you have done now, or you remove the fiscal powers of the Provincial Councils where they have no right even to impose a BTT, or you remove the police powers that have already been enshrined in the Constitution, or you remove the land powers that have also been enshrined in the Constitution. What are you planning to do in the PSC? State your position; state your case. As a Government, you should have a policy. If you do state that, we can start from there and go on to create a permanent solution that all people in this country could accept. Towards this, what is the inhibition you have? Is it because you do not want to give any devolution at all? Do you want to even abolish the Provincial Councils? What is the reason? In case there is an election in the North today, those people will, to some extent, have political power to resettle and rehabilitate their people. Grant them that wish first and then go towards a permanent political solution through whatever means you feel but giving some promise that there will be progress in the political negotiations that you envisage.

As far as resettlement and rehabilitation is concerned, the Opposition is willing to cooperate with the Government. I was told by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, Leader of the Opposition that the Hon. Douglas Devananda is willing to form a committee, consisting of Members of Parliament from the region and Chairmen of the Local Authorities in the North, that will go into the rehabilitation and resettlement issues in the North and that committee should report to Parliament so that we will also be aware of what is happening in the North.

A similar committee can be appointed for the East also with the Members of Parliament and heads of the Local Authorities. We also have a functioning Provincial Council there. Maybe some representatives of that Provincial Council can also be part of that committee for the Eastern Province. Let the people of the region decide what has to be done and how it has to be done to resettle and rehabilitate the people in the North and the East.

I am sure that every one of you will agree that we have postponed this too long; it is now time up and we should not let these people suffer any more. They suffered enough during the 30-year war and they are suffering even today, three years after the war. They need some solace at least now. So, please grant this and come forward to address this issue of the suffering people in the North and the East. Thank you.

293 294

[4.24 p.m.]

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Sir, this is a timely Motion because all of us in this House I believe agree that we must do all in our power to ensure that the people of the North and the East are fully integrated into a prosperous and pluralistic Sri Lanka. Sadly, instead of trying to work together towards this end, the Mover of this Motion has included various elements that go back to the old confrontational and selective assertions of the past, which I had very much hoped, my Friends in the Tamil National Alliance had grown out of.

Whilst I am glad that the Motion does not repeat canards about former combatants indicating that even the Opposition grants the rehabilitation programme has been a success, I am sorry that gross generalizations are made with no attention to facts. I do not need to talk about many of them but I think the manner in which the Mover of the Motion talked about army installation of Buddhist Statues is a complete falsehood. I have myself travelled all over the country. I think, there are two instances in the Vanni, one of which he mentioned and the moment that was brought to Government attention, they tried to look at the question in terms of the facts involved and provide an acceptable solution in terms of the laws of this land. I should add that his canard about the army was repeated at one of the many Reconciliation Committee meetings I have held at Divisional Secretariat level in the North and when I asked the person who made this statement for evidence, all he could say was that soldiers worshipped the statue; not as the Hon. Member said. Sri Lankans, whatever religion they belong to, tend to worship the statues of all religions. But, to attribute responsibility - . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Hon. Member, give me a moment. Do you deny the fact that a Buddhist Statue was installed at Thiruketheeswaram very recently close to this Temple?

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) No, I am not denying that fact. I am telling you that at the moment - . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) You have been there and seen it for yourself.

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) I have been and seen it for myself and I have told you that at the moment -

. ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) How can you say that what the Hon. Senathiraja told was false? ( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) I am sorry. What he said was that the army had been responsible and that is not true. . ( . ) (The Hon. R. Sampanthan) Unless the army gets involved, these things cannot be done; the army is all over. ( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) I am sorry. The Hon. Leader of the TNA is making a gross statement and if he is not aware of the facts he should find out instead of saying things which he should be ashamed of at his age. He says that unless the army is involved this could not have happened. That is nonsense, and I can assure him that making generalizations of that - [Interruption.] I think, indeed he said a particular monk had taken a statue there and Government's attention was drawn to this; the attention of the civil authority was brought to bear on this and they are looking into the case and solving it in terms of the law.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) Who is supporting that? You said the civil authority -

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Probably yourselves because this is the type of thing that you are engaging in to insult the army.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) The GA Mannar, who is a Sinhalese man is supporting it. Do you know that the statue was installed in a private land?

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) They are looking into it and I believe you are correct.

( ) (The Hon. Suresh Premachandran) I am hundred per cent correct.

295 296

2012 09

( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Yes. But, Hon. Member, the point I was making was the gross generalizations you were making about the army are false. Both of you have now granted that because you are now making accusations against the GA, which is also not true but I will leave him to defend himself. All I am saying is that you, in the TNA, are using falsehood to attack the army whereas what you should do is co-operate with the civil authority to ensure that nothing illegal happens. Many of these matters have been brought to the attention of the Government. They will look into them. I believe you are correct in talking about a private land but that has to be assessed by looking at the facts and to use such substance to make generalizations about the army is wrong and you know it. That is why you have now virtually withdrawn by accusing the poor GA. So, please try to be precise in the future and not to raise tensions because it is precisely this type of tactic that plays into the hands of the extremists, which I hope we will be able to rescue you from.

I say, Sir, that this has been selective because in this Motion there is no mention whatsoever of the root cause of the enormous suffering the Tamil people went through in the past several years. While I fully agree that the core causes of political conflict must be addressed and hope very much that the TNA will help us to do this, the cause of protracted armed conflict was the intransigence and murderous brutality of the leadership of the LTTE.

We are well aware that the Government of President Jayewardene contributed to what should have been political conflict turning into violence.

The reason I have a soft spot for the Mover of this Motion and forgiving him for his gross political posturing that has sometimes prevented resolution of conflict through political discussion - as happened in the year 2000 - is that he was one of the victims of the animosity of the Hon. Cyril Mathew, but he, until he was totally outclassed by Mr. Prabhakaran, did more to foster a culture of violence than anyone else.

But, there was an Accord in 1987 that should have led to peace. A more sane language policy was introduced, that being, I believe, one of the core causes of political conflict, given that it deprived so many of our fellow citizens of employment and access to Government services. And, we had some measure of devolution which, as my good Friend who took charge of the Wayamba Province showed, could lead to more effective attention to local problems and thus greater prosperity. But, before positive results could be seen in the North and the East, the intransigence of Mr. Prabhakaran, fuelled I fear by political gamesmanship in Colombo, destroyed hopes of peace. The manner in which the LTTE picked off the moderate Tamil leadership was appalling, but we have yet to hear, except occasionally now from the TNA Leader

for which I thank him, categorical condemnation of those murders.

I am also astonished that there is no mention in this Motion of the forced conscription of thousands, many of whom died at the altar of Mr. Prabhakarans ambitions. Certainly, it is true that Tamil civilians died, but the claim that tens of thousands of them were killed is totally false and even the cunning addition of the term maimed, to avoid a downright lie, is misleading. But, we know that many of them were killed by the LTTE, and we also know that many of the combatants who were killed were innocent young men, women and children who had been torn from their families and forced to fight by a monomaniac.

Ignoring this, Sir, is downright betrayal of the Tamil people and their suffering. Worse, it opens the doors to those who hark back to the violence and terror of the LTTE. I would like to believe that none of my Parliamentary Colleagues has such inclinations, but it is truly tragic that hardly any of them condemn the terrorism that held them also in thrall for so long.

I am willing, however, to accept this as an excuse that they were terrified out of their wits while Mr. Prabhakaran was alive. That is why I do not privilege the National List Member of Parliament, who has consistently criticized terrorism whilst standing up for Tamils, because he was not subjected to terror as the rest of his Colleagues were. Unfortunately, he now seems to be subjected to intimidation as his Leader used to be in the old days when, with all his moderate colleagues murdered, he had to succumb to the LTTE jackboot and make bizarre claims to the effect that a group of terrorists were the sole representatives of the Tamil people.

Sir, we need some truth-telling; we need to get over this state of denial in order to move forward more swiftly. There must be much more cooperation so that we jointly admit errors and try to correct them. But, while it is certainly true that Sri Lanka suffered from majoritarianism for many years and those language policies, educational discrimination and above all, a failure to empower regional populations were bad and that State-sponsored violence, in particular in 1981 and 1983, was worse, surely any sane person would recognize that all that lies in the distant past. Since 1987, it was the LTTE that prevented us moving forward towards building on the Constitutional changes enacted then, implementing language policy more effectively and making sure that our security forces were multiethnic and multilingual. Of course, we could have done more and I hope we will do more, but the fact that successive Governments had to deal with terrorism, the fact that successive Tamil leaders were ruthlessly killed, the fact that communications were cut while Government still continued to deliver health, education and food, all this should also be remembered.

297 298

Over the past three years, Sir, much has been done to remedy the situation of displacement and dispossession that LTTE violence, intransigence and hostage-taking created. Indeed more has been done than in any other similar situation in the world. Those of us who saw Cambodia several years after the ravages of its internal conflicts, Lebanon where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are still suffering in camps more than a half a century after they were displaced, sacrificed on the altar of European guilt, Afghanistan three years after the Taliban were removed only for the country to be neglected as the United States engaged in adventurism in Iraq and those of us who know the world realize how fortunate our displaced are.

They have been resettled more quickly than anywhere else, and the areas are flourishing in a way that was unthinkable three years ago. But, this is in comparison with what goes on elsewhere, and we must still strive to do more.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Though the programmes implemented for infrastructural development have been fantastic, we could ensure better planning so that the people of the North will benefit from the opportunities that have been corrected. Better and more diverse training and better mechanisms for local consultation are what the people requested at the various Divisional Secretariat Reconciliation Committee meetings I have attended over the last several months, and I hope we can deliver even more in these areas. I have in this regard made some suggestions to the Ministry of Public Administration, and I hope these can be considered soon and implemented as possible.

With regard to the first request in this Motion, whilst I certainly believe political reform is needed, I believe we need to think in terms of total empowerment rather than simply political power. All too often, as we in this House know only too well, political power means the power of politicians, not the power of the people. What we need, therefore, are mechanisms to empower people in every way, in particular economic and social empowerment. Only through that can we ensure that the political power vested in the people is not hijacked. In this regard, I hope very much that the ideas of His Excellency the President on broadbasing power, introducing better mechanisms of consultation and on promoting the principle of subsidiarity are taken forward. Far too often, lethargy has prevented the swift decision-making and reform this country needs, and I believe we are letting down the

President and the people who voted for him, if we do not do more to implement the ideas he has advanced with regard to empowerment of the people.

Finally, I agree absolutely that action must be taken to reverse, rectify and redress actions that have had adverse political, economic, social and cultural consequences for the Tamil people. But, this also includes the destructive actions of the LTTE and of those Tamil politicians who were in thrall to them and also the actions of those who hark back to terror and intimidation as a way of achieving political goals. I have often told the TNA leadership that their stance at the 2010 Presidential Election was not in the interests of the Tamil people, since it suggested that the Tamil people were secondary to a thirst for revenge. That may not have been the reason for their strange posturing, but they have I believe now recognized that in order to build up trust, politicians should refrain from resorting to vulgar stratagems.

As I have constantly said, anyone who tells us to look after the interests of the Tamil people is only telling us what we should be telling ourselves, for these are our people. But those who engage in posturing simply to weaken the Government are not helping the Tamil people, and I would urge them to rethink their strategies even while I hope our aims will remain the same, namely a prosperous, pluralistic, united Sri Lanka.

Thank you.

Seventy five thousand people were chased away from there saying that it was their land of birth and they were to rule that land. Our Muslims were also there. Scantily dressed they gathered whatever they could and ran away. You know the whole history. Yet, there was not a word of protest or sympathy from the TNA.

The other day, the Hon. Sushma Swaraj, Leader of the Opposition of Lok Sabha came here. She met our Parliamentarians under the leadership of the Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Hon. Leader of the House and, Sir, you were also there. I told this to her face; Seventy five thousand people were chased away from Jaffna. Your government is constructing 50,000 houses and they are not prepared to give one house to the Muslims. Is this fair? Is this justice? Is this moral rectitude? I am asking you, Hon. Sampanthan, the Leader of the TNA, because you are a senior person. I told that to her face. Neither the Leader of the TNA nor anybody in that group protested when the Muslims were chased away from the North at that time. Now they are -

- shedding crocodile tears in this House. Therefore, I tell the Government of India, through this House, that a fair quota of these Indian houses should be given to the Muslims also. There is no other way.

When Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, India, was destroyed, Karunanidhi -

. . , - - . ! - [] ! ! , ? ? defend ? . , . ? . []

You are a proxy of the puli.

Sir, do you know Mr. Cho S. Ramaswamy? He is a redoubtable Editor of the Tamil Weekly Thuglak and a former Rajya Sabha Member. He has given an interview to the media there. One question that was asked from him was, Tamil parties here and across the world are demanding that India support the US Resolution against Sri Lanka in the UN Human Rights Council. What do you think? - [Interruption.] Listen to what Mr. Cho S. Ramaswamy says. He says, "I doubt these people realize that the US Resolution does not condemn Sri Lanka as such. The Resolution says that recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission - LLRC - appointed by Colombo, which was something like the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, should be implemented. The US Resolution also insists that there must be a settlement of the Tamil problem. We understand that.

There is another question asked: "What do you think should be done to bring to book the perpetrators of war crimes?" Mr. Ramaswamy replies, "There was no war in Sri Lanka. Is there a war between the Naxalites and the Indian government? Is there a war between the Islamic militants and the Indian State?" What a timely question he is posing!

Then, Sir, another question posed to him was: "But, there were thousands of civilians killed in this war, or whatever you call it, in Sri Lanka?" His answer was: "Because the civilians were used by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam - LTTE - as shields. Nobody speaks of that now". . :

"They can use civilians; they can use children as shields and as suicide bombers".

So, what has happened in this country has been mirrored by Mr. Cho S. Ramaswamy properly and orderly. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, your time is over. Please wind up. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Okay. The last question asked from Cho was; Do you think Tamil nationalism is going overboard? I am asking the same question from the TNA today.

The reply given was: There is no doubt about that. It has been doing that persistently for many years. The insurgents need not follow any rules but the State should always be mindful of international law or rules of war et cetera. How is that possible? In that case, no State can put down terrorism. So, Mr. Ramaswamy, the well-known advocate and editor says that no State can put down terrorism and it is as if we are asking the State not to act

343 344

against terrorism. Now, this is the position, Sir, as far as the war is concerned.

The other day, I attended the 35th death anniversary of Mr. S.J.V. Chelvanayakam. It was a fine commemoration event held at the Kathiresan Hall, Bambalapitiya.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, please wind up your speech. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Give me one more minute, Sir. ,-

delivered the memorial speech. What did he say? He said, The Muslims rights are guaranteed. He mentioned the names of two people who built up the Federal Party. One is, ' ' C. Rajadurai, Former Minister of Regional Development and Hindu Cultural Affairs and the other is, of Maruthamunai in the Eastern Province, Senator S.Z.M. Mashoor Moulana. He said: A guarantee was extended to the Muslim community by Chelvanayakam?" I was listening to him.

Hon. Sampanthan, you must also guarantee those rights to the Muslims.

Therefore, Sir, I condemn unequivocally that the Hon. Rajadurai, the man who built up the Federal Party in the North and the East, was insulted when he visited Jaffna for the Thanthai Chelvanayakam Commemoration meeting. But, there was not a word of protest by the TNA except from some people in the Eastern Province. There, you see the difference. Therefore, Sir, this is what is happening. The North and the East are divided. Build a united TNA first.

( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you will have to wind up now.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I will finish in a minute.

This is the problem of the Tamil people. You look after the Tamil people. You build up a united party in the North before you come and sermonize us. I Thank you, Sir.
