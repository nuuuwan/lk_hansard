QUESTION BY PRIVATE NOTICE I NON-BRIEFING OF NATIONAL ACTION PLAN TO PARLIAMENT

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, I find that my Colleague, the Leader of the House, is not present here today. He is generally punctual. Anyway - ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He has gone to - ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) Okay. ( ) (Mr. Speaker) ? , . ( ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe) After labouring for a period of 18 months, the Commission of Inquiry on Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation, issued its Report. The LLRC Report was tabled in Parliament on 16th December, 2011 by the

Leader of the House. Tabling the Report he said, The Commission offers us detailed observations and recommendations on international humanitarian law issues relating to the final phases of the conflict. The Government seeks the support of all Members of this House, rising above party affiliation to carry forward the task of implementation with the energy that is called for at this crucial time.

Already two of the Opposition parties have sent in their observations. The UNP stated its support for the Report despite the shortcomings. Having responded to the LLRC Report, we have decided to ask for a full debate. The date is to be arranged with the Government.

It is now reported that a National Action Plan for Protection and Promotion of Human Rights will be circulated at the United Nations Human Rights Council Sessions in Geneva. The upcoming sessions of UN Human Rights Council is crucial for Sri Lanka, while the Government has the right to present whatever document they want in Geneva. I do not think anyone is contesting that. It is necessary to keep the House informed and table such document in this House. Neither has this National Action Plan been placed before Parliament nor have you kept this House informed as to why this report is being circulated. It is our complaint that the House must be informed.

A document which has not been placed before Parliament is being presented in Geneva. By doing this, the Government is by-passing Parliament. It is like the old saying, show the younger sister and give away the elder sister in marriage.

Issues regarding the human rights and our commitments under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - ICCPR - are raised and debated regularly in this Parliament. This includes both allegations against the Government as well as the responses by the Government. We, in Opposition also have pointed out shortcomings in the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka.

This House has also discussed the Report of the UN Panel of Experts. In this background, why is the National Action Plan for Protection and Promotion of Human Rights forwarded to Geneva without being tabled in Parliament? What is the reason for the Governments unwillingness to do so? Will you inform us as to who prepared this Action Plan? There are many Members in this House on both sides knowledgeable on human rights who can make a valuable contribution. Why are they being left out?

The LLRC Report was in effect Sri Lankas reply to the various allegations of human rights abuses that were made against Sri Lanka in general, and our armed forces in particular, in the Report of the UN Panel of Experts. The Government which tabled this Report in Parliament is unwilling to table the National Action Plan for Protection and Promotion of Human Rights. President Mahinda Rajapaksa in his National Day Address, also

65 66

announced the plans to implement the LLRC Report. Is this National Action Plan a supplement to the LLRC Report or an alternative to it? It is an important document. Therefore a complete discussion or debate at this critical time cannot take place without Parliament being briefed on the National Action Plan. The Government for whatever reason has failed to do so. In fact, it is a very confused picture. I showed a newspaper article of today to the Chief Government Whip. In that, the Minister of External Affairs has said, the "Government needs time to implement it". In the same newspaper, - "Daily Mirror" - the Minister for Plantation Industries says, "recommendations are being implemented". Then, the UN Representative also says, "recommendations are being implemented". I would like to hand this to the Hon. Speaker. So, in this background, there is a question as to whether there is a clear strategy being followed in Geneva by the Government. Certainly, we have not even been informed of the document.

Be that as it may, I would like to ask the Leader of the House why the Government has not briefed the House on the National Action Plan. It also raises, Hon. Speaker, an issue of Privilege.

Hon. Speaker, the action of the Government of not tabling the National Action Plan and not keeping the House informed, is a serious matter. How is it that the Government could take the House into confidence in regard to the LLRC Report but lack confidence of the same House in respect of the National Action Plan? In fact, the Government deliberately kept the House in ignorance. In doing so, they are in breach of Article 43 of the Constitution, which stipulates that the Cabinet of Ministers shall be collectively and individually responsible and answerable to Parliament. This amounts to a breach of Privilege. They have withheld vital information necessary for this House to perform its functions.

In fact, I was surprised today to read in the newspapers, that the Sri Lankan Permanent Representative to the UN has said that the Government will prosecute all those suspects involved in war crimes. Sri Lanka has no domestic crime called, war crimes. This is an international crime. You have accepted it again. In the "Daily Mirror" it is stated that anyone who has violated human rights, will be charged. As the Hon. Members know, there is no violation and it is not even a domestic offence. So, you have already accepted what is being said by the Western countries. Should this House not have been informed? We have a different point.

Earlier, without informing the House, you all informed the UN Panel that the Government is willing to file action domestically against anyone in the forces who has violated the law. That is in paragraph 368 of the LLRC Report. We did not know anything. Now, all of a sudden we read that you are going to prosecute them. What is the use of sending all these people? I can understand the plight of the Hon. Leader of the House. This is certainly a

breach of Privilege. Why are you taking all these actions? We get up in the morning to find that you have already conceded the fact that there have been war crimes. So, I would like the Government to reply. Also, Hon. Speaker, I think there is an issue of a breach of Privilege by not keeping the House informed. That is a very serious matter. ( ) (The Hon.

[2.43 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe - Leader of the Opposition) Hon. Speaker, this is a Motion jointly in the name of the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition, which is a convention that this House follows when we make a reference to a retiring Secretary-General.

My good Friend, the Chief Government Whip, has already given us the details about the life and the services which Mr. Dhammika Kitulgoda has so far experienced. Therefore, I shall not deal with it in length. I also do not want to talk about his days at Royal College because if the Chief Government Whip and I are to talk about him, you will think it is more a meeting of the Royal College Union than of this august Assembly.

Nevertheless, I must say that we have had many Secretaries-General. They generally came from the Attorney-Generals Department or they joined here directly. This is the first Secretary-General we had with judicial experience who came as a judge.

Of course, I must say, that prior to that he has taken part in politics of sorts, not in contesting Parliamentary Elections but in contesting the Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society Elections. You learn more about people there than you do in a General Election. I think the equivalent we have of the old days' election of ward members today, is the MPCS Elections and those are very important institutions, as you are aware, Mr. Speaker, in the Southern part of the country very much like in the Northern part.

His entry, I must say, which is the truth, was controversial but it is a tribute to him that at his departure we have all got together to record here the services he had rendered.

Mr. Kitulgoda came from the judicial service straight in here. The general practice was to recruit people from within Parliament Therefore, we were amongst those who raised points of Order but Mr. Kitulgoda proved himself adept at running the House and he was involved, I would say, with the then Speaker, the Hon. Anura Bandaranaike, in two main issues. The first was when the then President Mrs. Kumaratunga closed down Parliament. One day when we came, we found the Parliament closed and the police were around it.

The second and the more important one was, when the Supreme Court with the then Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva, wanted to take contempt proceedings against Parliament. I must commend the decision that the Secretary-General took at that time together with the

81 82

Speaker in calling for a certain number of leading lawyers to advise the Speaker on what steps should be taken. I think that was a good decision rather than the Secretary-General taking it upon himself and the final result was one that was acceptable to both sides of the House.

Then, Mr. Kitulgoda gave up this position to go to the Constitutional Council because he felt that both positions should not be held by one person. He left this and went to the Constitutional Council. He had to return and again his return was a controversy. This time it was not about the person but the method of appointment because there was no Constitutional Council, and in a sense, he carried over his school-days extra curricular activity or drama into that because he was an Acting Secretary-General. He acted for a fairly long time, I think for nearly two years, till he took over in 2010.

Then, also there had been an important question, not yet resolved, as to the status of General Sarath Fonseka, whether he is still a Member of the House or not. I myself have raised many points of Order, which have not been gone into, but it was certainly the time that the House had to readjust itself after the end of the war.

The debates that took place here were quite important and it will continue to be so, because the whole issue of what we discussed earlier as to what the international agreements are and how much it affects Sri Lanka, is a matter that is now being discussed in this House and in the country. Nevertheless, during Mr. Kitulgodas time, we had improvement in the budgetary procedures, especially with the decision to have separate Budget Committees and to service it, which enabled us to get through a lot of work in this House.

Mr. Kitulgoda has also been instrumental in many of the Parliamentary delegations and he played his own role together with you, Hon. Speaker, in ensuring that the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference will be held in September 2012 in Sri Lanka. I would agree with the Chief Government Whip that he held a unique position. Actually, first he was a judicial officer and then he was the Secretary to the JSC, which was in charge of appointing all the minor judiciary. Then, he comes to this House, which in addition to legislative power, also exercises judicial power and where we had to override the Supreme Court itself. Then, he was in the Constitutional Council, which makes the appointments of senior judges in Sri Lanka. So, in a sense his career has been not only in the legislature but also in the complete circle of what we call "Judicial Power": judicial appointments and various bodies that are associated with the judiciary. I think that is going to be a unique one. Certainly, the combination of the legislative and judicial experience will, I think, enable Mr. Kitulgoda to give many lectures, and I hope he will write many books

which will earn him well-needed income after his retirement. But, it is a unique position not only in Sri Lanka but I think in the Commonwealth countries also, that you were holding these together.

While stating all this, I would not like to go again into some of the other areas but I remember how we had to meet in the House with the aid of some torches when it went under water and had no electricity. Those are experiences that will get carried on.

I must also record Mr. Kitulgodas services as the Secretary of the Constitutional Council. Actually, he was the Secretary-General of Parliament when we created the Seventeenth Amendment and he was the Secretary-General of Parliament when the Parliament repealed it and brought the Eighteenth Amendment also. I think that is also a unique experience. I worked with him when the Hon. M. Joseph Michael Perera was the Speaker, and the Constitutional Council worked well. That is why long after it has been abolished, people are talking about it. Internationally they are talking about it. The LLRC is talking of the need for a mechanism to ensure the independence of the police, judiciary and other bodies. There had to be a lot of preparative work that had to be done. There were a few people like Mr. Kitulgoda, Mr. S.S. Wijeratne, and the former Justice A.R.B. Amarasinghe, who did the work and is now ill in hospital. This shows the need for a body like the Constitutional Council. I mean you need that independent mechanism.That is why today we are coming under criticism throughout the world and even the LLRC has recognized the need for that independent mechanism. The present one does not meet that requirement. I think we have to pay attention to that. Why is it that this country, in which the majority of the people want a Constitutional Council, is unable to go ahead? Why is it that the Government is not willing to do so? I am sure that if we all get together and do this, then we can certainly utilize Mr. Kitulgodas services to re-establish an independent mechanism. If, by any chance, you all do not want to go back to the Seventeenth Amendment, we can think of a new mechanism. That is one of the reasons why we responded to the LLRC Report; the need for the independence of judiciary and the independence of the police, is all a question.

Today, you find people are taken out in front of the courthouse, which would have never been the experience of Mr. Kitulgoda as a judge. But, I thought I should point this out. His presence here today also reminds us how important the Constitutional Council appointed under the Seventeenth Amendment was; how it gave us stature in the national fora and how its removal has brought down our standings. I think part of our problems will be resolved if this independent mechanism can be brought back again and pave the way for closer working relationship between the Government and the Opposition.

83 84

Anyway, I do not want to take anymore time of this House, but I think I must mention this. We had a temporary Budget Committee. Now, let us go ahead and make it a Standing Committee. Another issue we took up was the restructuring of the J.R. Jayewardene Centre, which the Parliamentarians can use. So, there is much more that could be done.

Actually, I want to wish Mr. Dhammika Kitulgoda long life but in practice, all retired Secretaries-General - from Mr. Sam Wijesinghe downwards - are enjoying their time and giving us the benefit of their experience. So, while we wish him all the best, we must also welcome the new Secretary-General, Mr. Dhammika Dasanayake - another Dhammika - who, again in addition to being in the same school like me, also happened to be in the same faculty of the University of Colombo. We will talk about him later on. We will have to both praise him and criticize him as we do of all Secretaries-General.

I, on behalf of the House, thank Mr. Kitulgoda, wish him all the best and hope his services will be available to us, especially to set up a new Constitutional Council.

Thank you. [.. 2.55] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Maithripala Sirisena - Minister of Health) , - - , - - .

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Hon. Speaker, I am extremely happy to have this opportunity of bidding farewell to a Secretary-General of Parliament who has rendered yeoman service. He is a unique personality, as quite rightly mentioned, by the Chief Government Whip and the Leader of the Opposition. He served as the Secretary-General of Parliament from 1999 to 2002 and again from 2008 to 2012. Besides that, he had been serving as the Secretary of the Judicial Service Commission in the judiciary, which is a highly recognized post, the Secretary-General of Parliament in the legislature, the Secretary to the Constitutional Council, a very important institution which

gave independence to all the important Commissions and as the Secretary to the Parliamentary Council.

Mr. Kitulgoda holds a magnificent record as a judicial officer. He was considered the youngest-ever Magistrate appointed in Sri Lanka and thereafter he served as a District Judge excising his judicial powers. He has been well recognized by whichever government that was in power due to his good services. Thereafter, he was appointed as the Secretary to the Judicial Service Commission. He did not stop there. He came to Parliament and then to the Constitutional Council, Parliamentary Council and so on. So, he is a unique personality. No other Public servant in this country, has had the opportunity or the ability to hold all these important positions.

Looking at his school record, you would see that he had been well recognized both in the fields of sports and social services. I am sure the members of the Bar and the lawyers who served in the courts in Elpitiya, Kebithigollewa, Kurunegala, Moratuwa, Nugegoda, Horana, Puttalam and Mount Lavinia would vouch for the fact that he was a very forthright and an independent magistrate, who did administer justice in all those courts.

In addition to that I have here with me, a record which states about his services rendered to Parliament, not only to the Members of Parliament of both sides but also to the staff of Parliament. I have here with me, a felicitating speech made about him during the office of the former Speaker, the Hon. W.J.M. Lokubandara. Mr. Kitulgoda has inaugurated various services, particularly on behalf of the staff of Parliament such as giving scholarships to the children of the staff and providing them with school books. He has also rendered various other services to the members of the staff. He had the goodwill of all the members of the staff, the higher-ups as well as the lower ranks of the staff. He was responsible for bringing about amity between the higher officials and the lower grade staff of Parliament.

I would like, with your permission Sir, to table* this document so that you would remember the good service that he has rendered on behalf of the staff by looking after, not only their career but also their other requirements, as the Secretary-General of Parliament.

I would like to say that he had always been very fair and reasonable to us, the Members of the Opposition, and he always gave us the correct advice. But, there was one point that I disagreed with him. Whenever we tried to make a statement or go out of order, he would quietly whisper to the Hon. Speaker saying, Sir, that is not provided in the Standing Orders and water us down. That was, of course, a part of his duty because he always

87 88

[ ]

2012 22

gave good, sound and proper advice to whomever the Speaker was. He may have served five Speakers but no one has complained against him, and I am sure, Sir, you would also appreciate the services he has rendered.

Today, we are happy that there is another Dhammika, who has been appointed as the Secretary-General of Parliament. He is Dasanayake as against Kitulgoda. Mr. Dhammika Dasanayake who was the Deputy Secretary-General of this Parliament is a very silent, conscientious worker and he too is an old boy of Royal College. He holds professional qualifications of LL.B, University of Colombo; LL.M, University of Colombo; and an Attorney-at-Law of the Supreme Court. He is a lawyer and provided he had proceeded in that profession, he would have been a Magistrate or a District Judge and ultimately gone up the ladder.

However, his employment record is also very impressive. He had served as a Consultant (Research) to the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment and was a State Counsel at the Attorney-Generals Department. He was a former visiting Lecturer of the Open University of Sri Lanka, a former visiting Lecturer of the Institute of Workers' Education of the University of Colombo, the Assistant Secretary-General and then the Deputy Secretary-General.

He has a great deal of experience in the international field, attending many conferences of IPU, CPA and guiding delegations, whenever he accompanied them. Now, we are happy to say that he is heading the CPA Conference, which is to be held in September. So, he has an onerous task of trying to make accommodation for nearly 1,000 delegates, who will be coming to Sri Lanka from 160 Parliaments of other countries at the invitation of the Hon. Speaker, who will be the Chairman of that Conference.

Sir, let me conclude by wishing Mr. Dhammika Kitulgoda, a very happy and enjoyable period of retirement. Though we say that he is retiring, he does not retire from all aspects; he is retiring only from Parliament. I do not want to mention the other aspects because I know his capabilities. He is a wonderful and a very enjoyable man. He believes in work and enjoyment at the same time. I wish him good luck!

Thank you. [.. 3.15]

[4.11 p.m.] ( )(The Hon. (Prof.) Rajiva Wijesinha) Mr. Chair, I am honoured to be able to speak today on behalf of the Liberal Party of Sri Lanka to felicitate Mr. Dhammika Kitulgoda on his retirement as Secretary-General of Parliament, and to thank him for his contribution. As you may be aware, I have a great respect for the office he occupied, a respect that dates back to nearly half a century when it was known simply as the position of Clerk to the House of Representatives. That was in the days of the old dignified Chamber, before we had to cope with this grandiose tinsel structure, but simplicity in those days marked great influence and authority.

Despite that lowly title, I was convinced that the Clerk to the House was the most important position in the House, save only that of the Speaker, and of course the Deputy Speaker, a position held then by the Hon. Member of Beliatta. That was in the days before the grandiose but pernicious concept of representing a whole district was imposed on us, with a corresponding lack of effectiveness. I should add that seeing Mr. Kitulgoda in action, while now being a Member of Parliament instead of just a spectator in the Gallery, I feel again that the Secretary-General of Parliament is indeed the second most important person in the House, a far more respectable individual than the rest of us.

Others have spoken of his extremely distinguished career in the judiciary where he was the youngest person to be appointed a Magistrate, and then in his administrative roles as Secretary to the Judicial Service Commission, the Constitutional Council and Parliament as Secretary-General. He actually occupied the latter position twice, succeeding and being succeeded by individuals already in service in Parliament. He was therefore unique in coming in from outside, which should not be a regular practice, but which can be a healthy corrective when a service becomes too insular.

The responsibilities of the Secretary-General are manifold, and I gather that, in several other dispensations around the world, these are now divided amongst two or more persons. The Secretary-General has to run the administration of Parliament, ranging from the official

103 104

[ . ]

2012 22

functions such as Bills, Committees and Record Offices, to more mundane areas such as food and security. Unlike in the old days, he now also has dozens of Ministers requiring offices on the premises and large security details to deal with.

The Secretary-General also advises the Speaker on procedures and Constitutional requirements. Sadly this is an area in which, following on the usurpation of several Parliamentary functions when the Constitution became an illogical hybrid, combining the Westminster Cabinet system and Executive Presidency, some of these functions became blurred, and the authority of the Speaker and the importance therefore of the advice he received from the Secretary-General became less significant. This, however, does not necessarily have to be the case, and I hope that as the present Speaker strives to restore the dignity of this House, so too the contribution of Parliament as a decisive element in the Constitution can be revitalized.

A good Speaker needs constantly to refer to the Secretary-General for advice on law, the Constitution and precedence. Similarly, a good Secretary-General stays in the background and ensures the absolute authority of the Speaker. I believe we saw such a relationship in the last two years, and I am glad I was privileged to serve on the Committee on Standing Orders, which made such swift progress under the guidance of the Speaker, with the support of the Secretary-General, before other considerations led to a pause. I believe it imperative that we revive this process, and update Standing Orders and make them effective, to ensure a more productive role for Parliament and the Committees, which no longer achieve as much as they are expected to do, an expectation they could fulfil in former times.

Mr. Chair, in thanking Mr. Kitulgoda for his contribution, I must also pay tribute to his unfailing courtesy when dealing with staff as well as Parliamentarians, and his cheerful and helpful approach to all of us. In this regard, his staff has also been admirable, and I look forward to a similar sympathetic and effective contribution from his successor.

Once again, I am privileged to have known Mr. Dhammika Dasanayake and his family for over half a century, and I recall his father's contribution as a Secretary to a Ministry, a position that initially was considered much more important than that of Secretary-General of Parliament. That concept changed some years back, and I am delighted therefore to see the son in the present exalted position, which I continue to believe is also much more important than that of the Parliamentarians. I know he will serve with dignity and affection as his predecessor did before him.

Thank you.

[4.54 p.m.]

() ( ) ( () - ) (The Hon. (Prof.) Tissa Vitarana - Minister of Scientific Affairs) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, I would like to join my Colleagues, who have spoken earlier, to pay tribute to Mr. Dhammika Kitulgoda for the service he had rendered to Parliament.

On two occasions, he had really been saddled with a difficult task and I think on the second occasion, it was much more difficult because I remember coming to

Parliament and seeing a very confrontational and unstable situation with a narrow majority for the Government, where tempers of Members were being raised and strong arguments were going on. It is in that context that it was necessary for the Hon. Speaker to have the assistance of a mature Secretary-General of Parliament to guide and help him in directing and controlling the House. I think the presence of a person of the calibre of Mr. Dhammika Kitulgoda was invaluable. He was, as we all know, a person with a strong legal background. Having been both at the Bar as well as on the Bench, he had learnt how to handle difficult situations, confronting persons who carry out those duties. With that background, he was able to, I think with his knowledge in constitutional law, give the necessary guidance to the Hon. Speaker to manage the affairs of the House. In doing that, he rendered an invaluable service, and during the period he had been the Secretary-General, one could see that he had assisted the Speakers to gradually bring this House to a far more manageable, reasonable and better level, which had helped in the conduct of debates and discussions of the House in an orderly manner. So, firstly, let me pay my tribute and express my thanks on behalf of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and the Government for the service he had rendered to keep the affairs of this House at a high level of excellence.

We know that the Secretary-General has a number of diverse functions to perform in managing the affairs of Parliament. I think one can say that over the years, there has been an improvement in all the support services provided by the staff here. The staff needs proper management as it has to look into a number of areas. It is during his service that the IT sector of Parliament improved greatly. Computer use has been facilitated and the access to knowledge and information through the Library, using computers has greatly improved. So, I think the various support services that are essential for the proper functioning of Parliament had been supervised, directed and managed by Mr. Kitulgoda very efficiently during his tenure of office. Looking at it from all angles, I think we owe a great debt to you, Mr. Kitulgoda, for what you had done to improve the performance of Parliament.

I would not keep on repeating the other points that were spoken of by my Colleagues earlier. But, I would like to just say that the events, functions and activities of Parliament have been put on a sound footing during your tenure of office. I am confident that your successors, who are seated with you, would carry on the good work you had done and ensure that the activities in Parliament would improve with time, to realize the type of standards that existed in this House during the golden era when people of the calibre of the Hon. Dudley Senanayake, the Hon. (Dr.) N.M. Perera, the Hon. (Dr.) Colvin R. de Silva, the Hon. Pieter Keuneman, the Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and various other leaders were functioning, when it was really a fount of knowledge and information. I am hopeful that that era would dawn again in Sri Lanka

in the not too distant future. You have already helped to put us on the right track and I hope those efforts would continue.

So, let me thank you very much, Mr. Kitulgoda, for all that you had done and wish you a bright future, long life and all the best!

Thank you.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) The next speaker is the Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer. Please try to finish your speech within five minutes. [5.11 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees, let me initially quote two great authorities on Parliament in order to illustrate the greatness, the importance and the significance of the post of Secretary-General of Parliament.

On page 197 of the "Erskine Mays Treatise on The Law, Privileges, Proceedings and Usage of Parliament, it is stated, I quote:

Principal Permanent Officers of the Commons - Clerk of the House. We mean, the Secretary-General of Parliament. It is further stated, I quote:

The Clerk of the House is the chief permanent officer of the House of Commons. He is appointed by the Crown, ... Here, it is His Excellency the President.

...for life, ... But, you are appointed for a peried.

... by letters patent, in which he is styled Under Clerk of the Parliaments...to attend upon the Commons.

The Clerk has the custody of all records or other documents, and is responsible for the conduct of the business of the House in the offices within his department. He assists the Speaker and advises Members in regard to questions of order

and the proceedings of the House. He is the Corporate Officer of the House and holds the appointments of Accounting Officer for the House of Commons and Chairman of the Board of Management.

Then, Sir, let us take another example from our close neighbour, India. I quote from the book Practice and Procedure of Parliament written by M.N. Kaul and S.L. Shakdher and edited by G.C. Malhotra. It states, I quote:

The position of the Secretary-General of the Lok Sabha

It is equivalent to Parliament here.

is a most unusual one; one might almost say that it is unique.

This position of the Secretary-General is also unique.

He is expected to know everything that is to be known about everything that has any reference to the Lok Sabha and its business, whether it relates to some rather abstruse constitutional point or the proper precedence that should be followed

in certain given circumstances; whatever the problem, members expect immediate and authoritative advice from him. In fact, the efficient and proper working of the House depends largely on the Secretary-General. Then, again it states, I quote:

No two persons are more closely associated than the Speaker and the Secretary-General. A relationship of utmost confidence in each other exists between them. The Secretary-General may be very competent; he may also be in the midst of politics, yet by training he is not a politician. He, therefore, lacks something which is filled in by the Speaker.

So, Sir, it is a unique position that Mr. Dhammika Kitulgoda occupied and today we find him seated in his usual chair and we are very happy that he has entered the House once more. He is elegantly seated.

The period Mr. Dhammika Kitulgoda enjoyed most in his career was the 20 years he spent in the judiciary. I would go back to that. He became the youngest-ever Magistrate in Sri Lanka at 28 and rose up to be the Secretary of the Judicial Service Commission. I should record this in English because about 1,000 members of the Commonwealth Parliaments will be assembling here in September. He did the groundwork and they must know who he really is.

He was one judge who was able to bring down the workload in every station he worked. In certain stations, he saw to it that all the trial cases on the trial roll were disposed of before he was transferred out. He was able to dispose of the work mainly by effecting settlements by

119 120

2012 22

having a dialogue with the parties in the case. This way, heavily- contested civil cases like partitions and land cases which were 30 - 40 years old were concluded to the satisfaction of all parties concerned. Therefore, some Members of the Bar referred to him as the Samadana Vinishchakara. It is not the JP that we used to refer to. It really means, Samadana Vinishchakara one who metes out justice in the proper way.

When he came back to Parliament, there were many pending matters and fundamental rights cases in litigation with regard to the Parliament staff and he was able to intervene and settle them all.

Then, Sir, let me state what he has done for the benefit of the Parliament staff. A 30 per cent allowance was given to them and the Sitting Allowance was increased without any discrimination to the minor employees. Then, there were promotions for the minor grades and he established a category of Junior Clerks, enabling the minor staff to advance in their career. An unprecedented number of Parliament employees were given foreign exposure and even from the minor grades, people were sent on study tours. If not for Mr. Dhammika Kitulgoda, the Buddhist Society in Parliament would never have been a reality.

At this point, Sir, I should recall the services of Mr. Bandula Abeysekara who was a power of strength to the Secretary Genaral in this Service.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Hon. Member, please wind up now. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Let me continue, Sir, because I am taking the time of the Hon. (Ven.) Ellawala Medhananda Thero also. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) There are a lot of speakers from the Government side. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, this is the last chance. I am also a Member of the Chairmans Panel. Let me have another five minutes. ( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) No, I cannot give you more time.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) He supported multi-religious activities in Parliament such as Ifthar, Christmas Carols, Lakshmi Pooja and Saraswathi Pooja. During the time of Ifthar - breaking of fast - he was very helpful to all the Muslim Members of Parliament and the members of the staff.

The Anuradhapura Circuit Bungalow, which is going to be a reality within the next month or two was his brainchild. It is a pity that it could not be completed before his retirement. He was able to find the funding to give scholarships to the children of the Parliamentary staff allowing the Parliamentary Staff Union to generate an income by the sale of accumulated waste paper in Parliament. After he relinquished duties for the first time as the Secretary-General of Parliament and went to the Constitutional Council, the Parliamentary Staff Union saw it fit to name the Fund after him and they called it the Dhammika Kitulgoda Scholarship Fund.

He provided transport facilities for Muslims to attend the Mosque on Fridays. I thank him for that on behalf of all the Muslims in Parliament. The children of the staff of Parliament were given employment in the minor grades in Parliament. Sir, I would like to table* the rest of my speech to be included in the Hansard because this is very important and concerns the Secretary-General of Parliament.

But, before I conclude, I have a duty to welcome our present Secretary-General of Parliament, Mr. Waruna Bandara Dhammika Dasanayake, who is a gleaming and a lovable personality. Then, Sir, I would also like to welcome our Deputy Secretary-General Mr. Wijayasundara Mudiyanselage Neil Parakrama Iddawala. I must also welcome Mr. C. Kuruppu who became the Librarian of this Parliament during the time of Mr. Kitulgoda. He was very helpful to you and all of us. Then, there are also certain demands put forward by the others. I would only ask that those matters be attended to.

Sir, I do not know whether it is a coincidence or not; we must ask from their parents. Dhammika -- has a

Dhammika - - who is his beloved wife. He has two children, Ama and Uma. He attended Royal College. All of them form a lawyers quartet in their home! I would only like to give this advice to his children: imbibe the noble qualities and follow the footsteps of your dad and not be found wanting in your career.

Sir, you are a Tamil gentleman in the Chair. May I quote from "Thirukkural" and finish off to illustrate his sterling qualities.

That is, justice, observation, independence and independence in judgment. Mr. Dhammika Kitulgoda has done this by his deeds and he has brought pride to this House. We would ever remember him. I must also say that he is a great sportsman. His wife Dhammika - - and I sat through several matches at the R. Premadasa Stadium and I think both of them enjoyed my "off the mike" commentaries also. I wish you will enjoy your life together for a long time to come. Thank you.

* : * : *Rest of the speech tabled: There was a lady lawyer who was serving as a Clerk in Parliament. Mr. Kitulgoda saw her potential and sent her to appear for Parliament along with the State Counsel in many cases, such as expulsion cases where Parliament was a party. With this much-needed exposure in Court, he saw to it that she applied to join the Judiciary and she is now a Magistrate serving in an outstation. He was able to obtain more than one hundred mobile phones and cameras from the Chinese Embassy and these were gifted to the senior members of the minor grade. He never postponed a single judgment in his entire career in the Judiciary. Because of this, he was able to ensure that the Minutes of all the Committees where he served as Secretary were produced before the end of the day. The High Posts Committee, the Parliamentary Business Committee, the Staff Advisory Committee and even the Minutes of the Parliamentary Council were completed the same day before the House adjourned. He was always able to attend to all the files on his table before he left the office. Even when he was sick, he used to get down the files and attend to them at home. He had undergone angioplasty, heart procedure just before the conference of the Heads of State of SAARC in Colombo, but he was able to persuade his doctors and leave the hospital within two days to make the necessary arrangements to receive them in Parliament when they came to Parliament where they had their Conference Retreat. As the Secretary of the Judicial Services Commission, he organized an educational programme for Judges. He held many seminars and workshops around the country, judged mentor programmes where junior judges were assigned to seniors who acted as their mentors. This was his idea. These programmes were funded by the Asia Foundation and the USAID. He recognized the Presidents of the Labour Tribunal and persuaded the Judicial Service Commission to have them appointed as Additional Magistrates. He had a close relationship with the Carthys (Quazi) and always saw to their welfare. He likes to keep fit. He can be seen doing his morning walk everyday either at the Colts Ground or at the Wellawatte Beach. He was a sportsman in his youth having captained Law College in Rugger, Hockey and Table Tennis. He coached the first Rugby Team to be

produced in the Matara District during his days in the Bar in Matara. Even in Parliament, he arranged Table Tennis encounters with the Chinese Embassy and the Auditor-Generals Department and personally took part as a member of the Parliamentary Team. He is a great supporter of differently abled persons. He is a patron of the Idiriya Foundation which endeavours to make Sri Lanka a more friendly place for the differently abled. He along with his friend, Dr. Ajith Perera, conducted a survey in Parliament and had the necessary changes made in the building to make it compatible with the needs of differently abled people. He, in his career as a public servant, had the good fortune to be able to occupy two of the most famous houses in the country; Mumtaz Mahal in Colombo and the two hundred-year old ancient Majestic Bungalow in Ratnapura constructed in the early eighteen eighties by the famous Ehalepola Nilame. It is where the Nilame had housed his harem. Mr. Kitulgoda of course did not have a harem. He had only his beloved wife with him during his occupancy of this house. Today, he laments over the present condition of these two palatial and monumental buildings and hopes that they be rehabilitated and maintained as sites of national heritage. His Excellency the President has mentioned that when he first entered the Law College, Mr. Kitulgoda and the former Attorney-General Mr. C.R. De Silva were the rag masters, but that was a different era when even the victims used to enjoy being ragged. His Excellency had only been asked to give a repeat performance of his maiden speech in Parliament, the Vote of Thanks on the Throne Speech.

( ) (Mr. Deputy Chairman of Committees) Thank you. The next speaker is the Hon. Hon. Palitha Range Bandara.

[5.36 p.m.] ... ( ) ( . . . - ) (The Hon. A.H.M. Fowzie - Minister of Urban Affairs) Hon. Speaker, I am very happy that you took the Chair before I start my speech, which will be a very short speech. In fact there were so many Members of Parliament from both sides who appreciated the services rendered by Mr. Dhammika Kitulgoda. Therefore, I am also very much delighted to have this opportunity to speak a few words in appreciation of the service of Mr. Dhammika Kitulgoda, who retired from the position of Secretary-General of Parliament.

Prior to joining the Parliamentary Service, he had been in the distinguished service of the judiciary and had held the positions of Magistrate, District Judge as well as the prestigious position of the Secretary of the Judicial Service Commission.

Sir, Mr. Kitulgoda has been known in the legal circle for his efficiency to dispense justice expeditiously. When he joined the Parliamentary Service with such experience in the judicial service, counting nearly two decades, he was found to be the most capable person to fill the post of the Secretary-General of Parliament. During his tenure of office as the Secretary-General of Parliament, he also served as the Secretary of the Constitutional Council and later in the Parliamentary Council. His extraordinary quality of friendliness with his pleasing personality has made it clear and easy for him to win the confidence of the Members of Parliament representing diverse political parties.

His efficiency in discharging his responsibilities and the smooth administration of his staff made it possible for him to serve under the Speaker, to his satisfaction. He is indeed a legal luminary of the highest order. I would like to note with delight that he leads a successful family, comprising his wife and two daughters, all of whom are professional lawyers. I wish to say to him, Well done! Mr. Kitulgoda, you are a gentleman par excellence. I also wish him good health, continued happiness and long life.

I wish his successor, Mr. Dhammika Dasanayake, all the best to carry on the good work done by Mr. Dhammika Kitulgoda and also wish Mr. Neil Iddawala, the Deputy Secretary-General, all the best.

Thank you. [. . 5.39] ( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena - Minister of Agriculture) , . . . . .
