[4.28 p.m.] ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem.

Mr. Presiding Member, it is my privilege today to speak on the Regulations moved by the Minister of Environment under the Marine Pollution Prevention Act, which is very timely and important as far as our tiny island is concerned.

The Hon. (Ven.) Ellawala Medhananda Thero put it right when he said that this is a small island and we all must get together to protect it. The most important thing is to protect the environment. If we interfere with the environment and the nature, the nature will punish you, the environment will punish you. That is the divine order. Therefore, we are born in this world in order to sustain our environment and maintain our nature. What is now happening is quite contrary to that.

I was able, Sir, to attend a conference held on 26th October, 2010 at Nagoya, Aichi, Japan and I have here with me the "Natural Capital Action Plan" endorsed at the Nagoya Parliamentarians Forum. My very good Friend, the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa also participated in a parallel conference at Nagoya at the same time. There I was searching for the Hon. Minister and he was searching for me because we were having a common goal in order to protect the environment. Sir, at the end of the Forum, under the Marine Ecosystems Recovery Strategy, they passed a resolution that all Parliaments in the world must bring in regulations based on the policy proposals that were adopted. Then, under the heading, "Part 2: Policy Proposals for Tropical Coral Reef Ecosystems," of the Report, "A Marine Ecosystems Recovery Strategy", it states, I quote:

Tropical shallow-water coral reefs are critically threatened by the cumulative and synergistic effects of climate change and direct human impacts.

I further quote:

"The coral reef crisis is also a crisis of management. All but the most remote coral reefs have already been heavily impacted by direct human pressures.

That is the most important thing for us to pay our attention. It goes on:

"Overfishing, destructive fishing practices, coastal pollution and coastal development account for most of these impacts, which not only destroy and degrade coral reefs but also considerably reduce their resilience to the effects of climate change."

I stated at this Conference that we have one of the finest coral reefs in Hikkaduwa, down South, where thousands and now lakhs of tourists, visit. Again

641 642

[ ]

2012 06

I quote:

Increasing coral reef resilience by reducing direct human impacts will slow the rate of coral reef degradation caused by climate change, and, if CO2 levels peak at or below 450 ppm, could prevent eco system collapse.

We must be warned about this.

Then, Item 2, under the heading, "Marine Protected Areas Coverage and Effectiveness" states, I quote:

At least 30 % of the worlds coral reefs should be effectively managed in no-take marine protected areas (MPAs).

MPA designation and implementation: Well enforced protected areas can be very effective in reducing human impacts on coral reefs. A minimum of 30% protected area coverage for habitats is recommended to achieve ecosystem health. It is important to establish legislation mandating a target level of marine protected area coverage for coral reefs...

Item 3 of the Report refers to "Water quality policy". This takes a prime place in the protection of the environment. It is not only an individual effort by the Minister, my good Friend, the Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, but also the effort of the Deputy Minister, the Hon. A.R.M.Abdul Cader, who is always very worried about pollution of the environment, especially air pollution. He is doing a good job of work and helping the Minister in a large scale in order to protect the environment.

Under Water quality policy, it states:

Land-based water pollution policies must be complemented by strong marine water quality targets and monitoring.

That is exactly a part of the job the Hon. Dinesh Gunawardene is handling. It further states:

Legislators should pursue comprehensive legislation mandating a reduction of all major pollutants in coral reef waters to at least half of 2010 levels.

Today, we have to learn a lesson from Japan on how they protect the ecosystem, the biodiversity and the coral reefs.

Then, Sir, under "Coastal Zone Planning" it states:

Backed up by legislation to ensure the refusal, relocation or sufficient damage mitigation for all development projects identified by EIAs to have a negative impact on coral reefs.

The present Japanese Ambassador is also very keen in this respect. He has made certain suggestions and expressed sentiments sometime ago when he presented his credentials to the President. Emperor Hirohito and the present Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda have all been very much interested in this because they know how Hiroshima and Nagasaki had suffered those days. Still the people are affected by eating fish in the Pacific Ocean. That shows the extent of the calamity the Japanese people faced at that time.

Sir, I now quote from "Principles for Action" of the Report:

"IX. National governments should join and actively participate in all relevant international and regional fora for coral reefs, particularly the international Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) and the UNEP Regional Seas Programme.

X. Parliaments should ratify and adopt robust implementing legislation for all international and regional conventions and protocols...,

This is exactly what our Minister of Environment is endeavouring to do today. In fact, I have given notice of a Motion to include this in our Constitution and also in the Marine Policy. It further states:

... including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).

Now, Sir, there are certain Members in this House who always see the negative side of a positive development.

He advised the fishermen. This problem was brought out by the fishermens representatives when they met him there. Mr. Ashok K. Kantha, the amiable High Commissioner of India, was also present. Some of the Tamil Members of Parliament including the Hon. Selvam Adaikkalanathan were also present. After all, in order to avoid clashes, he said: Where there is fish, there will be fishermen. They cannot care for borders because they do not know. Where there is fish, they will run after the fish. Therefore, the fishermen both across the Palk Strait and Sri Lanka, can agree to fish at a certain period of time. You can ask the others to fish for one or two months and they will go to the waters during that period. By doing so, this could be settled.

What has happened in Kachchativu? Fishermen from both countries met. The Hon. Adaikkalanathan seems to be missing from the House now. Sir, that story is

published on the front page of Ceylon Today of 5th March, 2012 captioned Kachchativu feast concludes successfully reported by Lanka Paranamanna from Kachchativu. ( ) (The Presiding Member) You have one more minute, Hon. Azwer. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I will take the time allotted to the Hon. Hisbullah also. Please permit me to speak.

Sir, these are the things that will be told to the Wikipedia and I do not know what the other pedia is. The diaspora-interested people are spying on us and are hell-bent in order to dislodge the best batsman at the governing crease in the world, that is His Excellency President Mahinda Rajapaksa. They cannot dislodge his wicket that easily. He will live long because God has blessed him by giving gems in the land that he was born - Magampura, Hambantota. There are some pictures published on page 7 of the same newspaper, under the title Undying devotion. The Hon. Douglas Devananda, our Minister, went there. He sat with both the fishermen from India and Sri Lanka who came in boats.

Sir, in the past, there was a girl who was shown on TV saying, "we go there, make love and sometimes we get married". The Sri Lankan boys go to India; the Indian boys come to Sri Lanka. These types of things have happened in good environmental background. - [Interruption.] - That girl was relating it. I did not go to see that. The Hon. Minister of Environment or the Deputy Minister can go there because they have to protect the environment there also.

Then, what did the Hon. Douglas Devananda do? He spoke to the fishermen of both countries. What the Hon. Douglas Devananda, said is very significant. He said "all these days, we were partial and listening to our fishermen. Now, we have come to Kachchativu, the common place where both of us can meet, eat, celebrate, discuss and exchange friendly banters. Now, we have studied your problems. You have related all the problems to us. Therefore, now there is no problem; we both can tackle this on a common platform. That should be the way. Even the people from Kachchativu help us. Some people in India wanted to take Kachchativu away. They are threatening the Government of India but that will never happen. That is what I always say." I know my Friends from the TNA - formerly they were a federal party- from the time of Thanthai S.J.V. Chelvanayakam. I have been associated with the leaders of that party, the late Hon. A. Amirthalingam, the Hon. Chelliah Rajathurai and a whole lot of them. Sir, they have lived enough; we have lived enough in this world, in our

645 646

beautiful island. Our generation has got to live. What are we going to do? Are we to go to the diaspora and all the international fora with a begging bowl ? What can the diaspora do? You could see the result at Geneva. They themselves have understood. All the Muslim countries and the African countries have pledged support for us. Now, they have come to the stage asking us to speed up the implementation of recommendations of the LLRC. That is what exactly the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime is trying to do. Therefore, it is a futile attempt on the part of those Sri Lankans.

After all, a Tamil who is born in this country is a Sri Lankan. You maybe a Tamil or a Sinhalese. I am a Muslim. But, when we die, Sir, our bodies are not taken to Rameswaram, to Delhi, or any other place in Hindu Kush or the Himalayan border.

They are buried here. When we die, we are buried here. Our bodies are not taken to Riyadh, Jeddah, Kuala Lampur or Karachi. Normally, Sir, if we are in Colombo, we will be buried in Maligawatte, Kuppiyawatte or Jawatte. These are the three wattes in Colombo, that we will seek refuge at last in this life.

I reiterate that I am very sorry about the Hon. Sampanthan. - [Interruption.] You are going to take him to Norway. But, he finds no way. Let him find a way. Please ask him, teach him, and show him where to find a way. What is the use? His grandchildren - I know them and wish them well - are in London, they are doctors. They are still there studying. You know that even Somawansas children are studying in the UK. Prabhakarans children were studying abroad. Now, this is why they say they do not want development.

. , ? ? . ! . . ! ?

Dr. Priyath B. Wickrama is the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. ( ) (The Presiding Member) Hon. Member, you have taken five minutes from the Hon. Minister's time. ... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, he gave me 12 minutes. The Hon. Hisbullah had given me his time. I will take another two or three

minutes and wind up. So, Sir, Dr. Priyath B. Wickrama is in charge of the Ports Authority. A dedicated officer, any clever person - be it a Secretary, a Director or a Chairman of a corporation - will leave no stone unturned without attacking them in this House. These Government officials cannot come here and reply. Now, read the Magazine called "TARGET" of September, 2010. I quote:

The Ceremonial Intake of Seawater into the Hambantota Harbour"

The Hambantota Harbour is being built; the Oluvil Harbour is being built. So many other harbours have been built. The Mattala Airport is coming up. These are developments in the modern age. What do they want us to do? Get into the tar barrel and die? Let them do that. That is why I speak in that tone to my very good Friend of the TNA. Now, they have understood. They are also now divided. Their party is divided into two or three groups. There is the Sampanthan group; the Mavai S. Senathirajah group and the Adaikkalanathan group. All these groups are fighting: "Why did we not go to Geneva? We should go". "No, we should wait here and carefully monitor the events". Okay, very good! You monitor them and live as Sri Lankans. Let your people enjoy life in our country in the future as well. They have a sure future.

When we go abroad, we come across people who ran away during the Black July in 1983. We went to the various cities in America. What do they say?

" . , . . , . . ! !"

Do you know, Sir, actually what is happening? Every Tamil and Muslim or anybody living in UK or in the so- called super power, the United States of America - America is doing all the villainous things. They want to control the whole world. Are we going to fall prey for that? No. We are a self-respecting nation. We have in our country enough rice, enough yams, enough herali, enough We are self sufficient in rice. Therefore Sir, nobody can make us cow down to their dictates.

So, Sir, I was just talking about this harbour. I again quote the magazine "TARGET":

"As Sri Lanka forges ahead to become the Wonder of Asia, one of the five hubs that are being developed is the naval and maritime centre. Hambantota Harbour is a pillar stone towards achieving this goal. "

647 648

His Excellency Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Chairman Dr. Priyath B. Wickrama and our Speaker, the Hon. Chamal Rajapaksa, the Hon. Basil Rajapaksa and the Hon. Namal Rajapaksa are all there.

Therefore, Sir, all these things add to our future prosperity of the country. That is what I am trying to say. We never neglected development, Sir, during the time of the war also - this is a very significant factor that the Western countries have taken note of. When the war was going on in the Eastern Province, 54 bridges were built over there. After that, it is still continuing. That is development. Those have been built when the war was going on. That is a great achievement. That is why we call our country, in the 21st Century. We will go on and on flourishing.

When we speak of gems, there was an article recently in the "Daily News", edited by the veteran journalist, Latheef Farook, on the land of gems - I do not want to read it for want of time - "Spain - Land of Gems". ( ) (The Presiding Member) You have taken ten minutes from the Hon. Minister's time.

... ( ... ) (The Hon. Alhaj A.H.M. Azwer) Sir, I say Sri Lankas Land of Gems today is Magampuraya in the deep South.

Thank you very much.
