( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, I rise to a point of Order.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) What is the point of Order?

( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Sir, the Hon. Anura Dissanayake has not finished his speech. While he was continuing with his speech, he was asked to sit down. That is very unfair; he must have his time. Not only that, his speech was not irrelevant; he was speaking sense. Therefore, I strongly urge that he should be given the opportunity to continue. Otherwise, there is no democracy in this House.

( ) (Hon. Members) No, no.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The Presiding Member has given an Order under Standing Order No. 73. Since it cannot be reversed, let the Hon. Arundika Fernando continue with his speech. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. John Amaratunga) Why can you not give him another five minutes? Otherwise there is no - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, it is not possible to canvass against an Order given by the Chair. But, of course you can take it up with the Hon. Speaker at the Party Leaders Meeting.
