manner are often subjected to various kinds of torture?

(b) Will he state -

(ii) whether necessary steps will be taken to

provide, only those who have been registered with an institution thus established with the jobs mentioned in a (i) above, in a proper manner?

.... (

) ( .... - , ) (The Hon. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah - Deputy Minister of Child

Development and Womens Affairs)

Hon. Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the Minister of Child Development and Women's Affairs, I answer Question No. 2.

(a) (i) Yes.

(ii) Yes. It is illegal in any form to engage

children in employment. However, women have the right to engage in employment based on their interest and the contract of employment they are entering with the employer.

(b) (i) When children under 14 years of age are employed and whether they are abused, injured or violence has taken place, legal actions are taken as a punishment for the employment of children. Immediate actions are being taken for the complaints received on violence against women workers. Establishment of a specific registering mechanism for women, who are expecting employment is an issue related to labour relations and therefore kind attention of the Minister of Labour and Labour Relations is required.

(ii) Information could be taken from the Minister of Labour and Labour Relations in this regard.

(c) No.

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) [ , , , , . . . In 2000, we wanted all those institutions to be free - the Judiciary, the Public Service, the Elections Commissioner and the Attorney-Generals Department. Why did you reverse it? ? , . . . . ? . We have handed over the judicial power of the people to the Executive. . [ . , . ; ; .

, . . . ? , ? . , . [ ] . t - [ ]

.. t ( .. ) (The Hon. A.D. Susil Premajayantha) ?

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) , . . , . . [ ] . headline . . t . . . [ . ; t . . [ ] Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, you are an expert on International Law. Have you heard of the Latimer Communiqu? , . .

We are a member of the Commonwealth and the Latimer Declaration is there. We are a member of the Commonwealth and all Commonwealth countries have approved the Latimer Declaration. You know it very well. One fact is very clear in that Declaration. The article on The Implementation of Latimer House Principles states, I quote:

The first is that the executive has no part to play in such a commission or in judicial appointments,.

So, if we are members of the Commonwealth, we have to accept the Latimer Principles. It clearly states that the Executive has no part to play in judicial appointments. Do you accept that?

We are hosting the Commonwealth Heads of Governments' meeting next year. But, we have violated the Commonwealth values by bringing in the Eighteenth Amendment. Then, it is our duty to provide the security for the judges to dispense justice. The Secretary of the Judicial Service Commission is a person involved with the dispensation of justice.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) He is a Public Servant. He was given protection -

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) So, how can you reconcile this position with the Commonwealth values and the Latimer House Principles? The Executive should not get involved. In developed countries, judges are always recommended by a Judicial Service Commission comprising judges. Of course, in certain instances, the President or the Prime Minister has the right of veto. He could veto certain appointments.

( ) (The Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara) We do not veto. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Even in India, all the appointments are made by a committee of judges. Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, you are a Professor of Law and I am sorry to say that when you had the opportunity to speak against the Eighteenth Amendment that conferred all the powers of appointing judges to the Executive, you did not do so. So, I think we must change this. We must change this for the future generations. You will be in the Opposition some day. I am not for a moment saying that judges are Gods. It is up to the judges, the lawyers and the Members of Parliament to maintain the balance. But, now the balance has been upset because the Executive has all the powers.

987 988

So, judges are scared. They must be given the favourable surroundings; they must be given the space to operate independently.

You know Mr. Gomin Dayasiri. Hon. Minister, you know him very well. He is an SLFP stalwart and the son of Mr. N.Q. Dias who played an important role in 1956. This is what Mr. Gomin Dayasiri says about you and the present crisis. In the "Sunday Island" dated 14th October, 2012, he states, I quote:

Scales of Justice are not squeaky clean. Judges have at times accepted many juicy bones thrown in their direction by the executive. -

.

Mr. Gomin Dayasiri . T t .

It further states, I quote,

Why does the Executive make such offers? -

? I further quote:

"but with a view to obtain access to future benefits? - . It further states, I quote:

If benefits are offered, they must be uniformly offered to the

whole judiciary. Otherwise it conflicts with the rules of equality and the discrimination that results bring both the executive and the judiciary to disrepute.

. . .

I further quote:

The Executive must be proper in exercising the rules of equal treatment and if individuals in the judiciary are picked for favored treatment, it is unacceptable. How many of the favoured declined such tempting offers?

- , t ? t . It further states, I quote:

In the past they did, and the judiciary was venerated.

.

Then, he further goes on to state, I quote: "Immediately on retirement, political appointments such as ambassadors........." .

"...and presidential advisers..."

.

"Children and spouses of judges have gleefully accepted bounties and enjoyed them. Matters turn sour if the offered bounties are lost,...."

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Member, you have only one minute left. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) Okay, Sir.

So, who created this? The law created this. The Executive created the situation, where he has all the powers, by bringing the Eighteenth Amendment. Then, you started offering goodies and now there is an imbalance. So, that is the problem. I am not for a moment saying that judges are superior to Parliament. We have the powers; let us restore those. With the Seventeenth Amendment, there was a balance between the Executive, the Judiciary and the Legislature. Now, that balance has been completely wiped out.

You talked about "".

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Please wind up, Hon. Member. ( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) ? .

() ( ( ) ) (The Hon. (Dr.) Jayalath Jayawardana) ?

( ) (The Hon. Lakshman Kiriella) ? . t ? . . . .

That is why our Leader, the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, suggested a Committee of Supreme Court Judges, maybe of senior Parliamentarians, judges from the SAARC countries and judges from a European country, where the standards are very high, be appointed. Let us appoint a Committee and frame laws to restore the balance within the Judiciary, the Executive and Parliament. Thank you.

[6.50 p.m.]

( ) ( - ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem - Minister of Justice) Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem. Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. We have had a very detailed discussion on the Adjournment Motion that was moved by the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake.

I must say that I was one of those people who visited Mr. Manjula Tillekeratne as soon as he was reported to have been attacked. That happened because His Excellency the President called me personally. He seemed very disturbed and wanted me to immediately visit and report about what had happened to him, which I did very dutifully. I could, very confidently, say that we have, since then, taken all necessary steps to properly investigate this matter and bring the culprits to book and my Colleague, the Hon. Vasudeva Nanayakkara, read out the situation report from the police regarding this.

Having said that, I must now deal with this issue of the Secretary to the JSC having issued a statement and certain implications arising out of that statement. Mr. Deputy Speaker, indeed there is a clear implication in that statement that the Executive was trying to influence the Judiciary. Asking the JSC to come for a meeting is a routine matter and certainly should not be construed as influencing the Judiciary and releasing that letter to the press was, in the least, unprecedented and that indeed was a serious breach of convention. The releasing of that statement undermines the confidence of the public in the Judiciary, I dare say that.

In that regard, I must also reply to the Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake. He came out with this statement and referred to a particular statement which had been released way back in 1999 by the then Acting Secretary of the JSC and I examined that document.

t . . t . t . . t . . . . . Mr. Deputy Speaker, I have very limited time. The JSC is vested with the power of appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of Lower Court Judges

. 2011 31 The Sunday Times article , U N H C R - . , . , .

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) . Thank you very much Hon. Member. Hon. Rauff Hakeem, you may speak.

is derived from common law, a construction where judges established this principle. Therefore, some argue that circumstances could arise where courts may qualify a principle established on the different hypothesis of constitutionalism.

Therefore, Mr. Deputy Speaker, - . ( . ) (The Hon. Ajith P. Perera) Sir, I rise to a point of Order. ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) No, I am not giving way. ( ) (The Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena) Do not give way. - [Interruption.] ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) I am not giving way because I have limited time, Mr. Deputy Speaker - [Interruption.]

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) Hon. Minister, you continue. [Interruption.] - ( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) Therefore, it is important for us to realize that the whole nation looks to its judges to manifest sturdy independence and determination to abide by the law in the Constitution and the exclusion of every other influence. The crisis of confidence regarding the country's judicial system is something regarding which we must pay attention. We must not look at the symptoms of the disease and should not mistake the disease for the symptoms. So, let us examine the causes dispassionately and adopt a bipartisan approach to restore the confidence in the Judiciary and correct whatever anomalies that have existed in the past. The functioning of the JSC lack transparency and accountability in the past and the dismissal and disciplinary control of Lower Court Judges, thus leading to adverse comments by international tribunals as well. Therefore, it is the duty of all concerned to see that we take a bipartisan approach and resist and desist from taking any emotional, sentimental attitude.

and this is contained in Article 114(1) and (6) of the Constitution. But, then the Constitution is silent however about how the JSC's powers are to be exercised or the procedure to be used when imposing penalties. To my understanding, the JSC has neither promulgated rules on these matters. Therefore, it is important for us to also realize that there is a fundamental error in the assumption that the JSC is a judicial body. For all purposes, the JSC is an administrative body which is subject to judicial review. There had been several instances where, as a matter of fact, several cases had been filed in the past against the Judicial Service Commission and that reveals the fact that it is purely an administrative body.

We must also understand that His Excellency the President, if at all, did not call for the Supreme Court - though I do not see anything fundamentally wrong in doing so - but yet the Head of the Judiciary may well then refuse for good reasons to attend such a meeting though the fall-out from such a rebuff to the appointing authority could still lead ultimately to other complications which would undermine and pervade the Government machinery, ultimately resulting in a policy paralysis.

This is what the Opposition is aiming at. They want to ultimately allow this whole fiasco to develop to such a situation where this whole conflict will be perceived by Government officials to a level where they will also not be taking decisions for fear of implications arising out of it. This must be avoided at all cost. This is the responsibility of both the Opposition and the Government. So, we must take a bipartisan approach to try and defuse this situation and take a very responsible attitude in this case.

In the past, there was criticism that the manner in which the JSC proceedings were conducted raised due process concerns. According to many former Lower Court Judges who had faced proceedings in the Judicial Service Commission, Judges have not on many occasions been informed of the evidence against them or the ultimate disposition of charges.

It has been reported and repeated complaints have been heard that the JSC instead adapted to short circuit the inquiries by suggesting to resign rather than being dismissed. This, I do not say happened during the current tenure of the JSC, but it had happened in the past. Because formal dismissal makes it difficult for the judges to return to private practice, many resigned rather than face charges.

Therefore, we must understand that for all purposes the Diceyan Concept of Supremacy of Parliament, pure and absolute, remains the cornerstone of a Constitution. It

It being 7.00 p.m., MR. DEPUTY SPEAKER adjourned Parliament without Question put.

Adjourned accordingly until 1.00 p.m. on Tuesday, 06th November, 2012, pursuant to the Resolution of Parliament of this Day.

( ) (The Deputy Speaker) The Hon. Minister is left with only a few minutes. There is no necessity to raise a point of Order at this moment. No points of Order will be allowed in the last few minutes. Do not try to disturb the proceedings.

( ) (The Hon. Rauff Hakeem) We must act with responsibility and maximum restraint whatever the provocations to uphold and preserve the Supremacy of Parliament and safeguard the independence of the Judiciary.

Thank you.
